The standard was first issued in 1982 and was reaffirmed in 1995. The objective of this standard is to rationalize the material constants for different items of building works by providing uniform values that can be used across various departments. The material constants have been arrived at by the Central Building Research Institute after conducting laboratory and field studies using materials that conform to relevant Indian Standards.\n\nThe standard specifies that the cubic contents shall be worked out to the nearest 0.01 m3. It also provides rules for rounding off numerical values. The bills of quantities in building works, as per IS 1200 (Part 17), shall fully describe the materials and workmanship and accurately represent the work to be executed. The finished thickness of sub-base, base, and bituminous courses is to be computed as specified in 2.5.1 of IS 1200 (Part 17).\n\nIn summary, IS 10067 provides standard material constants for various items of building works to ensure uniformity and consistency in the calculation of quantities and costs across different departments. The standards are based on laboratory and field studies using materials that comply with relevant Indian Standards."}

This method involves passing the sample gas through a catalyst to react H2S with hydrogen, producing sulfur and water. The sulfur produced is then weighed to determine the H2S content.\n\nThis standard specifies the requirements for apparatus, reagents, calibration gases, and operating conditions to ensure accurate and precise determination of H2S content using this method. It also provides guidance on the sampling, preparation, and handling of the samples to ensure representative and accurate results.\n\nIt is important to note that this standard does not cover other methods for determination of H2S content in natural gas and liquids, such as the titration method or the colorimetric method."}
