FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 18 May 1967, after the draft finalized by the Metal Standards Sectional
Committee
had been appr-ved
by the Structural
and
Metals
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Indian Standards Institution took up the steel economy project at
the request of Government of India in 1950 in order to conserve steel which
was in short supply.
A technical committee was set up to undertake this
work under which a number of subcommittees and panels initiated work on
specific subjects.
The
technical
committee
after
detailed
deliberations
formulated an Indian Standard code of practice for the use of cold-formed
light gauge steel structural
members
in general
building
construction
( IS  :  801-1958 ), and also an Indian Standard specification for cold-formed
light gauge structural steel sections ( IS  :  81 l-1961*)
was formulated subse-
quently.
The use of cold-formed light gauge structural steel sections leads
to considerable savings in steels on an average  up  to 40 percent.
The only
drawback
for extensive use of light gauge steel structures relates to the thin-
ness of members and corrosion particularly in a large country with varying
climatic conditions like India.
As early as in 1957 a separate panel was set
up with a view to conducting
necessary research and formulate suitable
recommendations
for protection of Iight gauge steel sections.
The panel
was entrusted with the work of developing accelerated tests to determine the
quality of protective scheme and also to prepare a corrosion map of this
country on the basis of corrosion potential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
With the active assistance of the following laboratories,
a short-
term corrosion test was conducted in different parts of India:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Central Electrochemical
Research Institute, Karaikudi<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Defence Research Laboratory
( Materials  ) ,  Kanpur<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>National Metallurgical
Laboratory, Jamshedpur<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>National Test House, Calcutta<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1.1
A long-term project on the same subject has been taken  up by
the Council  of Scientific and Industrial Research ( CSIR ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.2  In the formulation
of this standards
assistance
has been
derived
from
SIS
135111  ‘  European
scale of degree
of rusting
for
anticorrosive
paints  ’  issued by the Sveriges
Standardiseringskommission
( Sweden).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Assistance
was
also
received
from
the
Indian
Railways
and
Messrs
E.R.
Joseph
& Co, Calcutta.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
Based
on the data collected
for a period of about two years, this code
on corrosion
protection
of light gauge steel sections
for structures
has been
prepared.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 As degree of protection
needed for any particular
component
is related
to the conditions
of exposure
and the class of steelwork,
three different pro-
tective schemes have been described
in 3 and 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 The
protective
schemes
recommended,
if suitably
maintained
by re-
application
of paint are intended
to ensure a life of 60 years or more for the
light gauge structural
members
of permanent
buildings where the permissible
working stress is far more dependent
on adequate
protection
against
rusting
than
is the case for heavier
sections.
The
schemes
may also be usefully
applied
to structures
designed
for a shorter
life where
it
is desirable
to
ensure a high recovery
value for the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6
In the case of aluminium
coating,
a thickness of 0.1 778 f 0.0 254 mm has
been specified in this standard
based on the exposure
tests conducted
and
taking into consideration
the lack of facilities
for controlling
the thicknesses
of aluminium
coatings.
The
Sectional
Committee
is aware that in many
countries
this thickness
has been specified
between 0.0 762 to 0.1 524 mm.
After the proposed
long range
exposure
tests, the thickness
now specified
will be reviewed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  The recommendations
given in this code apply to light gauge compo_
nents for general building
purposes fabricated
from mild steel sheet or strip as
specified in IS  :  1079-1963*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The recommendations
refer to mild steel reduced
by cold rolling
and
having
thickness
varying
between
2 to 3.2 mm.
They
are not intended
to
heavy structural
steel work.
The
recommendations
also
apply
to steel
tubes used for construction
purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  All such steel parts should
receive,
before
they leave the fabricating
works, an adequate
protective
treatment,
for example,
application
of bitumen
paint or a paint primer.
The selection of the treatment
would depend on the
atmospheric
conditions
prevailing
at the site of fabrication,
transport
and
erection.
It would also depend on the interval
between
the fabrication
and
erection
and the type of the subsequent
paint coat to be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Steps should
be taken at all stages in storage,
transit
and erection
to
avoid damage
to the protective
coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Resistance
to abrasion
and
mechanical
damage
have
an important
bearing
on the choice of protective
schemes for steel parts used in building.
Damaged
areas should be adequately
repaired
on site, preferably
after erec-
tion if they are accessible.
When
adequate
precautions
cannot
be taken to
prevent damage,
protective
schemes should be selected so that local damage
will not lead to general
failure of the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 The
best procedure
is to apply
the protective
scheme
to the timshed
part, that is, after drilling,
bending
and welding
processes have ueen com-
pleted.
Overlapping
surfaces occurring
at riveted .joints are best protected
before they are assembled
and the joint
is sealed.
The size and
shape
of
the part will have a bearing
on the method
of protection
selected.
Special
care
is necessary
when
applying
certain
chemical
processes
to parts
of
intricate
shape
to avoid
entrapping
processing
solutions
in the
crevices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Whatever
protective
scheme
is used,
the surface
should
be dry and
clean,
that is, free from dirt, grease,
loose or heavy scale, or rust, before
applymg
the
protective
coating.
When
preparing
welded
assemblies
for painting,
care should be taken that the area at or near welds is thoroughly
cleaned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of aluminium
coating,
a thickness of O-1 778 f
O-0 254 mm
has been specified in this standard
based
on the exposure
tests conducted
and taking into consideration
the lack of facilities
for controlling
the thick-
nesses of aluminium
coatings.
The
Committee
is aware
that in many
countries
this thickness
has been specified between
0.0 762 to 0.1 524 mm.
It is expected
that as a result of the long range
exposure
tests, the thick-
ness now specified will be reviewed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.1
Detailed
recommendations
for
the
preparation
of surfaces
for
painting
are given in 4.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6
It is essential to envisage each protective
scheme as a whole.
All treat-
ments,
from those given at the fabricators’
works to the final pmtective
or
decorative
finish applied
to the parts after
installation
or erection,
should
form part of a co-ordinated
scheme.
For example,
if a final coat of air-
drying paint is to be applied after erection
to parts which have been stove-
painted at  the works, careful consideration
should be given to the selection<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The durability
of light gauge steelwork
exposed to severe conditions
of
service can only be ensured by maintaining
the protective
coating.
Regular
maintenance
by painting
is, therefore,
an
essential
requirement
of the
recommendation
for this class of steelwork.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4. PAINT
SYSTEM<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The protection
given by painting
depends not only on the composition
and quality
of paints used, but also on the method
of
application
and
specially on the method of surface preparation.
In general,
the effectiveness
of a painting
scheme
is increased
when it is applied
over a metal coating.
Painting
of metal
coatings
is advantageous
because it provides
marked
resistance
to mechanical
damage to shop coats broken during transit, storage
and erection
until
the final coats of paints
are applied.
In addition
the
life of painting
scheme
over a metal coating
is expected
to be longer than
that over bare steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
Correct
surface preparation
is essential
for success with any protective
scheme.
Most metal coatings
will not adhere to steel at all unless the mill-
scale is entirely
removed.
Paint should never be applied to dirty or greasy
surface.
Where
paint is to be applied
to bare steel that has rust or carries
objectionable
scales, a satisfactory
surface for painting
may be obtained
by
mechanical
methods such as grit or shot blasting
or by pickling.
Particular
care is necessary
to adjust
the operating
conditions
properly
when blasting
heavily
rusted steel.
Otherwise,
the abrasive
may drive the rust into the
pits instead of removing
it from them.
Moreover,
it
is always
essential
to dust down the surface after blasting
by brushing
or vacuum-cleaning,
or
with an air blast.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1
The
paint
may
be applied
directly
without
special
surface
pre-
treatment
to metal spray coatings.
Where
good adhesion
is to be obtained
metallic
coatings
require
degreasing
followed
by surface
pre-treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3
Total
thickness
of the dry paint film is an important
factor
and it is
vital that this should
be adequate
for the purpose
in hand.
Where
cir-
cumstances
permit,
full use should
be made

The thickness
of a single coat is affected
by the type of

But so far as practicable
this should
be not less than 44-54 g/m2 for primer grade and 54-68 g/ma for each coat of
finished paint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

are based on the results reported
from the outdoor
exposure tests
carried
out at various centres in India and also on considerable
experience
of
the
protective

and many
other countries,
gained
both by research
and by observations
of their behaviour
in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1
In decreasing
order of severity the types of outdoor exposures may
be broadly
classified as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Industrial and heavily polluted urban atmospheres -
Conditions
adjacent
to or within factories
of the heavy engineering
or chemical
indus-
tries
or buildings
in central
areas

towns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Marine
atmospheres-The
severity
of exposure
in a marine
at-
mosphere
may
vary
considerably.
When
steel is subjected
to
actual
wetting by the sea or continuous
salt spray as in sea-board
conditions
for both the rate of corrosion
is high;
conditions
inland
in non-industrial
districts within a few miles of the coast, although
still classified as marine,
may be relatively
mild,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Urban atmospheres -
Conditions

<<HEADING level=3>>6. DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  When designing buildings,
attention
should be given to avoiding features
conducive
to corrosion
since the protective
schemes
that have been recom-
mended
may prove inadequate
if associated
with poor design, either of the
component
itself or of the structure
as a whole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
Buildings should be designed
to avoid internal
condensation,
which
might occur in roof spaces and wall cavities if thermal conditions
and ventila-
tion were
not carefully
controlled.
The
presence
of moisture,
which
is
frequently
contaminated
by dissolved impurities
from the atmosphere,
is a
major threat to the durability
of iight gauge steelwork.
Wherever
possible,
use should be made of overhangs,
weatherings
and flashings made of durable
materials
to protect
the exposed
steelwork
from the weather.
Adequate
facilities for draining rainwater
from the steelwork should always be provided.
Ledges,
ridges,
crevices
and protuberances,
such as nuts, bolts and rivet
heads, should be avoided so far as possible, or designed to prevent retention<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

water. Precautions should be taken to render joint and cover strips water-
tight by careful sealing.
Ingress of moisture from roofing, outside walls,
cladding and windows should be prevented.
The design of building should,
where practicable,
admit of easy access to the metal surfaces for repainting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2
Certain other factors depending on the location of steelwork should
also be borne in mind by the designer since they will have to be taken into
account when selecting the protective scheme.
For example, light gauge
steel, such as metal trim that is in contact withbuilding materials containing
chlorides or sulphates, may be exposed to exceptional corrosion risks under
damp conditions.
In the presence of moisture, gypsum plaster will attack
bare steel, and alkaline materials, such as lime mortar and certain cements,
will corrode metallic coatings of lead, zinc and alumin;um besides being
injurious to oil paints.
Where such contacts are unavoidable, the application
of a thick coat of bituminous paint or mastic asphalt will provide adequate
protection for most practical purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
