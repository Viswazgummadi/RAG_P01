<<PARAGRAPH>>Geosynthetics
Sectional Committee,
WRD 25<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by
the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft
finalized
by the
Geosynthetics
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Water
Resources
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Geotextiles
which are being increasingly
used in the geotechnical
sector of civil engineering
are made either of
petro-chemical
derivatives
(synthetic)
or of natural
fibres. Jute is one such
natural
fibre out of which jute
Geotextiles
(JGT) can be made
by the special
treatment
and weaving
processes.
JGT may be
applied
with
advantage
in addressing
a number
of geotechnical
problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Jute geotextile
being a natural fabric is biodegradable
and environment-friendly.
It has good hydroscopic
and
hydrophilic
properties.
It can tibsorb moisture
up to about 5 times its dry weight and form mulch to promote
a
quick
growth
of vegetation.
JGT possesses
good drawability
that is it can shape
itself
well to the ground
topography
on which it is laid. It helps control extremes of temperature
and thus additionally
supports growth of
vegetation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These properties
make JGT admirably
suitable in areas where natural treatment
of a soil surface for control of
erosion
is called for. Adequate
growth of vegetation
is possible during the life time of JGT
provided
the right
type of species of vegetation
is chosen and planted considering
the soil and climatic
ambience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Erosion of railway and road embankments
and hill slopes is caused principally
by rains and winds. Erosion of the
top soil gradually
destabilises
the earthen embankments.
Denuded
hill slopes are always vulnerable
to erosive
forces of rains particularly
during the monsoon.
JGT when applied on an exposed
soil surface acts as miniature
check dams or micro terraces, reduces the kinetic energy of rain splashes, diminishes
the intensity of surface run-
off, prevents
detachment
and migration
of soil particles and ultimately
helps in quick growth of vegetation
on it
by formation
of mulch. JGT therefore
helps in controlling
erosion
in road and railway
embankments
and hill
slopes naturally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There
is no 1S0
Standard
on the subject.
This standard
has been prepared
based
on the data provided
by
indigenous
manufacturers’
and taking
into consideration
the practices
prevalent
in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the Committee
responsible
for formulating
this standard
is given in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
1S 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (revised)’.
The number of significant
places retained in the
rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of a particular
type of JGT. No systematic
researc,h has
been conducted on this aspect as yet. It is recommended
that the choice
of JGT should
be limited
to Type 1
(Table
1) where
the intensity
of rainfall
is severe
irrespective
of
the soil-type.
Field
trials
so far
conducted
have shown that soil mixed
with rock grits
and boulder-pieces
covered with JGT Type I of Table 1
(730 gsm), soil with dominantly
sand silt composition
and small quantities of clay and/or stone grits protected
by JGT Type 2 of Table
1 (500 gsm) while soil with
sand and/or clay
overlain
by JGT Type 3 of Table 1
(292 gsm) have given satisfactory
results. The
types
of JGT mentioned
in Table 1 are indicative and provide
broad guidelines
to the choice
of the JGT type by a
user. Annex B contains the list of some of the trials and
their results for guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1
Mechanism
of Surface Soil Erosion
As already indicated
in the foreword,
raindrops
cause
detachment
of the particles of the exposed soil-surface
of road and railway embankments
and hill slopes by
their impact
and
the
detached
particles
are carried
away by the surface run-off and wind.
The dislodged
particles
carry with them seeds
and
soil-nutrients.
Natural
growth
of vegetation
on the slopes
is thus
hindered.
The
exposed
denuded
slopes
become
increasingly
vulnerable
to
erosion
agents
and are
ultimately
destabilised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Role of Jute Geotextile in Surface Erosion Control<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As  already indicated in the foreword, JGT is capable of
reducing
the
erosive
effects
of
rain
drops
and
controlling
migration
of soil particles
of the exposed
surface.
On biodegradation,
JGT
forms mulch
and
fosters quick vegetative
growth.
Choice of the right
type of JGT and plant species
is critical for effective
results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 INSTALLATION
iMETHOD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  The stages
of laying
of JGT on slopes
for rain
water
erosion control are as under.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1
The slope should be made free from undulations,
soil slurry, mud and sharp projections
and
compacted
with
additional
earth where necessary.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table
1 mentions
different
types of JGT
with their
salient properties
that can be applied on embankment
slopes of
roads,
railways
and of hill to control
the
erosive effects of natural agents that is rains and wind.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
Anchoring
trenches
should be excavated
at the
top and
toe of
the
slope
along
the length
of the
embankment.
Recommended
dimensions
of the trench
(usually
rectangular)
are 450
mm
deep and 300 mm
wide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Species
of vegetation
needs to be selected
carefully
considering
the local soil and climatic conditions.
JGT
incidently,
does not draw
upon
nitrogenous
reserves
with its degradation
and its fibrous
residue
improves
~he soil structure.
Trials
indicate that JGT has a low C-
factor (0.004 for 3:1 slope and 0.005 for a 1.5:1
slope
on plying retention of soil to the extent
of 99.6 percent
and 99.5 percent
respectively).
(Ref
‘Erosion Control
with Natural Geotextiles’ — K. Balan and G. V. Rao —
‘Environmental
Geotechnology
with Geosynthetics
1996’.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3
The selected JGT should be unrolled across the
top
trench and
along the slope downward,
caring to
see that it touches
the soil surface at all points.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4
Overlaps
should be minimum
150 mm at sides
and ends
(see Fig. 1). The JGT at the higher level on
the slope should be placed over the portion to its next
at a lower level. Side overlaps of a JGT piece should be
placed over its next at a lower level. Side
overlaps of
JGT piece should be placed over its next piece on one
side and under the next piece on the other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Selection of JGT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The choice
of JGT basically
depends
on the type of
soil to be protected.
It requires to be ensured primarily
that the slope to be protected
from rain water erosion is
geotechnically
stable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The selection
of JGT is also required

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5
The JGT should
be fixed in position
by steel
staples as shown
in the sketch
(usually
of 11 gauge
dia) or by split bamboo
pegs.
Stapling should be done
normally at an interval of 1500 mm both in longitudinal
and transverse
directions.
Special care should be taken
to staple the JGT within the anchoring
trenches both at
the bottom
and at the sides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2
The treated area should be kept out of bounds for
cattle and other grazing animals till the time of maturit y
of vegetation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 The damage
and displacement
of JGT should be
noted for corrective
actions.
Tom portions of the JGT
should be covered with new pieces of JGT of identical
specifications
duly stapled at all sides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.6
The anchoring
trenches should be filled up with
brick-bats/soil
for preventing displacement
of the JGT.
Care should be taken that the overlaps are not displaced
during installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 Watering/maintenance
of the vegetation
should
be carried out as per specialist
advice of agronomist

not damaged
due
to
puncture,
tear
and
other
operational
stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5
Advice
should be sought from specialists
to find
out
the cause of unsatisfactory
growth of vegetation.
The advice
should be implemented.
Withered
plants
should be replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.8
Seeds
of vegetation
(grass,
legumes,
etc,
of
appropriate
variety)
should
then be spread
(refer to
Annex
A for guidance
in selecting
the species
of
vegetation).
If seeds are not available,
saplings of the
appropriate
plant species
may be planted
at suitable
intervals
through
the openings
,of the JGT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
