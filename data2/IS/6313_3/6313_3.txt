<<PARAGRAPH>>Building Construction Practices Sectional Committee, CED 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 3) (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Building Construction Practices Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 3) was first published in 1971 and subsequently revised in 1981, In view of comments
received and further knowledge that has become available, the Committee responsible for formulation of this
standard decided to take up its revision. Considerable assistance has been rendered by Central Building Research
Institute, Roorkee in revising the standard. In this revision, apart from other modifications, Chlorpyrifos and
Lindane have been included as an anti-termite chemical. Part 1 of this standard deals with constructional
measures and Part 2 deals with, pre-constructional chemical treatment measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Termite control in buildings is very important as the damage likely to be caused by the termites is huge. Wood
is one of the cellulosic materials which termites damage, cellulose forming their basic nutrient. They also
damage materials of organic origin with a cellulosic base, household articles like furniture, furnishings, clothing,
stationery, etc. Termites are also known to damage non-cellulosic substances in their search for food rubber,
leather, plastics, neoprene as well as lead coating used for covering of underground cables are damaged by
termites. The widespread damage by termites, high constructional cost of buildings have necessitated evolving
suitable measures for preventing access of termites to buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On the basis of their habitat, termites are divided into two types, namely (a) Subterranean or ground nesting
termites, and (b) Non-subterranean
or wood nesting termites having no contact with soil (see Annex A). The
subterranean termites are most destructive and are mainly responsible for the damage caused in buildings.
Typically, they form nests or colonies underground in the soil, near ground level in a stump or in other suitable
piece of timber, and some species may construct a conical or dome shaped mound, These colonies may persist
for many years and, as they mature, contain a population running into millions. All attacks by subterranean
termites originate from the nest but timber either lying on or buried in the ground maybe reached by means of
shelter tubes constructed within, or over such materials or else by the erection of an independent, free standing
mud structure. Chemical barriers which prevent the termites from reaching the super structure of the building
will protect the building and its contents. Treating the soil beneath the building and around the foundations
with a soil insecticide is a good preventing measure which is attracting attention throughout the world. The
purpose of this treatment is to create a chemical barrier between the ground from where the termites come and
woodwork,
cellulosic materials and other contents of the buildings which may form food for the termites.
Timber which is seasoned and is naturally durable in heartwood may be used in the building structure. However,
non-durable timbers and sapwood of all timbers should be treated to withstand the attack of drywood termites
(see 1S 401 and IS 1141).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Whenever termite infestation is detected in a building, appropriate steps as given in this Part of the standard
should be adopted for their extermination. Once the termites have an ingress into the building, they keep on
multiplying and destroy the wooden and cellulosic materials, and as such it becomes essential to take measures
for protection against termites. Periodic inspection and control measures are the most important steps in checking
termite damage to buildings. Often, the damage maybe slight and the removal of affected material and breaking
off the shelter tubes constructed by termites may suffice to protect the property. In other cases these simple
remedies may have to be supplemented by the application of chemical toxicants. The chemical treatment to soil
gives good results if it is carried out properly. The success of the treatment depends largely on the extent to
which the prescribed methods of treatment are feasible in a particular building. This again depends upon the
type of construction of the building, the amount of woodwork in it and the manner in which the woodwork is
installed. If there are signs of reinfestation after treatment, it may be necessary to repeat appropriate treatment
depending upon the termite infestation. This standard provides guidance for the chemical treatment measures
to be provided in an existing building for protection from attack by subterranean termites.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in Annex E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revisec$’. The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

building shall be treated with chemical emulsion at
the rate of 7.5 l/m2of the vertical surface of the sub-
structure
to a depth of 300 mm. To facilitate this
treatment a shallow channel shall be excavated along
and close to the wall at 1.75 Iitres per running metre
of the channel. Rodding with 12 mm diameter mild
steel rods at 150 mm apart shall be done in the channel
if necessary for uniform dispersal of the chemical to
300 mm depth from the ground level. The balance
chemical of 0.5 litre per running metre shall then be
used to treat the backfill earth as it is returned to the
channel directing the spray toward the wall surface.
If there is a concrete or masonry apron around the
building, approximately
12 mm diameter holes shall
be drilled as close as possible to the plinth wall at
300 mm apart, deep enough to reach the soil below,
and the chemical emulsion pumped into these holes

wherever such cracks are noticed, by drilling verticall y
12 mm holes at the junction
of floor and walls,
constructional and expansion joints mentioned above
at 300 mm interval to reach the soil below. Chemical
emulsion shall be squirted into these holes using a
hand operated pressure pump until refusal or to a
maximum of one litre per hole. The holes shall be
sealed. In general, the idea is to change the soil below
the floor at the locations of cracks with toxicants so
that termites in the soil are denied access through such
cracks and openings in the floor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1.5  Treatment
to voids in masonry<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Termites
are known to seek entry
into masonry
foundations and work their way up through voids in
the masonry and enter the building
at ground and
upper floors. The movement of the termites through
the masonry walls may be arrested by drilling holes
in the masonry wall at plinth level and squirting
chemical emulsion into the holes to soak the masonry.
The holes shall be drilled at a downward angle of about
45° preferably from both sides of the plinth wall at
approximately
300 mm intervals
and emulsion
squirted through these holes to soak the masonry using
a hand operated pressure pump. This treatment shall
also be extended to internal walls having foundations
in the soil. Holes shall also be drilled at critical points,
such as wall comers and where door and window
frames are embedded in the masonry or floor at ground.

shall be squirted
through
the holes till<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — In soils which do not allow percolation of chemicals to
the desired depth, the uniform dispersalof the chemicalto a depth
of 300 mm shall be obtained by suitably modifying the mode of
treatment
depending on the site condition. The dosage of
2,25 Iitres per linear metre shall however remain the same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1.2 The treatment described in 5.3.1.1 applies to
masonry foundations. In the case of RCC foundation,
the soil (backfill earth) in contact with the column
sides and plinth beams along the external perimeter
of the building shall be treated with chemical emulsion
at the rate of 7.5 l/m2of the vertical surfaces of the
structure. To facilitate this treatment, trenches shall
be excavated equal to the width of a shovel exposing
the sides of the column and plinth beams up to a depth
of 300 mm or up to the bottoms of the plinth beam if<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Non-subtemnean
or wood nesting termites
which live in wood with no contact with soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1. 1 Termites constitute a separate order of insects
called ‘ISEPTORA’. Although, they are commonly
called white ants, they are not related to ants. The
front pair of wings of the ants are longer than their
hind pair whereas in termites, both pairs are equal.
There are over 2300 species of termites of which about
220 are found in India. All these species are not
considered to be serious pests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l-3
Subterranean
termites
require
moisture
to
sustain their life. They normally need access to ground
at all times. These build tunnels between their nest
and source of food through covered runways. These
covered tunnels provide humidity
conditions
thus
preventing
desiccation
and protection
against
predators, darkness necessary for their movement and
for maintaining contact with earth. The subterranean
termites enter a building from ground level, under the
foundation, working their way upwards through floors,
destroying all before them. So little is seen of these
termite
operations
that sometimes
the structural
member attacked is found to be merely a shell with
the inside completely riddled and eaten away.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.2 According
to their habits,
termites
can be
divided into two well defined groups:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Subterranean

which build nests in the soil and live in them,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 6313 (Part 3) :2001<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.4 The wood nesting species comprise chywood
and dampwood
termites.
Drywood termites which
predominate are able to live even in fairly drywood
and with no contact
with soil. These frequently
construct nests within large dimensional timbers such
as rafters, posts, door and window frames, etc, which
they destroy, if not speedily exterminated. However,
they are not as prevalent and common as subterranean
termites, and are generally confined to coastal regions
and interior of eastern India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the habit of licking the secretions of exudating glands
of the physogastric queen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2 DEVELOPMENT
OF TERMITE
COLONY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At certain periods of the year, particularly after a few
warm days followed by rain, emergence of winged
adults on colonizing flights, occurs. This swarming,
also called the nuptial flight, may take place any time
during the monsoon or post-monsoon period, The fight
is short and most of the adults perish due to one reason
or the other. The surviving termites soon find their
mates, shed their wings and establish
a colony
if
circumstances are favorable.
The female of the pair
or queen produces a few eggs in the first year. The
first batch of the brood comprises only of workers.
The rate of reproduction however, increases rapidly
after 2 to 3 years. Although a colony may increase in
size comparatively
rapidly, very little damage may
occur in a period less than 8 to 10 years. Any serious
damage that may occur in a short time is perhaps due
to heavy infestation in the initial stages due to large
population of termites existing in the soil before the
building is constructed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.5
A termite
colony
consists
of a pair
of
reproductive,
the so-called king and queen and a large
number of sterile workers, soldiers, and nymphs. If,
however, the queen is lost or destroyed, her place taken
by a number of supplementary [productive
in some
group of termites; thus by removing the queen, the
colony will not be destroyed. All the work of the colony
is carried out by the workers. Guarding the colony is
the work of the soldiers. The adult workers and soldiers
are wingless. The workers are generally greyish white
in colour. The soldiers are generally darker than the
workers and have a large head and longer mandibles.
There are, however, other types of soldiers whose
mandibles are small, degenerated and functionless;
instead the frontal part of the head is prolonged to
form a long nasus; they dispel the enemy by squirting
out white poisonous
fluid through the nasus. The
reproductive,
that is, the flying adults, have brown
or black bodies and are provided with two pairs of
long wings of almost equal size in contrast to the
reproductive
of ants which have two pairs of wings
of unequal size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3
RECOGNIZING
THE
PRESENCE
OF
TERMITE
INFESTATION
IN BUILDINGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1
Swarms of winged reproductive
flying from
the soil or wood are the first indication of termite
infestation in a building. Often the actual flight may
not be observed but the presence of wings discarded
by them will be a positive
indication
of a well
established termite colony nearby. Termite damage is
not always evident from the exterior in the case of
subterranean termites, since they do not reduce wood
to a powdery
mass of particles
like some of the
woodborers or drywood termites. These termites are
also recognized by the presence of earth-like shelter
tubes which afford them the runways between soil and
their food.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.6
The food of the termite is cellulosic material
like timber, grass, stumps of dead trees, droppings of
herbivorous animals, paper, etc. Once termites have
found a suitable foot-hold in or near a building, they
start spreading
slowly from a central nest through
underground and over-ground galleries in the case of
subterranean
termites,
and galleries
within
the
structural member. Once they get direct access to them
in the case of drywood termites. In their search for
food they by pass any obstacle like concrete or resistant
timber to get a suitable food many metres away.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.2
Drywood termites
on the contrary
may be
recognized
by their
pellets
of excreta.
Non-
subterranean termites excrete pellets of partly digested
wood. These may be found in tunnels or on the floor
underneath the member which they have attacked.
These termites may further be noticed by blisters on
wood surfaces due to their forming chambers close to
the surface by eating away the wood and leaving only
a thin film of wood on the surface. Also the hollow
sound on tapping structural timber will indicate their
destructive activity inside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.7  In subterranean termite colony, the workers feed
the reproductive,
soldiers, winged adults and young
nymphs. One of the habits of the termites which is of
interest is the trophallaxis by means of wh;ch food
and other
material
remain
in circulation
among
different members of the colony. Workers are also in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

can have an adverse affect upon health when absorbed
through the skin, inhaled as vapours or spray mists or
swallowed. Persons handling or using these chemicals
should be warned of these dangers and advised that
absorption through the skin is the most likely sources
of accidental poisoning. They should be cautioned to
observe carefully the safety precautions given in  C-1.2
to  C-1.5  particularly when handling these chemicals
in the form of concentrates,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-1.4  The concentrates are oil solutions and present
a fire hazard owing to the use of petroleum solvents.
Flames should not be allowed during mixing.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-1.5 Care should be taken in the application of soil
toxicants
to see that
they
are not
allowed
to
contaminate wells or springs which serve as sources
of drinking water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-1.2  These chemicals are brought to the site in the
form of emulsifiable
concentrates.
The containers
should
be clearly
Iabelled
and should be stored
carefully so that children and pets cannot get at them.
They should be kept securely closed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-1.6  In case of poisoning, suitable measures shall be
taken for protection in accordance with IS 4015.<<HEADING_END>>

FOR TERMITE

TERMITE
DETECTION
IN BUILDINGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>termite control operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1. 1  A termite control operator must be able to find
out the existence or termites in a building. A certain
amount of technical
knowledge
and experience
is
necessary to determine if there is termite infestation
in a building, particularly
in the early stages when
the attack has just started or it is confined to remote
locations in the building. The operator should know
the habits of termites in general, the manner in which
they work, the places where they are likely to be found
and the signs which go to show that they are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.5  Termites work inside timber without breaking
the surface. They are known to eat away a board
completely
leaving only the film of paint on the
surface. If they break open the surface at any point
accidentally, they quickly seal it up, and their activity
continues beneath the surface without detection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.6
Woodwork
in the
vulnerable
locations
mentioned in  D-1.3  should be carefully examined to
find out if termites have attacked the wood. In the
absence of any external signs of damage, the woodwork
should be tapped to see if it is hollow having been
eaten up from inside. A sharp pointed instrument or
the sharp end of a pen-knife maybe used to pierce the
woodwork to determine if there are cavities in the
wood.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.2  A bright light is essential for termite inspection.
A bright electric bulb protected by a wire-cage and an
extension cord would be useful. If this is not available,
a flashlight may be used. The operator should also
carry with him a knife with a sharp pointed blade to
probe into woodwork.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.7 There is nothing as certain as termite runways
to establish
that infestation
exists.
However,
an
operator should be able to distinguish between old
runways and new ones. The old runways are brittle
and break away easily while the new ones will be moist
and stronger. It is not advisable to remove or destroy
termite runways during inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.3  As subterranean termites emerge from the soil
to seek entry into a building,
the portions
of the
building in contact with or adjacent to the soil should
be the first to be inspected. These would include the
basement, ground floor, step: leading from the ground,
columns,
porches,
etc. Locations
where there
is
dampness or where humid conditions prevail, such as
bathrooms, lavatories, or other places where there are
leaky pipes or drains are likely places of termite
infestation. Woodwork at basement or ground floor
level,
particularly
in damp locations,
should
be
examined. The places which demand careful scrutiny
are the points where woodwork is embedded in the
floor or in the wal I as termites seek entry through
crevices in the concrete or brickwork in which the
wooden frames are fixed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.8  If termite activity is noticed in any one location
of a building, it becomes necessary to make a thorough
search in the entire building.
In a multi-storeyed
building, if infestation has occurred at the ground floor,
all the upper floors must be subjected to thorough
scrutiny. There have been instance where termite
activity was noticed in one of the upper floors, with
no visible signs of attack in the lower floors except
perhaps the ground floor. This is explained by the fact
that the termites had travelled from floor to floor under
cover through lift wells or casings covering electric
wiring, telephone
cables, utility pipes, etc. Such
covered conduits
should, therefore,
be examined
carefully as they are ideal routes for termites. Other
places which should be examined
are woodwork,
wooden paneling on staircases and walls, are behind
picture frames huge on walls, false ceiling, special
attention being paid to locations where dampness
prevails, such as bathrooms, toilets and kitchen sinks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.4  The signs of presence of termites in a building
are the tell-tale
shelter
tubes which are termites
runways. As termites have soft bodies which cannot
withstand the drying effects of air, they move about in
sheltered mud tubes which they build when they have
to cross open spaces which are exposed to the air.
These are, therefore, not easily noticed and may go
undetected except to the trained eye of an experienced<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
