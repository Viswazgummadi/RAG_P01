<<HEADING level=3>>1. S-cope -
Prescribes two methods, one grauimetric
and the other volumetric,
for the determination
of settleable
matter.
These methods are applicable
to all types of water and waste water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  Gravimetric
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Principle-Settleable
matter is determined
from the difference
in the values
of non-filterable
residue of the sample, and of suspended
matter of the supernatant
liquid portion of the sample after it
has been allowed
to stand for 1 hour.
This technique
determines
matter which
will
not
stay
in
suspension
during
settling
period and either settles at the bottom or floats to the top.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>

); or<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)  Crucible

Porous-bottom
silica, sintered glass, porcelain,
stainless steel or alundum crucible
with a maximum
pore size of 5 pm.<<HEADING_END>>

temperature
up to 180 f 2°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.4  Desiccator

<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1
Preparafion
of g/ass fibre filter disc -
Place the
glass
fibre
filter
on
the
membrane
filter
apparatus
or insert into bottom
of a suitable
gooch crucible
with wrinkled
surface up. While vacuum is
applied, wash the dish with three  successive  20 ml volumes
of distilled
water.
Remove all traces of
water by continuing
to apply vacuum after water has passed through.
Remove filter
from membrane
filter apparatus,
or both crucible and filter if gooch crucible
is used, and dry in an oven at 103-105°C for
1 hour.
Transfer to desiccator
and weigh after half an hour.
Repeat the drying cycle until
a  constant
mass is obtained
( mass loss is less than 0.5 mg in successive weighings
).
Weigh
immediately
before
use.
After weighing,
handle the filter or crucible/filter
with forceps or tongs only.
~If determinations
are to be carried out at 180°C then the filter or crucible/filter
should be dried at 180%.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.2  Sample
volume
-
As in potable waters non-filterable
residue
is usually
small, relatively
large
volume of water is passed through
filter so as to obtain at least 2 5 mg residue.
For deciding
volume
to be taken, turbidity
values
may be taken into consideration.
If turbidity
value of a sample is less
than 50, filter
1 litre sample and if turbidity
value
exceeds
50 units,
filter
sufficient
sample
so that
non-filterable
residue is 50 to lOO_mg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.33
Assemble
the filtering
apparatus
and begin
suction.
Wet the filter
with
a small volume
of
distilled
water to seat it against the fitted support.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.4
Shake the sample
vigorously
and quantitatively
transfer
the predetermined
sample
volume
selected according
to 2.3.2 to the filter
using a graduated
cylinder
Remove all traces of water
by
continuing
to apply vacuum after sample has passed through.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
