FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 25 February
1972,
after the draft finalized by the Instrumentation
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2
In
hydraulic
structures
on
permeable
foundations
water
stored
percolates
below the foundation of the structure thereby causing uplift
pressures.
The pressure gradient acting along the direction of flow is a
critical design parameter
at the exit end of the structure.
Design of tbe
structure involves calculation of these pressures and gradients on the -basis
of certain assumptions.
In these cases, therefore, actual observations of
these pressures during actual operation become important.
This standard
has,
therefore,
been prepared
to cover installation
of instruments
for
observation
of uplift pressures at the contacts of the structures and the
foundation soils.
Pressure measurements at depths in .-the foundation soil
and pore pressure measurements
in earth
and
masonry
dams
using
piezometers
are being covered in a separate
standard
which is under
preparation.
A3 The theory of ground water movement is based on Darcy’s
law for
laminar flow which postulates that flow velocity is linearly proportional
to
the energy gradient and that the flow may be characterized
by a potmtial
function satisfying the following equation:
c<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where
4 = velocity potential
= k (z +p/W)
+ a constant<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>k = permeability of the medium,
z = height of the point tinder consideration above a datum,<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>P  =  residual

and
w = unit weight of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1
With

of simplifying
assumptions
far
ease of matbe-
matical
analysis,
the residual
pressure
at any point in the medium
may
be
computed
analytically
for mathematically
elementary
boundary
geometries,
utilizing
potential
flow theory
and suitable
conformal
transformations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.2
The
assumptions
generally
made
for
facilitating
theoretical
calculations
are the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The sub-soil
medium
is uniform,
homogeneous
and isotrouic
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>there
are no layers of differing
~ermeabkies
within
ttie medium;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)
cl<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The soil medium
is completely
saturated;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The flow is laminar
throughout,
enabling
application
of Darcy’s
law and potential
flow theory;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
temperature
of the soil medium
and
the flowing
water is
constant;
Seepage flow along
the bottom
profile by passing the soil medium
does not occur anywhere;
and
Only
two dimensional
analysis
is to be made
ignoring
all end-
effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>f ><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 But the assumptions
mentioned
in 0.3.2
are generally
not
valid
for
practical
structures.
Sometimes
values
of residual
pressures
and
exit
gradient
are obtainable
from
electrical
analogs
of the structure
and the
medium
which
may
include
effects of non-homogeneity,
non-isotropicity,
stratification
and
end-effects.
However,
even
these
experimentally
obtained
values
may not be realistic
enough,
due to the hydraulic
proper-
ties of the soi: medium
with
its variations
from
point
to point
which
can never be accurately
assessed in its totality
and simulated
in the analog.
The analog
could at best be only a gross approximation
of the prototype
built usually
with meagre
data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Therefore,
it becomes
essential
to install
pressure
pipes on the structure
itself
with
two objects
in view;
firstly
to act as tell-tales
watching
the
stability
of the structure,
and to predict
any undesirable
developments,
and
secondly,
to investigate
if the
actual
pressures
at various
points
on the
structure
are in conformity
with those assumed
for purposes
of design.
A
systematic
record
of their observations,
apart
from
its scientific
value,
will
be as necessary
for the maintenance
of structures
as a record
of usual
sub-
surface soundings
and probings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 IO the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in
different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7  For the  purpose of deciding whether a particular
re uirement
?
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or ca culated, express-
irig the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with

The number of significant places retained in the rounded ,off

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard covers design, installation, observation and maintenance
of uplift pressure pipes provided for hydraulic structures resting on perme-
able foundations.
This is ~essentially a system for measurement
of uplift
pressures  at the contacts of the structures and the foundationsoils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.1  The principles, however, may also be applied to other structures
(such
as spillway aprons, head regulators, pump houses on lift channels
and other appurtenant
structures ) resting on permeable
foundations,
where uplift pressures and excessive exit gradients are likely to develop.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  G-L<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 In
hydraulic
structures
on
permeable
foundations,
water stored
upstream  of the structure percolates below the foundations of the structure
due to the difference of head,  H,  between the upstream and downstream
water levels ( see Fig. 1 >.
Consequently at intermediate points, such as at
A  on the foundation bottom profile, residual pressures  P  develop, and they
act upwards tending to lift the structure, thereby reducing its stability.
In
order to design the structure safe against such uplift pressures, it becomes
necessary to compute the residual pressure at a number of salient points,
and provide sufficient dead weight of the structure itself to counteract
the
same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>22
The pressure gradient or the force of water acting along the direction
of flow is a critical design parameter
at the exit end of the hydraulic
structure indicated as point  B  in Fig. 1.
If at this end, the upward force
of water due to the-exit gradient is in excess of the effective weight, the
surface soil twill be lifted up followed by progressive dislodgement of soil
particles, and may result in the undermining of the foundation soil called
‘  piping ‘, and ult imate failure of the structure
itself.
This exit gradient
should be within design limits dependent on the foundation soil at the exit
end of the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>49 It may not always be necessary to provide graded filter material
around the filter points, as required for relief wells, since no flows through
the  filter points  are expected, except during the short periods when change
of water level occurs,
and during washing operations
to remove any
choking-up.

fine sub-soil material or of the existence of a high probability of choking-up<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

FOR PRESSURE
PIPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  During the installation
of pressure pipes the properties
of soil around
the tip, should be observed, particularly
when the tips are located in soil
with different properties
and permeabilities
recorded.
This
may be of
help in subsequent analysis and interpretation
of observations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 A damaged filter point shall not be used.
If one is damaged during
driving it shall be replaced with a good one.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Where necessary, especially in bored installations,
a clay seal of mini-
mum 1’5 m may be provided immediately
above the filter point to provide
effective closing around the periphery of the connecting pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 When more than one pipe are driven at the same place to different
depths, they shall be spaced not closer than 30 cm.
This will avoid any
direct connection
between any two filter points that may occur during
driving or extraction operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 The -horizontal piping between
the filter point and the observation
point on the superstructure
shall be slightly
inclined
downwards in the
direction of the filter point to avoid any possible air lock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>~5.6 During erection, the ends of all pipes shall be kept closed by caps to
avoid foreign matter findings its way into the pipes making observation of
water level unreliable,
if r-rot impossible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7 All vertical pipes shall be kept dead vertical
and no kink of any sort
shall be allowed.
Failure
in this requirement
may make it impossible to
lower the bell sounder or the thermometer
to the right place for obser-
vations,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8 Each pressure-tapping
point shall be given a distinct number and that
number shall be marked on the filter point and on each length of connect-
ing pipe.
These distinctive numbers shall be stamped on the caps at the
end of the stand pipes and on the masonry or concrete platform where
they are located.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 6532 - 1972<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9 Pipes from the filter points shall be led to piers or abutment walls to
enable water
level readings to be taken throughout
the year.
Points
directly under a pier or abutment wall shall be connected to the observa-
tion platform by a single vertical length of piping.
But those away from
piers and abutment
walls shall be connected
by horizontal lengths of
piping.
These latter shall be placed well below the lowest pressure level
that is likely to occur at the respective points.
Otherwise no observations
will be possible during certain water level conditions, when the observa-
tions stand pipe will be dry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10 Each pipe shall be tested to see that the filter point is not choked.
If any choking has occured anywhere in the pipe line, it’ shall be removed
by using compressed
air or pressure water
under pressure by jetting
through the pipe, flowing out through the filter point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11 Each vertical stand pipe shall be provided with a screw cap to avoid
bird nests and tampering.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12 All the piping including the stand pipes shall be coated with a good
quality anti-corrosive
paint.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  OBSERVATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The observations given in 6.1.1 to 6.1.6 for pressure data shall be made
simultaneously.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1 Upstream
and downstream
water levels shall be read from water
level gauges suitably fixed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2
Shade temperature
shall be read by means of an accurate
maxi-
mum-minimum thermometer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.13
The temperature
of river water at a suitable depth below water
surface where temperature
is approximately
constant shall be read.
The
surface temperature of river water is influenced by atmospheric
tempera-
ture, and only at a depth of l-5 to  2-O  m below the water surface, the
temperature appears to remain approximately
constant.
This is the tern--
perature to be observed, only by a maximum-minimum
thermometer,
and
not by an ordinary thermometer,
since its readings will be affected by the
varying  temperature
in the upper two metrcs of water during its with.
drawal after reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4 The temperature
of sub-soil water shall be read in a few selected
observation
pipes.
These temperatures
may be read by long distance
recording electrical thermometers,
preferably of the automatic
recording<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>type.
6.1.5  The water levels in all the stand pipes shall be read by means of a
bell sounder lowered into the pipe by a steel tape or by electrical devices.
The bell sounder is an accurate,
reliable, simple and cheap device.
It<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS t 6532 -  1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>consists of a solid brass rod about 90 mm long and 20 mm in diameter
ending in an inverted cup of 30 mm diameter
( set Fig. 4 ).
A swivel is
screwed  on  to the upper end to which the steel tape ii attached.
The length
of the sounder below the zero of the tape shali be measured carefully and
added to each reading of the tape to get the true depth from the top of
the stand pipe to the water level within the pipe.
The moment the cup
of the sounder~hits the water surface within the pipe, a definite  ‘  plop ’ can
be heard, a sound which cannot be mistaken or drowned even in the roar of
any discharging water through the hydraulic structure.
For exact reading,
the cup is moved up and down and the precise position where the  (  plop  ’
occurs is  read to an  accuracy  ~of  2 mm. From the previously known reduced
levels of the tops of the stand pipes, the reduced levels of the water within
the stand pipes are obtained by subtracting
the measured depths.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.6
The depths of sediment on the upstream and downstream floors
and if possible
the soil characteristics
of the sediment shall be observed.
Depths of sediment may be measured by sounding,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 For purposes of interpretation,
it is recommended
that for a filter, laid
horizontal,
the centre of the filter length will be the position of the pressure
point to which the reading in the connecting
stand pipe relates.
If there
is a drop of pressure along the length of the filter the pressure point should
be at the farthest position along the direction
of flow.
Similarly
in a
vertical filter the pipe reading should refer to the top or bottom end of
the filter, whichever is fi rthest downstream along the direction of flow and
has the lowest pressure.
Thus, at the upstream end of the structure, the
reading should refer to the botrom of the filter and at the downstream
end to the top.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 The frequency of observations will depend on local requirements.
For
investigation
of a particular
problem,
the observations
will have to be
rather frequent, but for watching
the stability of a structure,
once a week
for the key-pomts and once a fortnight
for other points shall be enough.
Daily observations
shall be made during periods when daily water level
changes are equal to more than 10 cm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  TIME LAG<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  When there are large fluctuatiqns in upstream and downstream water
levels, for instance during rising or falhng floods or when the river  supply
is bemgponded
up to feed supplies into the canals, the results are likely
to be influenced by time lag.
A rise in the upstream level will give rela-
tively lower readings and  vice versa.
When water levels are taken at regu-
lar intervals, due allowance shall be made for such time lag.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NATE -
The time lag of the pressure point should be assessed for each uplift prusurc
pipe after initial saturation
of the sub-soil and at periodical intervals.
This can be
done by filling the stand pipe with  water  and measuring the time for the water level to
drop down to a constant level.
The time lag for this purpose may be defined  as  the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

A sudden rise in downstream
level will give relatively lower pipe
readings and  vice  versa.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3  .In a rising flood, when both upstream

levels are
rising, the pressure pipes will read relatively low.
In a falling flood, when
both the upstream and downstream levels are falling, they will read high.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 The response
to any variation
in head due to change in the upstream
or downstream levels is almost instantaneous throughout the structure,
but
as the rate of movement of sub-soil water is very slow, the water in the
pressure pipes takes some time to deplete or recuperate
corresponding fall
or rise in the pressures.
Systematic and comprehensive
tests shall be done
during the course of operation of the hydraulic structure
to enable fixing
of the actual amount of time lag.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  The observations
shall be recorded
suitably
in registers
or forms.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 The record
of observations
shall consist of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Date of observation;

<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.1  The
form
shown
in Appendix
A should
be used
for recording
observations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 For purposes
of analysing
the
observations,
pipes
are
grouped
by
‘  lines ‘, that is, pipes on a single
section
from upstream
to downstream
of
the  hydraulic
structures.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4  Record
in Registers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8;4.1  One  page of the register shall be earmarked
for one line.
Sufficient
pages shall be reserved consecutively for each line to admit of all observa-
tions for that line being recorded consecutively for a period of, say, one
year.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.2
The registers
shall be maintained
in duplicate,
one for permanent
record in the office of origin and the other for periodical despatch to any
central organization where these data are scrutinized and analysed.

stations for uniformity
of record.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5 Record
in  Farms -
When
forms
are used
for
recording
observa-
tions, separate
forms shall
be used for each
line of uplift
pressure pipes.
These
forms may
be bound
in pads of 50 or 100 sheets.
Observations
shall be recorded
in duplicate
on these forms at site.
These
forms with
recorded
data may bc dctachcd
from the pad; one copy of the form shall
be filed suitably
in the onice and the other sent as expeditiously
as possible
to the agency
analysing
the data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.6
For the purposes of ready reference,
the data collected
and recorded
as
explained
in 8.2 to 8.5 shall be plotted as graphs.
properly
plotted graphs
will give a quick visual idea of the behaviour
of different
pipes at any time
of the year and wiJ1 bring to light
any special
features
or
abnormalities.
For a given
pressure
point,
4 (  P/H)
remains
constant
for any structure
provided
the temperature
of the flowing
water
and the nature
and depth
of sediment
or scour on the upstream
or downstream
pervious floors do not
alter.
The
function
(b should,
therefore,
form
the basis for plotting,
as
any variation
in this value from
the normal
will connote
damage
unless
this variation
can be explained
by temperature
and sedimentation.
The
dates of observation
should
be plotted
on the
X-axis
and
the
variable
factors
on the Y-axis.
The
variable
factors
are
4,
river
temperature,
sub-soil
temperature,
H,  downstream
water
level,
depths
of sediment
or
scour at the pervious
floors,
upstream
and
downstream.
These
graphs
shall be kept plotted
up to date
for all the key points,
so that
any un-
favourable
developments
in the sub-soil can be discovered
as soon as they
occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
