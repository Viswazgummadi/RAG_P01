<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted
by the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the
draft finalized by the Building Construction
Practices
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the
Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Use of stone masonry work is known and practised
froth
the
earlier
days and natural stone is exten-
sively available
in many
parts
of this
country.
The
types
of stone masonry~construction
followed
depends on local factors
like physical characteristics
of the stone, climatic
conditions,
workmanship,
etc. Certain broad principles
in laying, bonding, breaking of joints and finish should be complied
with
in order that the masonry develops adequate strength and presents a neat appearance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
( Part 1 ) covers rubble masonry
which is commonly
used in stone work in most cases.
Part 2 of the standard
covers ashlar masonry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published in 1967. The present revision has been taken up to incorporate
the
improvements
found necessary in light of the usage of this standard
and the suggestions made by vari-
ous bodies implementing
it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this
standard
several
construction
agencies
in this
country
having
wide
experience
in stone work have been consulted.
Due weightage has been given to international
co-ordi-
nation among the standards
and practices
prevailing
indifferent
countries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values
( revised)‘.
The number
of
significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES
1  The selection
of stones
for durability
is generally
based on experience.
An examination
of structures,
at least half a century
old,
where the partiruhtr
iype
of stone is used, will
indicate
the
durability
of the
stone.
If :ool
marks
are visib!r,
and the edges and
corners
arc still
sharp
and
true
;ino the surface is
hard and shows no signs of deterioration,
the stone is
durable.
2 Stone from quarries
having
stratification
at regu-
lar intervals
will
be of uniform
quality
generally.
Where there are variations
in rtratification,
the stone
shall
be examined
petrographically
in accordance
with IS 1123  :  1975.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Stone<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  Types<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
common
types
of natural buildingtstones
which are generally
used are, granite and other
igneous rocks, lime stone ( including
marble ),
sandstone,
etc. For the properties
of these types
of stones
reference
may be made to
IS 1123  :

Size  of
stone<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2  Quality<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally
stones used in rubble masonry should
be small enough to be lifted and placed by hand.
The length of the stone shall not exceed
three
times the height and the breadth on base shall
not be greater than three-fourth
of the thick-
ness of wall nor
less than
150 mm. The height
of stone
for
rubble
maso:?:y
may be up to
300 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>All stones used for building purposes shall be
strong, hard  and durable as indicated in 5.1.2.1
and 5.1.2.2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1,  Strength<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The strength
of building
stones
should be ade-
quate to carry
the
loads imposed.
For
ashlar
and coursed
rubble masonry,
the strength
shall
be as worked in accordance
with IS 1905  :  1987,
taking into
account, the appropriate
crushing
strength
of stone  as given in Table 1, and also
the type
of mortar
used. For random
rubble
masonry,
the strength value shall be specified on
the basis of local experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The
selection
and
grading
of
stones
for
rubble masonry
is largely done at site and the smaller
stones
are
used
in the hearting
of the wall.

<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Brought to courses ( see Fig. 7 ) -  The
stones are similar to those used for un-
coursed rubble but the work is levelled up
to courses of varying depth from 300 mm
to 900 mm according
to the locality and
the type of stone used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In selecting
a stone the situation in which it is
to -be used has to be considered.
The recommen-
ded use of common
types of stones for various
situations
has been shown in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 DESiGN CONSIDERATIOK<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  Coursed ($rst
and second sort )
( see
Fig. 8 ) -  Coursed
walling is built
in
courses
which may vary in height
from
100 mm to  300  mm but the stones in any
one course
are roughly
squared
to the.
same height.
The faces of the stones may
be pitched to give a rockface
appearance
or ma’y be dressed smooth.
A variant
of
this fype
of walling may be formed
by
the
mtroduction
of pinnings,
that
is,.
smaller
stones
in the
same courses,
at
intervals, producing
a chequered
effect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

POLYGONAL RUBBLE WALLING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Types of Mortar<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The choice of mortar shall essentitilly be based
on local experience
and practice
for use with
the stone selected
and the chmatic
conditions
prevailing.
The mortar shall also be duly work-
able, stand up well on the towel and spread out
easily.
shall stiffen up quickly as the rubble is
laid, shall adhere strongly to the wall unit and
shall develop sticient
compressive
strength
on
the masonry
work.
For details of mortar to be
used in masonry work,
reference
may be made
to IS 2250  :  1981.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Weatber_Protectioa<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An external
rendering would contribute
substan-
tially to the weather
resistance
of solid wall.
Depending
upon local conditions,
the wall may
be of solid construction
with or without exterior/
interior
protection.
The practice that is found
to be satisfactory
for the local
environments
shall be adopted. However, as a general guidance
the recommendations
givenin
Table 3 may be
followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - Table 3 gives the suitability or otherwise of
various types of some wall construction not less than
400 mm thick for the different conditions ofexposure
( for explanation of the terms, sheltered,  moderate,
severe, see Table 3 of IS 2212  :  1991 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5  Architectural Features<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.1  All-projecting
architectural
features,
such
as plinth projectionb,
string courses, or cornices
shall be effectively
bonded
by tailing into the
stone
work
to ensure stability. Such architec-
tural features
shall be set straight and true into
the finished joints as far as possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3  Rain Protection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Protection
against
rain
penetration
would
depend
upon the rate of absorption
of water by
stone or by the mortar
and also the extent
of
cracks
present
in the
masonry.
Penetration
through
body of the masonry
is possible only
-when the water absorbed at the external face is
sufficient
to fill certain
portion of the pores in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.2 When such features are not to be plaster-
ed over,
they shall be built with stone which
have high durability and resistance

<<HEADING level=3>>8.4  Handling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of grip in the tops of stones is prefer-
able to any method of holding the stone at the
end, because It enables the stone to be set in
final position before the tackle is released.
Due
care
shall be taken to protect
finished surfaces
and edges of stone against danger during hand-
ling. The various methods employed in different
situations for lifting stone are shown in Fig. 10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.4 All coping shall be dowelled
or cramped.
String courses shall tail at least 250 mm into the
work and shall be throated
on the underside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6  Damp-Proof Course<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the function,

<<PARAGRAPH>>Tools that are required for stone masonry work,
such as plumb
