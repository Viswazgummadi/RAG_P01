or other long spans.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Testing
of tower generally
serves
as a guide
to good tower design
and therefore
shall
not be considered
as a requisite
proof test for all
towers.
The test shall be conducted
on full scale prototype
tower as per
the approved
loading
schedules
and
rigging
diagrams.
The members
constituting
the prototype
shall be of the same grade of steel as specified
in the design and fabrication
shall conform
to the provisions
stipulated
in
IS  :  802 ( Part II )-1978t.
The tower shall be tested on rigid foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.1
The test tower shall
successfully
withstand
the ultimate
loads
specified for various
conditions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Leg  Anchorages
-
The tower
shall
be erected
vertically
on rigid
foundations
with as much unbraced
portion of the stub protruding
above
ground level as provided
in the drawing.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3 The tower erected
on test bed shall not be out of plumb
by more
than 1 in 360.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  CALIBRATION
OF MEASURING
INSTRUMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 All  measuring
instruments
shall be calibrated
in a systematic
manner
with the help of standard
weights.
The calibration
shall, before com-
mencing
the test on each tower, be done up to the maximum
anticipated
load to be applied
during
testing.
Calibration
curves for the instruments
to be used during testing
shall be drawn
by the testing
authorities
and
the test loads shall be suitably
corrected
with the help of these curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

OF LOAD
APPLICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Loads shall be applied
according
to rigging
diagram
through
normal
wire attachments,
angles,
or bent plates.
U bolts/D
shackles
or swinging
brackets
( hangers
) may
be used
in the
test tower
if desired
by the
purchaser,
provided
that satisfactory
and safe rigging
is attained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The
various
types
of
loads;
transverse,
vertical
and
longitudinal
shaU be applied
in such
a way that
there
is no impact
loading
on the
tower due to jerks from the winches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>’
4.3 Loading
cases (values,
directions
and points
of application
of loads)
are to be given
by the client.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  LOAD
AND DEFLECTION
MEASUREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  All loads shall be measured
through
a suitable
arrangement
of strain
devices
or by using
weights.
Positioning
of strain
devices
shall
be such
that the effect of pulley friction
IS eliminated.
In case the pulley friction
cannot
be avoided
the same shall
be measured
by means
of standard
weights
and accounted
for in the test loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Tower
deflections
under
load shall be measured
by suitable
procedure
at
the
top
cross
arm
level
on the front
sides
of the transverse
and
longitudinal
faces or front
and rear sides of transverse
facesa
Deflection
readings
shall
be recorded
for the  ‘  before
load’,
‘  load
on’
and  ‘  load
off’ conditions.
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  TESTING
PROCEDURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Bolt
Slip Test
-
In a bolt slip test, the test loads
are gradually
applied
up to the design
loads,
kept constant
for 2 minutes
at the design
loads and then the loads are released
gradually.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The initial
and final
readings
on the scales
before
application
and
after
the release
of loads
respectively
shall
be taken
with
the help
of
theodolite.
The
difference
between
these
readings
gives
the values
of
the bolt-slip.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Normal
Load/Broken
Wire Load Tests
-
All the loads
shall
be
applied
gradually
up to the ultimate
design
loads ( design load
x  F.O.S. )
in the following
steps and shall be released
in the similar
manner:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>25 percent,
50 percent,
75 percent,
90 percent,
95 percent,
and
100 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7. OBSERVATION
PERIODS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Under
normal
and broken
wire load
tests, the tower
shall be kept
under observation
for sign of failure for two minutes
(excluding
the time
for adjustment
of loads)
for all intermediate
steps of loading
up to and
including
95 percent
of ultimate
design loads.
-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 For normal
as well as broken wire tests, the tower shall be kept under
observation
for
five
minutes
after
it is loaded
up
to
100
percent
ultimate
design loads.
0<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 While
the loading
operations
are in progress,
the
tower
shall
be
constantly
watched,
and if it shows any tendency
of failure anywhere,
the
loading
shall be immediately
stopped,
released and then the entire
tower
shall
be inspected.
The
re-loading
shall
be started
only
after
the
corrective
measures are taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  RECORDINGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  The deflections
of the tower shall be recorded
at each
intermediate
and
final
stage
of normal
load/broken
wire
load
test
by means
of a
thcodolite
and grxduatcd
scales.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 The graduated
scales which are fitted on the tower shall be about
one
metrc long with marking
up to 5 mm accuracy.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  DESTRUCTION
TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1  If the purchaser
so desires,
the tower shall be tested to destruction,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Destruction
test shall be carried
out under normal condition
or broken
wire condition
as agreed between
the purchaser
and the contractor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 All the provisions
of this code for normal
load/broken
wire load test
are applicable
to destruction
test as well.
However,
the loads shall
be
increased
in steps of 5 pcrccnt
after the ultimate
design
loads
have
been
reached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.  CHECK
