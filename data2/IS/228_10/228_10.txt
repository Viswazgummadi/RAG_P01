<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Part 10) ( Third Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 22 December
1989, after the draft finalized
by the Methods
of Chemical
Analysis
of Ferrous
Metals
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 228 which was Arst published
in 1952 and subsequently
revised in 1959, covered the chemical
analysis of plain carbon and low alloy steels, alongwith pig iron and cast iron.
This standard was
again revised to make it comprehensive
in respect of steel analysis
and to exclude
pig iron 2nd
cast iron
which
are
being
covered
in separate
standards.
14 parts have already
been issued
covering only chemical
analysis of steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
IS 228 ( Part 10 ) was published in 1976.
In this revision the wave length at which
the intensity
of the molybdenum
complex is measured has been modified and the reproducibility
of the method has been incorporated.
,,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final
value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Outline of the Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1  Transfer 0’500 g of the sample to a 250 ml
conical
flask. Add 25 ml of the acid mixture.
Heat gently to dissolve the sample. Evaporate
the solution till firmes of perchloric
acid evolves
and
continue
heating
further
till
all
the
chromium, if present, is oxidised. Add dropwise
concentrated
hydrochloric
acid till most of the
chromium
is volatilised.
Cool,
add 50 ml of
dilute sulphuric acid ( 1  :  1 ), heat to boiling ( to
expel any free chlorine ) and cool. Transfer
the
solution to a 100 ml volumetric
flask and dilute
to mark with water.
Mix thoroughly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Sample aliquot is treated
with thiocyanate
