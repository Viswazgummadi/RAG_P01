<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian
Standard

had been approved
by the Civil Engineering

<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerable

which
is also increasing
continuously,
has led
to
incrrasicg
stress
being
laid in the development
programmes
of central
and state
governments,
on facilitating
speedy
and economical
construction
oi
houses.
Problem
of housing
being
greatest
amongst
the
lower

groups,
both
rural
and
urban,
the gre:.tcst
stress
is being laid on
housing
for these target
groups.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
calls
for
development
and
stancardization
of new
building
materials
and
construction
techniques
which
are
simple
and economical,
commensurate
with structural
and hygienic
safety
and durability,
in order to ensure
speedy
and economical
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
is one
of a series
of standards
being
published
by BIS on new materials
and
techniques
of roof/floorconstrucrion
which
when
implemented
will
result
in
substantial
savings
in materials
and
cost
of construction,
in addition
to
achieving
speedy
construction.

<<PARAGRAPH>>.1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
lays down recommendations
for
design
and construction
of
floors
and roofs
with precast
reinforced
concrete
planks
and
joist.
Planks
up to a length
of
1’5
m are
covered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.2 For large spans
requiring
high moment
of resistance,
either the depth
of joist can be
increased, or if depth can not be increased
due
to headroom
requirements,
the joist shall be
designed
as
doubly
reinforced
beam at the
support.
In the latter case, the bottom
rein-
forcement
of the joist shall be kept
projecting
out by about 20 mm
and the bottom
reinforce-
ments of joists covering
adjacent spans shall be
welded together
for continuity.
The top rein-
forcement
to resist negative
moment
shall also
be provided
in the joists up to a distance
from
supports
as specified
in IS 456  :  1978.
This
shall be
embedded
in  in-situ
concrete
( see
Fig.  1 ).
The moments
and shears at various
sections shall be determined
either theoretically
or the co-eficients
given in IS 456  :  1978 may
be used,
wherever
applicable.

Fan hooks
may
be
provided
if the fan is to be hung in between the

Alternatively,
a
