<<HEADING level=3>>1.  scope -
Prescribes methods for the measurement
of temperature
of water and waste water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Principle<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Temperature
measurements
may be made with any mercury-in-glass
thermometer,
provided
it is
checked occasionally
against a precision
thermometer
certified
by a competent
agency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2
Depth
temperature
may be obtained
with
a protected
reversing
thermometer
or a thermistor.
Measurements
of temperature
are, usually,
more conveniently
done using thermistors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. Procedure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Make
measurement
with
the
thermometer
immersed directly
in the water body, after a period of
time sufficient
to permit constant
reading.
If the measurement
of water temperature
can not be carried
out directly,
carry it out in a sampling
bottle.
The bottle
should
have a volume
of at least
one
litre.
Adjust its temperature,to
that of the sample water before the measurement.
Do not expose
it to heat
or direct
solar radiation.
Measure temperature
of tap water in a bottle through
the water flows
until a
constant
reading is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Make measurement
of the temperature
of a water body at a.particular
depth with
the thermometer
or thermistor
immersed
directly
in the
water
body.
After
sufficient
time has elapsed to allow
the
thermometer
or thermistor
to come to the exact temperature
of the water, take a reading.
In the
case
of the thermistor
make a direct measurement
of its resistance
and obtain
the temperature
of the water
body from the calibration
curve supplied
with
the thermistor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 In the case of reversing
thermometer,
obtain the reading by dropping
a messenger weight
along
the wire
to which
is attached
the
reversing
thermometer
in a reversing frame on a water sampling
bottle.
This weight
normally. drops at a speed of about 150 metres per minute
except
when
the wire
is extremely
inclined
to the vertical.
After sufficient
time has passed for the messenger
weight
to trip
the thermometer,
haul
up the wire
and
keep the
water bottle with the thermometer
carefully
in a
vertical
position
away from direct sunlight
in order to prevent accidental
reversing
before
reading
the
temperature
to be measured.
Allow
about
10 to
15 minutes
for the thermometers
‘to reach the air
temperature,
after they are brought
up from the water.
At this stage the auxiliary
thermometer
records
the atmospheric
temperature
and the
main
thermometer,
the approximate
temperature
of the water
body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Calculations
-
Calculate
the
exact
temperature
of the water
body, in the case of the reversing
thermometer,
from the following
formula:<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>T, =  the corrected value, that is, the true value of the water temperature,
“C;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>T’ =  the reading of the main thermometer,
“C;<<HEADING_END>>

graph; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  If an unprotected
reversing
thermometer
is used along with
the protected
thermometer
the
corrected temperature Tu can be similarly
obtained.
The actual depth of reversal of the thermometers
can be obtained using the following
equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Pm =  mean density of the water column; and

of ihe unprotected thermometer given

graph.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  Report
-  ‘Report the temperature
of water
to the nearest 0’01, 0’1 or OWC, depending on. the
accuracy required and the thermometer used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements of temperature are required in studies df self-purification
of rivers and reservoirs
and is one of the parameters for suitability
of an effluent waste discharge and for the control of waste
treatment plants. Temperature of water is important in relation to aquatic biota, bathing and irrigation
use.. It-also affects taste of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Accurate
measurements
of temperature of natural waters are essential for calculation of degrees
of saturation with respect to various minerals and in study of mineral ‘equilibria’.
Temperature readings
are used in cafculatiqn of various forms of alkalinity.
In limnologic
studies,
temperature
readings at
different
depths
are required.
In industrial
plants,
for process use or heat transfer calculations,
temperature values are required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
