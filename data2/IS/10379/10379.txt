FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
24
December
1982,
after
the draft finalized
by the Soil
Engineering
and
Rock
Mechanics
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
The
earthwork
involved
in embankments
and
subgrades
has to be
controlled
so that the average
properties
of the soil are equal
in quaiity
as adopted
in design.
A number
of field control
methods
have been
evolved.
This standard
covers
such
methods
and
also gives guidance
for use in various situations.
It is suggested
that
the tests mentioned
in
this
standard
are
conducted
at regular
intervals
so that the results are
available
for every
1 000 m2 of earth file.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off
in accord-
ance with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the
rounded
off value should
he the same as that of the specified
value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard
covers various
methods
of field control
of compaction
and moisture
contents
of soil for embankment
and subgrade.

TO
NON-GRAVELY
SOILS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Method
I -
In
this
method,
compaction
parameters,
that
is,
optimum
moisture
content
and
maximum
dry
density
are
determined
according
to the procedure
described
in IS  :  2720 ( Part VII
)- l980*
and
IS  :  2720 ( Part VIII
)-19747.
The in-&u moisture
content of compacted
soil is determined
by one of the procedures
given in IS  :  2720 ( Part II )-
1973:.
The field dry density
is determined
by any one of the metl?ods
given
in
IS  :  2720
( Part
XXVIII
)-19745,
IS  :  2720
( Part
XXIX
)-
197511 or IS  :  2720 (  Part XXXIV
)-19721.
after removing
the top 5 cm layer of earth.
The test shall be performed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The compaction
efficiency
is then
obtained
by
expression
of field
density-laboratory
maximum
dry density.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  Method
2 -
This
method
allows the determination
of the relation-
ship between
the embankment
moisture
content,
dry
density
and
the
laboratory
optimum
conGtions
without
the necessity
of measurement
of
water content
and the results can be obtained
in less than one hour.
This
method,
as
given
in
IS  :  2720
( Part XXXVIII
)-1976””
can be used
directly
for both moisture
and density
controls
or only density
control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Method
3 -
In certain
weathered
soils, field moisture
content
and
dry density
differ from the laboratory
compaction
values:
In such soils,
a test embankment
under nearly
identical
operating
conditions
for thick-
ness of soil, watering,
mixing
and compacting
is  used to determine
field
moisture
content
and dry density
attainable.
The specified
layer
of soil
should
be
spread
on a test strip ‘3  x
10 m, watered
and left for 5 to 30
minutes
depending
upon type before rolling.
The water content
is varied
in layers within
+ 6 percent
of laboratory
values.
Each
strip
is rolled
by
the roller
gnd the density
of soil is measured
by either of the methods
mentioned
in 2.1 after every
two passes.
A graph
of
the
number
of
passes
against
dry density is drawn for each water content.
A graph of
maximum
dry density
attained
when plotted
against
water
content
gives
field moisture
content
and attainable
field dry density.
The
trial gives a
minimum
number
of passes of compaction
roller which
at field moisture
content
will give maximum
dry density.

<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  In addition
to the methods

provisions
shall be applicable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The total density of soil increases
and moisture
content
decreases
with
increasing

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 For the soils with gravels up to 30 percent,
recommended
method
is
to establish
moisture

the
moisture

of the embankment
may be determined
by the method
preferably
given in IS  :  2720
( Part XXX111
)-19718
or alternatively
as
given in IS  :  2720 ( Part XXVIII

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  As shear
strength
of compacted
gravel
and
rockfill
does not vary
much with small changes
in the density and higher
precise
densities
can
be attained
without
precise
control
of water Icontent as in the case of fine

soil, controlled
testing may not be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
