<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Part 16 ) ( Second
Revision ) was adopted
by
the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized by the Methods of Chemical
Analysis
of Ferrous
IMetals
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 228, which was first published in 1952 and subsequently
revised in 1959, covered
the chemical
analysis of plain carbon and low alloy steels, alongwith
pig iron and cast iron.
It was revised
again to make it comprehensive
in respect of steel analysis
and to exclude
pig
iron
and
cast
iron
which
were
being
covered
in separate
standards.
During
its
second
revision
the
standard
has been split up in severa
parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers the method for determination
of tungsten.
The other parts of this series are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in steel has been
prescribed.
The reproducibility
of the method has been given
on the basis of interlaboratory
testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the result of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final
value observed or calculated
is to be rounded off it shall be done in accordance
