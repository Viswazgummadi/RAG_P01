<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Bureau
of
Indian
Standards
on 31 July
1987, after the draft finalized
by the
Construction
Plant
and
Machinery

Committee
had
beenapproved
by the
Civil

Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Pan
type
mixer
is a closed panequipped
with rotating
arms with
paddles
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
to arms
with
lesser
speed.
These
type of mixers
are very
efficient
in working
specially
with
stiff
mixes.

In
this
standard,
the nominal
sizes adopted
are based on the input
volume of unmixed
materials
as against
the volume
occupied
by concrete
after
mixing,
since
pan
mixer
has found wider applications
for mixing
materials
other than concrete
also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This
standard
lays
down
the
general
requirements
fo- pan mixers
with the following
objectives:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) To guide the purchasers
with some minimum
guaranteed
perfor-
mance;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) To
aid
in production
by limiting
the numberiof
standard
sizes;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) To help the manufacturers
and the purchasers
by
laying
down
working
limits for capacity
and other features
of the mixer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.1
This
standard
lays down the requirements
for the pan, water feeding
arrangements
and fittings,
skip loader,
certain
design
features
for safety,
power  units requirements
for the necessary
accessories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.2
It
does not
cover
free
fall batch
type concrete
mixers,
continuous
mixers
and truck mounted
mixers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 For the purpose
of this standard,
the definitions
given in IS  :  11386-

shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. DESIGNATION
OF
SIZE
AND TYPES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1

type
concrete
mixer
shall be designated
by the
number
representing
its input capacity
in litres
together
with
letter
‘P’
to indicate
the pan type concrete
mixer.
Thus,
a mixer
having
a maxi-
mum
input
of
500
litres
of mixed
materials,
per batch
will have the
designation
of 500 P.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2
Pan type concrete
mixers
shall be of one of the following
sizes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>375

4 500 P.
3.3 Input Capacity --  The
size of the
mixer
of a giveninput
batch
capacity
shall be such that,
on level ground,
it may accommodate
all the
unmixed
material
and thoroughly
mix
them
without
spillage
so as to
produce
the given volume
of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
