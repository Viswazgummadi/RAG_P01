<<HEADING level=3>>1  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard deals with provision
of aera-
tion for spillway and oultet
structures to over-
come the cavitation damages.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Cavitation Damage<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sudden reduction of pressure, at
any point
due to the vapour pressure of water is caused in
water passage by abrupt
changes in boundary
which causes a tendency of separation
of the flow
from the boundary, by constrictions
which
pro-
duce high velocities
and low pressures,
and by
siphons in which pressures
are reduced due to
elevation.
Vapour
cavities form as spheres in
the low pressure
areas
and collapse
when
a
higher pressure area is reached in a short distance
downstream.
The collapse is very rapid and sets
up  a high pressure shock wave in the water which
causes the damage to the nearby boundary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 The following
terms and
definitions
shall
apply for the purpose o,f this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Cavitation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cavitation
is formation
of gas phase
within
liquid.
The successive formation and collapse of
cavities in a stream of flowing liquid which results
from pressure changes within the stream caused
by changes in the velocity of flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Vaporous Cavitation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During process of cavitation
when the void is
filled primarily with water vapour, the process is
further classified as vaporous cavitation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

STRUCTURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.1  Gaseous Cavitation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Cavitation and Associated Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During process of cavitation
when the void is
filled with gases which have come out of the
liquid
the process
is
classified
as
gaseous
cavitation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  The flow of water on overflow
section in
the spillway causes high&r velocities, if the height
of overflow section is more than 60 m above the
river bed.
For higher velocities
of water
the
problem of cavitation becomes more critical.
For
velocities around
30 m/set
the
pressure
field
becomes much sensitive. The cavitation occurrence
is not only related
with high velocity
but with
discharge concentration
also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.2  Pseudo Cavitation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the process of cavitation if the reduction
in pressure
is sufficiently low, the cavities/voids
may get filled partly with gas(es) and partly
with
liquid vapour, then it is called pseudo cavitation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2 Pure water can withstand
very large tensile
forces before it ruptures,
but impurities in the
water are the points of weakness.
Most of flood
water contains impurities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Incipient Cavitation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In vaporous
cavitation, the
vaporization
first
takes place at local weakness in the liquid which
are called ‘Cavitation
nuclei’.
The nuclei often
found to be are either micro gas bubbles existing
freely in the liquid,
or a gas pocket in a small
crevice present
in the solid surface
in contact
with the liquid, gas bubble with organic skin or a
hydro phobic solid.
This onset of vaporization
is called ‘Incipierit Cavitation’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3 Cavitation
damage
occurs when vapour
bubbles form in the void/partial
vacuum creqted
or the high velocity water tends to break away
from the concrete surface while jumping over the
irregularities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.4 The surface irregularities include projections/
offsets of joints,
grooves, etc.
All precautions
shall be taken to avoid irregularities on the down-
stream face of overflow section.
The projections/
offsets shall not be more than 3 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The right

The
cavitation
damage
occurs usually at all similar type of locations.
The floor slabs of the spillwaqi are more vulner-
able to cavitation damage than the walls or piers.

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The air entrained
by a high velocity flow
affects the compressibility
of the airwater
mixture. So, when vapour-bubbles
collapse,
the collapsing effect of the bubble should
be smaller than those occurring
in water
without free air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
It can be observed from the above equa-
tion that the cavitation
index decreases as velocity
increases and the damage will increase very rapidly
with even a small
increase
in velocity
beyond a
limiting value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1 As explained
in 3.1 irregularities
at the

of the flow surfaces
are the main
causes for the cavitation damage.
The following
procedure
is
recommended
to
find out
the
occurrence of cavitation damage by comparing the
incipient cavitation index ( o  )  and flow cavitation
index ( K ) for every overflow section of hydraulic
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

by the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.4 If the flow cavitation
index ( K) is greater
than incipient cavitation
index ( Q ). then cavita-
tion will not take place and also no damage will
occur. In case the flow cavitation index (K) is less
than incipient cavitation index ( D ), then cavita-
tion will occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Q== 1’2(h/B)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h = height of offset, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.5 Based upon the computation
of the flow
cavitation
index as per 3.3.3 the range of index
and its effects are given in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B = depth of water flow channel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The relative height of offset (  h/B )  shall be
less than 0.05.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.6 Whenever cavitation
occurs, it will damage
the surface. However,
the e&tent and length of
time in which the damage takes place is very
important for ascertaining the potential of damage
and safety of the structure.
The magnitude
of
cavitation
damage occurrence is related to length
of time which is given in Table 2 for guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

A sample calculation for design of aeration groove
is given at Annex A.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.5  Design Criteria of Ramps<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.5.1  The principle of providing ramp as aera-
tion device is based on the theory
that it causes
the nappe to be lifted from the spillway surface
and strike it back at some distance
downstream.
A cavity is created under the nappe which draws
in air from outside.
As the air is entrained by the
flow, local pressure reduction occurs which causes
more air from atmosphere to rush in water flow.
3.4.5.2 The air requirement
shall be worked out
according
to the method
explained
in 3.4.1 or
formula given in 3.4.4.5.
3.4.5.3 Suitable size of ramp is considered
and
actual model
studies are carried out, to find out
the air drawing capacity of the nappe per unit
width by the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Large reductions in pressure can be avoided
by providing
air vents through
which air will
discharge
into the conduit when a low pressure
exists. The vents usually open through the conduit
roof immediately
downstream
from the service
gate.
The size of the air vent is governed
by
Froude number and discharge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The air discharge which must be supplied
through
air vents is dependent upon the rate of
air entrained by high velocity
flow and upon the
rate of air discharged
at the conduit
exit above
the air-water
mixture. These factors are variable
and are influenced by the hydraulic and structural
features
of the conduit, and method of  1  conduit
operation.
When
conduit
discharge
is
not
influenced by tail water conditions
and hydraulic
jump does not form in the conduit, the jet coming
out from a small gate opening forms a fine spray
or mist which fills the conduit
and is dragged
along the conduit by the underlying
high velocity
flow producing
a blast of air and spray from tbe
exit portal. But at large gate openings a hydrau-
lic jump is formed in the conduit and the jet will
entrain
air. Further
air discharge at the top of
the conduit will be entrained by the turbulence of
the jump and pumped
by the jump action into
the conduit
down stream. Both conditions of air
flow in the conduit result in reduced pressure at
downstream of gate and at the vent exit, resulting
in air discharge through the vent. The maximum
air velocity in the vent should not exceed 60 m/s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
