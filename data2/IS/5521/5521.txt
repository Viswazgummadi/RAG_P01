<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 13 June
1989, after
the draft
finalized
by the
Sugar
Industry
Sectional
.Cdmmittee
had
been
approved
by
the
Agricultural
and Food Products
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Molasses,
which
is often
referred
to a waste
product
of
sugar
factories,
is an important
raw material
for distilleries
producing
alcohol.
Storage
of
molasses
without
deterioration
is
important.
Presently,
molasses
is being stored in many
places in  kmh
or pucca
masonry
tanks
with
or without
roofs where
molasses
is likely
to get diluted
with and
have losses due to seepage and contamination
leading
to its deterioration_
Construction
of molasses
tanks,
preferably
of steel, is of marked
import-
ance
in
arresting
the
deterioration
and
wastage
of
molasses.
This
standard
gives
the
specification
of steel
tanks
for efficient
storage
of
molasses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This
standard
is intended
chiefly
to cover
the technical
provisions
relating
to the construction
of covered
mild
steel tanks
for storage
of
molasses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This
standard
was first Published
in 1969.
In the present
revision,
the format
has been
changed
and the requirements
of uniformity
and
recommendatory
nature
have
been
appended
to the
essential
require-
ments to enable
better
implementation
of the standard.
In this revision,
the
provision
of
Peripheral
vertcial
columns
has been
deleted
and
molasses
tanks
with
higher
capacities
have
been
included,
besides
incorporation
of Amendment
No. 1, issued to the earlier
version.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1 The
recommendations
on location
of the steel tanks
in case of

<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose
of this standard,
the following
definition
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Cane

AND
DIMENSIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The
diameter
and
height
of
the
molasses

usually
depends
upon
the
size
of
the
ground

available
and
the volume
of
molasses
required
to be stored.
Table

the recommended
volumes
and
dimensions
of tanks
for storage
of molasses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  I -  The height
of the tank
shall
be determined
taking
into consideration
the
soil bearing

Valve--
A sluice
valve,
preferably
of
stainless
steel,
shall
be fitted
to the outlet
opening.
It is desirable
to have two
valves in series.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3
Drainage
or Wash Out Valve -
A tank
shall

Z&t -
The inlet
of molasses
shall
preferably
be at the bottom

line
in which
case the molasses
should
not
be allowed
to fall
from
a
height
as in doing
so a lot of air gets occluded,
which is not desirable.
Instead,
the pipe may be held tangential
to the inside
of the wall
about
a metre

TESTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  The tank shall not leak when tested
by the following
method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.1 Bottom  Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1.1
After
the bottom
and
at least the bottom
courses
of shell
plates
have
been
welded,
the bottom
shall
be tested
by
pumping
air
beneath
the bottom
plates to a pressure
just sufficient
to lift them off the
foundation
and
in any case of not
less than
100 mm Hz0 gauge.
The
pressure
shall be held by the construction
of a temporary
dam of clay or
other suitable
material
around
the tank
periphery.
Soap
suds or other
suitable
material
shall be applied
to all joints
for the detection
of leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1.2
Subject
to the agreement
of the purchaser,
molasses
may
be
used instead
of air and soap suds to test for leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1.3
Alternatively,
the
bottom
seams
may
be tested
by the
vacuum-box
method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2
Shell Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2.1  The
shells
of tanks
shall
be tested
after
the completion
of
the roof.
Wherever
possible,
testing
shall
be by filling
the tank
with
water
to the level of the top course.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2.2
Where
local
conditions
ar,e such that
testing
with water
is
impractical,
the tank
shall
be testing
by. painting
or spraying
all joints
on the inside
with a highly
penetrating
oil and noting
any leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.3
Repair of Leaks<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.3.1
All’ leaks detected
during
testing
shall
be repaired
to
the
satisfaction
of the purchaser
and on completion,
the entire
tank
shall
be
tight and free from leaks.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.3.2
In the joints
between
roof plates only, pinhole
leaks may be
repaired
by mechanical
caulking.
However,
where there is any indication
of considerable
porosity
the
leaks
shall
be sealed. by laying
down
an
additional
layer of weld metal
over the porous section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.3.3  In all other
joints,
whether
between
shell plates or bottom
plates
or both,
leaks shall
be required
only
by welding,
if
necessary,
after first cutting
out the defective
part.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.3.4
When
the tank is filled with water for testing,
defects
in the
shell joints
shall be repaired
with the water level at least 300 mm below
the joint
being
repaired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
