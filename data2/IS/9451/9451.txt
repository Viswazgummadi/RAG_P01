<<PARAGRAPH>>Irrigation Canals and Canal Linings Sectional Committee, RVD 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Irrigation Canals and Canal Linings Sectional Committee had been
approved by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Canals excavated in expansive soils, such as black cotton soil, pose several problems involving
stability of slopes and shape of section. To have economical sections and prevent erosion due to
design velocities, it is necessary to line the canal bed and slopes. Precast cement concrete slabs for
side slopes and  in - situ  concrete for bed are common types of lining adopted for canals in cutting
and embankment. However, it is often experienced that the lining materials directly placed
against the expansive soils undergo deformation by heaving, disturbing the lining and throwing
the canal out of commission. This deformation is traced to the characteristics of swelling and
swelling pressure developed by expansive soils, when they imbibe water in their intra-layers.
Adequate thickness of cohesive non-swelling soil (CNS) material is found to resist swelling
pressure and prevent the heaving of underlying soil. From experiments in laboratory and field it is
concluded that deformations may be correlated to the thickness of CNS layer and swelling
pressure characteristics of expansive soil. This standard lays down guidelines for the treatment of
expansive soils by introduction of a cohesive non-swelling soil layer of suitable thickness between
the expansive soil mass and the lining material to counteract the swelling pressure and resultant
deformation of the lining material on a scientific basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1980 and the first revision was taken up in 1985. The second
revision has been taken up in view of the experience gained during the course of these years in the
use of this standard. The following major changes have been incorporated in this revision:
1) Identification and properties of expansive soil have been referred to the relevant Indian
Standard.
2) Instead of three types of treatment only one type of treatment has been provided.
3) Modifications have been incorporated in Table 1.
4) Construction procedure for canal in cutting and embankment has been added in detail.
5) Clauses on under-drainage arrangements and joints in lining have been elaborated.
6) Fig. 1 and 2 have been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 3.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (September 2000). Side bar indicates modification
of the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard lays down guidelines for
lining of canals in expansive soils.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Black cotton soils are a type of expansive soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(Part 41) : 1977 at optimum moisture content
and
minimum

soil, remoulded at OMC and compacted to
standard
proctor
density)
should
be
10 kN/m 2   when
tested
according
to
IS 2720 (Part 10) : 1991.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of this standard the definition
of terms given in IS 1498 : 1970 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Expansive soils in side slopes and bed of
canal in cutting or embankment when in
contact with water swell, exerting a swelling
pressure
which
may range
from 50 to
300 kN/m 2  or more. This characteristic of
swelling and the swelling pressures of black
cotton soils is attributed to the pressure of
montmorinolite
or
combination
of
montmorinolite and illite clay minerals. A wide
range of properties of expansive soils are found
in India (  see  IS 1498 : 1970 for identification
and properties ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4  If given CNS material is not available,
designed mix to produce blended CNS may be
used. The artificial CNS should satisfy all the
requirements of CNS. If stabilized material is
to be used, special mix design needs to be
evolved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.5  Most murums of laterite, laterite type and
siliceous
sandy
clays
exhibit
CNS
characteristics, however some murums may be
of swelling type. Unlike swelling soils, they do
not exhibit cracking during summer, nor
heaving and stickiness during rainy season.
Structures constructed on such soil do not
exhibit heave though they may sometimes
settle. The CNS are generally red, reddish
yellow, brown, yellow, white, whitish grey,
whitish yellow, green and greenish grey in
colour. Although, several soils containing
non-expanding type clay mineral exhibit CNS
properties, the following range helps in locating
such types:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The swelling pressure and free swell index
tests should be done in accordance with IS 2720
(Part 40) : 1977 and IS 2720 (Part 41) : 1977.
Expansive soil met within the locality has to be
analysed for swelling pressure before deciding
the type of treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For testing the expansive soil for determination
of
swelling
pressure
the
expansive
soil
specimen should be remoulded at zero moisture
content to the density obtainable at any time in
the year in the field at a depth beyond 1.0 m (in
expansive soil). The swelling pressure should
be determined under no volume change
condition when moisture content is increased
from zero to full saturation level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1  They are soils possessing the property of
cohesion of varying degree and non-expanding
type clay minerals such as illite and kaolinite
and their combination with low plasticity with
liquid limit not exceeding 50 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 9451 : 1994<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The construction should be carried out in the
following steps:
a) While excavating provision should be
made
for
accommodating
required
thickness of CNS layer on bed and sides.
The subgrade on which CNS layer is to be
laid should generally not be kept exposed
for more than four days, prior to the
placement of the CNS layer.
b) Serrations
should
be
provided
in
expansive soil to prevent contact slides
between CNS materials and expansive
soil.
c) Proper moisture should be added to CNS
materials.
d) CNS materials should be compacted in
layers by appropriate equipment to ensure
proper density.
e) CNS on side slopes should be trimmed to
the required thickness. The thickness is
measured perpendicular to the surface of
expansive soil.
f) Suitable canal lining over CNS material
should be provided depending on the site
and economy condition.
g) To avoid slipping and rain cuts during the
rainy season, it is advisable to provide
CNS right up to the ground level.
h) In deep cuts CNS material should be
provided not only behind the lining of the
canal but also above the canal prism, all
along the excavated surface, so as to
prevent large scale heaving above the
canal level. The CNS material above the
canal prism may be of lesser thickness,
say 15 to 20 cm. However, full design
thickness behind the lining should be
continued at least 100 cm above the top
level
of
the
lining
(illustratory
arrangement shown in Fig. 1).
j) The stability of the slopes, particularly in
the case of cuts, is very adversely affected
by rain water finding its way into the
tension cracks and exerting hydrostatic
force on the slipping mass of the soil.
Covering the surface of the slopes by CNS
materials and proper surface drainage
will reduce the chances of rain water
finding its way into the cracks.
k) It is necessary to stack the excavated soil
away from the cuts to prevent it inducing
slips by surcharge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 CRITERIA FOR FIXING THE
THICKNESS OF CNS LAYER<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  Thickness of CNS materials is related to
swelling
pressure
and
the
resultant
deformation, the permissible deformation being
2 cm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Guidelines for choosing the thickness of
CNS materials required for balancing the
different swelling pressures is given in Table 1.
Slopes
should
be
in
accordance
with
IS 10430 : 1982.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — However, optimum thickness of CNS materials
needs to be determined for different swelling pressures
by actual experiments both in field and laboratory; if
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To counteract the swelling pressure and
prevent
deformation
of
the
rigid
lining
materials,
a
CNS
material
of
required
thickness depending on the swelling pressure of
expansive soil, is sandwiched between the soil
and the rigid lining material. The thickness of
CNS layer should be measured perpendicular
to the surface of expansive soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Canal in Cutting<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  Long deep cuts in expansive soils should
be avoided and where possible a detour should
be considered.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cutting special care will be necessary to
compact the CNS materials against the
excavated surface of the cuts. The material
should be spread uniformly in their horizontal
layers of specified thickness (15 cm thick). Care
also is necessary in obtaining a good joint
between the two materials, by thoroughly
wetting the excavated surface, so as to avoid
slips at the junction plane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Canal in Embankment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The construction should be carried out in the
following steps:
a) Proper moisture should be added to CNS
material and expansive soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Expansive soil and CNS material above
ground
level
should
be
compacted
simultaneously,
in
layers,
with
appropriate equipment to ensure proper
density.
c) The
CNS
materials
in
embankment
should be laid and compacted in layers
simultaneously with the body of the
banks, so as to obtain good compaction
and to avoid any slippage plane being
developed between the two materials. The
compaction of CNS materials should also
be to the standard proctor density with
optimum moisture content. It may be done
either with sheep foot rollers or 8 to 10 ton
ordinary rollers.
d) Provision of surface drain and internal
drainage
filter
should
be
made
to
minimize external/internal erosion. A rock
toe with inverted filter may be provided at
either end of canal bank.
e) Special care is required to be taken to
provide internal drainage for the banks,
having bed filling of 2 metres or more. A
sand blanket is spread on the base of the
bank and rockfills with regular inverted
filters are also necessary at the outer toes.
f) For both the cuts and banks, paved surface
drains should be provided at the berms,
etc, to avoid erosion of the finished
surface. As far as possible, water from
these drains should be drained away from
the canal.
g) The drainage properties of the CNS
material itself need to be given due
consideration as water locked up in this
saturated layer is likely to cause pore
pressures on the lining during canal
draw-down conditions.
h) Murum (gravelly soil) material on outer
slopes of canal embankment should be
trimmed to the required thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j) To protect outer slopes from erosion,
proper turfing should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3  Similar procedure should be followed for
canals in partial cutting and embankment.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Pride<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1  The problem of effectively compacting the
subgrade for side lining on slopes is very
important in case of black cotton expansive soil
zone in cutting or embankments, where backfill
of CNS material is required to be placed for the
sides and bed, in addition to design thickness.
Twenty cm or so (perpendicular to side slope) of
extra pride may be provided and compacted in
horizontal layers to the required density. This
pride should be removed only just prior to the
placement of lining, thus making a fresh and
well compacted surface available for bedding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.2  For cutting in soft material where the
CNS backfilling is not required the best method
is to leave the cutting 20 cm or so undercut
(perpendicular to the canal slope) and remove
this undercut only just prior to the placement of
concrete lining. Similar procedure may be
adopted in case of cutting in hard strata.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5 Use of Polyethylene Sheets Below
Concrete Lining<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of polyethylene sheet below concrete
lining could be either for achieving better
ultimate imperviousness of the lining as a
whole or it may be used only for limited
purpose as an assistance, during construction,
for avoiding the cement slurry from concrete
escaping in the subgrade below. Use of Low
density polyethylene (LDPE) sheets 200 gauge
(50 micron) is to achieve only the latter limited
purpose. If overall imperviousness is proposed
to be achieved, it would be necessary to use
High molecular mass high density polyethylene
(HDPE-HM) sheet of sufficient thickness,
strength, toughness and durability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 9451 : 1994<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Such
drainage
holes
are,
however,
not
advocated for general adoption.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 LINING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  The
lining
may
be
cement
concrete
(IS 3873 : 1993), burnt clay tile (IS 3872 :
1966), stone pitched (IS 4515 : 1993), stone
masonry (IS 11809 : 1993) or lime concrete
(IS 7873 : 1975).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2  It is recommended to provide regular
drainage arrangements using porous concrete
sleepers,
7.7 cm × 20 cm
with
50 mm
perforated G.I. pipes at 3 m centre to centre
coming out through the sides of the lining. Two
porous concrete sleepers on either side of the
bed, below the side may be provided. A 50 to
75 mm thick sand mat below the bed and side
cast  in - situ  lining (below the polyethylene
sheet) should be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 UNDER DRAINAGE ARRANGEMENTS
AND JOINTS IN LINING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  The drainage properties of CNS material
itself need to be given due consideration as
water locked up in this saturated layer is likely
to cause pore pressure on the lining during
canal draw down conditions. To release the
same if holes are provided for drainage in
concrete lining, care will have to be taken to
provide inverted filters at the back of the holes
so as to avoid the CNS material being washed
away by fluctuating water levels in the canal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the sand mat is not economically
feasible additional porous concrete sleepers
may instead be provided at right angles to the
longitudinal rails (along the cross section of the
canal) at 3 m centre to centre. The porous
concrete sleepers have to be encased in filter
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
