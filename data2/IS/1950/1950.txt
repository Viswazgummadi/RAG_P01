<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD
0.1  This
Indian

was adopted by the Indian Standards
Insti-
tution on 29 May
1962, after
the draft

.by the Functional
Requirements

had
been approved
by
the Building Division Council.
0.2 This
standard
is one of a series of coda

the preparation
codes  to cover comprehensively
the functional
aspects of build-
in relation
to their structural
safety,
fire safety, heat and sound instrIation,  ventilation,
daylight
and orienta-
tion.
This code is intended
as  a simple
and  convenient  guide to the
engineer
and architect
in the Seld in dealing with noise reduction and
sound insuhation problems.
0.3 Investigations
on the e&t
of
noise
on
human
comfort
and
annoyance
have
revealed
that high noise conditions
not only result in
uncomfortable
living conditions,
fatigu%
inefficiency
and mental
strain
but
prolonged
exposure
to
such
conditions
may
cause
temporary

countries.
This
code is essentially
the experimental
Hiork and 6cld studies carried out
in certain countries
abroad
such as Britain,
Sweden,
Holland
and Denmark.
Absence of
similar data on noise levels in relation to human comfort and field tests
to determine
suitable types of construction
to obtain comfort
conditions
in India, makes it difficult to verify all the recommendations
of-his

here.

It may however

ing
iInaliacd,
the
National
Physical
Laboratory,
New Delhi was requested
by the Sectional
Committee
to
undertake
noise survey in some of the important
cities of India.
They
have rince conducted
this survey
in Delhi and Bombay and the data
thus obtained
has been very usdul
in arriving
at the recommendations
made in this standard.
c
The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of  this
code, recommends
strongly
that a programme
of noise survey,
noise
comfort
conditions,
experimental
research,
and field tests
should
bc
undertaken
by appropriate
authorities
in the country
so that reliable
and

for the

<<PARAGRAPH>>construction
of
buildings
which
would
provide
comfortable
living
conditions in respect of noise and sound insulation.
0.5 It is difficult to reduce outdoor
noises coming into a building.
It is,
therefore, desirable that during the planning of the layout
of a town or
a suburb,
the location
of ,thc residential
areas, in particular,
should be
so arranged
that they are away
from
the traffic, industrial
and other
noisy surroundings
and
arc set ,off from the various roads according
to the average noise level which may emanate
from
them at any time.
Residential
buildings
situated
on roads carrying
heavy
traffic would
need similarly
to be set off from the road adequately
and
suitably
oriented so as to attenuate
the noise to the required degree.
Indoor noises may be either due to the tenants on the upper
floor
moving their furniture or children dancing
and playing
or a “flushing
cistern ” worlting or other similar
causes; such noises are particularly
annoying during the night.
Adequate
attention
should be paid to the ar-
rangements
of rooms in any singie apartment
or house and to the design of
the party walls between two dwelling units. Similarly, the construction
of
floors and c&ings of buildings having two or more storcys should provide
for the attenuation
of impact noises to. the desired degree of quietness.
Some buildings are more vulnerable
to noise than others.
Broad-
casting and recording studios, audition
rooms  and certain types of scienti-
fic laboratories;
can be put out of action by noise; parliament
houses,
council chambers,
law courts, schools and colleges, may be made almost
useicss because of noise.
Thus specially is the case in hot climates wbcre.
open windows is the rule.
Thus close and urgent attention
to pro
zoning, particularly
in the location of air-ports, factories and such o J- er
sources of noise, should be given before it bccomcs too late.
0.6 In the formulation
of this standard,
the Committee
has considered
the recommendations
and practicer
in v
UC in other
countries
with
regard to sound insulation of buildin
.
r
‘;B  here considerations
have led
the Committee
to derive assistance

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This code lays dotin acceptable
noise levels and sound insulation
standards
in non-industrial
buildings
such as, dwellings, schools, hos-
pitals and office buildings,
and
recommends
methods
of minimizing

of air-borne
and

noises. It  does
not
include standards
for industrial

<<HEADING level=3>>2. GENERALPRINCIPLlB
I<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 &iaa -Noise
is defined as ‘ sound
not desired by the recipient ‘,
that
is, unwanted
sound.
This
unwanted
sound
may
be of single
frequency
and of coustant
or varying
intauities
or it may be a com-
bination of various frequencies
of different intensities.
The annoyance
eff’ect  of noise depends not only on the frequency but alsoon
the inten-
sity and wave-form
of the noise.
Thus, the noise may be due to either
of the fwrs,
frequency and intensity,
or both, high frequency
sounds
are more annoying and harmful
than low frequency
sotmds.
2.2 Im&u
rl
m
Nofau - Noises may be of outdoor
or indoor
origin.
Outdoor noises are caused by road. traBc, raitnhys,
aeroplanes,
lifts,  blaring
loudqdm
and various
tw
of moving
machinery
in
the neighbourhood
or in adjacent
buildings.
As far as indoor noises
are concerned,
conversation
of the’ occupants,
footsteps,
banging
of
doors,
shifting
of ‘the furniture,
operation
of the cistern
and water-
closets,
playing
of radios, gramophones,
etc, contribute
most of
the
noise
emanating
from
an adjacent
room
or an adjacent
building.
Noise
conditions
vary from time to  time;  a noise which may not be
objectionable
during the day may assume
annoying
proportions
in the
siknce of the night when quiet conditions are essential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3Ma~tmmtdNoke
23.1 The range of variation
of intensity .of noise is very large.
The
loudest
and almost
painful
noise
is about
1Qs times the intensity
of
sound which is just audible.
On account
of the wide range of noise
levels and the importance
of the effect of increase in noise produced on
the human ear a  ‘  logarithmic
scale’
is used.
Experiments
have shown
,that  the
ear does not
respond
in proportion
to the intensity
of the
sound,
and
that
its response
is a proximately
proportional
to the
logarithm
of
the intensity
of soun Cf  .
For example,
sound
intensities
varying in the proportion
of 10  :  100  :  1000, cause aural effect in the ear
proportional
to the logarithms
of 10  : 100 : MO, that  is,_ 1,2 and 3.
The
unit for comparing
two noise levels is a  ‘ be1 ’  which is the logarithm
of the ratio of the two intensity levels.
For example, if the two noise
levels are represented
by 1, and Is, the ratio of the two levels expressed
inbelsis<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

measurement,

expressed in d-tcibcls is. therefore<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.2 The scale
of intensities
of audible
sound commonly
met with
covers a range of 130 db.
From the physiological
point of view, this
scale is not satisfactory
as the sensitivity
with regard to loudness
per-
ceived by the ear varies
with both the fr
uency and the intensity
of
sound.
Sounds

s. Taking into account the sensitivity
of the ear the more representative
unit  @  phon ’ is tried which represents
the level of equal loudness
at’ all frequencies.
Sound is measured
in
phons by comparing
it aurally with  a standard  pure-tone of a thousand
cycles per second adjustable
in intensity.
&rting
&om zero decibel,
that is the threshold
of audibility
(reference
sound pressure
of 09M 2
dynes/cd
),  the level of intensity
of sound of thousand
cycles tone is
adjusted
so as to be equally loud to the ear as a given noise.
The level
of  the noise in phons rs equivalent
numerically
to the intensity
level in
decibel of 1 000 cycles tone found to be equally
loud to the ear.
For
the sake of convenience
in practice, however,
all values are expressed in
decibels referred to threshold of audibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Air-Borne Noise -.  Air-borne
noise
may be transmitted
into an
enclosure
by:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Air vibration
through
doors, windows,
ventilators,
and venti-
lating
ducts, and other
openings,
holes and cracks;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Vibration
of
the structure
as a whole,
which
allows
trans-
mission of sound from one portion
of the building
to another.
It
is found
that
room
structure
or
large
portions
of
the
structure
such
as walls,
floors
and
the ceiling
vibrate
like
diaphragms
resulting
in the creation
of sound waves
on the
other side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.2  Impact Noise -
Impact
noise is generated
in solid structures
and
is transmitted
as air-borne
noise.
Noise
of footsteps,
slamming
of
doors,
etc,
cause
vibrations
in solid
materials
and are conveyed
over
comparatively
long distances.
Denser
the solid material,
more readily
does the sound travel
through
it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5  Transmission
Loss -
During
transmission
of air-borne
noise through
a structure
a reduction
in sound
intensity
takes
place.
This is termed
‘  Transmission
Loss  ’ (  TL)
and is numerically
equivalent
to the loss in
intensity
of sound
expressed
in decibels.
The
efficiency
of
sound
insulation
of a partition
is expressed
: A  terms of the transmission
loss
of air-borne
sound that occurs while sound is being transmitted
through
it.
Thus
if 80 db and 40 db are the sound
Ievels
measured
on either
side of a wall,
the transmission
loss or sound
insulation
of that
wall
is 80-40
= 40 db.
Sound insulation
offered
by a structure
depends
on
the
materials
used
and the method
of construction
employed.
fiis
value,
however,
varies
with
frequency
and
is
high
for
the
high
frequencies
and low for the medium
and
low frequencies.
Adequate
idea
of the
performance
of a partition
as a sound
insulator
cannot,
therefore,
be obtained
from the transmission
loss’at
one frequency.
In
practice
the average
of a number
of such values in the range of about
200 to 2 000 cycles per second gives an adequate
idea of noise reduction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Traflic Noise -
Most prevalent
and important
source of noise in the
residential

areas
is due to traffic
either
in
close vicinity
or at a distance.
The main types of traffic noises encoun-
tered are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) Noise due to  heavy trajk conditions,  such as those existing<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Industrial Area Noise -
These
are due to industries
in the area
and
related
traffic.
Generally
two distinct
conditions
of noise are obtained
in the industrial
area,
namely
where
a particular
industrial
noise may
be above
that
of the
background
traffic
noise,
and
where the
back-’
ground
noise,
usually
due to traffic,
may be above
the industrial
noise.
The overall
noise levels
range from about  60  to 80 db.
At night,
these
hoise
levels
are likely to be lower
by about
10 to 15 db because
of the
reduced
traffic.
In winter
and in cold regions,
a similar
noise reduction,
attributable
to windows
of the factories
being kept closed,
is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Residential Area Noise -These
are
usually
due
to
(a)
distant
industrial
or traffic
noises,
(b) local
traffic
noise,
(c) children

and
(d)
other
local
noises

<<HEADING level=3>>6. MEANS OF  ACHIEVING NOISE REDUCTION AND SOUND
INSULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Noise Reduction
6.1.1  By Suitable Location, Orientation in Luyout and Plan -  The most
obvious method
is to locate
the residential buildings in  a  quiet area
away from the noisy surroundings
like the industrial
area!,
railway
tracks, tramway
lines, aerodromes,
roads carrying
heavy
traffic,
etc.
They shall be adequately
set-off from the road and oriented
in such
a way that doors and windows do not face the source of ,noise.
In
case this is found not possible, double doors and windows shall be
provided to prevent leakage of sound.
Where
possible, the windows
and ventilators
may be eliminated
by providing artificial illumination
and mechanical ventilation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2  By Suitable Arrangement of Rooms within Residential Buildings -
The bed-rooms which are required to be quieter than the rest of the
rooms are best located in the portion farthest
from the noise source.
Noise reduction
is further attained
by separating
the bed-rooms from
other
rooms
where
noisy conditions
can be permitted
or tolerated.
Mechanical equipment required for various services shall not be located
above or close to the bedrooms
or other rooms required to provide
quiet condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3  By Suppressing Noise at the Source Itself-
Certain types of noise,
for example, the operation
of mechanical
equipment
in the building,
shall be suitably
isolated
or enclosed
in sound-insulated
enclosures
so that noise emanating from it is reduced to the  minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4 By Suppressing or Reducing Noise after its Entry into the Room -
The noises, where required could be further suppressed on entry into  a
room if some sound absorbent material is installed therein.
Provision of
special
material
may
not  be  warranted
in the case of residential
buildings;
however, the existence of furnishing material
in living and
bed rooms help to reduce noise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.5  By Reducing the Noise Transmitted Through the Structure-
Reduction
of air-borne
noise
through

the most  common<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:1950-I%2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and major  cause of  penetration
of noise into
a room.
requires
that
the
structure
should.be
made air-tight.
The smallest
crack or opening
would
vitiate
the effect of insulation
provided
otherwise.
Ventilating
ducts,
where installed,
should
be specially
designed
to minimize
transmission
of
noise.
In order
to prevent
the transmission
of noise through
vibration
of structure
as a whole,
designs
utilizing
materials
which
transmit
sound
less easily
than
others
may
be used;
the
construction
of the
wall
itself
is
important
in obtaining
the
desired
degree
of sound
insulation.
Discontinuous
or non-homogeneous
structures
may
also be
used to reduce
the transmission
of noise.
The transmission
of air-borne
noise may be most effectively
prevented
by employing
rigid
and massive
walls which do not have any openings
for ventilation
ducts, pipes, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reduction
of  ‘  impact
noise
requires
the
use
of discontinuous
or non-homogeneous
materials
in the construction
of the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  Sound Insulation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  Sound Insulation Values of Non-porous Rigid Partitions -
The  sound
insulation
of non-porous,
homogeneous
rigid constructions,
such
as well
plastered
solid
brick
masonry
walls,
varies
as the
logarithm
of the
weight
per
unit
area
and
would
thus
increase
with
the
thickness
of wall.
There
is, however,
a limit
beyond
which
it requires
an
excessive
increase
in
thickness
to produce
only
a small
increase
in
sound
insulation
(see
Table
VII ).
The
relation
between
the weight
of a rigid
partition
and
its sound
insulation
is approximately
such
that
every
time
the weight
is doubled,
there
is an
increase
in sound
insulation
of about
4 to 5 db.

Sound Insulation of Porous Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2.1
Porous rigid materials -
The
relation
between
weight
per
square
metre
and
the
sound
insulation
value
given
in
Table
VII
does not apply
in the case of porous
rigid
materials,
such
as porous
concrete
masonry,
cinder
concrete,
etc,
because
of
their
sound
absorptive
properties
which
provide
about
10 percent
higher
insulation
than
the non-porous
varrety
of the same
weight.
In order
to secure
the
best
insulation
from
such
porous
materials,
it is recommended
that
the
porous
partition
should
be
plastered
at least
on one
side
and
if possible
on both
the sides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2.2
Non-rigid or flexible porous materials -
These
are materials
such as felt,
mineral
wool,
quilt,
etc,
and they
by themselves
provide
low
sound
insulation
as
compared
to rigid
materials
and
therefore
they
are
not
generally
used
for the
purpose
of noise
reduction
and
isolation.
However,
a composite
construction
employing
a combination
of rigid materials
and
porous
absorbers
may
be adopted
where
weight
is an important
factor.
Such a construction
produces
better
insulation
per unit weight
of the partition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3
Hollow and Composite Wall Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3.1
Heavy weight construction -
Neither
the
non-porous
rigid
materials
nor the porous
materials
alone
provide
the desired
insulation
in a reasonable
thickness.
For
example,
about
100
cm
thick
wall
( 1 950
kg/m2 ) or about
85 cm
thick
rock
wool
( 80 kg/m3 density )
would
be required
to secure
an insulation
of about
60 db.
A double
wall construction
with
an intervening
air space
of 10 cm is however,
more
effective
than
a single
partrtron
of the
same
weight*.
The
use
of porous
rigid
materials
like
cinder
blocks
also
results
in less
pronounced
vibrations
than with the use of non-porous
rigid
materials
in addition
to
the
advantage
of sound
absorption
provided
by the
hollow
space.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3.2
Light weight construction --  For
light
weight
construction
a
variety
of
materials
such
as
metal
lath
and
plaster,
fibreboards,
plywood,
plasterboards,
etc,
fixed
on
studs
may
be employed.
For
equal
weight
these
provide
greater
insulation
than
solid
masonry.
Tests
conducted
on such
partttions
have shown
that
sound
is mainly
transmitted
through
the
studs
and
very
little
through
air
space.

TYPICAL SECTIONAL PLAN OF A SOUND PROOF PARTITION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3.3
Filling
of hollow spaces
in partition-The
Ming
of hollow
space
with
acoustic
materials
like
rock
wool
or
glass-wool
which
absorbs
sound
more
effectively
than
air,
does
not
always
produce
satisfactory
results
as
the
filler
may
form
a bridge
across
the
two
partitions
and
thereby
considerably
reduce
the insulation.
Air space
is generally
better
than
a filling
material
unless
the acoustic
material
is in the
form
of a quilt
or an  insulation
board,
suspended
or fixed
to one
side only of a staggered
stud partition
with no rigid
or even
semi-rigid
connection
to the
other
side.
This
arrangement
effects
considerable
increase
in the
insulation
value.
In
the case of hollow
light
weight
partitions,
which
may not be structurally
separated,
the
acoustic
filler helps to increase
the insulation
only slightly
and therefore
may not be worth the additional
expenditure
involved
on the filler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3.4
Composite
wall -
Composite
walls of laminated
construction
may be designed
to obtain
any sound  insulation
desired;
the maximum
value is obtained
when all the layers of alternate
porous and rigid mate-
rials are separated
by an air space in which
case the value
approaches
approximately
the
sum
of the
values
of
individual
units.
Such
a
construction,
however,
occupies
.more
space
and
needs
great
care
in
installation
in order
to obtain
the anticipated
efficiency.
Use of such
composite
walls
may
be required
in special
cases
where
high
sound
insulation
is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4
Extent
of Insulation
Required-
As
a general
rule
in
practrce
reduction
of noise requires
to be carried
to a level of about
10 to 15 db
below
the
prevailing
inherent
noise
level
in the
surroundings.
For
example,
if ambient
noise
level in a certain
room is, say,
60 db it is
satisfactory
if adequate
sound insulation
is provided
so that
no outside
noise reaches
inside the room above 45 to 50 db.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_17>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ts:l!m-1962<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.4.1  The
desired
sound
insulation
may
be achieved
in any one
or more of the following
three ways:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) By adopting
a continuous
construction
by using
homogeneous
materials
where
the extent
of sound
insulation
is controlled
by
the
weight
per
square
metre.
Where
the
requirements
are
not relatively
stringent
and are of the order of 50 db, solid cons-
truction
of 20 cm to 30 cm bricks is considered
suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) By adopting
semi-discontinuous
construction
where
air
cavities
are employed
with
cross-connections
between
the two partitions,
the cross-connections
being
kept
as few as possible
and
made
preferably
of a flexible
material.
For
example,
two
10 cm
thick
brick
wall
will
provide
90
db,
provided
adequate
discontinuity
is maintained
between
the floor and
the
wall
and
the ceiling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) By adopting
a fully discontinuous
construction
where
complete
discontinuity
in the
structure
is introduced
by means
of an
air cavity
or an elastic
acoustic
material.
This
method
would
meet
the requirements
of the highest
insulation
required
within
reasonable
weight
per square
metre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.S  Overall Insulation -
In providing
sound
insulation
in any
room
the
question
of
overall
sound
insulation
should
be
considered.
Some areas, like sound-proof
doors,
windows,
etc, may provide
insulation
lower
than
that
of the other
surfaces
and
thus
would
adversely
effect
the
overall
insulation.
All
the
areas
should,
therefore,
be
designed
and
constructed
to provide
sound
insulation
approximating
to
the
desired
overall
value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.6  Classification of Partitions -

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.9 Sound Insulation of -Floors and Ceilings -
Both
air-borne
and
structure-borne
sounds may be transmitted
through
floors
and ceilings.
In most of the cases where the ceilings
and floor construction
is of solid
type like cement
concrete
these have sufficient
weight and rigidity
to pro-
vide adequate
insulation
fo; air-borne
sounds,
but offer poor
insulation
for structure-borne
or impact
sounds.
Insulation
against
impact
sounds
may be done in the following
three ways:
a)  By using a resilient surface material on floors -
This
helps
to
damp the impact
noises,
but has no appreciable
effect
on air-
borne
sounds.
Linoleum,
insulation
board,
cork,
asphalt
mastic and carpet
are some of the materials
usualIy
employed;
the softer
the material
used,
greater
is the insulation
effected.
An insulation
of 5 to 10 db over a bare concrete
floor is obtained
with such material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)  By providing a floating floor construction<<HEADING_END>>

5 cm thickness
which
is poured
over
a resilient

It is important
that

both

CONCRETE FLOOR FLOATING CONSTRWTION
Wooden floors  -.In
the case of floors constructed
of wooden
joists
the
problem
of
sound
insulation
becomes
more
difficult
particularly
in the
presence
of heavy
mechanical
impact
sounds.
Sketches
in
Fig.
4
show
methods
of
insulating
such floors employing
mineral
or glass-wool
quilt
for isolation
purposes.
Resilient
mountings
may be used to
obtain
even more satisfactory
results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A further
improvement
in the insulation
of such
floors
is
achieved
by
employing
a  ’  pugging  ’  or
a  ‘  deadening
’
material
in the air
space
between
the
wooden
joists
(see
Fig. 4 and 5 ).
Either
sound absorbent
type
materials
like
mmeral
wool
or other
materials
like sand or ashes, may be
used; the latter
are more effective
because
of the fact
that
the
efficiency
of the  ‘  pugging  ’  depends
‘on
the weight of
the material
used.
In order to obtain
useful
improvement,
at least
100 kg/m2 of sand  ‘  pugging  ’  is usually
employed.
Mineral
wool pugging
(at
least
15 kg/m2)
is used
mainly
in conjunction
with thin walls of 10 cm thickness
or less.
By  using a  suspended
ceiling
with air space-
This
helps
to
improve
the insulation
of both
air-borne
and structure-borne
sounds
by
attenuating
and
isolating
them
from
the
room
below.

provides
increasing
degree
of
insulation.
For
solid
floors,
metal
hangers
or acoustic
clips
may be used to support
the ceiling
below,
as shown in Fig.
6D.
The
extent
of improvement
effected
depends
on the weight of
the ceiling
as well as on the structural
rigidity
with
which
it
is connected
to the
solid
or wooden
floor.
Thus
the highest
insulation
could be achieved
by using a heavy
ceiling
which
is
arranged
to be independent
of the
floor  by supporting
it on
resilient
mountings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In
cases
of very
heavy
