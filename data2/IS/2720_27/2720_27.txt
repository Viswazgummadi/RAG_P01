FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part XXVII
) ( First
Revision
) was adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
30
December
1977,
after the
draft
finalized
by
the
Soil
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establish
uniform
procedures
for the determination
of
different
characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating
comparative
studies
of the results, the Indian
Standards
Institution
is bringing
out this Indian
Standard
Methods
of test for soils ( IS  :  2720 ) which
is being
published
in
parts.
This
part
[IS  :  2720
( Part
XXVII)-19771
deals
with
the
method
for the determination
of total
soluble
sulphates
in soils.
Sodium
sulphate
is present
in some
Indian
soils.
The salt is easily hydrated
and
dehydrated
under the influence
of climatic
changes.
There
are enormous
volume
changes
during
this process
of hydration
and dehydration,
which
influence
the engineering
properties
of soils.
Both soluble sulphate
content
and moisture
content
of soil are subject
to seasonal
fluctuations
and are
mutually
interdependent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
This
standard
was first
published
in
1968.
In
this revision
a
calorimetric
or turbidimetric
method,
which
is a rapid
method
has been
added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in  different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.
This has been met by basing
the standard
on the following
publication:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

for determin-

(b) volumetric method, and (c) calorimetric

shall be used in tests.
‘  Pure chemicals  ’  shall mean chemicals that do not
contain impurities which affect the results of analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Soil Sample-The
soil sample shall be brought
to a state in which
it may be crumbled,
if necessary,
by drying
it in an oven maintained
at
105  to 110°C.
The
aggregations
of particles
shall be broken up in mortar
with rubber
covered pestle or the mechanical
device.
The sample shall be
thoroughly
mixed and then sub-divided
by quartering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4
Principle
of the Method
-
The method
depends upon preparing
an
aqueous
extract
of the soil and determining
the sulphate
content
of this
extract
or
an
aliquot
portion
of it by the precipitation
of sulphate
as
barium
sulphate,
filtering off the precipitate
and weighing
it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Procedure
-Take
10 g of soil from
the sample
prepared
as given
in 2.3,
in a 250-ml
bottle with 100 ml of distilled water.
Give occasional
shaking
for 2 h by
means
of the
mechanical
shaker.
Allow
the soil
suspension
to stand overnight
( in case the soil is in a dispersed
condition,
add
O-5 to
1.0 g of pure potassium
nitrate
to flocculate
the particles ).
Filter and take 25 ml of filtrate in a beaker
and add concentrated
hydro-
chloric
acid
to just
neutralize
the
solution
if it is found
alkaline
to
phenolphthalein
indicator.
Add further
4 ml concentrated
hydrochloric
acid to make
the solution acidic.
Boil the solution.
Remove
the solution
from the source
of heat
and add hot barium
chloride
solution
in a fine
stream with constant
stirring,
till there
is no precipitation
with a further
addition.
Place the beaker on a steam-bath
for a minimum
period
of 4 h
and allow the precipitate
to settle.
Filter
the precipitate
through
ashless
filter paper,
wash free from chloride
ions ( see Note ), dry and ignite.
The
filteration
may also be done through
a preweighed
sintered
glass crucible
or a Gooch
crucible.
In the case of filter paper, after drying,
ashing
shall
be done on a low flame and the precipitate
then ignited
over a burner
or
in
a  muffle
furnace
at 600
to
700°C
for half
an
hour.
Cool
in
a
desiccator,
weigh
and note the weight of the residue.
This
is the weight
of barium
sulphate.
A corresponding
weight of sodium sulphate should be
calculated
and thus its percentage
determined
( see 2.6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  -To
check whether the residue is free of chloride ions, collect the washings
in a separate test-tube at different time intervals and add a drop of O-5 percent silver
nitrate solution to it.
The formation of white cloudy precipitate shows the presence of
chloride ions in the precipitate.
Continue washing until the white precipitate is not
formed in the washings by the addition of silver nitrate solution.
Hot water may be
used for washing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

( SUBSIDIARY

)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
Principle
-
The volumetric
method
depends
upon insol&e
barium
sulphate
forming
and settling
rapidly
when barium
chloride-. solution
is
added to the sulphate
solution.
The barium
chloride
reagent
is added
in
excess
and the excess is determined
by the standard
solutjpn
of
barium
chromate.
With the formation
of potassium
chromate,
the,slight
excess
of
chromate
reagent
becomes
evident
from the resultant
yell w colour of the
supernatent
solution.
f
The end point can be further
tested1 ( confirmed
) by
silver nitrate
solution
used as an external
indicator.
A b+ck

a drop of silver nitrate
is added’to

Whatman’s
No. 42 filter paper
or
equivalent.
Take
10 or 20 ml aliquot and transfer
to  a  25-ml
volumetric
flask.
Add
1 g of barium
chloride
crystals
(ground
to pass 50?-micron
IS sieve and to be retained
on 250-micron
IS sieve ) to the aliquot
in the
flask and shake
for  1  minute.
Add
1 or 2 ml of 25 percent
gum acatia,
Pour distilled
water
up to the mark
of volumetric
flask and shake for a
minute.
Precipitate
the suspension
and take the reading
between 5 to 30
minutes
after precipitation
either
by photoelectric
calorimeter
using blue
filter
or by turbidimeter.
Sulphate
is  then determined
by the standard
sulphate
curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

stock solution
with alcoholic
( N)
ammonium

to give 0’06 mg Sod/ml.
Take
2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ml of this to give a range of 0.12 -
