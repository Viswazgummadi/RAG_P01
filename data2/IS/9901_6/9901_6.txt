PROCEDURE

EVALUATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Generation
of Sound Field<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  The
impact
sound
shall
be generated
by the tapping
machine
( see  3 ).
The position
of the tapping
machine
shall
be
in
accordance
with
5.5.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Measurement
of Impact
Sound Pressure
Level<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1  The impact
sound pressure
level in the receiving
room should
be
an average
over space and time.
This
average
may be obtained
by using
a number
of fixed
microphone
positions
of a
continuously
moving
microphone
with an integration
of pa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2
The
indicating
device
should
be
designed
to
determine
rms
values of the sound pressure
or corresponding
pressure
levels.
If a sound
level
meter
is used,
it should
conform
to IS  :  9779-1981”
for precision
sound level meters.
It is recommended
to use the meter
response
‘slow’.
The
complete
measuring
system
including
the
microphone
shall
be
calibrated
before
each
series
of measurements
to
absolute
values
for
measurements
in diffuse sound fields.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3
When
in
any
frequency
band
the
sound
pressure
level in the
receiving
room is less than
10 dB above the
background
level,
then
the
background
level
should
be
measured
just
before and after the deter-
mination
of sound pressure
level due to the sound
source
and a correc-
tion as given in Table
2 shall be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4
The above corrections,
if any, are to be made
to the
individual
readings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5
If the
difference
is less
then
3 dB,
that
is, the impact
sound
pressure
level
is less than
the background
level, a precise
value of the
impact
sound pressure
level cannot
be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.6
In
cases where
the
impact
insulation
is high,
relative
to the
airborne
sound insulation,
the airborne
sound pressure
level produced
in
the
source
room
by
the tapping
machine
may
be transmitted
to
the
receiving
room at a higher
level than the transmitted
impact
sounds.

In the case of an

con-
struction
( ribs,
beams,

may be necessary.
Besides,
the
hammer
connection
line should be orientated
at 45” to the direction
of the beams
or ribs.
The
distance
of the
tapping

from
the
edges of the floor should
be at least 0.5 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EXAMPLE
OF TEST
PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-l.
An example
of a test procedure
which
will
normally
be
expected
to give satisfactory
repeatability
is given below.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.
Where
the receiving
room is substantially
rectangular
with a volume
of about 50 ma it will contain
at least three
randomly
orientated
diffus-
ing
elements
or
an equivalent
area of rotating
vane, the former
having
a typical
edge
length
of 1.2 m
each.
The
diffusers
should
not
be
suspended
from the ceiling
under test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.
Six
positions
of the
tapping
machine
are chosen randomly
distri-
buted on a rigid floor, no position
being closer
than
I.0 m to its edges.
For
each
tapping
machine
position,
one
of six
randomly
distributed
microphone
positions
is chosen
in the receiving
room.
No
microphone
position
should
be
nearer
than
0.7 m to
the
room
boundaries
or
diffusers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.
The
readings
of sound
pressure
level are taken using an averaging
time of 5 s in each frequency
band at each position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_13>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  9901( Part VI ) - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.  As an alternative,
the sound field sampling procedure can be carried
out using a rotating microphone
device having a sweep radius
between
1 m and
I.5
m.
In this case the plane
of the traverse is inclined in
relation to the room boundaries and the device
should have an averag-
ing time equal to the traverse time, which should be a minimum of 30  S.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-6.  The equivalent absorption area should be determined from readings
taken using three
microphones
positions
with two reverberation
time
analyses at each position.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>MEASURING
OF FLANKING
TRANSMISSION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.
In
case the flanking
transmission
has to be investigated,
this may
be done by measuring the average
velocity
levels of the specimen
and
the flanking
surfaces
in the receiving
room.
The
average
surface
velocity
level  Lv  of a specimen
in decibels is ten times the common
logarithm
of the ratio of the average of the mean square normal
surface
velocity of the specimen to the square of the reference velocity:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

surface
velocities
at n
different positions on the wall or ceiling, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>vo
=
5  x  IO-8  m.s-r is the reference
velocity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.
The vibration transducer used should Abe well attached to the surface
and its mass impedance
should be sufficiently
low compared
with the
point impedance
of the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.
If the critical
frequency
of the specimen
or the flanking objects is
low compared
with the frequency
range
of interest,
the
power
wk
radiated
from
a particular
element  k  with area
Sk in the receiving
room may be estimated from the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>wk =  PC skulk Ok.................
