<<HEADING level=3>>Safety in Construction,
Operation
and Maintenance
of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee,
RVD 21<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by
the Safety
in Construction,
Operation
and Maintenance
of River
Valley Projects
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With large scale increase in construction
activity of river valley projects,
the number
of major
accidents have increased.
The degree of safety achieved
in project
constructions
has a direct
bearing on the amount of effort expended to avoid accidents by those who control
the conditions
and practices on the project.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are a number of aspects that need to be kept in mind when the safety
norms
of an entire
river valley project are envisaged.
To this end, various aspects that
need consideration,
from the
viewpoint of safety, are dealt with in various parts of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers the safety aspects to be kept in view durin g usage of plant and machinery.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various machinery,
plants and other mechanized
equipment play a vital role in the construction,
operation
and maintenance
of river valley projects.
Safety of the plants
and machinery
used and
installed is an important
and essential part of planning as no other segment of the project will pay
greate~r dividends with minimum investment than a good safety programme.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inadequate
safety measures in respect of plant and machinery
can result,
besides
others,
in the
following mishaps:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Loss of human lives;
b) Temporary
or permanent
injury to workers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C)  Loss or damage to equipment;
d) Loss of material; and
e) Loss -of valuable time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The guidelines
given in this standard
are generalized
and indicative in nature, given for the
guidance of the concerned
project engineers.
Each project may have its own safety hazards which
need to be identified and taken care of accordingly.
Further,
in addition to these general guidelines
the instructions
issued by the suppliers of various equipment
should be strictly adhered to.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

he should
be properly
screened for the job
he is likely to
be entrusted.
Thorough
checking and screening
at the time of appointment
