Sectional
Committee,
CED 4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Building
Limes and Lime Products Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
is being formulated
to provide
guidance
to the users in the handling
and storage of building
limes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All building
limes as defined
in
this standard
are caustic alkalis in the presence
of water and can
cause
chemical
burns to the skin.
In addition,
when quicklime
comes into contact with water a chemical
reaction
occurs
which
generates
a considerable
amount
of heat.
This reaction
often occurs
very rapidly
and can
be vigorous
in character.
The most violent reactions
occur if quicklime
is added to water without
stirring
to dissipate
the heat generated,
resulting
in severe splasing
of hot lime slurry which can cause heat burns
to the skin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All huilding
limes need to be handled
with caution
and necessary
protective
measures
should
be taken to
minimize
the possibility
of discomfort
or accident
when handling
building
limes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In all cases, prevention
or adcluate
control of exposure
should be achieved
by measures
other than personal
protective
equipment,
so far as is reasonably
practicable,
in the light of the degree of exposure,
circumstances
of use of the substance,
informed
knowledge
about
its hazards
and current
technical
developments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of the technical

cases of contamination,
the person
should
receive
immediate
medical

<<PARAGRAPH>>The eyes are particulary
vulnerable

<<PARAGRAPH>>Especially
in warmer
weather,
the shaven
parts of
the face and neck are liable to be irritated by building
lime dust.
These parts should be protected
with a
barrier cream.
A cloth worn around the neck will
give additional
protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Storage
of Hydrated
Lime in Bags<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
Hydrated
lime
normally
contains
less than
I  percent
of free moisture
when manufactured
and
this wilt not rise above this level when stored within
the normal
range of relative
humidity.
However,
it
absorbs carbon dioxide
from the air and the rate of
deterioration
due to this cause is dependent
upon the
amount
of air passing
through
the store.
Ii air
movement
is reduced
to a practical
minimum,
hydrated
lime can be stored for up to six months
without appreciable
change.
For this reason hydrated<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Hands,
Arms
and Wrists<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hands should be protected by gloves with a tight
fitting wristband
conforming
to IS 4148:3989.
Any
exposed
parts of the arms, hands and wrists should
bc protected
with barrier

<<PARAGRAPH>>lime should be stored under cover in a cool dry place
with minimum
of air movement
and exposure

<<PARAGRAPH>>chemicals with-which it might react. Since this product
is fully hydrated,
no heat is evolved
when water is
added to it, and there is, therefore, no fire risk during
storage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
The  ideal store is a brick or concrete building
with
a concrete
floor,
or a similar
construction
designed
to eliminate
draughts
through
walls, floor
and roof.
The store should not be heated, since this
would
create draughts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2
Storage
of Quicklime
in Bags<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1
The storage conditions
described
for hydrated
lime are applicable to quicklime also. Quicklime should
be stored to avoid any accidental
contact with water
which could enter the bags, for instance,
at the point
where they are sealed after packing.
Since the product
is not hydrated, any water entering the bags will cause
expansion
up to 2.5 times and the heat generated may
cause a fire. Therefore, quicklime should not be stored
with, or close to, flammable
materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3  Bags of hydrated lime should be stored flat and
away from walls if condensation
or moisture
on the
walls is likely to occur.
Care must be taken to ensure
that stocks are rotated as very old stock will eventually
deteriorate
to the point of being unsuitable
for many
applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 Quicklime
may be stored in plastic bags under
good storage conditions
for up to three months without
significant
deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>51.4
If hydrated
lime
is stored,
temporarily
or
otherwise,
in a general
store, care should be taken
to ensure that it does not come into contact with other<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
