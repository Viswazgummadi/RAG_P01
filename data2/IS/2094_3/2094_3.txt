<<PARAGRAPH>>Construction Plant and Machinery Sectional Committee, HMD 18<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 3) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Construction Plant and Machinery Sectional Committee, had been approved by
the Heavy Mechanical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Construction Plant and Machinery Sectional Committee had published the following Indian
Standards:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 2093 : 1974
Specification for distributors for hot tar and bitumen (  first revision  )
IS 2094 : 1996
Heaters for bitumen (tar) and emulsion — Specification (  second revision  )
IS 4198 : 1967
Specification for emulsion spraying machine for roads<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The above standards are related to the same subject and, therefore, the Sectional Committee while
revising IS 2093 and IS 4198 decided that the revision of these standards be made as Part 2 and
Part 3 respectively of IS 2094 and the existing IS 2094 : 1996 be treated as Part 1 of IS 2094. As
per the decision, the standards now covered under IS 2094 shall be as under:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 2094 (Part 1)
Heater for bitumen (tar) and emulsion — Specification : Part 1 Bitumen
heaters
IS 2094 (Part 2)
Heaters for bitumen (tar) and emulsion — Specification : Part 2 Bitumen
sprayers
IS 2094 (Part 3)
Heaters for bitumen (tar) and emulsion — Specification : Part 3 Emulsion<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Further, it was decided to withdraw the standards IS 2093 and IS 4198.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Distributors and sprayers for tar, bitumen and bitumen emulsion are key items of equipment in
the pavement construction work, such as grouting, surface dressing and tack coats. The essential
function of mechanical sprayers is to apply the binder evenly to a sprayer in accurately measured
quantities and to continue to do so during the application of entire load irrespective of change of
gradient and direction. Very accurate and even distribution of emulsion may not be possible with
hand-sprayers, although reasonably uniform results may be obtained with such sprayers by proper
control and supervision. This standard covering hand-sprayers and mechanical sprayers for
bitumen emulsion has been prepared with a view to assisting the users in obtaining sprayers
capable of distributing emulsions uniformly to the specified standard and having satisfactory
mechanical efficiency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard includes a number of requirements which are at the option of the purchaser. For the
sake of convenience to the purchaser and the supplier, requirements to be specified by the
purchaser while making an enquiry or placing an order for emulsion sprayers have also been listed
in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to International Standards and
practices prevailing in different countries and also practices in this field in our country. This
standard has taken considerable assistance from BS : 3136-1959 ‘Emulsion spraying machines for
roads’, issued by the British Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (March 2000). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.3  The sprayer is backed into position with
the spray-bar over the catch tank, precaution
being taken to see the spray-bar is horizontal
and at right angles to the rails. The trolley and
containers rest on the rails clear of the spray
hood. A short preliminary spray is made to
ensure that all nozzles are functioning and the
sprayer is otherwise in normal working
condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-1.2  Spraying machines are tested with those
grades of emulsion for which they are to be
used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-2 DEPOT TRAY TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.1  The apparatus consists of a wheeled
trolley carrying a set of removable containers.
Each container is 5 cm wide, 0.9 m long and
15 cm deep, made of 0.900 mm thick mild steel
sheet, and of approximately 7 litres capacity.
The containers extend to a width 15 cm greater
than the full spray width of the sprayer,
therebeing six containers in 30 cm of spray
width. The rim of each container is lipped on
one side in order that the containers will
overlap and prevent binder from escaping.
Before each test, the containers are examined
for damage likely to affect results and are
replaced, if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.4  The trolley and containers are then
pushed underneath the sprayer and spraying is
commenced, and maintained for a period of
time sufficient almost to fill the containers. The
trolley is then withdrawn to the previous
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.5  The depth of binder in each container is
measured by dipping with a steel rule
graduated in millimetres. Each container is
dipped in the same position, a convenient place
being about 30 cm from one end. Dipping is to
commence when the froth has settled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.2  The trolley runs on steel rails fastened to
the top of 1 350 litre catch tank (2.9 + 0.9 +
0.6 m) the rails being horizontal and parallel to
the sides of the tank and sufficiently long to
allow the trolley to lie clear of the spray before
the test. The top rim of each container, when
fitted on the trolley, is parallel to the rails and
the same distance below the nozzles or
distributing gear as of the road surface under
normal working conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.5.1  If dips can be read with the ruler in
position, the ruler is wetted with paraffin to
give a flat meniscus, alternatively, if the ruler
has to be withdrawn in order to read off the tip,
it is dampened with soft soap solution to ensure
a clear line of demarcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
