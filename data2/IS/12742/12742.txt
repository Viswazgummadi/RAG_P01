<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 31 October
1989, after the
draft
tinalized
by the
Water
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Chemical Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All waters available in nature are contaminated,
in one way or the other, and invariably require treat-
ment before supply to users.
In the perspective of the concern of the Government
of lndia to ensure
supply of safe quality potable water to all citizens, more so the rural communities, added
significance
attaches to the techniques of water treatment of removal of various contaminants
including
fluorides.
Of course, the fluorides are beneficial if present in concentration
of 0’6 to 1’2 mg/l, but are hazardous
if their concentration
is in excess of 1’5 mg/l.
There are
two methods
of treatment
for fluoride
removal, namely, chemical treatment and ion exchange process.
Chemical treatment method
covered
herein is based on Nalgonda technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4 MECHANISM
OF DEFLUORIDATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The chemical method for the removal of cx-
cessive fluorides at domestic and community levels
involves precipitation
by aluminium
salts.
This
process is recommended when fluoride content
of
raw..water ranges from 1’5 to 20 mg/l. Aluminium
in the alum salts when added to
water is hydro-
Iizedmin the presence
of natural alkalinity.
The
extent of hydrolysis
is dependent on pH.
The
products are called
polyhydroxy
alumino
com-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 Simultaneous
disinfection
is
achieved
with
bleaching
powder
which also
keeps
the system
free
from undesirable
biological
growths.
4.2.3 Sedimentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Permits settleable floe loaded with fluorides, turbi-
dity, bacteria, and other impurities to be deposited

<<PARAGRAPH>>Site specific data especially with regard to existing
facilities, structure like overhead tanks, or sump
wells and mode of water distribution will override
the design consideration.
The unit comprises a
cylindrical tank of 10 m3 capacity
with dished
bottom, and equipped with inlet, outlet and sludge
drain.
The stability of cylindrical tank has to be
ensured.
Each tank is fitted with an agitator
assembly
consisting of  :  (a)  three phase electric
motor, and (b)~gear box ,with reduction ratio 60  :  1
to attain an output speed of 20 to 25 rpm,
com-
plete with downward shaft to hold, the agitator
paddles. The agitator is fixed to the bottom of the
vessel by sturdy, suitable stainless steel supporting
bushings.
The scheme comprises tanks of 10 m”
capacity
each, a sump well
and an overhead
reservior.
A system with two units in parallel for
treating water for a population of 1 500 at the rate
of 40 lpcd is shown
in Fig. 1. Raw water is
pumped into the units ‘and treated by chemical

of, Units for Population of 500
to 5 000
Based on the design consideration
given earlier,
the sizes of all the units, namely, overhead tank,
channel mixer, pebble bed flocculator,
sedimenta-
tion tank, sand filter and underground
treated
storage water tank are given in Table 1. The
sizes of the alum and lime tanks are given in
Table 2.
Table 3 indicates the alum requirements
at various alkalinity and fluoride levels, Engineer-
ing details for water treatment are shown in Fig. 2
~for population of 500, 1 000, 2 000 and 5 000.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The filtered water is stored in ‘filtered water
sump’.
The supply hours are also assumed
to be the same as raw water pumping hours
that is 2 hours supply in the morning and
2 hours supply in the afternoon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4  In order to avoid cost for extra overhead
service reservoir
for filtered water,
it is
presumed that filtered water from the sump
will be directly
pumped in the distribution
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Sludge-Water and Alum Recovery<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An example has been worked out for a population
of 500 persons to determine
the total quantity of
water to be supplied:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sedimentation
tanks should be desludged on
alternate days for five minutes.
The total loss of
water in desludging amounts to 1’0 -
1’5 percent
of. the total water
quantity
pumped
into the
treatment plant. This can be reduced considerably
in community
plants by making
provision
for
sludge concentration
well and drying beds. Water
and alum is recovered
from the
sludge.
The
recovered
alum can be used for purposes other
than
defluoridation.
The
fluoride ( as F ) in
recovered alum is 8 to 10 g per kg alum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
