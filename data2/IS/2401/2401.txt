<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
(First Revision)
was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 16 February 1973, after the draft finalized by the
Sanitary Appliances and Water Fittings Sectional
Committee
had been
approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Water meters being available
in many designs with different
end-
connections and varying flow characteristics,
due consideration
will have to
be given when selecting any one type of meter for a particular
situation.
Besides the proper selection, they have to be properly installed so that they
may give desired duty in service. without involving frequent repairs and
costly maintenance.
This standard was first published
in 1963 to give
useful guidance to consumers and water supply authorities
in the use of
water meters and the first revision of the standard has been prepared to
incorporate
certain
changes found
necessary
during the usage of the
standard.
A recommended
period for testing of water meters has been
incorporated
for guidance of users and testing authorities.
A stop valve
and a non-return valve have been recommended
for inclusion while instal-
ling water ‘meters. Recommendations
made in this Code may not, however,
meet all the situations that arise in practice and necessary deviations from
the provisions of this Code may have to be made in certain cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of this
standard has taken into consideration
the views of municipalities, municipal
corporations, manufacturers
and technologists
and has related the standard
to the practices of Grstallation of water meters followed in the country
in this field.
Due weightage has also been given to the need for inter-
national co-ordination
among standards prevailing in different countries of
the world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard contains clause 3.4 which calls for an agreement between
the purchaser and the supplier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This code covers the selection,
installation
and maintenance
of inferen-
tin1 and stmi-positive
water meters conforming
to IS  :  779-1968’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. SELECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Water
meters
shall
be selected
according
to flow
to be measured
and
not necessarily
to suit a certain
size of main.
shall govern
the seiection
of meters:
The following
points<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The maximum
flow shall
not
exceed
the
nominal
capacity
of
the meter
specified
in IS: 779-1968*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The continuous
flow shall
be not greater
than
the continuous
running
capacity
rating
specified
in IS  :  779-1968*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The
minimum
flow to be measured
shall
be within
minimum
starting
flows specified
in IS  :  779-1968*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1 Inferential
water meter has the same accuracy
as the semi-positive
type at higher flows; it passes
unfiltered
water
better
than
a semi-positive
meter
and
is lower in cost.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Special
care is necessary
in selecting
the most
suitable
meter
where
large
rates
of flow may
exist
for
short periods.
The normal
working
flow shall
be well
within
the
continuous
running
capacity
specified
in
IS : 779-1968*,
as high rates of flow over short period
may cause excessive
wear if the meter chosen
is too small for the duty.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Owing
to the fine
clearances
in the
working
parts
of meters,
they
are not suitable
for measuring
water
containing
sand or
similar
foreign
matter,
and in such cases a filter or dirt
box of adequate
effective
area
shall be fitted on the upstream
side of the meter
( see Fig. 1 ). It should
be
noted
that the normal
strainer
fitted
inside
a meter
is not
a filter
and
does not prevent
the entry of small particles,
such as sand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. INSTALLATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 A meter shall not be run with free discharge
to atmosphere,
if the static
pressure
on the
main
exceeds
10 m head
of water,
otherwise
the mete1
is liable to be overloaded
and damaged.
For hose connections
and similar
applications,
there
shall
always
be some
resistance
on the downstream
side of the meter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 A meter
shall
be located
where
it is not liable
to get
severe
shock
of water hammer,
which might break
the piston
or damage
the rotor,
and
the position
shall be such that it is always
full of water;

<<PARAGRAPH>>mc~hod of making
connection
to achieve
the purpose
is shown in
Fig. 1. If the meter body or adjacent pipes become partially drained of
water, the accumulated
air, when passed through
the meter, is registered
as water. and may cause inaccuracies and perhaps damage.
The inaccu-
racies may be more pronounced in the case of inferential meters.
In such
situations suitable devices likeair-release
valve may be fittedon the upstream
side of the meter.
In the case of intermittent
water supply system,
where there are frequent changes of air locks, the piston of the semi-
positive meter often breaks. In such a case, it is advisable to ensure that the
top of the meter is below the level of the communication
pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Semi-positive
meters may be fixed in any position,
with the dials
facing upwards or sideways, and they may be installed in horizontal
or
vertical pipe runs without affecting wearing properties of accuracy at normal
service flows.
Where backward flows are anticipated,
reflux valves are
recommended
to be provided.
A stop valve should be provided on the
upstream side as shown in Fig. 1 to isolate the meter whenever necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Inferential
meters
shall be installed in position
for which they are
designed; in the case of meters conforming
to IS  :  779-1968*, they shall be
placed horizontally with dial facing upwards.
However, where meters are
to be installed in vertical pipe lines, details shall be as agreed to between the
manufacturer
and the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 Turbulent flow of water affects the accuracy of the meter.
There shall,
therefore,
be straight
lengths of pipes upstream
and downstream
of
meter for an equivalent length of ten times the nominal diameter of the
pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6 Meters liable to damage by frost shall be suitably protected.
It is
possible to incorporate
frost protection devices in certain types of meters, if
ordered.
Several devices are adopted, the most common among them being
a collapsible metal ring which, under frost pressure, allows the top plate
carrying the mechanism to lift and thus safeguard the body, or a metal disc
in the body which gives way under pressure.
These devices have the
following disadvantages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The damaged ring or plate requires immediate
replacement
in
order to stop wastage and restore water supply to consumer;
b) Water runs to waste till the meter
is attended
to,
which
means loss of revenue; and
c) Damage is discovered
only after thawing has started.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.1 A more satisfactory
arrangement
consists of a method
whereby
the proportionate
increase in bulk of ice, which is approximately
14
percent,
is accommodated
by the provision
of pads of special quality
expanded natural rubber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

revision).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2401- 1973<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.2 No  arrangement,
however,
is regarded
completely
satisfactory,
and for this reason, the general practice is to install meters well out of
the way of frost.
Meters should be fixed below ground level if they are
located outside the building or, if in exposed portion inside the building,
the bodies of the meters should be protected with some form of lagging; in
the case of meters installed below ground, depth at which the meter should
be fixed to afford frost protection will depend on the nature of the soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7 Before installing a meter, the section of line to be metered shall be
thoroughly
flushed to remove all foreign matter and, when starting up,
control
valves shall be opened slowly until the line is full, as a sudden
discharge may damage the meter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8 Water meters may be installed underground,
either in the carriage way
outside the premises or at a convenient place within the premises.
In order
to enable the meters to be accessible for periodical reading, inspection,
testing and repairs, they shall be housed in water meter boxes conforming to
IS  :  2104-1962*.
Top of the meter box shall be placed at a slightly higher
level than
the surrounding
ground level so as to prevent ground
water
entering in and flooding the chamber during rains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8.1 If it is required to be located in a private passage leading to the
premises, proper precautions shall be taken consistent with safety.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9 The meters and connecting
pipes shall be strongly
supported
for
protection of the meters and to avoid noisy vibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. MAINTENANCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Periodic
Testing
of Water Meters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  The period over which water meters retain their overall accuracy
depends largely on the quality of water being measured and to a certain
extent on other factors which cause excessive wear or inaccurate registration.
The only way to determine whether any specific meter is operating efficiently
is to test it and the meter maintenance programme should aim at establish-
ing the frequency for testing every meter in service.
From an individual
customer’s
viewpoint,
meters should be tested to protect
him against
meter inaccuracy
that could result in over charges, while from the point
of view of the water undertaking,
it should be to protect the -under-
taking
against
the revenue
loss from
under
registration
by meters.
No definite recommendations
could be given in this regard as _the economic
results depend on such factors as the rates charged for water, the effect
of water of different
quality
on meters,
local conditions
under which
they operate and the cost of removal, testing, repairing and re-installation of
meters.
A reasonably
proper
economic
balance
should
be attained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:2401-1973<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Irrespective
of these considerations,
the meters should be tested at least
once in two years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2 In the case of inferential
water meters, water is passed even
if the meter stops registering, whereas, in the case of semi-positive meters,
the water supply would beshut off when the meter stops registering.
From
the periodical readings of the meter and having regard to the seasonal
fluctuation in the demand for water supply of a consumer, it is possible
to determine whether the meter requires
to be removed for test, being
suspected of running slow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 When a meter is removed
from
the
line for
whatever
reason,
opportunity
should
be taken to see that it is clean and functioning
properly before it is re-installed.
It should also be tested for accuracy and
reset to zero before installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
