<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Diversion Works Sectional Committee had been approved by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Diversion channel and open cut or conduit in the body  of the dam needs  to be closed by lowering
the gates at the entry end ( if not utilized for other purposes ).
This operation is started when the
dam is completed
up to crest, with energy dissipation
arrangements
and alternative passage to
discharge the water from reservoir behind  the dam is available.
After the  closure
of the channel/
conduit by gate, the conduit in the body of the dam has to be filled in with concrete of appropriate
strength
to make it part of the dam body.
This standard is intended to give guidelines to be
followed for execution of this work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The
height
of the
barrier
and
the
diameter
or pipe should
be decided
after inspec-

the conduits

seepage
after
lowering
of

The
diameter
of the
pipe
should
not be
less than
150 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
covers
the
method
of closure
of
diversion
channel
and open cut or conduit
in the
body of dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6 Before undertaking
closure
of the
gate,
the
condition
of the sills, girders,
guide grooves and
hoisting
mechanism,
etc,
should
be examined.
After
having
done
this,
depending
upon
the
damage,
the methodology
to be followed
should
be decided.
In addition
to the
lowering
of the
gate, remedial
measures
such as placing
an invert
filter
and
replacing
the
damaged
concrete,
etc,
may
be required
before
lowering
of the
gate.
After
closure
by
lowering
of gates,
the conduit
should
be thoroughly
inspected
to check damage
to concrete
and reinforcement
on
faces
both
on
invert and sides of conduit.
The damaged
surfaces
should
be thoroughly
cleaned
and
prepared
to
receive fresh plugging
concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian
Standard
IS 9349  :  1986 ‘Recommen-
dations
for structural
design of medium
and high
head
slide gates  (Jirst revision )’  is a necessary
adjunct
to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 METHOD
FOR
CLOSURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 During
construction
of
open
diversion
channel
or conduit
in
the body of the dam it is
necessary
to construct
a gate structure
for closure
of the ,channel/conduit
with
the hoisting
equip-
ment level higher than probable
maximum
reser-
voir level during
the non-monsoon
period allowing
for the rise in water level at the time of closure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  For dams higher than 50 metres,
inspection
of gate,
the conduit
opening
and its seals should
be done by a team
of divers
so that
corrective
measures
are
implemented
before actual
closure
operations
starts.
Under
water
photography
may
also
be
equally
helpful
in
detection
of
faults,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7 The portiou
of the channel/conduit
falling
in
the
body
of the dam should
then be plugged
by
minimum
M 15 grade concrete
placed
by use
of
concrete
pump or placer ( see Fig. 2 for guidance
)
or by conventional
method
in case the conduit
size is large.
l‘he length of concrete
plug
should
be minimum
3 times the diameter
of the
conduit.
Closed end of the plug
inside
the barrel
should
be provided
with stopper
for proper
placement
of
concrete
by pump.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The
conduit
opening
in the gate
structure
should
have seals provided
all round
the
opening
to ensure
minimum
leakage
of
water
during
sealing.
The
drawings
and
record
of the work
executed
should
be maintained
for proper
design
of gate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8 After
having
observed
the
provisions
given
in
3.6,
it would
be necessary
to channelise
the
leakage water coming
through
seals
of the gate
by
placing
a concrete
barrier
and channelising
the water through
a pipe as mentioned
in 3.5 to
see that the area where concrete
plug
is required
to be done
is in
reasonably
dry
condition
to
ensure
good
quality
concrete.
After
the
plug
concrete
has
attained
adequate
strength
and
undergone
necessary
shrinkage,
the
process
of
contact
grouting
as  shown
in Fig.
2 would be
undertaken.
After
completing
contact
grouting,
the
pipe
which
carries
the
leakage
water
out,
should
be closed
and
grouted
at a pressure
25
percent
higher than that of leakage
water
to see
that
the
pipe
is fully
grouted
and
water
is
prevented
from flowing through
the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Closure
of the
diversion
works
should
be
synchronised
with provision
of alternative
passage
to
the
river
flow
either
through
permanent
sluices or from
spillway
to
cater
to the
down-
stream
needs
for conservation
uses or for main-
taining
ecology,
so that downstream
supplies
may
continue
with least disruption.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Gates and hoists used for closure
of channel
or conduit
should
be designed
to cater to the
dynamic
water
forces
and
bouyancy
caused
during
closure
according
to
IS 9349  :  1986.
Proper
provision
of air
vent
should
be
made
to
cater
to
the
air
demand
during
closure
operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9 Grout
pipes
and
grout
buttons
should
be
provided
at the rate of 3 m c/c in either
direction
to
grout
the
shrinkage
gap
between*
the
old
conduit
concrete
and new plug concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 Leakage
of water
through
the seals of gate
should
be arrested
by a barrier
as shown in Fig. 1
and led through
a steel pipe
outside
