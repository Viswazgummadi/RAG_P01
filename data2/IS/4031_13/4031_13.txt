FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>standard in 1968, a number of standards
cover-
ing the requirements
of different equipment
used
for testing of cement, a brief description of which
was also covered
in the standard,
had
been
published.
In this revision,
therefore,
reference
is given to different
instrument
specifications
deleting the description
of the instruments,
as it
has been
recognized
that
reproducible
and
repeatable test iesults can be obtained
only
with
standard
testing
equipment
capable
of giving
desired level of accuracy.
This part
( Part 13 )
covers
measurement
of water
retentivity
of
masonry cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part
13 )  (  First
Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
on 22 April
1988, after the
draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Standard
methods
of testing
cement
are
essential
adjunct
to the cement
specifications
This standard
in different
parts
lays down
the
procedure
for the tests to evaluate the physical
properties
of different types of hydraulic cements.
The procedure
for conducting
chemical
tests of
hydraulic cement is covered in IS  :  4032-1985*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the
purpose
of deciding
whether
a
particular
requirement
of
this
standard
is
complied
with, the final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test
or
analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of
significant
places retained in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Originally all the tests to evaluate the physical
properties
of hydraulic cements were covered
in
one standard
;  but for facilitating the use of this
standard and future revisions, it has been decided
to print the different tests as different
parts
of
the standard
and,
accordingly,
this
revised
standard
has been brought out in thirteen parts.
This will also facilitate
updating
the individual
tests.

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Standard
Sand -
The standard
sand to be
used in the preparation
of mortar shall conform
to IS  :  650-1966*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The samples of the cement shall be taken
in
accordance
with the requirements
of IS  :  3535-
1986* and the relevant standard
specification for
the type of cement being tested. The representative
sample of the cement selected
as above shall be
thoroughly
mixed before testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>the mortar on the flow table to the mixing bowl,
and remix
the entire batch for 15 s at medium
speed.
Immediately
after
remixing
of
the
mortar, fill the perforated
dish with the pyrtar
to slightly above the rim.
Tamp the mortar
I5
times with
the tamper.
Ten of the
tamping
strokes shall be applied at approximately
uniform
spacing adjacent to the rim of the dish and with
the long axis of the tamping face held at right
angles to the radius of the dish.
The remaining
five tamping strokes shall be applied
at random
points
distributed
over the central
area
of the
dish.
The tamping
pressure
shall be just suffi-
cient  to ensure filling of the dish.
On comple-
tion of the tamping, the top of the mortar should
extend slightly above the rim of the dish. Smooth
off the mortar by drawing
the flat side of the
straight
edge ( with the leading
edge
slightly
raised ) across the top of the dish.
Then cut off
the mortar to a plane surface
flush with the rim
of the dish by drawing the straight
edge with a
sawing motion across the top of the dish in two
cutting
strokes,
starting each cut from near the
centre of the dish.
If the mortar is pulled
away
from the side of the dish during
the process
of
drawing the straight edge across the dish, gently
press the mortar back into contact with the side
of the dish  using the tamper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>retention test shall conform to  IS :  10850-1984*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Balance
-
The balance used
in weighing
materials shall conform to the following require-
ments  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On balance in use, the permissible
variation
at a load of 2 000 g shall be & 2’0 g.
The
permissible
variation
on new balance shall be
one-half of this value.
The
sensibility
reci-
procal
shall be not greater
than twice the
permissible variation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -The
sensibility
reciprocal
is generally
defined as the change in load required
to change the
position of rest of the
indicatmg
element
or

scale
a
definite amount at any load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Turn the stopcock to apply the vacuum  to  the
funnel.
The time elapsed from the start of mix-
ing the cement and water to the time of applying
the vacuum
shall not exceed 8 minutes.
After
suction for
60 s, quickly
turn
the stopcock
to
expose the
funnel
to atmospheric
pressure.
Immediately
slide the perforated
dish off from
the funnel,
touch- it momentarily
on a damp
cloth to remove droplets
of water
and set the
dish on the table.
Then, using the bowl scraper,
plow and mix the mortar
in the dish for 15 s.
Upon completion
of mixing, place the mortar
in
the flow mould
and determine
the flow.
The
entire
operation
shall be carried
out
without
interruption
and as quickly as possible, and shall
be completed within an elapsed
time of 11 min
after the start
of mixing the cement and wa&
,for the first flow determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Adjust the mercury relief
column
so as to
maintain a vacuum of 50 mm as measured on the
manometer.
Seat the perforated
dish on
the
greased gasket
of the funnel.
Place a
wetted
filter paper in the bottom of the dish.
Turn
the
stopcock
to apply the vacuum to the funnel and
check the apparatus for leaks
and to determine
that the required suction is obtained.
Then turn
the stopcock
to shut off the vacuum
from the
funnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
