FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 December
1982, after the draft finalized by the Building
Construction
Practices
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Bulk
of raw asbestos
fibres
used
in
the
manufacture
of
asbestos
cement
roofing
sheets in this country
are imported
from abroad.
Recent
investigations,
however,
have
indicated
that
its use may lead to serious
and uncurable
health
hazards.
This
hazard
coupled
with
the
soaring
cost
of asbestos
fibres
make
it imperative
that
new,
indigeneous
and
cheap roofing
material
be made available
for mass scale use.
Optimum
utilization
of national
resources
also
demand
that
use of indigeneous
building
material
should be promoted.
Coir,
woodwool
and few
other
vegetable
fibres
which
are
available
in large
quantity
in this country,
have
been
found
suitable
for
the
manufacture
of sheets
for
roofing
purposes.
The sheets may be either plain or corrugated
and manufactured
by
mixing
and pressing
coir, woodwool
and cement
in suitable
propor-
tions.
The
sheets
possess
better
thermal
insulation
and
fire
resistant
properties.
This
standard
has been
formulated
to provide
guidance
in
respect
of manufacture
and selection
of such roofing
sheets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In the formulation
of this standard,
assistance
has been
provided
by
Central
Building
Research
Institute
( CSIR
), Roorkee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
This
standard
contains
clause 3.1.1 which
permits
the manufacturer
to manufacture
the sheets for sizes other than specified
if agreed
to by the
purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
For the purpose
of decidi,ng
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded

<<HEADING level=3>>D-l.
From
each
of the
sheets
selected
in
accordance
with
7,
three
specimens
each 65  x  65 mm shall be taken.
NOTE -
The dimensions refer to actual edge length of the specimen.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-2. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-2.1  Each
specimen
shall be placed
upright
for 24 hours in 270 ml of 5
percent
acetic
acid solution
at 27 f
2°C contained
in a vessel
of such
a
size that the specimen
is entirely
immersed.
Separate
vessels and solution
shall be used for each specimen.
The
concentration
of the
acetic
acid
shall
be
determined
before
and
after
immersion
of the
specimen
by
titration
against
a solution
of sodium
hydroxide
of known
concentration
( approximately
0.5
N ) using
thymol
blue as indicator.
For titration
10 ml of the
acid solution
shall be first stirred,
then
diluted
to 100 ml
and 10 drops of thymol
blue
solution
( 0.040
g in 100 ml,
95
percent
alcohol
) added
to it.
The
end point
to be taken is that of the colour
change
from yollow
to blue corresponding
at apH
8.0 to 9.5;
the
small
amount
of gelatinous
precipitate
formed
does not interfere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>D-3.1
The
amount
of acetic
acid
used per square metre of area of the
specimen
shall be calculated
from the fall in concentration,
assuming
that
one
millilitre
of 0.5 N sodium hydroxide
solution is equivalent
to O-030 g
of acetic
acid as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
