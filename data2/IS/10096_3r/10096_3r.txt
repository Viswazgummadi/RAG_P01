<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by
the Hydraulic
Gates and Valves Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the River Valley
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Noting lack of adequate
systematic
information
on procedures
for inspection,
testing and main-
tenance
of radial gates land their hoists after erection,
the Hydraulic
Gates and Valves Sectional
Committee
decided that a set of recommendations
on this subject be drawn up for reference
and
guidance of the personnel
engaged in these duties.
to provide guidelines
for radial gates.
This standard has accordingly
been prepared<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
is being published in parts.
Part 1 deals with inspection
testing
and assembly at
manufacturing
stage.
Part 2 deals with inspection,
testing and assembly
at the time of erec-
tion.
Part 3 deals with inspection,
testing and maintenance
after erection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
( Part 3 ) was first published in 1982.

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of the standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
of numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The
number of significant places retained
in the
rounded off value
should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Periodical
inspection
of gate installations
should
be carried
out to detect
normal wear
and tear, defects, if any.
It should be done as
and when
necessary,
but at least thrice in an
year, one being prior to the onset
of monsoon
and one immediately
after the mosoon and one
at other times.
The gates
should be operated
up and down several
times to make sure that
everything
is in order.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
(Part

down
the
recommendations
for

and

of radial

clogged with silt causing accumulation
of water
in the horizontal

Therefore
the details of

<<PARAGRAPH>>In order
to detect
normal
wear and
tear,
defects,
if any, periodical
inspection
of gate
installation
should
be carried out.
The perio-
dical inspection
of these gates-and hoist should
be done as and when necessary,
but .at least
thrice a year and corresponding
to the peiiods
when the water
level in the reservoir
is at its
highest
and lowest
levels.
In
short,
pre-
monsoon and post-monsoon
inspections
should
be done and the following
checks be exercised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
