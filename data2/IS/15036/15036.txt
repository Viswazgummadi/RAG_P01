<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Reliability
of Electronic and Electrical Components and Equipment Sectional Committee had been approved by the Electronic
and Telecommunication
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dependability
analysis techniques
are used for the review and prediction
of the reliability,
availability,
maintainability and safety measures of a system. Dependability analyses are conducted mainly during the concept
and definition phase, the design and development phase and the operation and maintenance phase at various
system levels and degrees of detail to order to evaluate and determine the dependability measures of a system or
an installation. They are also used to compare the results of the analysis with specified requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While preparing
this standard,
assistance has been derived from IEC 60300-3-1
(1991) ‘Dependability
management
– Part 3: Application
guide – Section
1: Analysis techniques
for dependability:
Guide on
methodology’, published by International Electrotechnical Commission.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The technical Committee responsible for preparation of this standard has reviewed the provisions of following
IEC publication and decided that it may be used in conjunction with this standard till Indian Standard on this
subject is published:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>lEC 1025(1990) Fault tree analysis (FTA)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value, observed
or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off
numerical values (revised)’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

APPROACH
TO
SYSTEM
DEPENDABILITY
ANALYSIS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
guide
is an introduction
to the available
methodology and is intended to provide the analyst
with the necessary information in order to choose the
analysis method most appropriate to the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specific procedures for analysis are contained in the
standards describing each analysis method. General
procedures,
approaches
and requirements
are
described hereinafter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 REFERENCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standards listed in Annex A are necessary
adjuncts to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  General
Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedure
consists of the following
steps (as
applicable):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 DEFINITIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of this standard, the terms and defin-
itions given in IS 1885 (Part 39) shall apply in addi-
tion to the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Step  1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>List all system reliability and availability requirements,
characteristics
and features, together with environ-
mental and operating conditions,
and maintenance
requirements. Define the system to be analyzed, its
modes of operation, the functional relationships
to
higher levels and to interfacing systems of processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 System<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Item on the highest level considered in the analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Component<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Item on the lowest level considered in the analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Step  2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Define system fault, fault criteria and conditions based
on system tlmction”alrequirements, expected operation
and operating environment.
Software performance
should also be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Allocation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A procedure
applied during the design of an item
intended
to
apportion
the
requirements
for
performance
measures for an item to its sub items
according to given criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Step  3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
numerical
results
are
required,
it
is
recommended to carry out an allocation based on a
preliminary design (assignment of a portion of the
total permitted system failure rate or unavailability to
each sub-system).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE —  ‘System’maybe replacedby ‘sub-system’,etc,as
applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The analysis
methods
allow
the evaluation
of
qualitative characteristics and estimation of measures
(for example, failure rate, MTTF, MTBF, reliability,
steady state availability) which describe the predicated
long-term operating behaviour of a system. In order
to perform
a systematic
and reproducible
system
analysis, use of a consistent procedure is essential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Step  4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Analysis of the system as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Qualitative
analysis
(deductive/inductive
methodology)
Analyze, the functional
system structure,
determine system/component
fault modes,
failure mechanisms, effects and consequences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, no single dependability analysis method is
sufficiently comprehensive and flexible to deal with<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
inductive
methodology
(bottom-up),
for
example fault mode and effects analysis.
However, in practice, an iterative approach is more
usual
with
deductive
and
inductive
analysis
complementing one another.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of failures, consider item maintainability,
construct
reliability
and/or
availability
models, determine possible maintenance and
repair strategies, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quantitative
analysis
(analytical
or event
simulation
methods)
Obtain or identify item reliability data (for
example,
failure
rates), construct
mathe-
matical reliability and/or availability model,
perform
numerical
evaluations
of mathe-
matical model, perform component criticality
and sensitivity
analyses, evaluate improv-
ement
of system
performance
due
to
redundant
substructures
and maintenance
strategies, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Deductive
Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The essence of the deductive approach is to proceed
from the highest level of interest, that is, the system
or sub-system level, to successively lower levels in
order to identify undesirable system operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The analysis is performed at the next lower system
level to identify, any fault and its associated fault mode
which could result in the fault effect as originally
identified. For each of these second level faults, the
analysis
is repeated
by tracing
back
along
the
functional paths and relationships to the next lower
level using logical gates. This process is continued as
far as the lowest level desired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Evaluation of results, comparison with requirements
andlor alternative designs. Additional activities may
include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reviewing
system
design,
determining
weaknesses,
unbalances,
critical/high
risk
fault modes and items, considering system
interface
problems,
fail-safe
features and
mechanisms, etc.
Developing alternative ways for improving
dependability
(for example
redundancy
allocation,
performance
monitoring,
fault
detection, system reconfiguration procedures,
maintainability,
component replaceability,
and repair procedures).
Performing trade-off studies and evaluating
the cost of alternative designs.
The relationships between the general analysis proce-
dure and the specific methods and procedures are given
in Table 1 (note that Table 1 is not exhaustive). The
methods are explained further in 5.2 to 5.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The deductive method is an event-oriented
method
which is useful during the early conceptual phase of
system design when the details of the system are not
yet fully defined. It is also used for evaluating multiple
failures including sequentially
related failures, the
existence of faults due to a common-cause, or wherever
system complexity makes it more convenient to begin
by listing system faults or system success.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In all cases the undesirable
single event or system
success at the highest level of interest (the top event),
should be given. The contributory causes of that event
at all levels are then identified and analyzed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Inductive
Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The essence of the inductive method is to identi& fault
modes at the component level. For each fault mode
the corresponding effect on performance is deduced
for the next higher system level. The resulting fault
effect becomes the fault mode at the next higher system
level, and the fault effects of each fault mode are
analyzed at this level. Successive iterations result in
the eventual identification of the fault effects at all
fi.mctional levels up to the system level. This ‘bottom-
up’ method is rigorous in identifying all single fault
modes. Because component
fault modes must be
identified. This method is normally used during the
later stages of design where equipment has become
mature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Analysis
of Functional
Structure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to analyze the long-term operating behaviour
of a system with confidence, the precise way a system
is required to function, as well as its operational and
environmental
conditions should be determined and
described
in detail.
A separate
analysis
of the
functional
system structure
may be necessary
to
identify and departure from the required function.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The system function may be represented by functional
block diagrams, signal flow diagrams, state-transition
diagrams, event sequences, tables, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5
Maintenance
and
Repair
Analysis
and
Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Finally, the qualitative failure or success analysis may
be conducted in accordance with either of the following
two formal methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The long-term operating behaviour
of a repairable
system

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Selecting  the Appropriate

<<PARAGRAPH>>Starting with the top event, the possible causes or fault
modes on the next lowest functional system level are
identified
using logical gates. Following
stepwise
identification
of undesirable
system operation
to
successively lower system level will lead to the desired
lowest system level. Causes at this level are usually
the component fault modes. The results of the analysis
are portrayed as a fault tree.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to enable a system dependability evaluation
to be economically
performed,
an analysis method
should be chosen which:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>models
and evaluates
a wide range
of
dependability problems;
allows
a straightforward,
systematic,
qualitative
and quantitative
analysis to be
performed
by
trained
design
and
dependability engineers; and
predicts measures of the dependability char-
acteristics numerically, if data are available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quantitative analysis is performed on the basis of
the fault tree. In order to estimate system reliability
and availability, methods such as Boolean reduction
and cut set analysis are employed.
The basic data
required are component
failure rates, repair rates,
probability of occurrence of fault modes, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A dependability analysis method should be selected

analysis
is a
deductive (top-down) system dependability analysis
method. An RBD is the graphical representation of a
system’s logical structure in terms of sub-systems and/
or components. This allows the system success paths
to be represented by the way in which the blocks (sub-
systems/components) are logically connected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 2 gives an overview of various dependability
analysis methods and their characteristics and features.
More than one method may be required to provide a
complete analysis of the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1  Failure

Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various
qualitative
analysis
techniques
may be
employed to construct an RBD. The first step is to
establish the definition of system success. The next
step is to divide the system in functional
blocks
appropriate to the purpose of the reliability analysis.
Some blocks may represent
system substructures,
which in turn may be represented
by other RBDs
(system reduction).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Failure
mode and effect
analysis
(FMEA)
is an
inductive
(bottom-up),
qualitative
dependability
analysis method, which is particularly suited to the
study of material, component and equipment faults
and their effects and mechanisms on the next higher
functional
system
level.
Iterations
of the step
(identification of single fault modes and the evaluation
of their effects on the next higher system level) result
in the eventual identification of all the system single
fault modes. FMEA lends itself to the analysis of
systems
of different
technologies
(electrical,
mechanical,
hydraulic,
software,
etc) with simple
functional structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the quantitative evaluation of an RBD, various
methods are available.
Depending
on the type of
structure (reducible or irreducible)
simple Boolean
techniques, truth tables and/or path and cut set analysis
may be employed for the prediction of system reliability
and availability
values
calculated
from
basic
component data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FMECA extends the FMEA to include criticality
analysis
by quantifying
fault effects
in terms of
probability
of occurrence
and the severity of any
effects. Estimates of the probability
of failure are
calculated directly from a reliability prediction using
the data assessed
by the FMEA (probability
of
occurrence of a fault mode, failure rates, etc). The
severity of effects is assessed by reference to a specified
scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.4  Markov Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Markov analysis is mainly an inductive (bottom-up)
analysis
method
suitable
for the evaluation
of
functionally complex system structures and complex
repair and maintenance strategies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method is based on the theory of Markov chains.
In principle
the probabilities
of system elements
(components,
sub-systems)
being
in a particular
(functional) state, or events to occur, at specific points
or intervals of time are evaluated by mathematical
models.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2  Fault Tree Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a deductive (top-down)
method
for analyzing
system dependability.

Number of components<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  number of components of the system which can
be handled by a particular analysis method is basically
limited by the number of combinations (system states)
which arise from the possible component states or fault
modes considered. The number of combinations is also
heavily dependent on the specific system structure and
maintenance considerations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is basically
an
inductive
(bottom-up)
method
applicable
mostly
during
the proposal
and early design phases,
to
estimate an approximate system failure rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2.2  Redundant
structures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basis capability to handling redundant
system
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The components of the system need to be listed and
the appropriate failure rates determined according to
their stress levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2.3  Irreducible
structures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A structure is called irreducible if straight forward
reduction techniques are not possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method is based upon the assumption that the
components are logically connected in series. This is
often a worst case estimate. Where redundancies at
the higher levels of assembly are known, their effects
may be taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2.4  Failure/event
combinations
and dependencies<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  capability of the method to handle failure or event
combinations.
These
include
common
cause
br
common mode failures, multiple failure effects and
statistically dependent fault modes or sequential failure
effects and mechanisms, or events caused by adverse
environmental effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A parts count reliability prediction of a system with a
series type of structure will yield predictions at an
acceptable precision level, provided a thorough ‘Parts
Stress Analysis’ is carried out. Use of the parts stress
analysis gives more realistic component failure rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>On the left hand side of Table 2, the analysis methods
are listed.
In order
to facilitate
evaluation
and
comparison, their characteristics, attributes, flexibility,
etc, are stated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The capability of the method to handle statistically
dependent repair and maintenance situations. These
include cases where renewal processes (repair queues)
should be considered, as compared to the assumption
that,
for each component
failure,
repair
begins
immediately after failure, independent of whether a
component is accessible or not (independent repair).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For each analysis method the matrix thus gives an
indication as to which additional characteristics each
method can handle as indicated by ‘yes’ and ‘no’
entries, Further, the analysis methods are distinguished
by particular attributes or techniques. These are listed
and rated on the right hand side of Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2.7  Simulation
of functional
process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The capability of a method to simulate discrete events;
that is, the failure and renewal processes are simulated
and the particular system states evaluated according
to the influence which they exert on any higher-level
system or on the total environment (interrelation).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 2 indicates that there is no single, comprehensive
dependability
analysis method. The analyst should
choose the method which best fits the particular system
or analysis objective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

it is also necessary
