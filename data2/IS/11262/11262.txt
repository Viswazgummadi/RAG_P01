FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 12 March
1985, after the draft finalized
by the  Cement  and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil
Engi-
neering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number
of standards
on methods
of testing
cement
and
concrete
has
already
been
published.
Having
recognized
that
reliable
and
reproducible
test
results
could
be
obtained
only with use of standard
testing
equipment
capable
of giving
desired
level
of
accuracy,
the
Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had taken up
formulation
of
Indian
Standards
on instruments
for testing
cement
and concrete
and, as
a result, a number
of Indian
Standards
on instruments
for testing
cement
and concrete
have already
been published.
These
standards
are expect-
ed to
promote
development
and
manufacture
of
standard
testing
equipment
in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Accordingly,
this
standard
has
been
formulated
to
cover
the
requirements
of calorimeter
and its accessories
used for determination
of
heat
of hydration
of hydraulic
cement.
The method
for determination
of heat of hydration
of hydraulic
cement
is  covered
in IS  :  4031-1%8*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given to
international
coordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in
addition
to
relating
it to the practices
in the
field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accord-
ance
with
IS : 2-1960t.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in
the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value  in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The
calorimeter
consists
of a vacuum
flask fitted in an insulated
container,
Beckmann
thermometer,
stirrer assembly and a funnel.
The
heat of hydration of hydraulic
cement is determined
by measuring
the
heat
of solution
of dry cement
and the heat of solution of a separate
portion
of the cement
that has been partially
hydrated for any specific
period;
the difference
between these values being the heat of hydration
for that specified period ( see IS  :  4031-1968”
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Calorimeter
-
The
calorimeter
( see Fig.

consist
of a
450  ml ( approximately
150 mm  x  70 mm dia ) capacity
wide-mouthed
vacuum flask with a cork stopper, 40 mm thick.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The Aask shall be selected
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
when filled with 398 ml of water,
the
water
surface
is 20 f
6.5
mm below the lower surface
of the bung ( cork stopper
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) When the flask is filled with 400 ml of warm water,
the tempera-
ture
loss per minute
per
degree
Celsius above
room temperature
determined
after standing
without
stirring
for half
an hour,
does
not
exceed
0*002”C
per min per degree
Celsius excess tempera-
ture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
whole
inner surface
of the vacuum
flask and underside
of the
cork stopper
is evenly and thinly
coated
with material
resistant
to hydro-
fluoric
acid,
such
as paraffin
wax having
congealing
point about
60°C
forming
an acid-proof
lining.
The acid resistant
coating
shall be intact
and
free
of cracks
at all times.
Should
the lining at any time become
damaged,
as indicated
by
an
unusual
temperature
rise
during
the
determination
of the
initial
heating
or cooling
correction,
the
whole
lining
shall be melted
off and renewed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Insulated
Container
-
The
wooden
container
shall
have
an
insulating
layer
of cork, cotton,
wool or similar
material
at least 25 mm
thick,
completely
enclosing
the flask and also providing
support
for the
flask and the stirrer
motor.
The
container
shall be divided in a vertical
plane into two parts which
are hinged
together
on one side and provided
with a fastening
device on the other so as to permit
easy
removal
of the
vaccum
flask.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3  Differential
and
Reference
Thermometers
-
The
adjustable
differential
thermometer
shall
be of Beckmann
type, graduated
at least
to 0.01%
and shall have a range
of approximately
6°C.
The
portion
of the thermometer
that will rest inside the calorimeter
shall be protected
with a coating
resistant
to hydrofluoric
acid.
The thermometer
shall
be
provided
with
a suitable
reading
lens.
It shall be securely
held by the
cork stoppsr
so as io avoid accidental
contact
with the  8fW%i’
blades.
II!
order
to facilitate
removal
of the thermometer,
the cork stopper
may
be
divided
into two halves,
one of which supports
the thermometer,
and the
other the funnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The
reference
thermometer
shall be of the appropriate
range with
0.  1°C  graduations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4
Stirring
Assembly
-
The
stirrer
( see Fig. 2 ) shall be made of
glass or polyethylene,
of the double-bladed
propeller
type, approximately
40 mm in diameter
and shall extend
to within 40 mm
of the
bottom
of
the
flask.
It
shall
have
shaft
diameter
of 6 mm
and shaft length
of
400 mm.
When
a glass stirrer
is used, the portion
that
will
be inside
the calorimeter
shall be protected
with a coating
resistant
to  hydrofluoric
acid.
The
pitch
of the
blades
is set in such a manner
that when
the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : ll!m
; 1999<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>stirrer is actuated by the drive motor, liquid in the flask is propelled
in
a downward
direction.
Means shall be provided for disconnecting
the
stirrer from the motor which shall be 40 Watts synchronous motor geared
to run at a constant speed in the range of 350 to 700 rev/min.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>All dimensions in millimetres.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>FIG.  2
STIRRER<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
heat
developed by the stirrer when running continuously shall
be such that the contents of the flask shall not rise in temperature
at a
rate greater
than O*OOl”C/ min over and above the rate of temperature
change  in  the unstirred condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The function of the stirrer is two-fold (a) to maintain uniform temperature
throughout the liquid
and (b) to supply sufficient agitation
to keep the solid in
suspension in the acid mixture.
Since a stirrer
capable
of keeping the solid in
suspension generates
considerable
heat in the calorimeter,
it is important that the
stirrer speed and hence the rate
of heat generation
be maintained
constant.
A
synchronous motor and a geared speed reducer are almost mandatory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5  Funnel -
The funnel through which the sample is introduced
into
the calorimeter
shall be of the Gooch type made of glass or polyethylene
and shall have a stem of 6 mm internal diameter
and  a  body a pproxi-
mately
25 mm long and
25 mm in diameter.
The
stem shall not
protrude more than 3 mm beneath the cork stopper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. MARKING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The
following information
shall be clearly and indelibly
marked on
each
component
of the apparatus,
as far as practicable,
in such a way
that it does not interfere with the performance
of the apparatus:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Name of the manufacturer
or his registered trade-mark
or both,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Date of manufacture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1 The
apparatus
may
aIso be marked with the ISI Certification
Mark.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The use of the ISI Certification
Mark is governed by the provisions of the
Indian Standards
Institution
( Certification
Marks ) Act and the Rulesand
Regu-
lations made thereunder.
The IS1 Mark on products covered by an Indian Standard<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>conveys
the assurance that they have been produced
to comply
with the require-
ments of that standard under a well-defined system of inspection, testing and quality
control which is d&vised and supervised by IS1 and operated by the
producer.
IS1
marked
products
are also continuously
checked
by IS1 for
conformity
to that
standard as a further safeguard.
Details of conditions
under which a licence
for the
use of the IS1 Certification
Mark
may be granted
to manufacturers
or processors,
may be obtained from the Indian Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
