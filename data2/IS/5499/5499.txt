FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institu-
tion on 12 December
1969, after
the draft
finalized
by the
Functional
Requirements
in Building
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by
the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 In densely
populated
areas
considerable
loss of life may be avoided
by
provision
of
proper
protective
air-raid
shelters.
It is with
this
view that
this standard
is being
prepared
to provide
guidance
to those
engaged
in Civil Defence
~projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This
standard
is intended
for
use in construction
of shelters
in
densely
populated
urban
areas
with
limited
open
space
available.
Decisions
with regard
to actual
locations
of these shelters,
competent
authority
shall
decide
where
these
shelters
should
be located
to suit
their
particular
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard
due
weightage
has been given
to international
co-ordination
among
the
standards
and practices
pre-
vailing~in
different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test
or
analysis,
shall
be
rounded
off in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value
should
be the
same
as that
of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
lays down basic
requirements
of design and materials
for the construction
of underground
air-raid
shelters
in natural
soil for
protection
of persons
against
explosion
of conventional
bombs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY
2.0  For
the
purpose
of this
standard,

or excavation
used
or
intended
to be used to provide
protection
against
hostile
attack
from
the air.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Underground
Shelter
-
A shelter

floor
of which
is below
the
surrounding
ground
and
the
level of the
upper
surface
of its ceiling
does not protrude
at any point
by more than
1 ti above
the level of the
surrounding
ground.
Shelter
whose
underground
parts
of walls
are
not
surrounded
by
a thickness
of earth
of at
least
3 m,
measured
horizontally,
shall not be considered
as underground
shelter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Rock  -Natural

matter
occurring
in

For the purpose
of this
standard,
rock shall be designated
as a continuous
stony
layer,
the
inclination
of whose
strata
does
not
exceed
W,
and the crushing
strength
of which,
measured
on a 70-mm
side cube
saturated
with water,
is not less than
100 kg/cm2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Non-rocky
Soil -
Any soil other
than
defined
in 2.3 shall be classi-
fied as non-rocky
soil.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. MATERIALS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 For the construction
of the
shelters,

shall be designed
to accommodate
a maximum
number
of 50 persons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
The limit, 50 persons,
has been specified to reduce the calamity
risk.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 As far as possible
shelters
should
be dispersed
rather
than
concen-
trating
in one
area
or floor.
Where
owing
to lack
of space,
it is
necessary
to construct
shelters
in order
to accommodate
the maximum
number
of persons
in the minimum
space,
they should
be divided
by
traverses,
zigzags,
or doglegs
into
sections
to accommodate
not more
than
50 persons
in each section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. ENTRANCES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Wherever
possible,
it is desirable
to
connect
shelters
one
with
another,
so that,
should
they be rushed
and become
overcrowded
people
may move
on to the next unit to leave
space
for those
seeking
refuge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 When
trenches
are connected,
each
connecting
passageway
should
be allowed
to over
sail
past
the actual
corner
so as to form
a blast
pocket
to reduce
the risk of casualties
in the
shelter
if the
bomb
falls
in the connecting
passage.
Connecting
passages
shall meet each other
at right angles
( see Fig.
1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
