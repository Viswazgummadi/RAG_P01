<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Part 22 ) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the
Methods
of Chemical
Analysis
of Ferrous
Metals
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 228, which was first published
in 1952 and subsequently
revised
in 1959, covered
the chemical
analysis
of plain
carbon
and low alloy steels,
alongwith
pig iron and cast iron.
It was revised
again to make it comprehensive
in
respect
of steel analysis
and to exclude
pig iron and cast iron which
were being covered
in separate
standards.
During
its second
revision
the standard
has been split up in several
parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers
the method
for determination
of total hydrogen
in steel by thermal
conductivity
method.

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2
Immerse
the sampler
in the molten
metal
for
2 to 4s to allow the sample to be drawn into the inner
chamber.
Excessive
immersion
time
may
cause
misleading results. Immersion depth must be a minimum
of51
mm into the molten metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3
Weigh the sample
and follow
the calibration
procedure
as laid down
in the operation
manual
of
the instrument
and establish
the instrument
response.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4
Verify
the
response
of the
instrument
by
analyzing
a standard
sample
after calibration.
The
value should be within the allowable
limits of certified
value of the standard.
If not, repeat
the calibration
and verification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Immediately
after removing
the sampler from the
molten metal, plunge the end of the sampler
into cold
water.
Agitate
it to hasten
cooling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  PRINCIPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Repeat  the calibration
when the carrier gas
supply has been changed or when the system has not
been used for long time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In
steel
the
total
hydrogen
is present
in two
forms
as diffusible
hydrogen
and
the
residual
hydrogen.
The diffusible
hydrogen
is the hydrogen
which
diffuses
out during
the solidification
of the
sample.
This is contained
within
the sample
tube.
During
the
analysis
for the
diffusible
hydrogen,
the
sample
tube
is
pierced
and
the
diffused
hydrogen
is swept out with nitrogen
and measured.
The
residual
hydrogen
is the hydrogen
which
is
remaining
after
the solidification
of
sample.
This
hydrogen
is released
by heating
the
sample
in a
nitrogen
atmosphere.
Carbon
dioxide
and moisture
released
along
with
hydrogen
are
removed
by
suitable
absorbent.
Hydrogen
is then measured
by
thermal
conductivity
method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Calibration
by Gas Dosing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some
instruments
have
provision
for calibration
by hydrogen
gas
dosing.
Follow
the
procedure
suggested
by the manufacturer
of the instrument
for
calibration
by analyzing a certified
