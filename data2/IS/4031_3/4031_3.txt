<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part 3) (First
Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards on 24 February 1988, after the draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.
0.2  Standard methods of testing cement are
essential adjunct to the cement specifications.
This standard in different parts lays down the
procedure for the tests to evaluate physical
properties of different types of hydraulic
cements.
The
procedure
for
conducting
chemical tests of hydraulic cement is covered in
IS : 4032-1985*.
0.3  Originally all the tests to evaluate the
physical properties of hydraulic cements were
covered in one standard but for facilitating the
use of this standard and future revisions it has
been decided to print the different tests as
different parts of the standard and, accordingly
this revised standard has been brought out in
thirteen parts. This will also facilitate updating
of individual tests. Further, since publication of
the original standard in 1968, a number of
standards
covering
the
requirements
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>different equipment used for testing of cement,
a brief description of which was also covered in
the standard, had been published. In this
revision, therefore, reference is given to
different instrument specifications deleting the
description of the instruments, as it has been
recognized that reproducible and repeatable
test results can be obtained only with standard
testing equipment capable of giving desired
level
of
accuracy.
This
part
covers
determination of soundness by Le-Chatelier
method and autoclave test.
0.4  This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment
No.
1
(March 1993).
Side
bar
indicates
modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.
0.5  For the purpose of deciding whether a
particular requirement of this standard is
complied with, the final value, observed or
calculated, expressing the result of a test or
analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant
places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2  Balance  — The balance shall conform to
the following requirements:
On balance in use, the permissible variation
at a load of 1 000 g shall be plus or minus 1.0
g. The permissible variation on new balance
shall
be
one-half
of
this
value.
The
sensibility reciprocal shall be not greater
than twice the permissible variation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>mould gently together while this operation is
being performed. Cover the mould with another
piece of lightly oiled glass sheet, place a small
weight on this covering glass sheet and
immediately submerge the whole assembly in
water at a temperature of 27 ± 2°C and keep
there for 24 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2  Measure the distance separating the
indicator points to the nearest 0.5 mm.
Submerge the mould again in water at the
temperature prescribed above. Bring the water
to boiling, with the mould kept submerged, in
25 to 30 minutes, and keep it boiling for three
hours. Remove the mould from the water, allow
it to cool and measure the distance between the
indicator points. The difference between these
two measurements indicates the expansion of
the cement.
5.3 Calculation  — Calculate the mean of two
values to the nearest 0.5 mm to represent the
expansion of cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1 — The
sensibility
‘reciprocal
is
generally
defined as the change in load required to change the
position of rest of the indicating element or elements of
a non-automatic indicating scale a definite amount at
any load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N OTE  2 — Self-indicating
balance
with
equivalent
accuracy may also be used.
5.1.3  Weights  — The permissible variations on
weights in use in weighing the cement shall be
as prescribed in Table 1.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4  Moulds  — Moulds of 25 × 25 mm size and
282 mm internal length and other accessories
conforming to IS : 10086-1982*.
6.1.5  Autoclave  — The autoclave shall consist
of a high pressure steam boiler equipped with
suitable safety device. The capacity of heating
unit shall be such that with maximum load
(water plus specimens) the pressure of the
saturated steam in the autoclave may be raised<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1  Place the lightly oiled mould on a lightly
oiled glass sheet and fill it with cement paste
formed by gauging cement with 0.78 times the
water required to give a paste of standard
consistency [  see  IS : 4031 (Part 4)-1988* ]. The
paste shall be gauged in the manner and under
the conditions prescribed in IS : 4031 (Part 4)-

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to a gauge pressure of 2.1 MPa or to an absolute
pressure of about 2.2 MPa, in 1 to 1¼ hour from
the time the heat is turned on. The automatic
pressure
control
shall
be
capable
of
maintaining the pressure at 2.1 ± 0.1 MPa
corresponding to a temperature of 215.7 ±
1.7°C. The autoclave shall be designed to
permit the pressure to drop from 2.1 MPa to
less than 0.07 MPa in one hour after the heat
supply has been shut off. It shall be equipped
with a vent valve for allowing the escape of air
during the early part of the heating period and
for releasing any steam pressure remaining at
the end of the one-hour cooling period. The
pressure gauge shall have a nominal dial
diameter of 115 mm and shall be graduated
from 0 to 4.1 MPa with scale division of not
more than 0.04 MPa. The error in the gauge
shall not exceed plus or minus 0.02 MPa at the
operating pressure of 2.1 MPa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1  At 24 ± ½ h after moulding, the specimens
shall be removed from the moist atmosphere,
measured for length, and placed in the
autoclave at room temperature in a rack so that
the four sides of each specimen shall be exposed
to saturated steam. The autoclave shall contain
enough water to maintain an atmosphere of
saturated steam vapour during the entire
period of test. Ordinarily, 7 to 10 percent of the
volume of the autoclave shall be occupied by
water.
6.3.2  To permit air to escape from the autoclave
during the early portion of the heating period,
the vent valve shall be left open until steam
begins to escape (  see   6.4  ). The valve shall then
be closed and the temperature of the autoclave
shall be raised at such a rate as will bring the
gauge pressure of the steam to 2.1 MPa in 1 to
1¼ h from the time the heat is turned on. The
2.1 ± 0.1 MPa pressure shall be maintained for
3 h. At the end of 3 hours period, the heat
supply shall be shut off and the autoclave
cooled at a rate such that the pressure will be
less than 0.1 MPa at the end of the hour, and
any pressure remaining shall be slow released
by partially opening the vent valve until
atmospheric
pressure
is
attained.
The
autoclave shall then be opened and the test
specimens immediately placed in water, the
temperature of which is above 90°C. The water
surrounding the bars shall then be cooled at a
uniform rate by adding cold water so that the
temperature of the water shall be lowered to
27 ± 2°C in 15 min. The water surrounding the
specimens shall then be maintained at 27 ± 2°C
in 15 min when the specimens shall be
surface-dried and their lengths measured
again.
6.4 Safety Precautions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.6  Length Comparator  — Changes in length
of the test specimen shall be measured by an
apparatus conforming to IS : 9459-1980*.
6.2 Preparation of Test Specimens<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  Preparation of Moulds  — The moulds
shall be thinly covered with mineral oil. After
this
operation,
the
stainless
steel
or
non-corroding metal reference inserts with
knurl heads shall be set to obtain an effective
gauge length of 250 mm, care being taken to
keep them clean and free from oil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2  Mixing Cement Paste  — The standard
batch of cement paste shall consist of 500 g of
cement, mixed with sufficient water to give a
paste of standard consistency.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3  Moulding
Specimens  — Immediately
following the completion of mixing, the test
specimens shall be moulded in one or two
layers, each layer being compacted with the
thumb or forefinger by pressing the paste into
the corners, around the reference inserts, and
along the surfaces of the moulds until a
homogeneous specimen is obtained. After the
top layer has been compacted, the paste shall
be cut off flush with the top of the mould and
the surface smoothed with a few strokes of the
trowel. During the operations of mixing and
moulding, the hand shall be protected by
rubber gloves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1  The pressure gauge should have a
maximum capacity of 4.2 MPa. This is
important because with too small a capacity
there is but a little length of arc in which the
gauge hand may indicate pressure above the
specified maximum working pressure. The
operator must be sure that the gauge hand has
not passed the maximum graduation on the
scale.
6.4.2  It is well to leave the pressure gauge
tested, but in any event thermometer shall
always be used together with the pressure
gauge, so as to provide a means of detecting any
failure of the pressure gauge to operate
properly and also to indicate any unusual
conditions such as that resulting from loss of
water from the autoclave during the test.
6.4.3  The
automatic
control
shall
be
maintained in proper working order at all
times.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4  Storage of Test Specimen  — After the
mould has been filled, it shall be immediately
placed in a moist closet or a moist room.
Specimens shall remain in the moulds in the
moist room for at least 24 h. If removed from
the moulds before 24 h, they shall be kept in
the moist closet or moist room until tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 4031 (Part 3) - 1988<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.4  The safety valve shall be set so as to
relieve the pressure at about 6 to 10 percent
above the maximum of 2.1 MPa specified, that
is at about 2.3 MPa. The safety valve shall be
tested at least twice a year, either with a
gauge-testing device or by adjusting the
automatic controls so as to allow the autoclave
to reach a pressure of about 2.3 MPa at which
pressure the safety valve shall either open or be
adjusted to open. The safety valve discharge
shall be directed away from the operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.6  It shall be remembered that for many of
the autoclave pressure gauges now in use, the
return of the gauge hand to the initial rest or
starting point does not necessarily indicate zero
pressure within the autoclave; there may then
still remain an appreciable pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.7  A few drops of kerosene placed in the vent
valve about once a week will aid in keeping the
needle clean and in good-working condition.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Calculations  — The difference in lengths
of
the
test
specimen
before
and
after
autoclaving shall be calculated to the nearest
0.01 percent of the effective gauge length which
is the length between the innermost points of
the metal inserts used as reference points and
shall be reported as the autoclave expansion of
the cement. A contraction (negative expansion)
shall be indicated by prefixing a minus sign to
the percentage expansion reported.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — Unexpected combinations of conditions may
really occur. For example, in one case the automatic
control had failed, the safety valve had stuck, and the
gauge hand, which at first glance appeared to be at
about zero, had really passed the maximum graduation
and had come to stop on the wrong side of the pin. This
condition of the gauge was finally detected and the
pressure, then of an unknown magnitude, was released
before failure could occur in the apparatus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.5  Heavy leather work gloves shall be worn
to prevent burning of the hands when removing
the top of the autoclave at the end of the test.
The vent valve shall be directed away from the
operator. When removing the autoclave lid, the
lid shall be so tilted that any steam escaping
from beneath the lid may be discharged away
from the operator. Care shall be taken to avoid
scalding by any liquid that may have been used
in the autoclave well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6 Retests  — In the event of cement failing to
meet the test for soundness, a retest may be
made after aeration. For this purpose, spread
out the sample in a layer of 75 mm thickness
and store it for 7 days in an atmosphere
maintained at 27 ± 2°C and relative humidity of
50 to 80 percent. Retest this cement as
described in  6.2  and  6.3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
