FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
(Part
1) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on
26
February
1985,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Foundation
and
Substructure
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 There
are various
measures
for seepage
control
which
are given
in
IS  :  8414.1977*;
one of which is grout
curtain.
This standard
covers the
design of grout curtain
for earth and rockfill
dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Design
requirements
for a grout
curtain
depend
on its function,
for
example,
when the grout curtain
is designed
to function
as the
principal
measure
of seepage
control
and it constitutes
the main
seepage
barrier,
it shall be of adequate
depth and width
and the permeability
within
the
grouted
zone shall be reduced
to acceptable
limits.
On the other
hand
the grout
curtain
may
be considered
as a complementary
measure
of
other seepage
control
measures.
In such cases the curtain
is essentially
an exploratory
line of closely spaced
holes aimed
at sealing the wider and
more open cracks
and voids
so that
the efficacy
of the system
is
not
impaired
by excessive
concentrated
seepage
along the major
cracks joints
and voids.
The method
of grouting
is covered
in IS  :  6066-1985t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4
This
standard
is being
prepared
in two parts;
Part
2 covering
masonry
and concrete
dams is under
preparation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is
complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off
in accor-
dance
with IS  :  2-1960:.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in
the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
covers the design
of grout
curtains
in alluvium
and
rock when used as principal
measure
of seepage
control.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GROUT CURTAINS
IN ALLUVIUM<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Choice of Number of Rows of Grout Holes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1  In
alluvium
and
other
type
of pervious
soils,
multiple
rows of
holes are necessary
for effective
sealing
when
the curtain
constitutes
the
principal
seepage
barrier.
The
choice
of numbers
of rows of holes is
governed
by the following
considerations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
In heterogeneous
formations
effective
sealing may be achieved
on
the central
row or rows, the outer rows being employed
primarily
to block the open passage
and seal the larger
voids so that
over
travel of the more fluid grout injected
through
the central
rows is
prevented;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The
curtain
width
should
be
adequate
to ensure
adequate
resistance
to leaching
and internal
erosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Resistance of Grout to Internal Erosion and Leaching<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  The
ratio
of the width
of the curtain
to
the
hydraulic
head
across the curtain
depends
on the nature
of the grout
material
and the
formation
treated
by the grout.
Clay cement
and bentonite
cement
grout
injected
into
coarse
sand
and
gravel
are
known
to
have
withstood
hydraulic
gradients
as high as 7 : 1.
Prolonged
laboratory
tests
of one
year
duration
have
indicated
virtual
permanence
of
the clay-cement-
bentonite
grout
for specimens
of grouted
sand
and
gravel
subjected
to
gradients
as high as 20.
On the other hand the softer
bentonite
silicate
grouts used for treatment
of medium
sand may be eroded
at gradients
of
the order of 10. For permanent
curtains
hydraulic
gradient
for bentonite
silicate
grout
have
been
restricted
to
3  :  1.
Bentonite
silicate
grouts
should be used with caution
since their behaviour
is very much dependent
on the nature
of bentonite,
and its reaction
with the fluidifier
and salts in
the soil.
,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Silicate
aluminate
gels are known
to be stable and are known
to
withstand
hydraulic
gradients
of 4  :  1 or even
higher.
Data
presently
available
indicate
that acrylamide
grout are permanent.
The permanence
of other types of
grouts need to be investigated,
and their application
is
not
advised
for
important
and
permanent
curtains.
For
permanent
curtains
choice
of grout
materials
is generally
limited
to clay
cement,
bentonite
and silicate
aluminate
grouts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.3 Curtain Width<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3.1  The
curtain
width
should
be ‘chosen
on the basis
of following
criteria:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The curtain
width at the core contact
should match the core base,

GROUT CURTAINS IN PERVIOUS SOILS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
main
curtain
should
extend
to rock
or impervious
stratum
and the width should be reduced
from the width at core
contact
to the main curtain
width.
Usually
this is achieved
in a zone of
about 2 the depth of the pervious
alluvium;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main curtain
should have two or more rows depending
upon
the requirements
of strata.
For
clay
cement
silicate
aluminate
grouting
the main curtain
should have a width of l/7 head;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
residual
head,
downstream
of the curtain
measured
as excess
head with regard
to tail water should be 20 percent
or
lower
of
the total head from tail water to head water.
This
reduction
in
head is achieved
by appropriate
choice
of curtain
width and
by
bringing
about
sufficient
of permeability
in the
curtain
width.
Usually
grouting
is effective
when the post-grouting
permeability
values are brought
down to one hundredth
of initial
values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should be at least 6 m.
The depth of blanket
grouting
hole<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2
The normal practice of splitting
the spacing
starting
with
an
initial spacing of 6 to 12 metres is recommended
for each of the rows.
The final spacing would be related to the spacing of joints and normally
3 metres spacing may be necessary, but special geological condition
may
require closer spacing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3 The main curtain would consist of one or more
rows of holes.
In the first row grouting operations
are carried
out by split spacing
method.
If the permeability
can be brought
down to 5 lugeon with a
final spacing of 3 m or larger, a single line curtain
would be adequate.
If further
drilling
and grouting of holes at closer spacing is required,
two line curtain should be preferred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Types
of  Grout  in Rock<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1  Normally for grout curtains in rock, neat cement grout should be
used and if admixtures
are used to reduce cement consumption,
only
non-colloidal
fillers such as fine sand, flyash may be used.
For grout
curtains in rock colloidal
admixtures
such as bentonite
would not be
normally permitted since the addition of bentonite/clay would reduce the
resistance
of
grout to internal
erosion
and
leaching.
Use of such
admixtures
should be combined
with sand
in small quantities,
about
2 percent by weight of cement, to obtain a more pumpable grout mix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Depth
of Curtain<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1 The depth of the curtain
shall be related
to the design of the
drainage
system
and
the
depth
to an essentially
impervious
and
inerodable
rock formation.
In stratified rock and in massive igneous or
crystaline
metamorphic
rock
an impervious
formation
may often be
established
at shallow depth below rock surface and 3 metres would be
sufficient penetration
of the grout curtain into such formations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2 Grouting
cannot be relied upon to prevent internal
erosion
in
clayey or silty gauged zones and solution cavities filled by heterogenous.

<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS t  11293  (  Part  1) -  1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3 In such cases, it is essential to excavate
and backfill seems in the
entire core contact zone and blanket
if necessary
special care is needed
when material filling seams consists of silt and dispersive clay vulnerable
to erosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.4 The grout curtain
should normally
extend to relatively
imper-
vious rock of permeability
3 lugeon or less. When this cannot be realized
due to deep pervious formations
the curtain
should extend
to a depth
ranging from H/3 to  H  with reference to the core and core rock contact.
The greater depth may be necessary up to reservoir head when the rock
contains seams and defects vulnerable to internal erosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
