0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the
Bureau of Indian Standards on 20 December
1988, after the draft finalized by the Flooring
and Plastering Sectional Committee had been
approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.
0.2  These sheets can be used for temporary
applications
for
limited
duration.
Proper
installation methods as suggested by the
manufacturer shall be followed and it is
recommended that due caution should be
exercised in their use under extreme climatic
conditions.
0.3  Purlins provided for bitumen roofing sheets
shall not sag under its own weight during its
life period and shall be spaced 550 mm centre
to centre. Purlins should also be provided on<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>eaves and the maximum overhang of sheets
should be restricted to 75 mm.
0.4  This edition 1.2 incorporates Amendment
No. 1 (January 1993) and Amendment No. 2
(April 1999). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the
amendments.
0.5  For the purpose of deciding whether a
particular requirement of this standard is
compiled with, the final value, observed or
calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall
be rounded off in accordance with IS : 2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in
the rounded off value should be the same as
that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
