<<HEADING level=1>>( Third Revision )<<HEADING_END>>

F O R E W O R D<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Third Revision) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 21 December 1984, after the draft finalized
by the Building Limes Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Lime has been used in India as a material of construction from
very ancient days. The manner in which lime structures about 2 000
years old have withstood the ravages of time bear irrefutable evidence
to the durability of lime mortars.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  The vastness of the country and its varied geological character has
made available several types of limestones suitable for burning to
obtain building limes. Due to the variability of limestone from place to
place the resulting lime may be expected to vary in quality. While it
has not been found possible to make strict comparison of
characteristics of the many types of limes obtained, this aspect has
been given full consideration in the preparation of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  The method of manufacturing building limes and the manner in
which they are used in construction work differ from one part of the
country to another. For instance, in the south, lime mortar is
generally prepared by grinding a mixture of slaked lime and sand in
suitable proportions in a bullock mill while in Punjab, lime putty is
mixed with sand and the mix used as mortar directly. Besides, defects
caused by adulteration with undesirable admixtures, differences in
the method of burning, slaking, storing and using have appreciably
affected the quality of lime and in the absence of suitable standards
for checking the quality, the use of lime in building construction has
come to be discouraged to a large extent. At a time when necessity has
been felt to make full use of our construction material resources, the
formulation of a specification for building limes and its adoption are
expected to bring about a more judicious use of limes for construction
purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 712 - 1984<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  This standard was first published in 1956 to bring out a long felt
need for uniformity in the variety of practices being followed towards
manufacture and use of lime in construction work. The standard was
subsequently revised in 1964 and in 1973. This revision has been
taken up to keep abreast with the developments and modifications
found necessary with the usage of this standard. In this revision,
requirements for dolomitic limes which are manufactured and used in
large quantity in some parts of the country have been added, and the
existing chemical requirements and fineness have been modified to
recognise and utilize certain type of lime, which otherwise was not
covered. The requirement for cementation value has been deleted as it
is not directly relevant in case of lime.
0.6  This edition 4.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (January 1989).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.
0.7  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the requirements for building limes used for
construction purpose.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  For the purpose of this standard, the definitions given in
IS : 6508-1972† shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. CLASSIFICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Building limes shall be classified as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Class A — Eminently hydraulic lime used for structural purposes.
Class B — Semi-hydraulic lime used for masonry mortars, lime
concrete and plaster undercoat.
Class C — Fatlime
used
for
finishing
coat in plastering,
whitewashing, composite mortars, etc, and with
addition of pozzolanic materials for masonry mortar.
Class D— Magnesium/dolomitic lime used for finishing coat in
plastering, white washing, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The hydrated lime shall be supplied, in suitable containers, such
as jute bags lined with polythene or high density polythene woven
bags lined with polythene or craft paper bags, preferably containing
50 kg of lime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — If the hydrated lime can be used within 30 days, use of liner may be
dispensed with.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  The quicklime shall be supplied in containers like metal container
or similar suitable containers preferably containing 50 kg of lime.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. MARKING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  The lime packages shall bear the type and class of lime, the brand
name of manufacturer, date of manufacture and the net weight; in
case of quicklime the slaking temperature shall be indicated.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A-2. PROCEDURES FOR SAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1 General  — Sampling shall be carried out as quickly as possible
so that the material does not deteriorate. The total time occupied in
mixing and quartering down the composite samples, and the
preparation of the final test samples from this shall not exceed two
hours. The final samples shall be three in number and shall be placed
immediately in clean, dry and air-tight containers. When testing is
not to be carried out at once, the samples shall be enclosed, marked
and sealed to the satisfaction of all concerned, paying special
attention to the air-tightness of the containers. Tools and containers
shall be of material free from rust and shall be alkali resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.2 Sampling  — From each lot, three final test samples shall be
taken as provided under  A-2.2.1  for quicklime and under  A-2.2.2  for
hydrated lime.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2.1.1  When the lump quicklime or powdered quicklime is
available in bulk, the gross sample shall be made up of at least 50
equal portions taken from the lot at equal intervals of loading or
unloading to make up the prescribed gross sample size. For stationary
lots, the gross sample shall be collected from different parts of the
stock pile in not less than 50 equal portions. The gross sample
collected in the above manner shall be thoroughly mixed on a clean
dry surface to about 20 kg for lump quicklime and 10 kg for powdered
quicklime by coning and quartering method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2.1.2  When the lump quicklime or powdered quicklime is
presented for sampling in packages, at least 25 percent of the
packages shall be opened and equal portions of the material shall be
collected from different parts of the packages to make up the
prescribed gross sample size. The gross sample collected in the above
manner shall be thoroughly mixed on a clean dry surface to about
20 kg for lump quicklime and 10 kg for powdered quicklime by coning
and quartering method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.2.2   Hydrated Lime —  The final samples, each of not less than
5 kg, shall be taken direct in the same manner as described under
A-2.2.1.1  and  A-2.2.1.2  for powdered quicklime.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.3 Material for Physical and Chemical Tests  — Subsequently, at
the time and place at which the tests and chemical analysis are to be
carried out, the sample taken as described under  A-2.2.1  and  A-2.2.2
shall be crushed to pass through 2.36 mm IS Sieve and thoroughly mixed.
Slightly more quantity of lime than is sufficient for conducting the tests
shall be taken. For chemical tests only, from the material finally chosen, a
small quantity from the sample shall be ground and rejected in order to
ensure absence of contamination in the grinding equipment; and then<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
