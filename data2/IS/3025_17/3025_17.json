Principle \u2014 Non-filterable residue is determined by passing the sample through a weighed filter\nand drying the filter at 103-105\u00b0C or 179-181\u00b0C. Non-filterable residue is calculated from the\nincrease in mass of the filter.\n3. Apparatus\n3.1Filters \u2014 One of following may be used.\n3.1.1Gooch crucible \u2014 30ml capacity with 2.1, 2.4 or 5.5cm diameter (pore size 1.2 \u00b5m) glass fibre\nfilter disc. (Whatman GF/C or equivalent.)\n3.1.2Crucible \u2014 Porous-bottom silica, sintered glass, porcelain, stainless steel or Alundum crucible\nwith a maximum pore size of 5 \u00b5m.\n3.1.3Glass fibre filter disc \u2014 (Whatman GF/C or equivalent) 2.1 to 5.5cm in diameter, pore size\n1.2\u00b5m.\n3.2Filtering Apparatus \u2014 Depending on type of filter used.\n3.3Drying Oven \u2014 With a thermostatic control for maintaining temperature up to 180 \u00b1 2\u00b0C.\n3.4Desiccator \u2013 Provided with a colour indicating desiccant.\n3.5Analytical Balance \u2014 200g capacity and capable of weighing to nearest 0.1mg.\n3.6Magnetic Stirrer \u2014 With teflon coated stirring bars.\n4. Procedure\n4.1Preparation of Glass Fibre Filter Disc \u2014 Place the glass fibre filter on the membrane filter\napparatus or insert into bottom of a suitable Gooch crucible with wrinkled surface up. While vacuum\nis applied, wash the dish with three successive 20ml volumes of distilled water. Remove all traces of\nwater by continuing to apply vacuum after water has passed through. Remove filter from membrane\nfilter apparatus (or both crucible and filter, if Gooch crucible is used) and dry in an oven at 103-105\u00b0C\nfor 1hour. Transfer to a desiccator and weigh after half an hour. Repeat the drying cycle until a\nconstant mass is obtained (mass loss is less than 0.5mg in successive weighings). Weigh immediately\nbefore use. After weighing, handle the filter or crucible filter with forceps or tongs only.\n4.1.1If determinations are to be carried out at 180\u00b0C then the filter or crucible/filter shall be dried\nat180\u00b0C.\nNote \u2014 If fixed non-filterable residue is to be determined subsequently then silica, Alundum or porcelain filters should be\nused. These should be heated to 550\u00b0C in the furnace for at least 30 minutes, cooled in the desiccator and weighed.\n4.2Sample Volume \u2014 In potable waters non-filterable residue is usually small. Relatively large\nvolume of water is passed through filter so as to obtain at least 2.5mg residue. For deciding volume\nto be taken, turbidity values may be taken into consideration. If turbidity values of a sample is less\nthan 50 units, filter 1litre sample and if turbidity value exceeds 50 units, filter sufficient sample so\nthat non-filterable residue is 50 to 100mg.\n4.3Stir volume of sample with a magnetic stirrer or shake it vigorously. Assemble the filtering\napparatus and begin suction. Wet the filter with a small volume of distilled water to seat it against\nthe fitted support.",

These should be heated to 550\u00b0C in the furnace for at least 30 minutes, cooled in the desiccator and weighed.         |            |               |\n| 4.2Sample Volume \u2014 In potable waters non-filterable residue is usually small.

For deciding volume                        |            |               |\n| to be taken, turbidity values may be taken into consideration.
