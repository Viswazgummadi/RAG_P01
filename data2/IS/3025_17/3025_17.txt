<<HEADING level=3>>1. Scope —  Prescribes a gravimetric method for the determination of non-filterable residue. This
method is applicable to all types of water and waste water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Principle  — Non-filterable residue is determined by passing the sample through a weighed filter
and drying the filter at 103-105°C or 179-181°C. Non-filterable residue is calculated from the
increase in mass of the filter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Filters  — One of following may be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.1  Gooch crucible —  30 ml capacity with 2.1, 2.4 or 5.5 cm diameter (pore size 1.2  µ m) glass fibre
filter disc. (Whatman GF/C or equivalent.)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.2  Crucible  — Porous-bottom silica, sintered glass, porcelain, stainless steel or Alundum crucible
with a maximum pore size of 5  µ m.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.3  Glass fibre filter disc  — (Whatman GF/C or equivalent) 2.1 to 5.5 cm in diameter, pore size
1.2  µ m.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Filtering Apparatus  — Depending on type of filter used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Drying Oven  — With a thermostatic control for maintaining temperature up to 180 ± 2°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Desiccator  – Provided with a colour indicating desiccant.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5  Analytical Balance  — 200 g capacity and capable of weighing to nearest 0.1 mg.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6  Magnetic Stirrer  — With teflon coated stirring bars.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Preparation of Glass Fibre Filter Disc  — Place the glass fibre filter on the membrane filter
apparatus or insert into bottom of a suitable Gooch crucible with wrinkled surface up. While vacuum
is applied, wash the dish with three successive 20 ml volumes of distilled water. Remove all traces of
water by continuing to apply vacuum after water has passed through. Remove filter from membrane
filter apparatus (or both crucible and filter, if Gooch crucible is used) and dry in an oven at 103-105°C
for 1 hour. Transfer to a desiccator and weigh after half an hour. Repeat the drying cycle until a
constant mass is obtained (mass loss is less than 0.5 mg in successive weighings). Weigh immediately
before use. After weighing, handle the filter or crucible filter with forceps or tongs only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1  If determinations are to be carried out at 180°C then the filter or crucible/filter shall be dried
at 180°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note  — If fixed non-filterable residue is to be determined subsequently then silica, Alundum or porcelain filters should be
used. These should be heated to 550°C in the furnace for at least 30 minutes, cooled in the desiccator and weighed.
4.2  Sample Volume  — In potable waters non-filterable residue is usually small. Relatively large
volume of water is passed through filter so as to obtain at least 2.5 mg residue. For deciding volume
to be taken, turbidity values may be taken into consideration. If turbidity values of a sample is less
than 50 units, filter 1 litre sample and if turbidity value exceeds 50 units, filter sufficient sample so
that non-filterable residue is 50 to 100 mg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3  Stir volume of sample with a magnetic stirrer or shake it vigorously. Assemble the filtering
apparatus and begin suction. Wet the filter with a small volume of distilled water to seat it against
the fitted support.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4  Shake the sample vigorously and quantitatively transfer the predetermined sample volume
selected according to  4.2  to the filter using a graduated cylinder. Remove all traces of water by
continuing to apply vacuum after sample has passed through.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5  With suction on, wash the graduated cylinder, filter non-filterable residue with portions of
distilled water allowing complete drainage between washings. Remove all traces of water by
continuing to apply vacuum after the wash water has passed through.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

103-105°C or 179-181°C for at least 1 hour. Cool in a desiccator and weigh. Repeat the drying cycle
till constant mass is obtained. Alternatively, remove crucible and filter from crucible adapter, wipe
dry from outside with filter paper and dry at 103-105°C or 179-181°C in an oven. Cool in a
desiccator and weigh. Repeat the drying cycle to constant mass till the difference in the successive
