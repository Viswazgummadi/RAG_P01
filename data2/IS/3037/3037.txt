FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 4 July
1986,
after
the draft
finalized
by
the
Waterproofing
and Damp-proofing
Sectional
Committee
had been appro-
ved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number
of materials
for waterproofing
of
roofs
are
available.
Bitumen
mastic
is one of them and this standard
is intended
to provide
the required
guidance
in the proportioning
of bitumen
and aggregates
to
get bitumen
mastic suitable
for waterproofing
purposes.
The
choice
of
materials
and proportioning
aims
at obtaining
(a) the densest
mix
to
ensure
imperviousness,
(b) the required
flexibility
of
the
mastic
layer
after it is laid, and (c) sufficient
workability
to ensure ease of application.
This mastic
is intended
for hot application.
For flat surface,
both
air-
blown and steam
refined
grades
of bitumen
are used within
the limits
specified.
For steeply
inclined
and vertical
surfaces,
however,
airblown
bitumen
within the limits specified
may prove more suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This standard
was first published
in 1965.
The
present
revision
in-
corporates
the
changes
necessary
due to developments
and revision
of
other standards
referred
to in the standard.
In this revision,
the require-
ment
of solubility
of bitumen
in
carbon
tetrachloride
and
trichloro-
ethylene
has been added in the physical
properties
of bitumen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.5 This
standard
is one of a series of Indian
Standard
specifications
on
materials
for use in waterproofing
and damp-proofing
of buildings.

specifications
published

AND CRITERIA
FOR CONFORMITY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 During
Discharge
from
Miser
-
Three
or more separate
portions
of not less than 5 kg each of bitumen
mastic
shall be taken
at intervals
during
the discharge
of the mixer.
The
specimen
shall include
portions
taken at beginning
or at the end of the discharge
except
in
cases

to the mixer
the first and last portions
dischar-
ged
is followed.
The
portions
shall
then
be
thoroughly
mixed
at a
temperature
range
of 150 to 205°C.
The
mixture
shall be floated out on
an iron plate with the aid of a wooden
float to a thickness
not less than
25 mm.
While still warm,
the specimen
shall be loosened
from the plate,
and
a
representative
portion
weighing
not
less than
5 kg,
shall
be
forwarded
to the laboratory
for examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  Blocks
-
Material
in
block
form
shall
be
sampled
by
taking
approximately
equal
amounts,
in pieces, from not less than 6 blocks taken
at random.
The total specimen
of not less than 5 kg, shall be forwarded
to the laboratory
for examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Criteria
for Conformity
-
The bitumen
mastic
shall be conside-
red as conforming
to this specification
if the requirements
given

and 6.1 are satisfied.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  MARKING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  If cast into blocks
for storage,
the date and name
of the
manufac-
turer shall be indicated
suitably.<<HEADING_END>>

The IS1 Mark on producti covered by an Indian Standard
conveys the asurance
that they have been produced
to comply
with the require-
ments of that standard under a well-defined system of inspection, testing and quality
control which is devised and supervised by IS1 and operated by the
producer.
IS1

are also continuously
checked
by IS1 for
conformity
to that
standard as a further safeguard.
