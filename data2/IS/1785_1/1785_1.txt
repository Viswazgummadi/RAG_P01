FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
( Part I ) ( Second
Revision
) was
adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
011  14 March
1983,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Joint
Sectional
Committee
for Concrete
Reinforcement
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
This standard
was first published
in 1961 and was revised
in 1966.
In the first revision,
the standard
was published
in two parts, one cover-
,
ing the requirements
of-stress-relieved
plain wire
which
was
a revision
of the 1961 version
of the
standard
and
the
other
covering
as-drawn
plain
wire
for
the
first
time.
with
a view
to modifying
The present
revision
has been taken up
the
earlier
requirements
in the light ofex-
perience
gained
in using
this
specification
by
both
manufacturers
and
,
users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In this revision,
modifications
have been
incorporated
in
provisions
relating
to
chemical
conrposition,
tolerance
on nominal
diameter
and
requirements
of relaxation
and stress corrosion.
Further,
SI units
have
been
adopted
in specifying
the physical
requirements.
References
to
related
Indian
Standards
also have been updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In
the
formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given
to international
co-ordination
among
the
standards
and
practices
pre-
vailina
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in
the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accord-
ance with IS  :  Z-1960”.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the
rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in this
sthndard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
