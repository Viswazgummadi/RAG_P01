has been approved
as suitable

as an Indian
Standard
without

Certain conventions
are, however, not identical to those used in Indian Standards.
Attention
is particularly
drawn to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wherever
the words ‘International
Standard’
appear referring to this standard,
they should be read as
‘Indian Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the adopted

<<PARAGRAPH>>- this
part
of 1S0 9992
supports
the
use
of a single
application
or
multiple
applications
in an ICC. When
more
than
one
application
exists
in
the
ICC,
multiple
applications
of the same
type
of service
(e.g.
electronic
chequebook)
may
be
present.
Applications
may be added
to the
ICC at any
time during
its life cycle, with
the agreement
of the issuer,
and
according
to security
rules
defined
in 1S0 10202.
An application
may
be
logically
deleted
from
the
ICC
at
any
time
during
its life cycle, in accordance
with agreed
procedures
between
the operating
parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Introduction<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
concepts
on which
this
part
of 1S0 9992
has
been
developed
are
based
upon
the
following
considerations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>- this
part
of 1S0 9992 provides
compatibility
with
existing

standards
referenced
in

2 and
is
intended
to

the flexibility
to accommodate
future

customer
possesses
for
verification
of identity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the  purpose
of this International
Standard,
the following
definitions
apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>response:
A message
returned
to the initiator
after
the
processing
of a command
to
the
recipient.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Application
Data
File
(ADF):

<<HEADING level=3>>4  Concepts and structures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Logical
structure
of the data within
tbe
Icc<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>command:
A request
or advice message
which
initiates
an
action
and
which
solicits
a
response.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The logical
data
structure
enables
an ICC to
support,
with
the
minimum
duplication
of
data,
services
independent
from
each
other.
These
services
may
be provided
by different
application
suppliers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Common
Data File (CDF):
A mandatory
file
that contains
the common
data elements
stored
in the ICC and used
to describe
the card,
the
card issuer
and the cardholder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Data
that
may
be
used
by
all
services
supported
by an ICC (e.g. PAN,
card
expiry
date)
are contained
in the Common
Data
FiIe
(CDF).
Only one CDF shall
be present
in an
ICC. The card
issuer
shall
be responsible
for
the presence,
contents
and use of the CDF.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iile:
An organised
set of data
elements
andlor
program
code in the ICC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>function:
A process
accomplished
by one or
more commands
and resultant
actions
which is
used to perform
all or part of a transaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Data
stored
in an ICC to service
a business
transaction
is contained
in the CDF and/or
in
an Application
Data
File (ADF).
One or more
ADF maybe
present
in an ICC to accommodate
different
financial
and non-financial
services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Integrated
Circuit Card (ICC):
An ID-1 type
card (see 1S0 7810) into which has been
embedded
one or more integrated
circuits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>message:
An
ordered
series
of characters
transmitted
from the CAD to the ICC
or vice-
versa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An
ICC
may
contain
a CDF
without
the
presence
of an ADF.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Primary
Account
Number
(PAN):
The
assigned
number
that identities
the card issuer
and cardholder.
This number
is composed
of an
issuer
identification
number,
individual
account
identification,
and
an accompanying
check digit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Interactions
between
the ICC
and
the
CAD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ICC and the CAD interact
using messages.
These
messages,
which
are
commands
and
their
responses,
are
used
to
accomplish
functions
which are part or all of a transaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A function
as
described
in
4.3.1
shall
be
accomplished
using
one
or
more
pairs
of
messages.
These
messages
are commands
(e.g.
read,
write)
and
their
responses
(e.g.
acknowledgement,
data).
After
processing
a
command,
resulting
in a decision
and/or
an
action,
the receiver
shall
return
a response
to
the sender.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

it imply
that

may be accomplished
by a single command
