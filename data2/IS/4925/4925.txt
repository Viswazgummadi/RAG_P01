FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards i Institution
on 14 December
1968, after the draft. finalized by the Construcl  itr17
Plit:~
I
and Machinery
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by- l.hc  Cl:;ii

central
batching
plants or batching
and mixing
plants
arc
~cneraii)
used.
The plant is erected in a suitable central
position and either the
mixed concrete is directly transported from it to the working sites, or the
dry aggregates or dry mix of concrete is delivered to site mixers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
These plants are usually specially designed to suit the local condi-
tions and the output required.
Small plants may have an output of as
low as 30 m3 of mixed concrete
per hour, medium plants may have the
output in the range of 100 to 300 m3 of mixed concrete per hour and large
plants may have an output of over 300 m3 of mixed concrete per hour.,
The plants may be manually
controlled,
semi-automatic
or fully auto-
matic ( see 5.1 ).
The composition of the plant may also vary depending
upon the type and composition
of aggregates,
cement,
admixtures for
concrete, and various other requirements,
such as temperatmc
control of
aggregates,
mixing
water
and concrete
and above
all t11c quality of
concrete expected from the plant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.2
This performance oriented specification lays down general require-
ments and guide lines for medium and large size centralized bnlching plants
with the object of providing guidance
to prospective
users and manufac-
turers and for guiding the purchaser in covering all the requisite
technical
points
in the enquiry
or tender
notice,
and to define the same more
precisely
while
placing
the order on the manufacturer.
With suitable
modifications,
the specification may also be used for small plants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In view of intricate
nature
of’ such plants
and of the variety
of
combination
of ancillary equipment that may be required
under different
conditions, information on many aspects may have to be supplied both by
the user for the guidance of the manufacturer
and by the tnanufacturer
to
the prospective user, to obtain a true comparative
assessment of different
plants
available
and
to ensure that the plant selected is suited to the
conditions prevailing.
For this reason, the specification
contains clauses<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>which call for agreement
between the purchaser
and the supplier and
which permit
the purchaser
to use ,his option for selection to suit his
requirements.
These clauses are 3.1, 3.1.1, 3.2, 4.2, 5.4, 5.6, 6.5, 7.2, 6.2
and 9.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS: 2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>off
valu:
should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard covers the requirements
