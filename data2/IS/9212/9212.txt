<<HEADING level=3>>REASONS FOR SELECTING PRESSURES FOR LOW-PRESSURE
WARNING
DEVICE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-l.
The adopted
values
have been chosen
for the reasons outlined
in  A-l.1
and A-1.2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-l .?  Tolerance
-
The tolerance
chosen
provides
ease of manufacture.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l .2  Pressures
-
The maximum
pressure
of 500 kPa is low enough
to ensure
that the warning
device functions
only in the case of an actual
defect.
This
allows
the corresponding
value
not to
be reached too frequently.
At the same time the minimum
pressure
of 450 kPa is high enough,
for
this value of the pressure,
to prevent
any serious
brake failure,
and to ensure
that the vehicle
is
still
able to run with some degree of safety
before the-emergency
brake comes into operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ThisIndian
Standard
aims at providing
the acceptable
values
for pressure
in compressed
air
lines of road vehicles
and the trailers
connected
to these
road vehicles.
This standard
is expected
to provide
the data for vehicle
manufacturers
and to be used as basis of agreement
between
the
vehicle
manufacturers
and braking
systems
manufacturers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
is in entire agreement
with ISO/R1186-1970
‘ Pressure
in brake lines and braking
efficiency
‘,  issued
by International
Organization
for Standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
