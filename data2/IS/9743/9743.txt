<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermal Insulation
Materials Sectional Committee,
CHD 27<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard (First Revision) was adopted
by the
Bureau of Indian
Standards
on 20
February
1990, after the draft finalized by the Thermal Insulation
Materials
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Finishing cements are used in conjunction
with thermal insulating
materials
and should,
therefore,
be compatible
with them.
These materials are used as finishing cements,
both
for
hot and cold
insulation work.
For low temperature,
a vapour barrier
has
to be used and for
outdoor
jobs
suitable water proofing
should be done.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Finishing cements are generally supplied as dry powders,
which are mixed with water
in suitable
proportions,
applied in plastic form, and dried or set in place to form
a hard and smooth
surface
( SYC 6.3.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The materials are of four types
( see 4.1 ).
Hard-setting
and gypsum
plaster
compositions
are
suitable for indoor applications,
while self-setting cements are
suitable
for outdoor
applications.
This standard does not prescribe requirements
for setting time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hard setting compositions
do not contain hydraulic
setting agents
and setting
time depends upon
the rate at which the mixing water is either absorbed into the underlying
insulation
or evaporated
from the surface, or both.
Hard-setting
compositions
reasonably
set in 5 to 6 hours,
although
complete
drying may take much longer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Self-setting cements are hydraulic
setting and only such quantity
as can be used within
1 hour
should be mixed at one time.
The time
for
the cement
to take an initial set depends upon the
absorbancy
of the underlying
insulating material.
On absorbent
material
the cement
takes its
initial set and can be compacted
and finally trowelled in 2 to 3 hours.
On non-absorbent
or only
slightly
absorbent material the initial
set may take
up to 12 hours.
Final
drying
out of these
cements depends on the ambient temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gypsum plaster compositions
set much more
rapidly
and only
as much
as can be used within
30 minutes should be mixed at one time.
These compositions
generally
set hard
over
absorbent
or non-absorbent
insulation
materials within 1 hour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 198  1.  Based on the experience
gained
during
the
period, it
has been decided to revise this standard
incorporating
the following changes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Inclusion of another type of finishing cement, namely, fire-proof
finishing cements;
b) Stipulation
of mixing proportions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Deletion
of Aexural strength for Types 2 and 3;
d) Reduction
of-soaking heat temperature
from 150°C to 100°C; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Aligning of Table 1 and Clause B-2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test, or analysis,
shall be
rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value iu this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
prescribes
the requirements
for thermal
insulation
finishing
cements, pre-
pared by mixing with water for application
to
insulating materials after they have been applied
at site to the plant or piping systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2 Type 2 finishing
ce&ents
consist
of well
distributed
reinforcing
fibres (  1  part ) with a
hydraulic cement ( 3 parts ) as binder,
with or
without plasticizing agents or fillers.
These set
without the application
of heat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Some of these finishing cements
are used
for
services
at temperatures
below
ambient,
in
which case a vapoti
barrier
is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3 Type 3 finishing cements
set without
the
application
of heat
and
consist
of calcium
sulphate
hemihydrate,
and
well
distributed
reinforcing
fibres, usually to a lower percentage
by mass than for self-setting cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

require-
ments for setting time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
