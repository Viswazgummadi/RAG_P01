<<PARAGRAPH>>NATIONAL FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard which is identical with IS0 898-7  :  1992 ‘Mechanical properties of fasteners -
Part 7  :  Torsional test and minimum torques for bolts and screws with nominal diameters 1 mm to
10 mm’, issued by the, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was adopted by the
Bureau of Indian Standards on the recommendation of Bolts, Nuts and Fasteners Accessories
Sectional Committee, and approval of Light Mechanical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The text of IS0 standard has been approved as suitable for publication as Indian Standard without
deviations. Certain terminology and conventions are however not identical to those used in Indian
Standards. Attention is particularly drawn to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Wherever the words ‘International Standard’ appear, referring to this standard, they should
be read as ‘Indian Standard’, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Comma (J has been used as adecimal marker while in Indian Standards the current practice
is to use a point (.) asthe decimal marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this adopted standard, reference appears to IS0 898-l  :  1988. The Indian Standard IS 1367
(Pan 3)  :  1991 ‘Technical supply conditions for threaded steel fasteners  :  Pan 3 Mechanical
properties and test -methods for bolts, screws and studs with full loadability (third revision)‘, which
is identical with IS0 898-l  :  1988.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

minimum
breaking
torques
can
be
specified for property classes 8.8 to 12.9 only, be-
cause for lower property classes the test results are
widely scattered and therefore more studies are re-
quired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS0 898-l
contains
property classes
for bolts and
screws but only indicates minimum breaking loads
and proof loads for threads equal to or greater than
M3 because in the case of smaller bolts and screws
the inftuence of the thread tolerances~and the toler-
ances of the test device is such that an exact deter-
mination of breakirrg loads and proof loads is not
possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The indicated minimum breaking torques are to be
applied without taking account of friction and the
type of test device is optional according to this part
of IS0 898. Figure 1 is only an example of a suitable
test device.
Also since bolts and screws with threads greater
than M3 UB to annroximatelv

subjected to a tensile test (or proof load test) due to
their short lengths, minimum breaking torques have
