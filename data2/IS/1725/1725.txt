FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 14 April
1982, after the draft finalized
by the Soil
Engineering
and Rock Mechanics
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Development
during
the last two decades in the use of soil based blocks
in different
parts of the world
and the experience
which
has been gained
for nearly
a decade
in the field of construction
in India
hold out a great
promise
for the use of soil based
blocks
in general
building
construction,
particularly
in low-cost
structures.
Experience
shows that most soils can
be satisfactorily
stabilized
with cement-lime.
It is, however,
necessary
to
conduct
comprehensive
tests on soils in a laboratory
in order to determine
the optimum
requirements
to give the specified properties.
While in general
building
construction
soil based
blocks
may be used as a substitute
for
bricks,
their use should
be avoided
in the case of isolated
load bearing
columns,
piers and such other heavily loaded
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 This standard
was first published
in 1960. Based on further
studies
conducted,
this revision
has been prepared.
The principal
modification
is
in respect
of weathering
test, which
has been
prescribed
as per studies
conducted
at Indian
Institute
of Science,
Bangalore.
The revision
now
covers all types of soil based blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the requirements and test for soil based blocks for
use in general building construction.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. GENERAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Soil based blocks shall be manufactured
from a mixture of suitable
soil and ordinarily portland cement or lime pozzolana mixture thoroughly
mixed together, preferably in a mechanical mixer.
The mixture is moulded
and cast into blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. CLASSIFICATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The blocks shall be of two classes, Class 20 and Class 35 (see 5.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. SIZES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 There shall be three sizes of soil-cement blocks, the dimensions of
which shall be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1 Twenty ( more according to the size of stack) whole blocks shall
be selected at random from the sample selected under 6. All blisters, loose
particles of clay and small projections
shall be removed.
They shall then
be arranged upon a level surface successively in contact with each other
and in a straight line.
The overall length of the assembled blocks shall be
measured
with
a steel tape or other
suitable
inextensible
measures
sufficiently long to measure the whole row at one stretch.
Measurement by
repeated application
of short rule or measure shall not be permitted.
If,
for any reason, it is found impracticable
to measure blocks in one row, the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  1725 - 1982<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>sample may be divided into rows of 10 blocks each, which shall be
measured separately to the nearest millimetre.
All these dimensions shall
be added together.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Each block shall also have a frog one centimetre deep and 10 x 4 cm
on one of its flat sides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  PHYSICAL
REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Compressive Strength - The blocks when tested in accordance
with
the procedure laid down in IS: 3495 ( Part I )-1976* shall have a minimum
average compressive
strength of not less than 20 kgf/cmZ for Class  20
and 30 kgf/cm2 for Class 30.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1 The compressive
strength of any individual
block shall not fall
below the minimum average compressive strength by more than 20 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Water Absorption - The block when tested in accordance
with the
procedure laid down in IS: 3495  (  Part II )-19767, after immersion in cold
water for 24 hours, an average
water absorption
shall not be more
than 15 percent by weight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Weathering - When tested
in accordance
with Appendix
A, the
maximum loss of weight shall not exceed 5 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. SAMPLING
AND CRITERIA
FOR CONFORMITY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Sampling and criteria for conformity
of the blocks shall be done in
accordance with the procedure laid down in IS: 5454-1978:.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. MARKING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Each block shall be marked
in the frog with the manufacturer’s
identification mark or initials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1 The manufacturers
may also use the IS1 Certification Mark.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-The
use of the ISI Certification
Mark
is governed
by the provisions
of the Indian
Standards
Institution
( Certification
Marks ) Act and the Rules
and Regulations
made thereunder.
The IS1 Mark
on products
covered
by an
Indian Standard
conveys the assurance
that they have been produced
to
comply
with the requirements
of that standard
under a well-defined
system of inspection,
testing and quality control
which is devised
and supervised
by IS1 and operated
by the producer.
IS1 marked
products
are also continuously
checked
by IS1 for
conformity
to that standard
as a further
safeguard.
Details
of conditions
under
which a licence
for the use of the IS1 Certification
Mark
may
be granted
to
manufacturers
or processors,
may be obtained

<<HEADING level=3>>WEATHERING
TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l. PRINCIPLE
The parameters
that need be simulated
in the weathering
test are the  (  i  )  rain drop diameter
at impact
(range
in  2  mm for medium
intensity
and 4 mm for high intensity
)  (  ii ) maximum
terminal
velocity
of 6’5 m/set
at impact,
and
(  iii) maximum
intensity
of rainfall,
15-30
mm/hr.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2. TEST SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1  Three
whole
blocks
shall
be selected
from
the sample
of blocks
produced
afrer carrying
out the test for dimensional
conformity.
These
blocks
shall be designated
as specimen
A, B and C respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3. SPRAY TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1 A  set of spray non-rustable
showers
that can produce
a hard spray
all over the block should
be used.
The diameter
of each shower
is 10 cm
with 36 holes of 2 mm diameter.
A facility
for providing
a device pump
to create
a constant
pressure
of l-5 f
0.2 kgf/cm2
should
be available
for
this test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4. PROCEDURE
A-4.1
The block to be tested is to be mounted
on a test rig, such that only
one face is exposed
to shower
and discharged
water
should
find an exit
without
wetting
the other
faces or getting
collected
such that
blocks
get
immersed.
These showers
are placed
at a distance
of 18 cm from the block
and are arranged
by the side, such that
the complete
face gets exposed.
The period of exposure
is limited
to 2 hours
and then the exposed
surfaces
are examined
for possible
pitting.
The tests are carried
out on at least 3
blocks.
The limiting
diameter
of the pit formed
is to be within
1 cm for
passing
this weathering
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
