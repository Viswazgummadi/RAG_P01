<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(  Part
VIII
) was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards’
Institution
on 22 March
1973, after
the draft finalized
by the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by
the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Autoclaved
cellular
concrete
is a class of material,
which
‘has  been
developed
commercially
abroad
and
is in the process
of development
in
this country
also.
A series of Indian
Standards
on cellular
concrete
is
being
formulated
SO as  to provide
guidance
in obtaining
reliable
products
in autoclaved
cellular
concrete.
The
Sectional
Committee
has
consi-
dered
it desirable
to issue a standard
for the methods
of tests for auto-
claved
cellular
concrete
products
for the guidance
of manufacturers
and
users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For convenience
of reference,
‘  Indian
Standard
methods
of tests
for autoclaved
cellular
concrete
products
” has
been
grouped
into
the
following
nine parts:
Part I Determination
of unit

or bulk
density
and
moisture
content
Part II Determination
of drying

In reporting
the result of a test or analysis
made
in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded

with IS  :  2-1960”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This
standard
( Part
VIII
) covers
the method
for the determination
and study of the strength
deformations
and cracking
of flexural
members
such as floor and roof slabs of cellular concrete
subjected
to diagonal
shear
.loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. TEST
SPECIMEN<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Size of the Specimen-The
test specimen
shall
be
the
full
size
member
as to be actually
used in construction
satisfying
the requirements
of the
relevant
Indian
Standard
(or the
requirements
specified
by the
manufacturer
) in respect
of shape and dimensions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2
Condition
of the Test
Specimen<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1
Moisture
Content-The
moisture
content
of the concrete
during
the test should
be indicated
and should
be not less than
10 percent
by
weight,
when detcrminecl
in accordance
with IS  :  6441 ( Part
I )-19721_.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.2
Temperature
of Specimen -
The
temperature
of the concrete
shall
not be materially
different
from
the ambient
temperature
in which
it is
being  tested
and in any
case
not
less
than 6°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. TEST
ARRANGEMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The member
to be tested shall be simply supported
at the ends.
The
supports  shall
consist
of 25 mm* thick
horizontal
mild steel plates bedded
on rigid supports
of steel or concrete.
The
ends of the member
shall be
fully in contact
with the steel plate over the whole width of the member.
The
bearing
width
and the span
used for the test shall
be the same .as<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

METHOD FOR LOADING TEST FOR ‘CELLULAR CONCRETE
FLEXURAL UNITS IN DIAGONAL TENSION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  LOADING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  A single load shall be applied in the proximity of a support through
steel  platen
not less than 25 mm thick, the load extending over the entire
width of the member.
The steel platen shall be embedded on soft fibre-
board packing, not less than 12 mm thick and of the same plan dimensions
as the steel platen.
The packing shall be placed between steel loading
platen and the top of the member.
The width of the steel platen shall
not be less than 100 mm and shall be increased, where necessary, in multi-
ples of 50 mm, so that the contact pressure under the applied load is not
more than 20 percent of the,, compressive strength of .the concrete.
The
distance
between the axial point of application of the load and the inner
edge of the end steel support plate shall be not less than 3 times the depth
of the member ( see Fig. I ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4J.l
The span shall be taken as the distance between the centres of the
bearings ( see Fig- 3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The weigh* of,the loading equipment shall be taken into account in
calculating
the applied load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5. MEASUREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  The
loads shall be measured to an accuracy
of  not  less  than fl.5
percent of the applied load.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The deflection of the member shall be measured at midspan and the
least count of the dial gauge shall be at least 0.01 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Crack widths shall be measured to an accuracy of f0.05
mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 The movement of the end of the main tension reinforcement in relation
to the concrete shall be measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  TEST PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>’
6.1  Zero for the deflection measurements shall be taken immediately
after
the member had been placed in position.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6,2 The loading apparatus shall then be fixed, and the load applied grad-
ually at a rate of a bout l/4 of the design live load per minute.
Measure-
ments shall be taken at suitable intervals.
The load at which a diagonal
tension
crack
has appeared
shall be maintained
for 2 hours.
Loading
shall then be increased until failure occurs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
