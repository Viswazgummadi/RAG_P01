F O R E W O R D<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part XXV) (Second Revision) was adopted
by the Indian Standards Institution on 27 October 1971, after the draft
finalized by the Civil Works Measurement Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Measurement occupies a very important place in the planning and
execution of any civil engineering work from the time of first estimates
to the final completion and settlement of payments for a project.
Methods followed for measurement are not uniform and considerable
differences exist between practices followed by different construction
agencies and also between various Central and State Government
Departments. While it is recognized that each system of measurement
has to be specifically related to administrative and financial
organizations within a department responsible for the work, a
unification of various systems at technical level has been accepted as
very desirable specially as it permits a wider range of operation for
civil engineering contractors and eliminates ambiguities and
misunderstandings of various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  Among various civil engineering items, measurement of buildings
was the first to be taken up for standardization and this standard
having provisions relating to building work was first published in 1958
and was revised in 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  Clause deleted
0.5  Wherever necessary, more information than is demanded by
adherence to this standard may be given, provided the principles of
measurements laid down in this standard are observed and it is in the
interest of accuracy and practical estimating to do so.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6  This edition 3.4 incorporates Amendment No. 3 (April 1981) and
Amendment No. 4 (January 1996). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendments. Amendment
Nos. 1 & 2 had been incorporated earlier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1200 (Part XXV) - 1971<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a measurement, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard (Part XXV) covers the method of measurement of
tunneling.
2. GENERAL RULES
2.1 Clubbing of Items  — Items may be clubbed together and that the
break-up of the clubbed items is agreed to be on the basis of the
detailed description of the items stated in this standard.
2.2 Booking of Dimensions  — In booking dimensions, the order
shall be consistent and generally in the sequence of length, width and
height or depth or thickness.
2.3 Measurements  — All work shall be measured net in decimal
system as fixed in its place as given below
a) Linear dimensions shall be measured to the nearest 0.01 metre,
b) Areas shall be worked out to the nearest 0.01 square metre,
c) Cubic contents shall be worked to the nearest 0.01 cubic metre,
and
d) The weight shall be measured to the nearest 0.1 kilogram.

<<HEADING level=3>>2.7  Clause deleted<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. METHOD OF MEASUREMENT OF EXCAVATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The item of tunnel excavation may be classified as follows:
a) Excavation in tunnel in hard rock not requiring supports.
b) Excavation in tunnel in all classes of soil, soft and hard rock [  see
IS : 1200 (Part 1)-1992* ] requiring temporary or permanent
supports during excavation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — Supports shall be measured separately (  see   4  ).
3.2  The description of the item shall unless otherwise stated to be held
to include drilling, blasting, ventilation, lighting, scaling and hauling
of excavated material and depositing in the area earmarked and
finally clearing the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  The quantity of excavation shall be measured in cubic metres and
shall be the volume of the tunnel measured in solid contained within
hypothetical line as decided by engineer-in-charge (also known as ‘B’
line or pay line) irrespective of whether or not the actual excavation
falls within or beyond the said line subject to excavation up to the
minimum excavation line (‘A’ line), ‘A’ line and ‘B’ line shall be as
defined in IS 4880 (Part 2) : 1976 Code of practice for design of tunnels
conveying water : Part 2 Geometric design (  first revision  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Clause deleted
3.3.1  In case as determined by the engineer-in-charge the minimum
excavation line is increased necessitating enlargement of the already
excavated tunnel, separate measurement of the quantity of the
excavation shall be made. The measurement shall be between the
original ‘B’ line and the revised ‘B’ line that is established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  The layers of soft or disintegrated rock bedded with hard rocks or
seems or faults required to be excavated beyond the pay line being
removed by hand or pneumatic or other implements without requiring
continuous and systematic blasting, shall be measured separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5  Cement consumed at the point of mixing for guniting/shotcreting
required for protection of weak rock shall be measured separately on
weight basis.<<HEADING_END>>

of concrete placed between the formwork or the outside surface of the
steel shell when used and the pay line, which shall be ‘B’ line or pay
line adopted for excavation at the place. The item of concrete lining
shall be inclusive of formwork. No deduction shall be made for the
volume of the reinforcement, but the volume of permanent steel
supports (  see   4.2  ) where provided shall be deducted from the total
