<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 29 March 1990, after the draft
finalized by the Hydraulic Structures Instrumentation
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the
River valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The soil mass is composed of solid soil particles and voids filled with water and air. The constructed
embankment will always contain a certain
volume of air and water within the voids. The air is
compressible while water is highly incompressible. Hence when embankment settles due to compaction
by rolling, or due to self weight, the void space contract.
This causes pressure
in the pore fluid
comprising air and water.
Thus the intergranular
pressure is reduced due to opposing pore pressure
and therefore the shear strength depends upon intergranular
pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pore pressure is also caused due to the seepage of water through an embankment.
The initial energy
head of percolating water at entrance into the dam isgreater
than the-energy heat at any point in the
interior. The difference represents the loss of energy due to friction forces of percolation.
The potential
of the water decreases as it seeps through the dam. Pore pressure due to percolation
is determined by
subtracting the corresponding
elevation
from the flow potential at that point being considered.
Thus
pressure at any point in a dam at any time is the function
of compaction,
consolidation
and seepage.
Procedures for testing the pore pressure cells both in the laboratory
and in the field before installation
are under formulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for
rounding
off numerical
values (  revised)‘.
The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard covers the details of installation,

of electrical

pressure

earth

dams for measuring
the pore

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.1 When
the
gauge-wire
is
caused
to
oscillate, it will vibrate at its resonate
or natural
frequency of vibration
which is dependent on the
tension in the wire. If strains are induced in the
element
on which the gauge is mounted,
the
distance between the support
posts -will change.
Accordingly, the tension in the gauge-wire and its
natural frequency of vibration wihalso be changed.
Thus the change in frequency
of the gauge wire
is a measure of the strain in the sensing element
of the transducer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Code of practice
for selection,
splicing,
installation
and
providing
protection
to the
open ends of cables used for
connecting
resistance
type
measuring devices in concrete
and masonry
dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.2 The main components
of such an instru-
ment are,
porous
filter
element
diaphragm,
vibrating
wire,
electro-magnet
and connecting
cable. The pretensioned
vibrating
wire is such
connected
to the
body of the cell
and the
~diaphragm,
that
the
tension
of
the
wire
changes due to the deflection
of the diaphragm
.only. Due to pore water pressure, the diaphragm
is deflected
and
the
natural
frequency
of
the measuring
wire is altered. The
mechanical
oscillation
of
the
wire
is
converted
to
electrical
frequency
signal by an electro-magnet
and
this
electrical
frequency
is transmitted
through
the cable
to the
receiver
unit and
correlated
to the pore pressure. The frequency of
the wire is independent
of variations
in voltages,
currents and resistance. There are several types
of electrical
piezometers and the main difference
lies in the transducer package, the porous element
and the
arrangement
of
the
body
of
the
piezometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  INSTALLATION EQUIPMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Electrical Pore Pressure Cells<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The electrical
pore pressure
cell has a stainless
steel diaphragm
behind a porous
filter element.
The diaphragm
is deflected
by the pore water
pressure
against one face; the deflection
being
proportional
to
the
applied
pressure.
The
deflection
of the
diaphragm
is
measured
by
means of various
electrical
transducers,
most
common among them being unbounded resistance
strain gauge and vibrating
wire strain gauge.
Electrical piezometers
have very small time lags
and are very sensitive. Hence these are especially
suited in the circumstances
when the fluctuations
in pore pressures
are very quick or in case of
dynamic observations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.1  Vibration Wire Type Pore Pressure Cells<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.3 The pore pressure cell should be structur-
ally isolated from
the surrounding
concrete/earth
so that no apparent
pore pressure are indicated
due to straining of the body of the instrument.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basic principle
of
the vibrating-wire

gauge is that the change in natural frequency
of
vibration
of a stretched
wire depends

<<PARAGRAPH>>cable shall be of sufficient length to reach the
permanent
readout
station. In case of necessity
of joining the cables, proper
splicing kit shall be
used.
The cables should be looped
where they
cross an interface
and at joints,
to reduce the
strain in cables and
joints
due to differential
movement.
When there
are
sufficient
pore
pressure cells to be installed which can .justify use
of an instrument
house, the cables have to be
lead through an entry duct connected to a suitable
terminal
unit. If many pore pressure
cells are
grouped together
closely and the terminal
unit
is relatively far, then suitable junction boxes shall
be used for connecting
individual cables from the
transducers to a multicore
cables, which in turn
connected to the terminal unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Cable<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The electrical
type pore pressure
cells shall be
supplied
with
conductors
of
required
length
( see 3.2.1 ) attached
to the instrument as agreed
by the supplier and the purchaser. The cable type
depends on the different makes of the instruments
and
for
the
details
and
specifications,
the
catalogue of the manufacturer
may be referred to.
In most installations the cable is recommended
to
be further protected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
used
in
adverse
environments,
cables
armoured with steel wires, having two layers of
insulation
with petroleum jelly
filling to prevent
water seepage may be used. It is also recom-
mended that the use of a junction box to connect
several
individual
cables
terminating
in
the
junction
box and a steel armoured,
jelly
filled
multi-core cable of 10,20,40 conductors capability
may be used to connect
these to a termination
switch box installed in the terminal house.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Installation
of Pore
Pressure
Cells
in the
Drill Holes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1  Pore pressure
cells are
installed
in bore
holes drilled, below the foundations
or through
already completed
embankments.
The minimum
diameter
of bore holes shall be 100 mm for cell
diameter
up to 35 mm and
150 mm for cell
diameter above 35 mm and up to 45 mm separate
bore holes shall be drilled for each cell. Casing of
these wholes is usually required
to maintain
the
holes during installation,
depending
on
local
conditions and the type of equipment
available.
The casing should be removed
after
the pore
pressure cell is placed in position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1  Cable Connections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The connection between the pore pressure cell and
the cable of required
length
to connect
to the
readout
unit is generally
done in the
factory
itself and in exceptional
cases when the cable is
too short or has been damaged, the cable connec-
tions are done at site. In such a case care should
be taken to get pressure-tight
connections
using
sealing compound.
The splicing
shall be done
in accordance with IS 10334  :  1982.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Remove the high air entry filter from the
cell and boil it in
clear water for five
minutes to saturate the filter with water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After completion of the cable connections, test the
pore pressure
cell for insulation by means of an
ohmmeter,
the value shall not be less than
500
megaohms
at 12 V. There must -be no electrical
connection
between
each
of
the conductors
and the
metal braiding
or the
body
of the
pore pressure
cell. After
this the pore pressure
cell shall be
checked
for
proper
functioning.
These tests should
be
performed
immediately
after the sealing resin has been applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Reassemble the pore
pressure
cell under
cool water by assembling
the same in a
bucket
of clean water. The bucket
should
be large enough to allow pore pressure cell
to be reassembled
and the. placement
of
the cell inside the cloth bag in submerged
condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Place a cloth bag in the bucket of water
mentioned above-and place some clean sand
in the bag, place the pore pressure cell in the
bag and pack the sand above it as shown
to get the assembly as indicated in Fig.  1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.3  Identjfication of Cable Ends<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After connecting
the cable to the pore pressure
cell the free end of the cable should be marked or
identified
with
permanent
marks by use of a
minimum
of 3 tags at a maximum
spacing of
10 m over the entire exposed length of cable with
non-corrosive
metal tags engraved
or embossed
with appropriate
transducer
numbers. Permanent
identification
is necessary
to
prevent
errors
in
identifying the pore pressure cells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
