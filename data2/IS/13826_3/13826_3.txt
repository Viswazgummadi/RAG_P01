<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD
\<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by’ the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft f?nalize$l
by the Water-proofing
and Damp-proofing
Sectional Committee
hadbeen
approved
by ~the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen
fe!ts
may
be of different
types
depending
upon
the raw material
used and their
construction.
IS 1322  :  1993 Specification
for bitumen felts for water proofing and damp-proofing:
(fourth
revision )  and IS 7193  :  1993 Specification
for glass fibre base coal tar
pitch
and bitumen
felts  (first
revision ),  covers bitumen felts of hessian based and glass fibre base respectively.
The
above
standards
require
amongst
other requirements,
detailed testing of etch of these products.
Various methods of test relatirg
to each product for determination
of physical
properties
have
been included in the separate standards.
All types of felts have to satisfy some common essential
physical
requirements
for which
methods
of test are same.
A series of standards
covering
methods
of test have thertfore
been
formulated
to
cover
the
determination
of physicai,
rrquirements
ef bitumen felt.
This standard
covers
storage
sticking
test.
Other parts of the-
standard are as follows  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the technical
committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard is.
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is ccmplied with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.  The number
of significant
places
retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified,
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
