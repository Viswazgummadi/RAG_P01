Sectional Committee,
CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Second
Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft finalized by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a standard
fine aggregate used for assessing
the quality
of cement,
standard
sand plays a very
important
role in the cement industry.
The
importance
of a standard
sand in industrial
economy
is
evident
from the fact that it is’required
not only as a testing
material in the cement industry but also
as a standard
material to study
the properties
of other
building
materials
like lime and pozzolanas,
various admixtures
to cement and also as a standard
material for determining
the abrasive resistance
of different
substances,
such as building stones. Till the year 1955, the
country’s
requirements
for
standard
sand were met by importing
Leighton-Buzzard
sand from the United Kingdom.
The difficul-
ties and expense of importing this standard
sand from UK led to an investigation
to replace Leighton-
Buzzard
sand by an Indian Standard sand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While formulating
the standard
for Portland cement, the Committee
also felt the necessity of establish-
ing an indigenous standard sand as early as possible. As a result of extensive survey and research carried
out by many organizations,
namely, Geological
Survey of Jndia; Industrial
Research
Bureau; National
Test House;
Concrete
and Soil Research
Laboratory,
Chepauk,
Madras; Hirakud Research
Station;
Hyderabad
Engineering
Research
Laboratory;
the laboratories
of the Associated
Cement
Companies
Ltd; and Dr La1 C. Verman, it was found that the white variety of sand available at Ennore,
Madras
State,
was very pure
in nature
and suitable for use as a standard sand. The thoroughly
washed sand
passing 850-micron
IS Sieve and retained
on 6CO-micron IS Sieve was observed
to satisfy the require-
ments of standard
sand as a substitute
for the imported
sand. Accordingly,
‘the Sectional Committee
formulated
IS 650  :  1955 which reccmmended
Ennore sand passing 850-micron
IS Sieve and not more
than 10 percent
ty mass passing 600-micron
IS Sieve. This grading was the same as that for Leighton-
Buzzard sand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the light of experience
gained with the
practical
use of Indian
Standard
sand ( conforming
to
IS 650  :  1955 ) for testing
the compressive
and tensile
strength of Indian
cement over the period,
certain
drawbacks were observed
in respect
of compressive
and tensile strength values, the quantity
of gauging
water’ and
the reproducibility
of results. The Sectional
Committee
was of the view that
these drawbacks
could be overcome
by revising the grading of Ennore sand. On the recommendations
of the Sectional
Committee,
the Council
of Scientific
and Industrial
Research
sponsored the scheme
of investigations
on ‘Mortar
making properties
of Ennore
sand’ to be carried out at the Concrete
and
Soil Research
Laboratory,
Madras
under
the guidance
of the then
IS1 with
the following main
objects:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) To determine
the
optimum
grading
of Ennore
sand which would
give the highest strength
keeping at the same time, the yield from the quarry as high as possible; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) To introduce
one or more
intermediate
size requirement
in the grading specification
with a
view to controlling
uniformity
of grading
and thus to ensure
better
reproducibihty
of
results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a result
of the above
investigations,
and on the recommendations
of the
Concrete
and Soil
Research
Laboratory,
Madras, the Sectional
Committee
decided to revise the grading of Ennore
sand
to make it more suitable from the technical
and exploitation
point of view and also to bring it in line
with the RlLEM CEMBUREAU
grading of sand for testing of cement
recommended
by the Interna-
tional Organization
for Standardization
( IS0 ). First revision
of the standard
was printed in 1966
mainly with a view to incorporating
the revised grading of standard
sand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Sectional
Committee
records
its deep appreciation
to all those who have assisted in the impor-
tant investigations
related
to regrading
of the standard
sand and in particular
to the Concrete
and
Soil Research
Laboratory,
Madras;
the Central
Road
Research
Institute,
New Delhi; Engineering
Research
