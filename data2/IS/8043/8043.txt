<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee, CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydrophobic cement deteriorates very little during prolonged storage under unfavourable
conditions. This cement is obtained by intergrinding 33 grade ordinary Portland cement clinker
with certain hydrophobic agents which will impart to the cement a water repelling property. The
hydrophobic properties are due to the formation of a water repellant film around each particle of
cement. This film is broken during the mixing of the concrete, and normal hydration takes place.
Hydrophobic cement shall not be confused with waterproofing cements. A test on hydrophobicity is
also included in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first issued as an emergency standard in 1976 and subsequently revised in
1978. Since publication of the first revision of this standard, amendments have been issued from
time to time in order to modify various requirements based on the requirements of the users and
also keeping in view the raw materials and fuel available in the country for manufacture of
cement. The important amendments include modification in the tolerance requirements for the
mass of cement packed in bags, permitting packaging of cement in 25 kg bags, making compulsory
provision for issuing a certificate indicating the total chloride content in percent by mass of
cement, permitting different bags for packing of cement, incorporating details for considering of
supply of cement as bulk supply, etc. In view of these large number of amendments, the
Committee decided to bring out the second revision of this standard incorporating all these
amendments so as to make it convenient for the users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mass of cement packed in bags and the tolerance requirements for the mass of cement packed in
bags shall be in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Standards of Weights and Measures
(Packaged Commodities) Rules, 1977 and  C-1.2  (  see  Annex C for information ). Any modification
in these rules in respect of tolerance on mass of cement would apply automatically to this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Technical Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is
given at Annex D.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 3.3 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (November 1991), Amendment No. 2
(November 1993) and Amendment No. 3 (April 2000). Side bar indicates modification of the text as
the result of incorporation of the amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement obtained by grinding 33 grade ordinary
Portland cement clinker with an additive which
will impart to ground cement, a water repelling

its storage for longer periods in extremely wet
climatic conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

produce a paste of standard consistency.
6.4  By agreement between the purchaser and
