Sectional Committee had been approved by the Heavy Mechanical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Construction

the standards
now covered under
IS 2094 shall be as under  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 2094 (Part 1) Specification

<<PARAGRAPH>>Further, it was decided to withdraw the standards IS 2093 and IS 4198.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In view of convenience
of bulk supply of tar and bitumen
from the suppliers,
there is an increasing
use of
mechanical
distributors in the pavement construction
work, such as surface dressing, soil stabilization
and grouting.
In surface dressing, uniformity
of distribution
of binder across the surface is one of the most important
factors in
achieving
a durable and strong surface.
Time for distributing
binder is very valuable specially
in large pavement
construction
work from the point of view of economy and quality of the finished surface.
Distributors
are being
used by various organizations
because of their unique advantages
over other means.
This standard
has been
prepared with a view to assisting the users in obtaining
distributors
capable of distributing
binder uniformly
to
the specified standard and having a satisfactory
mechanical
efficiency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
includes
a number
of requirements
which are at the option of the purchaser;
for the sake of
convenience
to the purchaser
and the supplier, requirements
to be specified by the purchaser
while making an
enquiry or placing an order for distributors
for hot tar and bitumen have been listed in ‘Annex A’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.1
This annex lays down the method for testing
uniformity
of distribution
of binder across the surface
being sprayed.Various
methods
for determining
the
transverse
uniformity
of distribution
have been
developed, the essential requirements
of which are the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>ci<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test is so arranged that the distributor
can
operate for a sufficient
period to obtain the
normal working conditions,
and when this has
been achieved,
the test surface is exposed to
the discharge for suitable period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The amount of binder delivered on each 5 cm
strip is then measured
and the results
ex-
pressed as a percentage
deviation
from the
mean for all the 5 cm unit over the effective
width.
The effective width is defined as the
sprayed width less than 15 cm margin at each
side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

there being six containers
in 30 cm of spray width.
The rim of each container is lipped on one side in order
