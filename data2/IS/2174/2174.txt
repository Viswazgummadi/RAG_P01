FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
7
September
1962,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Building
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to sizes and constructional
details
for reinforced
concrete
dust bins.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The Sectional
Committee
responsible
for ‘the
preparation
of this standard
has taken into con-
sideration
the views .of producers,
consumers
and
technologists
and
has related
the standard
to the
manufacturing
and trade practices
followed in the
country
in this field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Refuse
collection
and
disposal
is becoming
more
and
more
important
with
the
industrial
development
and the consequent
urbanisation
in
the country.
With the expansion
of existing towns
and the springing
up of new towns, sanitation
and
hygiene have naturally
become
the primary duties
of civic
bodies
and
such
other
organizations.
Hygienic
requirements
necessitate
the collection
of refuse
in well designed
containers
located
at
predetermined
places for its subsequent
disposal.
The
container
or the bin should be such that the
collected
refuse does not leak through or is carried
away by wind; it should also be such that it does
not get damaged
in any manner
under the condi-
tions
normally
met
with
in
actual
practice.
Various
municipalities
and
other
organizations
are already
using dust bins on a large
scale
but
there
is no
uniformity
yet either
m size or in
construction.
This standard
has, therefore,
been
prepared
with a view
to unifying
the
existing
practices
and guiding
manufacturers
with regard<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Wherever
a reference
to any Indian
Standard
appears
in this specification,
it shall be taken
as
a reference
to the latest version
of the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a parti-
cular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2 - 1960
Rules
for
Round.ing
Off Numerical
Values
(  Revised  ) .  The
number
of
significant
places
retained
in
the
rounded
off value
should
be the same as that of
the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 This standard
is intended
chiefly to cover the
technical
provisions
relating
to reinforced
concrete
dust bins, and it does not include all the necessary
provisions
of a contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
