CONSTRUCTION
OF COFFEE SEED
STORAGE STRUCTURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 31 December
1971, after the draft finalized by the Stimulant
Foods
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Agricultural
and Food
Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The damage to coffee seeds due to fungal, microbial and insect attacks
can be minimized to a large extent if coffee seeds are stored in structures
which prevent, as far as practicable,
their entry inside and also if suitable
measures are taken during handling, transport and storage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The damage and pollution of coffee seeds during storage are due to
temperature,
moisture and dampness, insects and rodents.
It is therefore
obvious that in order to conserve coffee seeds they should be stored in sound
structures of different types, each type being suitable for a particular region
in the country and code of practice should be formulated and adopted for
handling, transporting and storing; when such standards become available
and are implemented, they will go a long way in minimising the loss of coffee
seeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard has been formulated mainly with a view to guiding pro-
cessors, dealers and other agencies connected with handling of coffee seeds
so that the damage to coffee seeds is, as far as possible, reduced to the
minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 This code is designed for the construction
of structures which would
permit effective control of insect and other pests of stored coffee seeds and
which would entirely exclude rain and ground moisture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 This standard has been formulated after a study of Indian Standards for
foodgrains storage structures, but to suit the special requirements of coffee
seed godowns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 Suggestions for the improvement of the existing warehouses have already
been made by the Coffee Board.
,This code, therefore, has been prepared
with a view to providing guidance to the upcoming coffee curing works and
also in the construction of coffee storage structures in the future.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard specifies requirements
and method for construction
of
coffee seed storage structures of the bag storage type.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 It also specifies requirements
and method of construction
for storage
structures intended to store cured coffee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose if this standard, the following definitions shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.i
Bag -
A container made either of jute, fabric or laminates having the
standard dimensions and containing
a net content of 60 to 80 kg of cured
coffee seeds.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Bag Storage Structure -
Structure in which coffee seeds are stored in
bags.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. LOCATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The coffee seed storage structure shall be located on a raised and well-
drained site, or on suitably made-up soils, if necessary.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The structure
shall not be located
on lands subjected
to floods or
inundations and shall be safe from damage by surface or seepage water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 The structure shall be at least 15 m away from residential buildings,
factories
( other than coffee curing factories ), dairies, poultry runs, kilns
and other possible sources of fire and 30 m away from garbage, dumping
grounds, slaughter houses, hide curing centres, tanneries and such other
places, the close vicinity of which is deleterious to safe storage of coffee seeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -This
shall not apply
to any new structures
which
may be constructed
within
the premises
of the existing
curing
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  The structure shall be away from large trees.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 The structure shall be generally accessible
to lorries and preferably
situated near a rail head with goods siding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.1
Where the structure is near waterways, such as ferry heads and docks
sufficient berthing, loading and unloading facilities shall be made available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. BAG STORAGE STRUCTURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The bag storage structure
may be of dimensions most ‘economically
suited to the land available.
The storage capacity shall be calculated taking<<HEADING_END>>

factor -

tonne of cured coffee seeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>KOTE  1 -The
coefficient factor is derived from:
(a) 14 bags stacked one over the
other, (b) each such bag cantaining 75 kg of coffee seeds, (c) 30 percent floor area for
passage in between the stacks, and (d) stacks of 30  t  bulk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
