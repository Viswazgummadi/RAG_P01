FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.,l This Indian
Standard
( Third Revision
) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 11 May 1982, after the draft finalized by the
Welding
General
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Structural
and Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard was first published in 1959 under the title  ‘  Specification
for molybdenum
and chromium-molybdenum-vanadium
low alloy
steel
electrodes for metal arc welding  ’  and was subsequently
revised in 1964
and 1971.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In recent years, there has been a considerable
increase
in the indus-.
trial usage of the molybdenum and chromium-molybdenum
steel electrodes
intended
for use at elevated service temperatures
and a growing use of
nickel
steel and other
low alloy
steels for service applications
at low
ambient temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This revision
covers a wide variety
of low and medium alloy steel
covered electrodes which were not included
in the earlier
standard,
but
which
are
being
manufactured
indigenously
and
having
industrial
standardization.
The
title
of the
standard
has also been changed
accordingly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 The practice of using an appropriate
alloyed core wire or mild steel
core wire with alloying elements added in the coating in the manufacture
of low alloy electrodes is prevalent in different parts of the world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5.1 When the transfer
of alloying
elements
from mild steel
cored
electrodes with alloys added to the coating
is intended,
extreme
care is
necessary
to ensure
that
the electrode
flux covering
is intact
during
striking, restriking of arc and fusion,
A synthetic electrode with damaged
coating will not provide uniform alloy recovery.
It is, therefore,
recom-
mended that individual electrode manufacturers
clearly
mention
in their<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISr1395-1982<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>product
leaflets about the two variants
of electrodes,
for example,
synthetic
type and alloyed
core wire type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 This standard
keeps
in view
the manufacturing
and
trade
practices
followed
in the country
in the field.
Assistance
has also been
derived
from the following

for an actual
moisture
determination
shall be followed step-by-step
with a single exception
of
omitting
the sample.
The
nickel
boat
shall be removed
from
the
desiccator
and exposed to the atmosphere
for a period approximating
the
time required
to transfer
the sample from the balance
pan to the boat.
The combustion
tube shall be opened,
the weighed
absorption
U-tube
attached,
the boat placed in the combustion
tube, ,and the tube closed.
After a heating period of 30 min, the absorption U-tube shall be removed
and placed in the balance case and the nickel boat shall be transferred
to
the desiccator.
After the 20 min cooling period, the absorption
U-tube
shall be weighed and the gain in weight shall be taken as the blank value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.7 The calculation
shall be made according
to the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>18.8.2
Nickel
boats
are
used
rather
than
clay boats
because
lower
blank
valves can be obtained.
Some
laboratories
use zirconium
silicate
combustion
tube in preference
to fused silica or mullite
because
zirconium
silicate
will not devitrify
or allow
the
escape
of combustible
gases
at
temperature
up to 1 370°C.
Some
combustion
tubes are reduced
at the
exit end
and
a separate
dust trap
is used.
This
dust trap
consists of a
200 mm drying
tube filled with glass wool which
is inserted
between
the
Schwartz
absorption
bulb
and
the combustion
tube.
A suitable
150°C
heater
is mounted
around
the dust trap
to keep the evolved
water from
condensing
in the trap.
The dust trap is filled with glass wool which
can
be easily inspected
to determine
when
the glass wool should
be replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.8.3
On the ingoing
side of the combustion
tube,
a pusher rod can be
used consisting
of a 3 2 mm stainless
steel
rod
mounted
in a 6.4 mm
copper
tee fitting.
This
is used
at the entrance
of the combustion
tube
and permits
gradual
introduction
of the sample
into the tube while oxygen
is passing
over the sample.
In this way,
any
free moisture
will not be
lost, which
can happen
if the sample
is introduced
directly
into
the hot
zone before
closing
the end of the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Chmzcteristics<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C
Electrodes
of the
cellulosic
type
have
a covering
which
contains
a large
quantity
of combustible
organic
substances,
so that
the decomposition
of
the latter
in the arc produces
a voluminous
gas
shield.
The amount
of slag produced
is small and
the slag is easily detached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This type of electrode
is characterized
by a highly
penetrating
arc and fairly high fusion rate.
Spatter
losses
are
fairly
large
and
the
weld
surface
is
somewhat
coarse,
with
unevenly
spaced
ripples.
These electrodes
are usually
suitable
for welding
in all positions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Characteristics<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Type of Covering<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R
Rutile type electrodes have a covering
containing
a
large
quantity
of rutile
or components
derived
from titanium
oxide.
Usually
this amounts to
50% by mass ( not taking into account cellulosic
material ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The R type can be distinguished
from
the other
types by its heavier slag. Sometimes this difference
is not readily discernible,
especially with electrodes
having
a medium covering,
but the amount
of
rutile in the covering is well above 45 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because
of the difference
in application
and also
mechanical
properties,
a
subdivision
is made
according to the thickness of the covering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The covering is of medium thickness.
Small amounts
of cellulosic
material,
up to the maximum
of
15 percent may be present in the covering.
These
electrodes
are particularly
suitable
for welding in
the vertical and overhead positions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although the susceptability
to solidification
cracking
because of dilution by the parent metal is not so
high as that of the acid type, care has to be taken
in view of the fact that usually a weld is made
with a much smaller throst thickness
than
with
acid electrodes.

<<PARAGRAPH>>0
Electrodes
of the oxidizing type have a thick cover-
ing composed
mainly
of
iron
oxides
with
or
without manganese
oxides.
The covering
gives a
slag so that the
deposited
metal
contains
only
small amounts of carbon
and manganese.
The
slag is heavy, compact
that often self-detaching.
This type of electrode gives poor penetration
and
a fluid molten pool, and is particularly
suitable
when only a small weld is required.
Usually its
use is restricted
to welding
in the horizontal-
vertical fillet weld and flat fillet weld positions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These electrodes are used mainly for welding
steels
when the appearance
of the weld is more impor-
tant than the mechanical
strength of the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Electrodes
of the
basic
type usually
have a thick
covering
containing
considerable
quantities
of
calcium or other basic carbonates
and fluorspar so
that metallurgically
they are
basic in character.
There is a medium quantity of dense slag, which
often has a brotin
to dark-brown
colour
and a
glossy appearance,
It is easily detached
and as it
rises to the surface of the weld very quickly,
slag
inclusions
are not likely to occur.
This type of
electrode gives an arc of average penetration,
and
is generally
suitable for welding
in all positions.
This
type of electrode
is often used, on direct
current,
electrode positive, but there are electrodes
that can be used on alternating
current.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As the deposited metal is highly resistant
to solidifi-
cation
and
cold
cracking,
these
electrodes
are
particularly
suitable
for welding heavy
sections
and very rigid carbon steel structures.
They
are
also recommended
for welding
medium tensile
steels and steels the carbon and sulphur context of
which
are higher
than those
of carbon steel of
good weldable quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The coverings
of basic electrodes
have to be very
dry  :  conesquently
electrodes used to be stored
in
a very dry place or, if they have already absorbed
moisture, to be dried before use, according
to the
recommendation
of the manufacturer.
This
en-
sures that the deposited
metal
will have
a low
hydrogen content, and there is less risk of under-
bead cracking when welding steels likely to show
a marked hardening
in the heat-affected
zone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
