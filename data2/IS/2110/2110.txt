<<HEADING level=3>>CODE OF PRACTICE FOR
IN  SITU  CONSTRUCTION
OF WALLS IN
BUILDINGS
WITH SOILCEMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>( First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 October
1980, after the draft finalized
by the
Building
Construction
Practices
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Stabilized
soil ( soil-cement
in particular
) has
been
considered
a
satisfactory
material
for construction
of permanent
buildings.
Its main
use is in load-bearing
and partition
walls of single-storeyed
buildings
with
a wall height not exceeding
3.2 m and
with
a minimum
wall thickness
of 300 mm for load bearing
and 200 mm for non-load
bearing
walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1  Generally
stabilized-soil
construction
is recommended
in super-
structure
which is above the level of plinth.
The wall below the level of
plinth
is usually
built
with
conventional
materials
like
bricks,
lean
concrete,
etc.
However,
stabilized
soil with a richer
proportion
of cement
may be used advantageously
for this type of construction
also wherever
such
material
is economical,
provided
the usual
damp-proofing
courses
are inserted
to prevent
access for moisture,
and also precautions
are taken
against
attack by termites.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This
standard
which
was first published
in
1962 is intended
to
provide
guidance
with
respect
to the
construction
of walls
in single
storeyed
buildings
with soil cement
and other stabilized
soil.
The present
revision
has
been
taken
up
to incorporate
the
improvements
found
necessary
in the light
of the usage
of the standard
and the suggestions
made
by various
bodies implementing
it.
In this revision
the minimum
thickness
and
shuttering
arrangement
for non-load
bearing,
partition
walls have been specified.
The syringe
test specified
in the earlier
version
as a preliminary
quick
test for determination
of plastic
limit of soils has
been deleted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This
standard
is intended
chiefly
to cover
the technical
provisions
relating
to in si/zl construction
of walls
in buildings
with
soil cement
and it does not include
all the necessary
provisions
of a contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For  the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a test
or
analysis,
shall
be
rounded
off
in
accordance
with
IS : 2-1960*.
The
number
of
significant
places
retained
in the
rounded
off value
should
be the same
as that bf the
specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
covers
in  situ  construction
of walls
in Jluildings
with
soil-cement
or other stabilized
soil.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.1  This
type of construction
is
recommended
for
single-storeyed
buildings
with a wall height
not exceedin, u 3.2 m and with a minimum
wall thickness
of 300 mm
for load bearing
and 200 mm for
non-load
bearing
walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The
same
procedure
as recommended
in the
standard
may
be
adopted
for
rammed
in situ  wall, construction
with
unstabilized
soil,
provided
the surfaces
of the wall.,are
protected
with a waterproof
mud
plaster,

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Pouring
of Soil in Shuttering-
After the shuttering
is erected,
the moist stabilized
soil shall be poured into the shuttering
in layers of
75 mm at a time.
The layer shall be uniform in depth.
To control this
depth, suitable templates may be used which may be placed cross-wise at
intervals of about one metre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Compaction
-
Compaction shall be done by workers standing inside
the shuttering

with about 80  x  80  mm base
and of about 7 kg weight.
Compaction
shall be started at the side and
worked inwards.
Ramming
on the sides shall be evenly distributed
to
avoid tilting of the shuttering.
Verticality
of the shuttering
shall
be
carefully checked periodically
as compaction proceeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1 Samples of the compacted soil shall be taken and tested for dry
bulk density.
The minimum number of samples shall be at the rate of
one for every 3 metres of wall length.
The dry bulk density of the soil
in
the
wall
shall
be not less than
1.8 g/ems at the completion
of
compaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2  All the holes left after taking cores for the .purpose of testing
density shall be carefully filled up and rammed
before the next layer is
spread.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3  Curing -
The walls shall be cured for 15 days after removal of the
