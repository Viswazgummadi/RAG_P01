atmosphere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5  Pressurized
Room -
A room in which the protective
gas is maintained
at a pressure
greater than that of the surrounding
atmosphere.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6  Pressurization
with Leakage
Compensation
-
A  method
in which the
supply
of protective
gas is suficient
to maintain
the overpressure
in the

with a flow corresponding
to the inevitable
leakages
from
the
room
and its associated
ducts,  all the exit openings being closed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7  Pressurization
with Circulaticrn of Protective Gaq -

<<HEADING level=3>>2.8  Purging
-
The
operation
of passing
a quantity
of
protective
gas
through
a room
and
its
associated
ducts
in
order
to
reduce
any
concentration
of flammable
gas or vapour
within
to a safe level.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. CLASSIFICATION
OF THE INTERIOR
OF THE ROOM<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The different
hazardous
zones given in IS  :  5572 ( Part  1  )-1978* enables
to drive, the classification
of the zone, whele the room is situated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 It is considered
that the interior
of a room
should
receive,
in
the
absence
of pressurization,
a classilication
based on the most hazardous
area
into which the room has at least one direct opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Pressurization
of the room after purging,
permits
the use of electrical
equipment,
which
is
not
otherwise
suitably
protected
for
the
area
classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
The atmospheres
inside
a rcom
which
is partially
situated
in a
hazardous
zone,
but all of whose openings
lead into non-hazardous
zones,
is
considered
as non-hazardous.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. PRINCIPLES
OF CONSTRUCTION
OF ROOMS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Protective
Gas Ducts and Their Connections<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1 The
materials
used for protective
gas
ducts and their connections
should
have chemical
and
physical
resibtar:ce
suitable
for their
intended
use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2 The
ducts
and
connections
shall
be capable
of
withstanding
1.5 times, the maximum
overpressure
specified
for normal
service,
with a
minimum
of 200 Pa.
Appropriate
safety
devices
shall
be installed
if
there is a possibility
of overpressures
occurring
during
service capable
of
causing
dangerous
deformation
of  ducts  or connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3 The ‘position,
dimensions
and
number
of supply
ducts
shall
be
sufficient
to ensure
effective
purging.
The
number
of ducts
shall
be
chosen in relation
to the design and arrangement
of
the apparatus
to
be
protected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.4 The supply
ducts
should
be considered
as forming
part
of
the
room.
In particular,
where
they
pass
through
a hazadous
area,
it is
desirable
that
they
be
pressurized
with
respect
to
the
surrounding
atmosphere.
However,
if the
mechanical
integrity
and
sealing
of the
ducts can be guaranteed,
then it is permissible
for the pressure
within
the
ducts to be lower than that of the surrounding
atmosphere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1  The
entry
of cables
or electrical
conduits
and
other
serviced
( protective
gas, water,
etc ) directly
into
the room should
be so effected
that the necessary
overpressure
can be maintained
and entry
of flammable
substances
precluded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2 Where
exhaust
apertures
open
into
a hazardous
zone.
it
is
recommended
to provide
them
with automatic
closing
valves
or flaps to
prevent,
as far
as practicable,
the
ingress
of
the
external
explosive
atmosphere
in case of failure
of pressurization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. PROTECTIVE
MEASURES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.0 Protective
measures
shall be adopted
to prevent
the electrical
apparatus
installed
in
a pressurized
room
from
giving
rise to an explosion
at the
moment
of switching
on, or in the case of failure
of pressurization.
These
measures
should
be determined
by
the
characteristics
of the
electrical
apparatus,
by the environmental
conditions,
and
by
the
use
of
safety
devices
to monitor
the
inside
atmosphere,
or to
actuate
an alarm
or
possibly
switch
the power
supplies
off automatically.
Such measures
arc
given in 5.1 to 5.3 and also summarized
in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Energizing
-
During
initial
start-up,
or after
shutdown
and
whatever
the classification
of the hazardous
area,
it is necessary,
before energizing
any electrical
apparatus
in the room
which is not suitably
protecfcd
for the
classification
of the
area:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Either
to
ensure
that
internal
atmosphere
is
not
hazardous
( see
Note 1 ) or
to
proceed
with prior
purging
of sufficient
duration
that
the
internal
atmosphere
may be considered
non-
hazardous
( see Note 2 ), and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
To pressurize
the room.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
An atmosphere
is considered
non-hazardous
when, at all points
in
the room. the enclosures and associated ducts. the concentration
of flammble
eases
or vapours
is below 25 percent
of the lower explosive
limit.
The placr
of
measurement
shall be judiciously
chosen to determine
the highest
concentration
of’
gas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  2 - Generally,
the volume
of protective
gas required
for purging
is
estimated
as at least five times the internal volume of the room and its associated
ducts.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Failure of Pressurization<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>52.1  First Case h  The atmosphere
in the

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1.2
The visible
or audible
alarm shall be so located
as to be imme-
diately percieved
by the responsible
personnel
who shall
take the necessary
action.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1.3
For monitoring
the satisfactory
functioning
of the pressurization,
either a pressure
monitoring
device or a flow
monitoring
device
or both
should
be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - Electrical interlock
on the fan motors is not suitable to indicate
failure
of pressurization.
They do not give an indication
in the event of, for example,
rhe
fan belt slipping, the fan becoming loose on the shaft or reverse rotation of fan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1.4  In certain
circumstances.
such as the necessity
of keeping electri-
cal apparatus
in operation,
it may be advisabic
to provide
two
sources
of
protective
gas so that each on: can take over from the other in
case
of a
breakdown
of one source.
Each source should
be independently
capable
of maintaining
the necessary
overprcssure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. VALUES
OF OVERPRESSURE
AND OF PROTECTIVE
GAS FLOW<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The pressurization
system shall be capable
of ensuring
a sufficient
out-
ward protective
gas speed through
the
openings
of the
room
when
all
these openings
are  open
at the same
lime.
The velocity
should
be greater
than that of external
air currents
but should
not lead to so great a pressure
in the room as to make it difficult to open and close the doors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Where doors, windows
and openings
are provided
with interlocks,
these are to be closed when checking this requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 A minimum
overpressure
of 25 Pa ( 0’25 m bar ) with
respect
to the
outer atmosphere
should
be maintaiued
at all points
inside
the
room
and
its associated
ducts at which
leaks
are
liable
to
occur,
all
doors
and
windows
being closed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 If there is any air-consuming
equipment
inside
the
pressurized
room,
the flow through
the pressurization
system should
be capable
of  covering
all needs; if not, the extra air required
should
be supplied
by
a separate
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -  The pressurization
system may a!so include
heating,
ventilating
and
air-conditioning
devices over and above the
equipments
necessary
to fu@l the
requirements
of 6.1 to 6.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The design  of  a  pressuriz:d
room will also need to consider  :
ai the  number of persons expected to stay  in the room in order to ensure
the  necessary  renewai of the air; and
b) the type of amaratm
to b: installed in the  room and their need for
coohng air,  if any.
7. PROTECHVE
GAS SUPPLY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  The
protective
gas should
not, by virtue
of any chemical
products
or
impurities
which it may contain,
produce
deleterious
effects or introduce
a
risk of reduced
safety.
NOTE - The protective gas may also be u;ed
for other
purposes,
such
as for
cooling the appsratus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  VERIFICAI‘ION
A ND  TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Before putting
a pressurized
room into service,
the technical
documen-
tation
should
be examixd
and ii‘ necessary,
a test shall be carried out.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2  In particular,
it should
be assured
that:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the construction
of the installation
and
the
protective
measures
are such that purging
can be eRected, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the minimum
over pressure
( see 6.2 ) can be maintained
at the
minimum
flow rate
of the
pressurization
system
with
all the
openings
closed, in normal
working
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. MARKING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 All doors I^rom the pressurized
room should
be clearly marked
on the
outside,
by the following
notice or an equivalent:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘WARNING
-
PRESSURIZED
ROOM
-
CLOSE THIS DOOR’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Inside
thz room, the following
inFormation
should
be displayed:
Minimum
required
overprrssurs,
or
corresponding
rate
of  flow  of
protective
gas.
9.3 Rules to be observed
for the installation
in question:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When
switching
on:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>In accordance
with  5.1, a  notice should
be displayed
close
to the
switch of the pressurization
fan and to the general
circuit-breaker
for the room, with the following
or equivalent
wording:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘WARNING
-
The pressurization
fan should
be allowed
to  run
for t minutes before switchiug on the installation,
unless it has been
checked that the atmosphere
in ths room is not hazardous.’
NOTE - t is  the time required for purging at minimum flow rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In case  of pressurization
failure:
Jn  accordance
with 5.2, a detailed
list should
be given
indicating
the apparatus
to be switched
off, the delays,
if any,
allowed
for
each  operation,
and any other measures
to be taken
particularly
in the event of pressurization
failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
