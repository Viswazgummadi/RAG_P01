<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part XI) (Third Revision) was adopted by
the Indian Standards Institution on 30 September 1977, after the draft
finalized by the Civil Works Measurement Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Measurement occupies a very important place in planning and
execution of any civil engineering work from the time of first estimates
to final completion and settlement of payments of the project. The
methods followed for measurement are not uniform and considerable
differences exist between various Central and State Government
departments. While it is recognized that each system of measurement
has to be specifically related to the administrative and financial
organizations within the department responsible for work, a
unification of the various systems at technical level has been accepted
as very desirable, specially as it permits a wider circle of operation for
civil engineering contractors and eliminates ambiguities and
misunderstandings arising out of the inadequate understanding of
various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  Among the various civil engineering items, measurement of
building had been first to be taken up for standardization and this
standard, having provision relating to all building works, was first
published in 1958 and then revised in 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  In the course of usage of this standard (IS : 1200-1964*) by various
construction agencies in the country, several clarifications and
suggestions for modifications were received and, as a result of study,
the Sectional Committee decided that its scope, besides being
applicable to buildings, should be expanded so as to cover also method
of measurement applicable to civil engineering works like industrial
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1200 (Part XI) - 1977<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  Since various trades are not related to one another, the Committee
decided that each type of trade as given in IS : 1200-1964* be issued
separately as a different part, which will be helpful to specific users in
various trades. This part covering method of measurement of paving
and floor finishes applicable to building as well as civil engineering
works was, therefore, issued as a second revision in 1971.
0.6  In the course of use of this standard in the past 6 years, a number
of suggestions were received and accordingly certain amendments
were issued to this standard. This third revision incorporates all such
amendments besides making other provision up-to-date.
0.7  This edition 4.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (December 1989).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.
0.8  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a measurement, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960†. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE
