FOR PRESTRESSED CONCRETE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>( First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( First Revision) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 30 December 1980, after the draft finalized by the
Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee
had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard was first published in 1960. This revision was taken
up with a view to keeping abreast with the rapid development in the field
of concrete technology
and also to bring in further
clarifications
and
modifications in the light of experience gained while applying the provisions
of the earlier version of the code to practical situations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>’  0.3 The format and arrangement of clauses in the code have been changed
from the earlier version.
The matter has now been divided into four
sections as follows:
Section 1 General
Section’ 2 Materials, Workmanship, Inspection and Testing
Section 3 General Design Requirements
Section 4 Structural Design: Limit State Method<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 In this revision, an attempt has been made to unify the coda1
provisions between prestressed concrete structures and reinforced concrete
structures, as is necessary.
As a result, many of the provisions in Section 2
Materials, Workmanship,
Inspection and Testing and Section 3 General
Design Requirements
of IS  :  456-1978” apply to prestressed
concrete
structures and, therefore, only reference has been made to such provisions
in this code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.2 In some clauses, the code recommends
reference
to specialist
literature, since the current knowledge on some aspects of design has not
yet crystallized.
This has also been done in order to avoid burdening the
code with a lot of details which may not be required
for the design of
great majority of structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<IMAGE_3>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS :1343-1980<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.3
SI Units have been used in this code, the values of stresses being in
units of N/mm*.
While converting the values from the earlier units of
kg/cm2, the values have been rationalized
rather than giving the exact
conversion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.4 While deciding on the symbols used in this code, the recommen-
dations of IS0 3898-1976* have been taken into consideration.
However,
considering the convenience of the users of the code, the familiar symbols
of the old version have been retained to the extent possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This revision incorporates a number of important
changes.
The major
changes in this revision are on the following lines:
a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The concept of limit state which provides
a rational
approach,
taking into account variations in material strengths and loads on
semi-probabilistic
basis, has been introduced.
This, in fact, is a
rationalization
of the ultimate
load method,
covered
in the
earlier version.
Provision for intermediate degrees of prestress (partial prestress)
has been included.
Consequentlv,
the code covers 3 types of
structures, the types being associated with the permissible tensile
stress in concrete.
The method of design for shear and torsion has been completely
revised, incorporating
the results of the latest research on the
subject.
Recommendations
regarding transmission length of prestressing
tendons have been elaborated.
Recommendations
for ensuring lateral stability during handling
and erection have been modified.
Considerations
regarding
durability
have been
detailed
with
guidance concerning
minimum
cement content
and maximum
water-cement
ratio
for
different
environmental
conditions,
including types of cement to be used for resisting sulphate attack.
Limitations
on total chloride and sulphate content of concrete
have also been given.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>f )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1 In IS : 456-1978?, major changes have been incorporated
in provi-
sions relating
to materials,
workmanship,
inspection
and testing,
and
general design requirements.
In view of the attempt at unification between
the provisions of reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete codes, these
changes are relevant to prestressed concrete code also wherever reference
has been made to related provisions of IS  :  456-19787.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1343 - 1980<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  In this code, it has been assumed that the design of prestressed concrete
structures is entrusted to a qualified engineer, and that the execution of the
work is carried out under the direction of an experienced supervisor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 The
Sectional
Committee,
responsible
for the preparation
of this
standard,
has taken into consideration the views of manufacturers,
users,
engineers, architects, builders and technologists and has related the stan-
dard to the manufacturing
and trade practices followed in this country in
this field.
Due weightage has also been given to the need for international
co-ordination
among standards
prevailing in different countries
of the
world.
These
considerations
led the Sectional
Committee
to derive
assistance from the following:

concrete.

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2  Tensile Strength
of Concrete-The
flexural
strength
shall be
obtained as per IS : 516-1959*.
When the designer wishes to use an esti-
mate of the flexural strength from the compressive strength, the following
formula may be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fcr = 0.7 d/
N/mm2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
fcr = flexural strength in N/mm2, and
fck = characteristic compressive strength of concrete in N/mm2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3  Elastic Deformation -  The
modulus
of
elasticity
is primarily
influenced by the elastic properties of the aggregate and to a lesser extent by
the conditions of curing and age of the concrete, the mix proportions
and
the type of cement.
The modulus of elasticity is normally related to the
compressive strength of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3.1 In the absence of test data, the modulus of elasticity for
structural concrete may be assumed as follows:
--
E c = 5  700 \/  fck<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
EC =  short-term static modulus of elasticity in N/mm2, and
fCk = characteristic compressive strength of concrete in N/mm2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4  Shrinkage -  The shrinkage of concrete depends upon the consti-
tuents of concrete, size of the member and environmental conditions.
For a
given environment,
the shrinkage of concrete is most influenced by the total
amount of water present in the concrete at the time of mixing and, to a
lesser extent, by the cement content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4.1 In the absence of test data, the approximate value of shrinkage
strain for design shall be assumed as follows:
For pre-tensioning
= O*OOO
3
0.000 2
For post-tensioning
= ~-------
Log,,  ( t +- 2 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
t = age of concrete at transfer in days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -

subject

value
of@0003.

<<PARAGRAPH>>shrinkage takes place during the first month and that about three-quarters
of the shrinkage takes place in first six months after commencement of
drying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5  Creep of Concrete’---  Creep of concrete depends, in addition to the
factors listed in 5.2.4 on the stress in the concrete,
age at loading and the
duration of loading.
As long as the stress in concrete does not exceed one-
third of characteristic
compressive strength, creep may be assumed to be
proportional
to the stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5.1 In the absence of experimental data and detailed information
on the effect of the variables, the ultimate creep strain may be estimated
from the following values of creep coefficient (that is, ultimate creep strain/
elastic strain at the age of loading ):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5.2  For the calculation of deformation at some stage before the total
creep is Pea&d,
it may be assumed that about half the t&al creep takes
place in  the  first month after loading and that about three-quarters
of the
total cresp takes place in the Grst six months after loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.6 ~!&WHUZ~JMZ+O~ - The coafflolent of t&ma1
expansion depends
on ntiure d cement, {he aggregate, thb cement content, the relative humi-
dity and. the,aize of sections.
For valucts of eoe&eient of thermal expansion
for concrete with different aggregates, clause 53.6 of IS : 4.56-19781 may be
referred to.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. WORKABiLITY
OF CONCRETE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 The concrete mix proportion+s chosen should be such that the concrete is
of adequate workability for the placing conditions of the concrete and can
prcperly be compacted with the means available. Suggested ranges of values
of workability of concrete are given in IS  :  456-1978*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. DURABILITY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 The durability of concrete depends on its resistance to deterioration and
the environment
in which it is placed.

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1343 - 1980<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>weathering, chemical attack, abrasion, frost and fire depends largely upon
its quality and constituent materials.
The strength alone  is  not a reliable
guide to the quality and durability of concrete; it must also have an adequate
cement content and a low water-cement ratio.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1  One of the main
characteristics
influencing
the durability
of
concrete is its permeability.
With strong, dense aggregates, a suitably low
permeability is achieved by having a sufficiently low water-cement
ratio,
by ensuring as thorough compaction
of the concrete as possible and by
ensuring sufficient hydration of cement through proper curing methods.
Therefore, for given aggregates, the cement content should be suflicient to
provide adequate workability with a low water-cement ratio so that concrete
can be thoroughly compacted with the means available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Appendix A provides
guidance regarding minimum cement content
and permissible limits of chloride and sulphate in concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and surface finish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.X The determination
of the proportions
of cement, aggregates and
water to att4n
the required

Such concrete shall be called ‘Design mix concrete’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For prestressed concrete construction,

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.2.1  All prestressing steel shall be carefully and accurately located
in the exact positions
shown in the design drawings.
The permissible
tolerance
in the location
of the prestressing tendon shall be f5
mm.
Curves or bends in prestressing tendon required by the designer shall be
gradual and the prestressing tendon shall not be forced around sharp bends
or be formed in any manner which is likely to set up undesirable secondary
stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.2.2 The relative position of wires in a cable, whether curved or
straight,
shall
be accurately
maintained
by suitable
means such as
sufficiently rigid and adequately distributed spacers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.2.3 In the case of post-tension
work, the spacing of wires in a
cable shall be adequate to ensure the free flow of grout.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.2.4 The method of fixing and supporting the steel in the mould or
the formwork shall be such that it is not displaced during the placing or
compaction
of the concrete or during tensioning of the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.2.5 The type of fixtures used for positioning the steel shall be
such that it.does not give rise to friction greater than that assumed in the
design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.3  Jointing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.3.1  High tensile wire other than hard-drawn
wire may be joined
together by suitable means provided the strength of such joints is not less

come  into contact with other stressed wires or concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.4.2 Bars shall preferably be ordered to the exact length required.
Any trimming required shall be done only after the bar has been tensioned
and the grout has set; it shall then
be carried
out
in accordance
with 11.1.4.1.
11.1.5  Protection of Prestressing Steel and Anchorages -
In  all construc-
tions of the post-tensioned type, where prestressing is initially carried out
without bond,
the prestressing
tendon shall, at a subsequent date and
generally not later than one week after prestressing, be given and adequate
protection against corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.5.1  Internal prestressitzg steel -  Internal prestressing
steel is best
protected by a cement or cement-sand grout preferably in colloidal form.
Care shall be taken to prevent segregation and, for that purpose, only fine
sand shall be used.
The grout shall be placed under pressure, and it shall be ensured
that the entire space between the duct and the prestressing
tendon
is
properly filled with grout.
Where small ducts are encountered,
it is advisable that water is
flushed through prior to grouting, care being taken to see that all water is
subsequently displaced by grout.
In the case of butted assemblies, flushing
with water shall be carried out only after the jointing material has properly
hardened.
Injection shall proceed from one end or preferably in case of curved
ducts from the lowest point of the curve, and shall be continued until the
grout overflows from the other  end.
11.1.5.2
External
prestressing
steel -
The
protection
of
external
prestressing steel is usually best done by encasing the tensioned
wires,
cables or bars in a dense concrete secured to the main concrete,
for
example, by wires left projecting from the latter.
If a cement-sand mix is
used, the cover provided and its density should be adequate
to prevent
corrosion.
Alternatively, the steel may be encased in bitumen or, where the steel
is accessible for inspection
and maintenance,
paint protection
may be
provided.
11.1.5.3 The anchorage shall be adequately protected against damage
or corrosion soon after the completion of the final stressing and grouting
operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.6  Cover
11.1.6.1
In pre-tensioned work, the cover of concrete measured from
the outside of the prestressing tendon shall be at least 20 mm.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.1  Stressing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.1.1 The tensioning of prestressing tendons shall be carried out in a
manner that will induce a smooth and even rate of increase of stress in the
tendons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.1.2 The total tension imparted to each tendon shall conform to the

pensate for the initial tensioning of the wire.
The extent of correction shall
be arrived at by plotting on a graph the gauge reading as abscissae and
extensions as ordinates: the intersection of the curve with the Y axis when
extended
shall be taken to give the effective elongation
during initial
tensioning,

<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.1.4 When two or more presiressing tendons are to be tensioned
simultaneously, care shall be taken to ensure that all such tendons are of
the same length from grip to grip.
The provision shall be more carefully
observed for tendons of a length smaller than 7.5 m.
12.2.1.5 The placement of cables or ducts and the order of stressing and
grouting shall be so arranged that the prestressing steel, when tensioned and
grouted, does not adversely affect the adjoining ducts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.2  Measurement of Prestressing Force<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.2.1  The force induced in the prestressing tendon shall be determin-
ed by means of gauges attached to the tensioning apparatus as well as by
measuring the extension of the steel and relating it to its stress-strain curve.
It is essential that both methods are used jointly so that the inaccuracies to
which each is singly susceptible are minimized.
Due allowance shall be
made for the frictional Josses in the tensioning apparatus.
12.2.2.2 The pressure gauges or devices attached
to the tensioning
apparatus to measure the force shall be periodicaliy calibrated to ensure
that they do not at any time introduce errors in reading exceeding 2 percent.
12.2.2.3 In measuring the extension of prestressing steel, any slip which
may occur in the gripping device shall be taken into consideration.
12.2.3  Breakage of Wires -  The breakage of wires in any one prestressed
concrete member shall not exceed 2.5 percent during tensioning.
Wire
breakages after anchorage, irrespective of percentage, shall not be condoned
without special investigations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.4.1  The transfer of the prestress shall be carried out gradually so
as to avoid large differences of tension between wires in a tendon, severe
eccentricities of prestressing force and the sudden application of stress to
the concrete.
12.2.4.2 Where the total prestressing force in a member is built up by
successive transfers to the force of a number of individual tendons on to
the concrete,
account
shall be taken of the effect of the successive
prestressing.
12.2.4.3 In the long line and similar methods of prestressing, when the
transfer is made on several moulds at a time, care shall be taken to ensure
that the prestressing force is evenly applied on all the moulds, and that the
transfer of prestress to the concrete is uniform along the entire length of the
tension line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If permitted by the engineer-in charge,
admixtures may be added to improve the performance
of the grout.
The
water-cement ratio for neat cement grouts should be approximately
0.50 by
mass, but should in no case exceed 0.55 by mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.3.2.1 The compressive strength of 100 mm cubes of the grout shall

the body of the grout.
A grout screen should preferably be fitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.3.3.2 The pump and the injection equipment shall be capable
of
continuous operation with little, if any, pressure variation and shall have a
system for recirculating the grout while actual grouting is not in progress.
No compressed air system should be used for grouting work.
The pumping
equipment shall be able to deliver the grout at a nozzle pressure of at least
0.7 N/mm2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.3.3.3 All piping to and from the grout pump shall have a minimum
of bends, valves, and changes in diameter and the delivery hose shall be as
short as practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>12.3.4  Mixing -  Water shall be measured and added to the mixer first,
followed by cement.
When these are thoroughly mixed, the additive and
sand, if any, shall be added.
When all the ingredients have been added,
mixing shall continue for at least two minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3.5  Duct Preparation -  Ducts shall be kept clean at all times.
Un-
wanted opening at anchorages and in any other locations shall be sealed
before grouting commences.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In all long ducts, or in any duct where considerable changes of level
occur and in any large diameter ducts, grout vents shall be provided at all
crests and at intervals of 20 m to 30 m so that grout can be injected succes-

<<PARAGRAPH>>12.3.6 Grout  Injection -  Grouts should be injected from the lowest point
or  ‘  uphill  ’  wherever practicable so that air and water in the duct, being
less dense than the grout, will be pushed ahead of the grout mix and be less
liable to become entrapped in the grout mix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grout mix shall be allowed to flow through vent openings until its
consistency is equivalent to that of the grout injected.
Vent openings shall
then be firmly closed one after the  other  in the direction of flow. Once good
grout mix has commenced to flow freely from the end or ends of the duct,
that end or ends shall be closed and the pressure built up inside the duct to
0.7 N/mm’ before closing the injection end.
In the case of large ducts where pressure grouting cannot be used, a
standpipe or vent pipe shall be provided and kept topped up with cement
for an hour or two to replace grout losses due to wastage and subsidence at
the termination of grouting operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1343 - 1980<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.3.1  Deductions for Prestreqsing Tendons -  In calculating area, centroid
and moment of inertia of a cross-section, deduction for prestressing tendons
shall be made as follows:
a) In the case of pre-tensioned
members, where the prestressing
tendons are single wires distributed on the cross-section or strands
of wires of relatively small cross-sectional area, allowance for the
prestressing tendons need not be made.
Where allowance is made,
it shall be on the basis of (m-l ) times the area of the prestressing
tendons, m being the modular ratio.
b) In the case of post-tensioned members, deductions shall invariably
be made for prestressing tendons, cable ducts or sheaths and such
other openings whether they are formed longitudinally
or trans-
versely.
These deductions need not, however, be made for deter-
mining the effect of loads applied after the ducts, sheaths or
openings have been grouted or filled with concrete.
Where such
deductions are not made, a transformed area equivalent to ( m-l )
times the area of the prestressing tendon shall be taken in calcula-
tion, m being the modular ratio.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -m
shall be calculated
as  Es/EC;
for values of Es and EC, JM 4.5.3.1
and 5.2.3.1
respectively.
Wherever
necessary, creep effects shall also be taken into consideration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.4 Instability
During
Erection -  In evaluating
the slenderness
effects
during lifting of slender beams, the following factors require consideration:
a) Beam geometry,
b) Location of lifting points,
c) Method of lifting, and
d) Tolerances in construction.
All beams, which are lifted on vertical or inclined slings, shall be
checked for lateral stability and lateral moment on account of tilting of
beam due to inaccuracies in location of lifting points, and due to the lateral
bow.
For calculating the factor of safety against lateral instability yt reference
may be made to specialist literature; the factor shall not be less than two.
For determining the lateral moment due to tilting, realistic
values
which are not likely to be exceeded in practice shall be assumed for the
eccentricity of lifting points and the lateral bow.
The maximum tensile
stress for yi/yi - 1 times the lateral moment due to tilting shall not exceed
1.5 N/mm2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.5 Prestressing Requirements
18.5.1  Maximum Initial Prestress -  At the time of initial tensioning, the
maximum tensile stress f,i immediately behind the anchorages
shall not
exceed 80 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the wire or bar or
strand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>18.52
Losses in Prestress -  While assessing the stresses in concrete and
steel during tensioning operations and later in service, due regard shall be
paid to all losses and variations in stress resulting from creep of concrete,
shrinkage of c,oncrete, relaxation of steel, the shortening ( elastic deforma-
tion) of concrete at transfer, and friction and slip of anchorage.
Unless
otherwise determined
by actual tests, allowance for these losses shall be
made in accordance with the values specified under 18.5.2.1 to 18.5.2.6.
In computing the losses in prestress when untensioned reinforcement
is present, the effect of the tensile stresses developed by the untensioned
reinforcement due to shrinkage and creep shall be considered.
18.5.2.1 Loss  of prestress due to creep of concrete -  The loss of pre-
stress due to creep of concrete under load shall be determined for all the
permanently applied loads including the prestress.
The creep loss due to live load stresses, erection stresses and other
stresses of short duration may be ignored.
The loss of prestress due to
creep of concrete is obtained as the product of the modulus of elasticity of
the prestressmg steel ( see 4.5.3 ) and the ultimate creep strain of the concrete
fibre (see 5.2.5.1 ) integrated along the line of centre of gravity of the
prestressing steel over its entire length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total creep strain during any specific period shall be assumed for
all practical purposes, to be the creep strain due to sustained stress equal to
the average of the stresses at the beginning and end of the period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X5.2.2
Loss of prestress due to shrinkage of concrete-
The loss of
prestress due to shrinkage of concrete shall be the product of the modulus
of elasticity
of steel ( see 4.5.3) and the shrinkage strain of concrete
( see 5.2.4.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.5.2.3 ‘Loss  of prestress due to relaxation of steel -  The relaxation
losses in prestressing steels vary with type of steel, initial prestress, age, and
temperature and, therefore, shall be determined from experiments.
When
experimental vaiues are not available, the relaxation losses may be assumed
as given in Table 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For tendons at higher temperatures
or subjected to large lateral
loads, greater relaxation losses as specified by the engineer-in-charge
shall
be allowed for.
No reduction in the value of the relaxation losses should
be rnade for a tendon with a load equal to or greater than the relevant
jacking force that has been applied for a short time prior to the anchoring
of the tendon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.5.2.4 Loss of  prestrcss due to shortening of concrete -  This type of
loss occurs when the prestressing tendons upon release from tensioning
devices cause the concrete to be compressed.
This loss is proportional
to
the modular ratio and initial prestress in the concrete and shall be calcula-
ted as below, assuming that the tendons are located at their centroid:
a) For pretensioning, the loss of prestress in the tendons at transfer
shall be calculated on a modular ratio basis using the stress in the
adjacent concrete.
b)  For members with post-tensioned
tendons which are not stressed
simultaneously,
there is a progressive
loss of prestress during
transfer due to the gradual application of the prestressing forces.
This loss of prestress should be calculated on the basis of half
the product
of the stress in the concrete adjacent to the tendons
averaged along their lengths and the modular ratio.
Alternatively,
the loss of prestress may be exactly computed based on the sequence
of tensioning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.5.2.5  Loss  of prestress due to slip in anchorage -  Any loss of pre-
stress which may occur due to slip of wires during anchoring or due to the
strain of anchorage shall be allowed for in the design.
Loss due to slip
in anchorage is of special importance with short members and the necessary
additional e!ongation should be provided for at the time of tensioning to
compensate for this loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.5.2.6 Loss  ofprestress
due to friction -  The design shall take into
consideration
all losses in prestress that may occur during tensioning due
to friction between the prestressing tendons and the surrounding
concrete
or any fixture attached to the steel or concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For straight or moderately curved structures, with curved or straight

<<PARAGRAPH>>18.6.1.1 Trunsmission length -  The considerations

<<PARAGRAPH>>The transmission length depends on a number of variables, the
most important being the strength of concrete at transfer, the size
and type of tendon, the surface deformations
of the tendon, and
the degree of compactness of the concrete around the tendon.
The transmission length may vary depending on the site condi-
tions and therefore should be determined from tests carried out
under the most unfavourable
conditions.
In the absence
of
values based on actual tests, the following values may be used,
provided
the concrete is well-compacted,
and its strength
at
transfer is not less than 35 N/mm2 and the tendon is released

<<PARAGRAPH>>18.6.2.2  Bursting tensile forces
a) The bursting tensile forces in the end blocks, or regions of bonded
post-tensioned
members, should be assessed on the basis of the
tendon jacking load. For unbonded members, the bursting tensile
forces should !.e assessed on the basis of the tendon jacking load
or the load in the tendon at the limit state of collapse, whichever
is greater ( see Appendix R).
The bursting
tensile force,  Fbst  existing in an individual
square end block loaded by a symmetrically placed square ancho-
rage or bearing plate, may be derived from the equation below:
F  bst
__
=<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>PI,
0.32 - 0.3 +<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fbrt =  bursting tensile force,
P, =  load in the tendon assessed as above,
J’~(, = side of loaded area, and
y, = side of end block.
The force  Fbsf  will be distributed in a region extending from 0.1 ~3~
to y0 from the loaded face of the end block.
Reinforcement
provided to sustain the bursting tensile force may be assumed to
be acting at its design strength (0.87 times characteristic
strength
of reinforcement)
except that the stress should be limited to a
value corresponding to a strain of 0.001 when the concrete cover
to the reinforcement is less than 50 mm.
In rectangular end blocks, the bursting tensile forces in the two
principal directions should be assessed on the basis of 18.6.2.2.
When circular anchorage or bearing plates are used, the side of
the equivalent square area should be used.
Where groups of
anchorages
or bearing plates occur, the end blocks should be
divided into a series of symmetrically loaded prisms and each
prism treated in the above manner.
For designing end blocks
having a cross-section different in shape from that of the general
cross-section of the beam, reference should he made to specialist
literature.
Compliance with the requirements of (a), (b) and (c) will generally
ensure that bursting tensile forces along the load axis are provided
for.
Alternative
methods of design which make allowance for
the tensile strength of the concrete may be used, in which case
reference should be made to specialist literature.
Consideration
should also be given to the spalling tensile stresses
that occur in end blocks where the anchorage or bearing plates
are highly eccentric; these reach a maximum at the loaded face.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

DESIGN : LIMIT
STATE METHOD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19.  SAFETY  AND SERVICEABILITY REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.1 Limit State Design -The
structural design shall be based on limit
state concepts.
In this method of design, the structure shall be designed to
withstand safely all loads liable to act on it throughout its life; it shall also
satisfy the serviceability requirements,
such as limitations
on deflection
and cracking.
The acceptable limit for the safety and serviceability require-
ments before failure occurs is called a ‘Limit State’.
The aim of design is
to achieve acceptable probabilities that the structure will not become unfit
for the use for which it is intended, that is, that it will not reach a limit
state.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.1.1 All relevant limit states shall be considered in design to ensure an
adequate degree of safety and serviceability.
In general, the structure shall
be designed on the basis of the most critical limit state and shall be checked
for other limit states.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.1.2  For ensuring the specified objective, the design should be based on
characteristic
vaiues fo.r material strengths and applied loads, which take
into account the variations in the material strengths and in the loads to be
supported.
The characteristic values should be based on statistical data if
available;
where such data are not available, they should be based on
experience.
The ‘design values’ are derived from the characteristic value
through the use of partial safety factors, one for material strengths and the
other for loads.
In the absence of special considerations,
these factors
should have the values given in 20.4 according to the material, the type of
loading and the limit state being considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19.2  Limit State of CoIlapse -  The limit state of collapse of the structure or
part of the structure could bc assessed from rupture of one or more critical<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>sections and from buckling due to elastic or plastic instability ( including
the effects of sway where appropriate ) or overturning.
The resistance to
bending, shear, torsion and axial loads at every section shall not be less
than appropriate
value at that section produced
by the probable
most
unfavourable combination of loads on the structure using the appropriate
partial safety factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19.3 Limit States of Serviceabilit$<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.3.1  Limit State of Serviceability  :  De$ection -  The deflection
of a
structure
or part thereof
shall not adversely
affect the appearance or
efficiency of the structure or finishes or partitions.
The deflection shall
generally be limited to the following:
a) The final deflection, due to all loads including the effects of
temperature, creep and shrinkage and measured from the as-cast
level of the supports
of floors, roofs and all other horizontal
members, should not normally exceed span/250.
b) The deflection including the
effects of temperature,
creep and
shrinkage occurring after erection of partitions and the application
of finishes should not normally exceed span/350 or 20 mm which-
ever is less.
c) If finishes are to be applied to prestressed concrete members, the
total upward deflection should not exceed span1300, unless uni-
formity of camber between adjacent units can be ensured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.3.2  Liniit State of Serviceability  :  Cracking -  Cracking
of concrete
shall not affect the appearance or durability of the structure.
The criteria
of limit state of cracking for the three types of prestressed concrete mem-
bers shall be as follows:
a)  For type I,  no tensile stresses.
b)  For type  2, tensile stresses are allowed but no visible cracking.
c)  For type  3, cracking is allowed, but should not affect the appearance
or durability of the structure; the acceptable limits of cracking
would vary with the type of structure and environment and will
vary between wide limits and the prediction of absolute maximum
width is not possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -For
design of type 3 members,
as a guide, the following
may bc
regarded as reasonable
limits.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface width of cracks should not, in general,
cxcecd
0.1 mm for
members exposed to a particularly
aggressive environment
such as the severe
category in Appendix A and not exceeding 0.2 mm for al1 other members.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.3.3  The flexural tensile stress at any section of the structure, both at
transfer and under the most unfavourable
combination
of design loads,
shall satisfy the criteria for the corresponding type of structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

pressive stresses both at transfer and under design loads shall be limited to
the values given in 22.8 for all types of structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

appropriate to that structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Until the relevant
Indian

<<HEADING level=3>>22.1 Limit State of Collapse  :  Flexure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>22.1.1 Ass~nzptions -  Design for the limit state of collapse in flexure
shall be based on the assumptions given below:
a) Plane sections normal to the axis remain plane after bending.
b) The maximum strain in concrete at the outermost
compression<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fibre is taken as 0.003 5 in bending.
The
relationship
between
the comprcssivc
stress distribution
in concrete and the strain in concrete may be assumed to be
rectangle, trapezoid, parabola or any other shape which results in
prediction
of strength in substantial agreement with the results
of tests.
An acceptable stress:strain curve is given in Fig. 3. For
design purposes,
the compressive
strength of concrete
in the
structure shall bc assumed to be 0~67 times the characteristic
strength.
The partial safety factor ym = 1.5 shall be applied in
addition to this.
NOTE -
For the stress-strain

If tendons are unbonded in post-tensioned members, the stress in
the tendons may be obtained from a rigorous analysis or from
tests.

<<PARAGRAPH>>22.6.1.2  Long-term defection -  The total long-term deflection due to
the prestressing force, dead load and any sustained imposed load may be
calculated using elastic analysis, taking into account the effects of cracking
and of creep and shrinkage ( see 5.2.4 and 5.2.5).
Due allowance shall be
made for the loss. of prestress ( see 18.5.2 ) after the period considered.
The
deflections shculd comply with the limits given in  19.3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

load is less than or
equal to 25 percent of the design imposed load, the deflection may be calcu-
lated as in 22.6.1.1.
When the permanent load is more than 25 percent of
the design imposed load, the vertical deflection limits for beams and slabs
may generally be assumed to be satisfied provided that the span to effective

For a member which is free
of joints, the tensile stress shall not exceed the values specified below for
the 3 types of members.
a)  Type I - No  tensile stress.
b)  Type  2 -The
tensile stress shall not exceed 3 N/mm?.
However,
where part of the service loads is temporary in nature, this value
may be exceeded by I.5 N/mm2, provided under the permanent
component of the service load the stress remains compressive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Type 3  - For type 3 members in which cracking is permitted, it
may be assumed that the concrete section is untracked,
and that
hypothetical tensile stresses exist at the maximum size of cracks.

<<HEADING level=3>>B-l. The  moment of resistance of rectangular
sections or T-sections
in
which neutral axis lies within the flange may be obtained as follows;
112 -f,”
A, (n - 0.42~“)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
M = moment of resistance of the section,
jY,, = ultimate tensile stress in the tendons,
A, =  area of pretensioning tendons,
d =  effective depth, and
x, = neutral axis depth<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
pretensioned
members and for post-tensioned
members with
eft’ective bond between the concrete and tendons, values of  f,,,  and ‘x, are
given in Table 11.
The effective prestress after all 1,osses should not be
less than 0.45  f,,  where  f,  is the characteristic strength of prestressing steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
