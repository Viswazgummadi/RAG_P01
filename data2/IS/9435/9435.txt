Unless otherwise
stated with regard to one or more of the items
mentioned
below,
it
should be understood
that:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the supporting
surface
is horizontal;
lengths
and widths
are measured
on the horizontal
plane, and heights
in the vertical
plane;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the total
weight
of the vehicle
is the maximum
authorized
total
weight,
the
load being
distributed
according
to the manufacturer’s
instructions
(see
IS : 9211-1979 Denominations
and definitions
of weights
of road vehicles
);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the tyres are inflated
to the pressure
corresponding
to the maximum
authorized
total weight
of the vehicle;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the vehicle
is stationary,
and ifs wheels
and articulated
elements
are in positions
corres-
ponding
to movements
in a straight
line;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) the vehicle
is new from the factory
and normally
equipped;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) all wheels
of the vehicle
are resting
on the ground;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) the expression
‘ mid-plane

in a number
of definitions,
designates
the planes equidistant
from the inner edges of the rim.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the vertical
