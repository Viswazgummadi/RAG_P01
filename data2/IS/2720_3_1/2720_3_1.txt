FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
( Part III/Set
1 ) ( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 3 October
1980, after the’ draft
finalized by the Soil and Rock Mechanics
Sectional
Committee had been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establishing uniform procedures for the determination
of different characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating
a comparative
study of the results, the Indian
Standards
Institution
is bringing
out a
series of standards on methods of test for soils ( IS  :  2720 ).
This standard
( Part III ) deals with the method
of test for determination
of specific
gravity
of soils which finds application
in finding
out the degree
of
saturation and unit weight of moist soils.
The unit weights are needed
in pressure, settlement
and stability
problems in soil engineering.
This
standard was published in the year 1964. In view of the further work done
in this field in this, as well as in other countries, the revision has been pre-
pared so as to give the latest method of test which has separate
provision
for fine grained and coarse soils.
The revision is being prepared
in two
sections  :  Section 1, dealing with the method for fine grained soil which is
a basically laboratory
method and Section 2 for fine, medium and coarse
grained soils which is field method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules for rounding off numerical values  ( r&red).<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard
( Part III/Set
1 ) lays down the methods
of test for the
determination
of the ,specific
gravity
of soil particle
of fine grained
soils
( see Note  ) .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE
-  The method
may also he used for medium
and coarse
grained
soils
if
the coarse parttcles
are grained

<<HEADING level=3>>4. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The
complete
density
bottle
with
stopper,
shall
be dried
at 105 to
1 lO”C, cooled in the desiccator
and weighed
to the nearest
0.001 g ( ml )
( Je Note 1 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The 50 g sample
obtained
as described
in the procedure
for the pre-
paration
of-disturbed
samples
for testing
( see 1.5  )  shall
if necessary
be
ground
to pass a 2-mm
IS test sieve.
A 5 to 10 g subsample
shall be
obtained
by riffling,
and
oven
dried at 105 to 110°C
( see  Note 2 ).
This
sample
shall be transferred
to the density
bottle direct
from the desiccator
in which it has been cooled.
The
bottle
and contents
together
with
the
stopper
shall be weighed
to the nearest
0.001 g (  ma).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3  Sufficient
air-free
distilled
water
( see Note 3 ) shall
be added so that
the soil in the bottle
is just covered.
The
bottle
containing
the soil and
liquid,
but without
the stopper,
shall be placed
in the vacuum
desiccator,
which shall then be evacuated
gradually.
The pressure
shall
be reduced
to about
20 mmHg.
When
using
a water pump,
because
of variation
in
mains
pressure,
care shall be taken
to ensure
that the required
vacuum
is
maintained.
Care shall be taken
during
this operation
to see that
the air
trapped
in the soil does not bubble
too violently,
so as to prevent
small
drops of the suspension
being lost through
the mouth
of the bottle.
The
bottle shall be allowed
to remain
in the desiccator
for at least 1 hour until
no further
loss of air is apparent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 The vacuum
shall be released
and the lid of the desiccator
removed.
The
soil
in
the
bottle
shall
be
stirred
carefully
with the spatula,
or
the bottle
vibrated.
Before
removing
the spatula
from
the
bottle
the
particles
of soil adhering
to the blade shall be washed
off with a few drops
of air-free
liquid.
The lid of the desiccator
shall then be replaced
and the
desiccator
evacuaied
again.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 The procedure
outlined
in 4.3 and 4.4 shall be repeated
until no  more
air is evolved
from the soil ( see Note 4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1
Alternately,
the entrapped
air can be removed
by getting
heat-
ing the pyknometer
placed
on a water-bath
or sand-bath.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6 The bottle
and
cohtents
shall
then
be removed
from
the desiccator
and further
air-free
liquid
added
until the bottle is full.
The stopper
shall
then be inserted.
The stoppered
bottle shall be immersed
up to the neck
in the constant-temperature
bath for approximately
1 hour
or until
it has
attained
the constant
temperature
of the bath
( see Note 5 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If there is an apparent
decrease
in volume
of the liquid
the stopper
shall
be
removed
and
further
liquid
added
to fill the bottle
and
the
stopper.replaced.
The bottle shall then be returned
to the bath and sufi-
cient time shall be allowed
to elapse after
this operation
to ensure that the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of the bath.
If the bottle is still not completely full this process shall be repeated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7 The stoppered bottle shall then be taken out of the bath, wiped dry
and the whole weighed to the nearest O*OOl g  (ma).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8 The bottle shall then be cleaned
out and filled completely
with air-
free liquid,
the stopper
inserted and then the whole immersed in the
constant temperature
bath for 1 hour or until it has attained the constant
temperature
of the bath.
If there is an apparent decrease in the volume
of the liquid, the stopper shall be removed and further liquid added to
fill the bottle and the stopper replaced.
The stoppered bottle shall then
be returned
to the batch and sufficient time shall be allowed to elapse
after this operation to ensure that the bottle and its contents
again attain
the constant
temperature.

The bottle shall then be taken out of the bath,

( see Note 6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.9 Two determinations
of the specific gravity of the same soils sample
shall be made  ( see  Notes 7 and 8 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -
S!andord  Density Bolllcr -
If a density bottle is used then in order to
avoid distortion it should not bc dried by placing it in an oven.
It may be dried by
rinsing
with
acetone
or an alcohol-ether
mixture
and
then
blowing
warm air
through it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
Oven drying of the soil has been specified for convenience.
If there
is any reason to believe that this will change the specific gravity due to loss of water
of hydration the soil should be dried at not more than 80°C.
This fact should be
rep&ted.
NOTR 3 -

<<PARAGRAPH>>Nom 4-
Experience
has shown that the largest source of ‘error in the test is
due to the diflicllltv in ensurine the comnlete removal
of air from the sample.
To
I
obtain reliable results the soil should be left under vacuum
for scvrral
hours, pre-
ferably
overnight.
Shaking
the ‘bottle
in hand once
or twice intcruppting
the
vacuum
gives quicker results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  7 -
Many

parti-
cles.
Such
soils
will  give
erratic

of repeated
tests may be needed
to obtain
a good average
