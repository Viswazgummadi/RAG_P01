<<HEADING level=3>>2.  General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  By ‘  weight’
or
‘load’
is meant the force
transmitted
-by the vehicle,
or by the
part
of the
vehicle
defined,
to a horizontal
plane
of contact,
under
static
conditions.
Weights
and loads
are
measured
with
the vehicle
stationary;
the vehicle
and its road wheels
being in the straight-ahead
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The definitions
apply to vehicles%ewly
manufactured
and with
normal
equipment.
-For terms
defined
in 3.7 to 3.12 inclusive,
both the maximum
weight
set by the manufacturer
and maximum
weight authorized
are defined
for each case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 The definitions
given
do not necessarily
apply
to special
vehicles,
for which
other definitions
are sometimes
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 For some terms, the elements
shown with the reference
mark (*) in the lists for their
definitions
need not be included,

when, specifying
the vehicle
weight
corresponding

given
term
shall
indicate
