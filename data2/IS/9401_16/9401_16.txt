<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 16 ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had been approved by the River Valley
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In measurement of quantities, in construction of river valley projects, a large diversity of methods exist at
present according to local practices. Lack of uniformity may at times create complications regarding measurements
and payments. This standard is intended to provide a uniform basis for measurement of various items of tunneling
in river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the results of a test or measurements made in accordance with this standard, if the final value,
observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,_it shall be done in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical values (  revised)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

be made for the volume of reinforcement. However,
the volume of steel ribs and volume of shotcrete, if
the shotcrete has been measured- by projecting the
excavated profile of the tunnel onto the B-Line, shall
be deducted from the total theoretical volume of
concrete lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
