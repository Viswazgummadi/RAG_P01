FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>&I This  Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
25
February
1972,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Instrumentation
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Volume
change
and stress occur in concrete
dams due to temperature
changes
also.
The
temperature
changes
arise from both
external
and
internal
causes.
The
temperature
effect
may
be
of two general
types
in mass concrete,
namely:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The effect due to the chemical
reaction
of cement
combining
with
water,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The effect due to climatic
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The temperatures
of the faces of a dam are affected
by radiant heating,
evaporation
of water on the face of the dam, reservoir
water,
etc.
The
surface
temperature
is important
because
generally
cracking
begins
at
a surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The
surface
temperature
is important
to study the effect of ambient
temperature
on the surface of the structures
and the temperature
gradient
through
the dam.
‘1 he
external
heating
and
cooling
is as important
as the heating
from within caused by the chemical
reaction
of the cement
combining
with
water.
Most
of the
internal
heating
occurs
during
the first few weeks after casting,
but it continues
for many years after the
dam is completed.
Thus,
in order to determine
the effect of temperature
on
the
stress
and
volume
change
in a dam,
temperature
should
be
measured
at a number
of points
within
the dam,
as well
as at
the
boundaries.
However,
it is not
necessary
to determine
the
detailed
temperature
history of every portion of dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISr6524-1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.5 This standard
contains
clauses which require the user to specify
certain
technical
requirements
at
the
time
of placing
orders
for
thermometers.
The relevant clauses are 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given
to international co-ordination among the standards and practices prevail-
ing in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in
the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accord-
ance with IS  :  2-l 960*.
The number of significant places retained
in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard covers the details of installation and observation of
resistance
type thermometers
of the embedded type for measuring the
temperature in the interior of a concrete dam and such other structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TEMPERATURE
MEASURING
INSTRUMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Resistance Thermometers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1  The operating principle is based on the variations of resistance as
a function of temperature.
Resistance
thermometers
are designed and
constructed for embedment in mass concrete for measurement of internal
temperatures.
A typical resistance thermometer
which is designed to be
embedded permanently
and directly in the  mass
concrete
is shown in
Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2 The coils of resistance
thermometers
are wound with suitable
platinum-or enamelled copper wire wound non-inductively on an insulat-
ing core so as to have a definite resistance at predetermined temperature.
The thermometers
shall have a fixed resistance change over the tem-
perature change
of 0 to 100°C.
The
entire resistance
element
shall
be encased in a soldered brass case to prevent entrance of moisture and
the element shall be further protected by filling the inside of the case with
joint sealing compound to ensure thermal contact between the coil and the
casing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3. NUMBER
AND
LOCATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Apart
from
the externally
imposed
load and deformation
conditions
the greatest
single factor in causing
stresses in massive
concrete
structures
is temparature
change.
Thus,
it is imperative
jhat
temperature
be
measured
accurately
at many points in the structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 It is often sufficient
to select
those portions
of the dam for measure-
ment
which
are typical,
on the one hand,
and
those
which
are most
severe
on the other
hand
and to concentrate
the measurements
in such
locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Since strain meters and stress meters
installed
in dams for strain and
stress measurements
provide
an
accurate
measurement
of temperature
together
with their other indications,
there
is no need of duplicate
instru-
ments for this information
at these
main points of measurement.
However,
sufficient
resistance
thermometers
should
be embedded
at intermediate
points to give a complete
picture
of the temperature
in the body
of the
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  A  typical
scheme
would be to place a thermometer
in 15  x  15 m grid
horizontally
and
vertically
in a minimum
of one block
in the spillway
portion,
a minimum
of one
block
in the non-overflow
portion
of the
dam and in other portions
depending
upon the data required
for detailed
study of the structural
behaviour
of the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Methods
of temperature measurement by electrical resistance thermometers.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 A  ~few thermometers
should
be placed
near and in the downstream
face
to evaluate
the rapid
daily
fluctuations
in temperature.
Thermo-
meters
placed
in the upstream
face as a continuation
of the main thermo-
meter grid will serve to evaluate
lake temperatures
close to the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6 In order to better
define
the steep thermal
gradients
which
may be
more prominent
near the upstream
and the downstream
faces of the dam,
it is desirable
to place thermometers
at 15 cm, 1 m, 2 m and 3 m from both
the downstream
faces of the dam in addition
to those in the grid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7 For measurement
of foundation
temperature,
thermometers
should be
placed
near
the
base
of the
dam
and
also
in
holes
drilled
into
the
foundation
at desired
locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8
In order to study the effect of operating
penstocks
and river outlets, on
the temperature
of surrounding
concrete
mass,
one line of thermometers
should be installed,
spacing of thermometers
from the outside
of penstock
or outlet pipe being
15 cm, -1 m, 2 m and further
as required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  INSTALLATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  In
the
embedment
of a resistance
thermometer
orientation
is not
critical
and the meter
is very rugged.
Prior to embedment
of resistance
thermometers
in
newly
placed
concrete,
each
instrument
should
be
thoroughly
checked
for meter resistance
and lead resistance
to assure that
all units are in proper operation
condition.
Immediately
after embedment
of the thermometer,
the location
may be covered
either with a wooden
plank
or any
temporary
protecting
device,
to protect
the thermometer
from
any damage
that
is
likely
to
occur
during
further
concreting
operations.
Identification
tags should also be attached
to each
thermo-
meter
and careful
record
maintained
about
the
location
where
each
instrument
is laid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Some preparation
is necessary
prior to embedment.
This varies with
the type of embedment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1
For embedment
in the middle of a lift, it has been found helpful to
give
each
thermometer
a quick
dip in sealing compound
as specified
by
the user, and tape with one layer of friction
type tape for additional
shock
resistance
and additional
water-proofing
insurance
during embedment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
Where
resistance
thermometers
are to be embedded
at the up-
stream
fact
to measure
water
temperatures,
additional
water-proofing,
against
hydrostatic
pressure
is furnished
by encasing
the thermometer
in a
suitable
length of grout tubing
which is then completely
filled with sealing
compound
as specified by the user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.1
For fixing
the thermometer
at the upstream
or downstream
face the method
shown in Fig. 2 is recommended.
As an alternative
the
thermometer
may be held by hand against
the form while concrete
is back
fiIled around
it.
It is perhaps
better,
however,
to tie the
thermometer<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 6524 - 1972<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to the form with light
wires and provide anchors
onto the meter
case and
back
into the concrete
so that
the thermometer
will not be pulled
out
of the weak concrete,
when the form is stripped.
Trenches
are formed
in
the fresh concrete
for routing
the cables
from
the thermometer
to the
terminal
board
location,
or if the latter
is located
in a gallery
of the
dam below the thermometer
location,
the cables
are routed
to a conduit
leading
from
the
gallery.
Frequently
the
cable
trench
is made
by
vibrating
a
length
of 20 x 20
cm timber
into the fresh
concrete
after
the individual
thermometers
have been
arranged.
The
timber
is then
removed
from the trench,
the lead cables
placed in the depression
and the
depression
backfilled
with concrete
by hand to cover the cables.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3
For embedment
at the
base
of a lift,
it is best
to tie
down
some wires to the concrete
of the previous
lift or between
two cooling
pipes.
The
thermometer
may then
be wired or taped securely,
to hold
down the thermometer
so that the pressure
of the
mass
concrete
will
not dislodge
it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4
For
an installation
at the
top of a lift,
a small
hole may
be
dug and the thermometer
inserted
and
covered
immediately,
using
the
foot,
or a vibrator,
to puddle
the concrete
around
the instrument.
For
accurate
spacing
at
various
heights
in a lift, the
thermometers
have
sometimes
been taped
to a wood pole carefully
maintained
in vertical
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Cables
and Conduits<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1  Rubber-insulated,
rubber-covered
stranded
copper
cables
have
proved tough and resilient
enough to give good service
during
the shocks
of embedment,
and
during
its long exposure
to the
alkaline
solutions
of the hydrating
concrete.
In general,
cables run from the instrument
to
the nearest gallery for their terminal
locations;
horizontally
directly
in the
concrete
without
conduit,
and in downward
and upward
directions
in
conduit.
The
conduit
may be of almost
any material
which
will
not
collapse
in the fresh concrete.
The
size of the
conduit
may
easily
be
chosen by drawing
circles of the diameter
of the cable.
In order to allow
for ~pulling friction
and
cable
crosses,
provide
for one
and
half
times
the number
of cables
where
the conduit
run
is short,
up to twice
the
number
of circles as there are cables where the runs are long or there are
many
bends.
Circumscribe
these
circles
with a larger
one to find the
inside diameter
of the conduit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2
If the cable
leads are
to cross
expansion
or contraction
joints
in the structure
a slack
cable
recess
should
be provided
at the crossing
point.
This may consist of a wooden box block out, forming
a recess into
which the cable
is run.
During
placement
of concrete
in the adjacent
block
a 30 cm loop of slack
cable
is left in the
unfilled
block
o!rt and
the remaining
length of cable laid in the usual manner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3
Cables
should
be
threaded
individually
into
the
conduit,
SO<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>that  each cable will be required
to support
only iLs otin
weight.
At the
entrance
of the
cables
into
the
conduit
suitable
protection,
such
as
padding
with burlap,
should
be provided around
each
cable and in the
interstices
between
the cables
to prevent
sharp
bends
and
to prevent
the entrance
of concrete
and grout into conduit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4
Where
a group of many
cables
is to be run
horizontally
in a
lift,
they may be taped
together
at
intervals
and
laid
on the
top
of
the
next
to last
layer
of concrete
in the
lift,
dovered
with
pads
of
fresh concrete
at several
points
along
their
length,
and
placement
of
the final concrete
lift layer
allowed
to proceed
in
the
normal
manner.
Single or pairs of cables leads may be ‘walked into’ the concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.5
The
layout
should
be
planned
so that
meters
and
terminal
boards are in the same block.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.6
In
the
general
case
where
a number
of cables
from
widely
separated
points are collected
at one central
point and run downward
in
conduit,
a very
successful
plan
is to run
the
cable
in two steps.
A
collecting
box or concrete
form
is erected
around
the grouped
conduits
so that
the
lift is left about
45 cm low at the conduits.
During
the
placement
of the concrete
in which
the meters
are embedded,
the cables
are brought
horizontally
to the collection
point and there coiled and hung
out of the fresh concrete.
As Soon
as the concrete
has set sufficiently
to
bear
traffic,
the cable
coils are taken
down
the conduit
to the terminal
boards.
The advantages
are that it is much easier to sort and run
cables
when they are not muddied
with fresh concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Terminal Boards -  The
cables
should be terminated
in a suitable
terminal
board.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  OBSERVATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The
observations
of the
instruments
should
begin
as soon as the
instruments
are
covered
and
continue
at
gradually
increased
time
intervals.
As the concrete
-hydrates,
the resulting
heat induces
volume
changes
and consequent
stress change
which vary rapidly during the early
days of the concrete
and more slowly later.
Hence
enough
observations
shall
be
available
to
give
the
complete
picture
of
these
changing
conditions
of temperature.
The following
sliding schedule
that has proved
effective
is recommended:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
An observation
as soon as the meters
are covered
( embedded
)
and two more that day;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) TWO observations
on the second day;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) One reading
per day for ten days or until maximum
temperature
is reached;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 6524 - 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Reading every other day for ten more days;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Thereafter, twice weekly for a month; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Thereafter, weekly until the construction is completed.
Usually
available help falls off sharply at the end of the construction
period and observations should be continued on a twice a month
basis, if help can be spared but not less than monthly, if the help
situation is critical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 A recommended pro  forma  for the record of observations in the field
and for transfer of observations to a permanent record in the office is
given in Appendix A.
Suitable data sheets should be printed in advance
upon which the observations can be noted as they are taken and for
preparation of permanent records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Resistance thermometers are based OK the fact that the ohmic
resistance of a metal wire varies at a practically
linear rate with the
temperature.
The thermometer readings are taken by a test set operating
on the Wheatstone Bridge principle,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1 With the calibration provided for the thermometers (resistance
at 0°C and the change of resistance per “C), resistance readings can be
converted directly to temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  SOURCES
OF ERROR<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The following are the sources of error in measurement of temperature
by resistance thermometers and should be checked frequently:<<HEADING_END>>
