<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee, CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the past several years asbestos cement flat sheets are being manufactured and used in India.
These sheets are either water cured or humid cured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These sheets are mainly used for external wall claddings, partitions, false ceilings, panelling,
furniture and dado work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Asbestos cement flat sheets are different from asbestos cement building boards which are more
porous and flexible and are intended mainly for internal use. Asbestos building boards are covered
separately in IS 2098 : 1964 ‘Specification for asbestos cement building boards’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was originally published in 1966. The present revision has been taken up in the
light of experience gained during its use. In this revision frost cracking test, test for resistance to
acidified waters, and test for water absorption and impermeability have been deleted, since it has
been found that sheets fulfilling requirements for density and bending strength are weather-proof.
Classification and strength of sheets have also been modified in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to international co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing in different countries in addition to relating it to the
practices in the field in this country. Assistance has been derived from BS 690 (Part 2) : 1981
‘Asbestos cement slates and sheets, Part 2 Specification for asbestos cement and cellulose asbestos
cement flat sheets’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in
Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (August 1997). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

colouring matter may be added in the
composition. They may receive coloured or
uncoloured coating on their surface. Pigments
which are embodied in asbestos cement for

<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of the Standard Mark is governed by the provisions of the  Bureau of Indian
Standards Act, 1986  and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder. The Standard Mark on
products covered by an Indian Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply with the requirements of that standard under a well defined system of inspection,
testing and quality control which is devised and supervised by BIS and operated by the
producer. Standard marked products are also continuously checked by BIS for conformity to
that standard as a further safeguard. Details of conditions under which a licence for the use of
the Standard Mark may be granted to manufacturers or producers may be obtained from the
Bureau of Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
