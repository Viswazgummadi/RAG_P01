<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO
(the
International
Organization
for
Standardization)
is a worldwide
federation
of national
standards
bodies
(ISO member
bodies).
The work
of preparing
International
Standards
is normally
carried
out through
ISO
technical
committees.
Each
member
body
interested
in
a subject
for
which
a technical
committee
has been
established
has the
right
to
be
represented
on that committee.
International
organizations,
governmental
and non-governmental,
in liaison with
ISO, also take part in the work.
ISO
collaborates
closely
with
the
International
Electrotechnical
Commission
(lEC)  on all matters
of electrotechnical
standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Draft
International
Standards
adopted
by the
technical
committees
are
circulated
to the member
bodies
for voting.
Publication
as an International
Standard
requires
approval
by at least 75  ‘Yo of the member
bodies
casting
a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
