<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope -
This
standard
prescribes
two
methods
for determination
of bromide,
Bromides ir
the samples
are oxidized
to bromine
in presence of phenol red and subsequently
phenol red i:
brominated
by addition
of chloramine-T.
The
brominated
compound
thus produced
is reddisl
to violet
depending
upon
its concentration.
of reaction before dechlorination
are critical.

of chloramine-T

The  COIOU~  maching is done either visually
or usins
ln case of any difference
of opinion,
the spectrophotometric
method shal
be the referee method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  Interference
-
ions commonly
found in water do not interfere
in the test,
but
oxidizing
an(
reducing agents and iodides do interfere.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bromide may occur
in varying
amounts
in well supplies in coastal areas as a result
of sea
water
intrusion.
Industrial
discharges
may contribute
the bromide found in some fresh
water
streams.
Under normal circumstances,
the bromide content of most drinking
waters
is negligible,
seldom
exceeding
1 mg/l.
This standard supersedes 28 of IS  : 3025-1964

of sampling
and test ( physical and chemical ) for water  used  in industry’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
