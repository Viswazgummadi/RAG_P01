<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of indian Standards, after the draft
finalized
the Housing Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.
by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerable
shortage of houses in the country,
which is also increasing continuously,
has led to
increasing
stress being laid in the development
programmes
of central and state governments,
for
facilitating
speedy and economical
construction
of houses.
Problem of housing
being enormous
amongst
the lower
income
groups,
both
rural
and urban, the maximum stress is being laid OD
housing for these target groups.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is one of a series of standards
on new materials and techniques
of rbof/floor
cons-
truction,
which when implemented,
is likely to result in substantial
savings in material and cost
of construction,
in addition
to achieving
speedy
construction.

Code of
practice<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of reinforced
brick roofs had been quite common in Northern
parts of India.
Its design
was based
on the crushing strength of brick.
The large variation
in crushing strength of bricks
had, however, inhibited their use and raised doubts about the feasibility and performance
of rein-
forced brick roofing/flooring
slab. Further,
the corrosion
of reinforcement
due to contact between
mild steel bars and bricks caused reduction
in the life of
roof.
Also,
the crushing
strength
of
bricks usually being low, the thickness of slab increaser causing an increase in dead load too.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Central Building Research Institute,
Roorkee has developed prefab brick panel
system
which
is a combination
of concrete,
bricks
and reinforcement
such that concrete is used in the zone of
maximum compressive
stresses thereby permitting
the use of lower compressive
strength bricks and
T-beam action develops between partially precast joist and the in-situ concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the result of  a  test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off
in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values
(  revised)‘.
The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If the maximum
deflection in mm, shown during 24 h under load

test
shall be
further subjected to failure load.
Loading
shall
be done
uniformly
through
loading
blocks or
through
hydraulic
jacks and a set of beams to
distribute
the load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Distribution/temperature
reinforcement
in the
form of one 6-mm mild steel Grade I bar con-
forming to IS 432 ( Part 1 )  :  1982 shall be laid
parallel
and perpendicular
to the length of the
panel.
Cement
concrete
( M 15 )
3’5 cm
thick
shall be
laid
over
the panel
and
it
shall be cured by sprinkling
water for 14 days
and
dried
for
14 days
thereafter,
before
testing,
A dial gauge having a
least
count
of 0’02 mm or less and a range of 50 mm
or more shall be fixed at mid span of the panel.
The dial gauge shall be adjusted to indicate zero
reading
under
self
weight
of the panel and
applied dead load.
Design dead load other than
due to self weight of the unit shall be applied
uniformly
over the panel through loading blocks
or by other means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Jf loading
is
done
through
blocks/bricks,
sufficient
gap
shall
be left between adjacent
blocks/bricks
to
ensure
that
they
do
not
touch
each other
even at the final stage of
loading, to prevent transfer of load to supports
of the
panels
through arch action. The loading
shall preferably
be done by making an indepen-
dent
scaffolding
to
previde
safety
to
the
labourers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-4.2 The loading shall continue
till the panel
fails.
If no failure occurs by crushing or break-
ing of unit, the load causing
a deflection
equal
to 1/60th of clear span of the panel shall be
considered
as the
failure
load.
To check that
the limiting
deflection
is not exceeded, a steel
marker shall be fixed below
the panel at mid
epan,
leaving
a gap
of
1/60th of clear span,
before the start of the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.2 The panel shall be subjected to a uniformly
distributed
load equal to 1’25 times the imposed
designed load, applied through loading blocksof
concrete
or steel.
Alternatively
uniform
load
may be applied by hydraulic jacks through a self
reacting frame and a set of beams to distribute
the  load.
The load shall be retained for 24 h and
after recording
deflection
at the
end
of
this
period,
the
load
shall
be removed
without
disturbing the dial gauge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
