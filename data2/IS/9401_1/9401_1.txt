<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement of Works of River Vhlley Projects Sectional Committee, RVD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 1) ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after the draft
finalized by the Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had been approved by the
River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In measurement of quantities, in construction of river valley projects a large diversity of methods exists at
present according to local practices. Lack of uniformity creates complication regarding measurement and
payments. This standard has been formulated in various parts, covering each type of work separately and
Part 1 is intended to provide a uniform basis for measurement of excavation for foundation in the construction
of river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1982. The revision has been taken up in the light of experience gained
during its usage and to align it with current field practices. A number of standards have been published for
measurement of different works undertaken in River Valley Projects and this revision is also intended to harmonize
the earlier version with those parts which have been published since 1982.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of measurements made in accordance with this standard, if the final value, observed or
calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9401 (Part 2 )  :
Method of measurement of works

appurtenant structures )  :  Part 2
Dewatering<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The description of each item shall include conveyance,
delivery, handling, loading, unloading,
storing,
rehandling, etc, including all inputs for finishing to
required shape and size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 GENERAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6  Work to be Measured Separately<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  In case of measurement of proposed work, the
dimensions are read from drawings and then worked
up, that is, reduced to length, area, or volume in
recognized units of measurements for the particular
item. In case of assessment of executed work, the
dimensions are measurements in the field. Calculations
of length, area, volume, weight, etc, are made on the
basis of these dimensions and payments are made
accordingly.
Where measurements of a number of
units are the same it is the usual practice to take
measurements of one unit and multiply the calculated
length, area or volume by the number of units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Work executed in the following conditions shall be
measured separately:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Work in or under water;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Work in liquid mud/marshy land;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Work under tides; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Work in any other specific condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.1 The level and the timings of high and low water
tides, where occuring, shall be stated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.2 Wherever dewatering is resorted to, it shall be
measured in accordance with Part 2 of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Clubbing of Items<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Items may be clubbed together provided that the break
up of items is on the basis of detailed description of
items stated in the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7 Measurements are closely linked with detailed
drawings, description of items and specifications of
the work. These should, therefore, be very clear and
properly worded and the order of precedence shall be
sanctioned drawings, approved specifications and
specified description of items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Booking of Dimensions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In booking dimensions, order shall be consistent and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

separate item.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 MEASUREMENT
OF IRREGULAR
AREAS
AND VOLUMES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Irregular areas shall be divided into a number of
figures of known area, say, triangles, rectangles, etc.
The remaining part ( which cannot be formed into a
triangle or a regular figure ) shall be evaluated on
common basis by Simpsons rule, or average ordinate
rule.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.7 Any activity, such as upheaving, blowing in, etc,
to be measured separately under the item of excavation
shall be clearly specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.8 Excavation shall be measured by taking cross
sections at intervals of 5 metres generally in the original
position before starting of the work and after its
completion. This interval maybe reduced in undulating
and uneven site conditions. However, in isolated and
special cases, excavation shall be measured by taking
off dimensions of pit excavated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 In case of an irregular volume the volume shall be
determined by Prismoidal formula.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

excavations like wells, etc, within the excavated
location shall be deducted from the final measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
