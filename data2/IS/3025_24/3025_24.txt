<<HEADING level=3>>1. Scope-
Prescribes
methods
for determination
of sulphates
in water
and waste water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 Three
methods
as given below are prescribed:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>i) Gravimetric
method,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ii) Thorin
method, -and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>iii) Turbidity
method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The choice depends upon the concentration
range of sulphate
and degree of accuracy required.
Dilution
or concentration
of sample will bring most waters
into the desired range for any of the
methods
prescribed
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. Gravimetric
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Scope
and
Application
-This
method
is applicable
for
all the
waters
having
sulphate
concentrations
above 10 mg/l;
however,
it is a time consuming
method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2
Principle
and Theory -
Sulphate
is precipitated
in hydrochloric acid medium as barium sulphate
by the addition of barium chloride solution. The precipitation
is carried  out  near boiling temperature
and after a period of digestion, the precipitate
is filtered, washed with water until free of chlorides,
ignited or dried and weighed
as barium
sulphate
(BaS0.J.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The reaction
in its simplest
form is  :<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SO;‘+ BaCl

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
interferences
-
Suspended
matter, silica, barium chloride precipitant,
nitrate and sulphate
are
the principal factors in positive error. Alkali metal sulphates and heavy metals, such as chromium and
iron, cause low results.
To minimize
solubility
of barium
sulphite,
the acid concentration
while
precipitating
barium
sulphate,
should
be minimized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Sampling

Highly
polluted

samples
should
be stored

Sulphite
may be oxidized to sulphate by dissolved oxygen
above pH 8,O; samples

sulphite
should
have their pH adjusted
below this value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If the silica concentration
exceeds 25 mg/l,
evaporate the sample nearly to dryness in a
platinum dish on a steam bath. Add 2 ml hydrochloric acid (2.6.2),
tilt the dish and rotate it until the
acid comes in contact with the residue; continue the evaporation to dryness. Complete the drying in
an oven. at 180°C
and if organic matter is present, char over the flame of a burner. Moisten
the
residue with 2 ml distilled water and 2 ml hydrochloric
acid (2.6.2)
and evaporate to dryness on
steam bath. Add 5 ml hydrochloric
acid (2.6.2
), take up the soluble residue in hot water and filter.
Wash the insoluble
silica with several small portions of hot distilled water. Combine the filtrate and
washings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.8
Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.8.1
Adjust the clarified
sample, treated
if, necessary to remove interfering
agents, to. contain
approximately
100 mg of sulphate
ion in  500
ml volume.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8.2
Add 2 to 3 drops of methyl red indicator solution  (26.1
).  Add hydrochloric acid (2.6.2)
drop
by drop till an orange red colour appears. Lower concentrations
of sulphate ion may be tolerated if it
is impracticable
to concentrate
the sample to the optimum level, but in such cases it is better to fix
the total volume
at 150 ml after concentration
on hot plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8.3
Heat the solution to boiling, while stirring gently, add warm barium chloride solution (2.6.3)
slowly
until’ precipitation
appears
to be complete,
then
add about 2 ml in excess. Digest the
precipitate
at 80-90°C
for at least 2 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8.4
Filtration
-Filter
the precipitate
through filter paper (2.6.6)
and wash the precipitate with
small portion of warm distilled water until tne washings
are free of chloride
ions as indicated by
testing
with
silver nitrate-nitric
acid reagent
(2.6.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.8.5
Dry the precipitate
in crucible
and ignite at 800%
for 1 hour.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Note -Do
not allow the filter paper to flame.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.8.6
Cool in a desiccator
and  weigh.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.9
Calculation
-Calculate
the sulphate
concentration
in the sample from the equation:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Suiphate
concentration
as mg/l BaS04 =  mg BaSO, X 411.5
ml of sample<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. Thorin
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
Scope
and Application-This
method is applicable to surface and groundwaters
with sulphate
concentration
in the range 5 to 150 mg/l. Samples having higher concentrations
can be measured by
appropriate
dilution
of sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2
Principle
and
Theory-
Sulphate
ion is titrated
in an alcoholic solution
under controlled
acid
conditions
with
a standard
barium
chloride
solution,
using thorin
as the indicator.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
interferences-There
are
no
interferences
in normal
waters;
however,
chloride
ions
in
concentrations
greater than 1 000 mg/l
cause an indistinct
end point when the sulphate present is
low  (  less than 10 mg/l SC&-). To overcome this interference,
a known amount of sulphate present is
added to sample to increase
the sulphate
concentration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
