Sectional Committee, WRD 16<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft finalized by the
Hydraulic Structures Instrumentation
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Water Resources Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water retaining structures cannot be constructed waterproof.
It often happens
that a minute quantity of
water gets released through various means. This minute quantity of water or seepage through or around a
concrete/masonry
and earth/rockfill
dams is an extremely valuable indicator of the condition and performance
of the dam. The quantity of seepage is, normally, directly related to the level of water in the reservoir.
Any
sudden change in the quantity of seepage without apparent cause, such as a corresponding
change in the
reservoir levels or a heavy rainfall, could indicate a seepage problem. Similarly, when the seepage water
becomes muddy or discoloured,
contains increased quantities of sediment, or changes radically in chemical
content, a likely serious seepage problem is indicated. Wet spots, moisture or seepage appearing at new or
unplanned locations at the abutments or downstream of a concrete dam and on the downstream
slope or below
an embankment could also indicate a seepage problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to reduce seepage and uplift pressure under the dam foundation,
grout curtain is provided near the
underside
(u/s) face for a considerable depth below the base of the concrete/masonry
dam. This provides a
comparatively
watertight barrier to percolation from reservoir. A few metre down stream (d/s) of this grout
curtain a drainage curtain is provided by drilling a line of holes from the foundation gallery and tunnels in the
abutments to intercept any seepage that passes downstream of the grout curtain.
Measurement of seepage
d/s of the grout curtain provides a direct indication of the adequacy and effectiveness of the grout curtain,
drainage curtain and functioning of the drains/holes and helps to decide when and where remedial measures
may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Observations of leakage from contraction joints (ungrouted), lift joints and cracks provide a means for judging
the quality of workmanship as well as indicate the necessity for corrective measures to preserve the integrity of
the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since all the soil materials used for construction are pervious to varied degree, seepage takes place through
earth dams and their foundations.
The water seeping under pressure through the soil voids creates mechanical
drag on the soil particles. When these forces exceed the resistive forces of the soil grains, the movement of
grains may take place. Even a minor washing or removal of grains may lead to progressive decrease in resistance
toseepage and culminate in the formation of cavities leading to ultimate collapse of the structure. It is therefore,
important to keep down the seepage, not only to keep the water loss well within economic limits but also to
take adequate control measures to ensure the safety of the dam against excessive uplift pressure, instability of
downstream slope, piping through the embankment and/or foundation and erosion of material by migration
into open joints in the foundation
and abutments. The purpose of the dam may impose limitations on the
quantity of seepage. Thus seepage has to be controlled either by flat slope, embankment
zonation or by a
system of drains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Besides the loss of water, the adverse effects of seepage may lead to migration of soil particles resulting in
piping failure, and may also contribute to slope failure, or to progressive sloughing. Similarly, excessive pore
pressures in the foundations may result in foundation blow out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Study of seepage and uplift also provide information about the overall state of the grouting, and sudden changes
in the recorded trends indicate need for remedial measures in specific areas. Seepage measurements made at
various locations in the foundations and abutment may indicate the need for increased drainage facilitiers at
some other safe locations to relieve the dam areas of uplift, not caused by the reservoir, but by the underground
seepage water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Results of chemical analysis of water samples collected from drainage holes provide information bout the
foundation material wash in the effluent. Presence of material wash could indicate need for appropriate remedial
measures in the specific areas.

<<PARAGRAPH>>atmosphere. If the weir is submerged or partially
submerged (tail water is high enough to obstruct free
discharge into atmosphere), nonstandard negative
pressure conditions are created affecting the rate of
flow producing error in flow measurement. Thus actual
flow may be greater than the computed one. Free
flow condition is more desirable. In certain condition,
the under-nappe air-space is artificially ventilated to
maintain near atmospheric pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard stipulates the provisions for installation,
observation and maintenance of seepage measuring
devices for concrete/masonry and earth/rockfill dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 SEEPAGE MLUXRING
DEVICES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Seepage measuring devices are required to be installed
to measure quantity of seepage through, around or
under dams. Drain outlets are commonly used was
seepage measurements
points. The seepage water
should be tested to determine its chemical composition
because chemical changes may indicate progressive
dissolution,
decay or erosion in the dam body,
foundation or abutment. The most common type of
seepage measurement devices are weirs, calibrated
containers and flowmeters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following types of weirs are generally used  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Standard contracted rectangular weirs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Standard suppressed rectangular weirs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Standard Cipolletti weirs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Standard 90’ V-Notch weirs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  Weirs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.2  Standard Contracted Rectangular Weir<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.1  General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the distance from the ends or sides of the weir
notch to the side of the pool are great enough to
allow the water free, unconstrained lateral approach
to the crest, the water will flow uniformly and relatively
slowly towards the weir ends. As the water from the
sides of the channel nears the notch, it accelerates
and turns, making a curved flow path or contraction.
When approach conditions from the weir pool allow
complete contraction at the end and the bottom, the
weir is called as contracted weir.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The weir is one of the oldest, simplest and most
reliable types of devices used to measure the quantity
of flow of water. If sufficient fall is present in the
channel and the quantity of water to be measured is
relatively small, the weir is very suitable and economical
measuring devices, because for weir of specific size
and shape, with free flow study stage condition a
specific discharge exists for a specific depth of water
in the upstream pool. Weirs are of two types:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A standard contracted rectangular weir (Fig. 1 A) has
its crest and sides far enough from the bottom and
sides of the weir box or channel in which it is set.
Thus a full contraction is developed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Overflow structure weir; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Submerged orifice weir.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most common types of weirs under category (1)
are rectangular, trapezeida
(Cipolletti) and V-notch
weir. A submerged orifice weir, generally not in use,
can be used where available head is low and the amount
of floating debris are significant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The shape of the opening determines the type of the
weir. For a rectangular or trapezoidal weir, the bottom
edge of the opening is called the crest and the side
edges are called sides Dr weir ends. The sheet of
water leaving the weir crest is called the nappe. Weirs
operate best when they discharge freely into the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>the crest of a rectangular
weir is too small to be
accurately measured. When the depth of water flowing
over the rectangular weir is less than 5 cm triangular
weir is preferred, because the discharge over a triangular
weir increases more rapidly with the head than in the
case of a horizontal rectangular weir. ~The weir generally
used is the 90’ V-notch weir shown in (Fig. 2). However,
22.5’ and 43’ weirscan also be used for comparatively
smaller flow/discharge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Weir<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a rectangular weir is placed in a channel such that
sides of the channel acts as the ends of the weir that
is there is no side contraction
and the nappe has the
same width as of channel, the weir is termed as
suppressed rectangular weir. A standard suppressed
rectangular weir. (Fig. 1B) has its crest far enough
from the bottom of the approach channel so that a
full crest contraction is developed. Because the sides
of the weir coincide with the sides of the approach
channel no-lateral contraction is possible. In this weir
the sides of the approach channel should extend to
downstream
beyond the crest to prevent lateral
expansion of the nappe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Cipolletti
(Trapezoidal)
Weir<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  Cipolletti weir is a contracted trapezoidal weir in
which each side of the notch has a slope of 1 horizontal
to 4 vertical. It is named after its inventor Cesare
Cipolletti, an Italian Engineer. Its popularity rests largely
upon the belief that side slopes of 1 to 4 are just
sufficient to correct the endcontractions
of the nappe
and that the flow is proportronal to the length of the
weir crest. It does not require corrections for end
contractions. The weir has sharpcrest and sharp sides,
bevelled from the downstream side only. It is commonly
used to measure medim discharges. Standard Cipolletti
Weir (Fig. 1C) has its crest and sides far enough
from the bottom-and sides, respectively, of the approach
channel so that full contraction of the nappe occurs.
The weir should not be used for heads less than
about 0.06 m nor for heads greater than one third the
crest length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

INSTALLATION
(V-NOTCH-WEIR )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The upstream edge of the notch should be
machined or filed perpendicular to the upstream
face of the weir and should be free of burrs or
scratches. Material of the weir should be hard
enough and unscratchable by abrasive cloth
or paper during cleaning. Knife edges are not
desirable and should be avoided because they
are difftcult to maintain and do not allow the
nappe to~develop properly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>sides of the approach charmel should preferably
be at least twice the depth of water above the
crest, but not less than 0.3 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The overflow sheet should touch only the
upstream edges of the crest and sides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ii9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The maximum downstream pool level should
be at least 0.6 m below crest elevation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The head on the weir should be taken as the
difference in elevation between the crest and
the water surface at a point upstream from the
weir adistance of four times the maximum head
on the crest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The downstream edges of the notch should
be chamfered if the plate is thicker than the
prescribed crest width. This chamfer should
be at an angle of 45’ or more to the surface of
the crest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cross sectional area of the approach channel
should be at least 8 times that of the nappe at

times and downstream preferably 5 times the
depth of the nappe, if the approach channel
is smaller than that defined the velocity of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>it suitable for particular operating condition. Experience
shows that a rectangular
suppressed weir or a 90”
V-Notch weir provides the most accurate measurement
than others. Usually the range of flows to be measured
by a weir can bet fairly well estimated
in advance.
With this-range in mind, the following points may be
considered while selecting the types of weir.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>approach may be too high and the staff gauge
reading-too low.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n$
The depth of water flowing over the rectangular
weir~should not be less than about 5 cm and
not more than about two-thirds the crest width.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.6.2  Standard
suppressed
rectangular
weir<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The 90“ V-Notch weir is preferred for measuring
discharges between 0.015 m’/sec to 0.03 m’/sec. It
can also work fairly well and is as accurate as other
types of weirs for flow from 0.03 to 0.28 mYsec. For
flows less than 0.015 m3/s, the 22.5’ or 45’ V-notch
weir is preferred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The conditions
for accurate
measurement
with
the standard
suppressed
rectangular
weir are
identical
with those of the standard
contracted
rectangular weir except the side contraction. In the
suppressed weir, the sides of the approach channel
should coincide with the sides of the weir and should
extend downstream beyond the crest to prevent lateral
expansion of the nappe. The vents may be placed on
both sides of the weir box under the nappe to secure
proper aeration beneath the nappe at the crest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.8  DischargeMeasurement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rate of flow or discharge in litres per second
over the crest of a standard contracted rectangular
weir, standard suppressed rectangular weir or standard
Cipolletti weir is determined by the head H in cm. and
by the crest length L in ems. The discharge of the
standard 90° V-Notch weir is determined directly by
the head on the bottom of the V-Notch. As the stream
passes over the weir, the top surface curves downward.
This curved surface, or draw down, extends upstream
~a short distance from the weir notch. The head shall
be measured at a point on the water surface in the
weir pond beyond the effect of the draw down. This
distance should be at least four times the maximum
head on the weir, and the same gauge point should
be used for lesser discharges. A staff gauge having
a graduated scale with the zero placed at the same
elevation as the weir crest is usually provided for the
head measurements. The  staff  should be placed upstream
of the draw down at a distance of 4 times the maximum
weir head, and close enough to the bank for easy
reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.6.3
Standard
Cipolletti
(trapezoidal)
weir<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sides of the weir incline outward at a slope of
onehorizontal
to four vertical. The Cipolletti weir is
a contracted weir, and should beinstalled accordingly.
In this weir the end contraction
are suppressed but
the contracti-ons are compensated by the outward
slope of the weir sides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All conditions for accurate measurements stated for
the standard contracted
rectangular weir apply to
the Cipolletti weir. The weir should not be used for
heads less than 0.06 m nor for heads greater than
one-third the crest length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.6.4  Standard
90’ V-notch weir<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The crest of the standard 90°V-Notch weir consists
of a thin plate set on the sides of the notch which are
inclined 45” from the vertical. This weir operates as a
contracted weir, and all conditions for accuracy stated
for the standard contracted
rectangular weir apply.
The distance from the sides of the weir to the sides
of the channel should be at least twice the head on
the weir. The minimum distance from the crest to the
pool bottom should be measured from the vertex of
the notch to the channel floor and should not be less
thanO.3 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the head is determined,
the rate of flow or
discharge may be found by referring to the tables as
described in the following paras. These tables are
for free-flow conditions and are applicable only to
weirs installed in accordance with the~requirements
for standard contracted weirs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.9  Discharge
Formulas<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.9.1 Standard
contracted
rectangular
weir<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because the V-Notch weir has no crest length and
due~to its shape a small flow has greater head than
that of other types of weirs. This is an advantage for
small discharges because the nappe will spring free
of the crest, whereas, it would cling to the crest of
another type of weir and make the measurement
worthless.
The 45’ and 22.5’ weirs are even more
accurate for smaller flows than the 90’ V-Notch weirs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The discharge
through
the standard

rectangular weirs may be computed by the Francis

<<PARAGRAPH>>which sense the voltage. The sensed voltage is then
transmitted through the cable to the surface unit
which amplifies and conditions the signal, and displays
the results as a velocity measurement. The polarity
and magnitude of this signal is directly proportional
to the direction and velocity of the water. By knowing
the channel dimensions and depth of flow, the quantity
of flow can be computed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For best operating conditions, the weir structure
should be set in a~straight reach of the channel and
perpendicular to the line of flow. The weir crest shall
be horizontal and the bulkhead plumb.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The weir and weir pool should be maintained free of
weeds and trash and the weir pool should be cleaned
of sediment as it accumulates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The device consists of a probe, extension rods and
a surface read out unit. All these are connected by a
cable. The unit is battery powered, light weight and
easily portable. The device has an accuracy within
5 percent at low flows of about 0.003 m3/sec and within
one percent at higher flows of about 0.06 m’/sec.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The level of the crest should be Checked periodically,
and should also be checked with reference to the
elevation of the zero of staff gauge. Inspection should
also be made to determine whether there is leakage
around the weir and, if such leakage exists, necessary
arrangements may be made to stop the leakage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3  Installation of Devices<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care must be taken to avoid damaging the weir notch
itself. Small nicks and dents-can reduce the accuracy
of a good weir installation.
Any nicks and dents that
do occur should be carefully dressed with a fine-cut
file or stone, storking only in the plane of the weir
upstream faces, plane of the weir, crest or sides, or
plane of the chamfers. Under no circumstances should
the upstream corner of the notch be rounded or cham-
fered, nor should any attempt be made to remove
completely fan imperfection
that would change the
shape of the weir opening. Instead, only those portions
of the metal that protrude above the normal surface
s&o&d be removed. The entire stretch of the channel
both downstream and upstream of the notch must be
periodically cleared of weeds, mud, etc, in order to
ensure that the flow is smooth and measurements
are accurately done.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No  installation is required for the portable velocity
meter. The velocity meter is lowered into the flowing
water with the device switches set at “Normal” and
“on” and readings taken for the meter velocity. The
Dbservation should-be taken by skilled staff.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.4  Monitoring Procedures<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The velocity meter is lowered into the flowing water.
The water velocity is read directly from the meter.
Open channel flow may be determined by measuring
the velocity and computing the cross-sectional area
of the channel to the depth of flow. Then the flow
may be computed by multiplying the measured water
velocity and the area of the channel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Calibrated Container Devices<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Flow Meters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is generally used for relatively low flow
condition and is most suitable for monitoring quantity
of flow from drains. The method consists of catching
a known quantity of water in a calibrated container
and measuring the amount of time required to do so.
Rate of flow can easily be computed by dividing the
time to the quantity of water catched. This method
requires that the drain water be either flowing-through
a pipe with an exposed end or the channel with a
vertical drop and an overhang. Such requirements
are necessary so that the container can be placed in
a position to catch the water. Calibrated containers
may be of any size. Commonly used sizes are 1,2,5 or
10 litres in  capacity  for convenience of handling. When
catching the water, the container is held~in a position
so as to catch the total flow, and the time in minutes,
required to fill the container is noted:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many types of flow meters/velocity
meters are
available. Their method of operation vary from the
pitot Qpe principal to propeller-type devices, accoustic
flow meters and electro-magnetic current indicators.
~Most of these devices can be used for measuring
flow in open channels. A relatively new device is the
portable velocity
meter, which can be used for
measuring water velocity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2  Description of Device<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The portable velocity meter probe operates on electro-
magnetic principles. A conductor moving through a
magnetic field will have an induced voltage. In the
velocity meter a signal is generated and sent to an
electromagnet
within the probe, which creates a
magnetic field. The conductor is the water into which
the probe is immersed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rate of flow can be computedas follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

large. The device may be used in a straight reach of
the open channel. The observations should be taken
by skilled staff only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 SELECTION OF SEEPAGE MEASURING
DEVICES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Weir<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The weir is preferred  if  sticient
fall is present in the
channel and the quantity of water to be measured is
small. The weirs are located in the drainage gallery to
measure the drain flow or internal seepage. These
are also used-to measure the overall seepage through
the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Calibrated Container Devices<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is preferred when the quantity of water
to be measured is relatively very small. The device is
used to measure the quantity
of flow from drains.
The device is particularly suitable for measuring the
block-wise or reach-wise seepage from the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Flow Meters<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised
)‘.  The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
