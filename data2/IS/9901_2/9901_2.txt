<<PARAGRAPH>>PART II STATEMENT
OF PRECISION
REQUIREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part II  )  was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 26 October
1981, after the draft finalized
by the Acoustics
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Electronics
and
Tele-
communication
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  It  is not possible
to specify completely
the construction
of laboratory
test facilities
or the sound field conditions
obtained.
Therefore,
some details
of the test set-up and the procedure
must be left to the choice of the operator.
This,
together
with the statistical
character
of sound fields within
rooms,
leads to uncertainties
in the results due to non-systematic
( random  )  and
systematic
influences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Random
influences
can
be
determined
by
repeated
measurements
under
essentially
similar
conditions,
variations
being
made
in order
to
obtain
representative
samples
of
the
actually
existing
conditions
( for
example,
position
of loudspeaker
and
microphone
).
The
repeatability
obtained
is a measure
of the confidence
to be placed
in the results with
respect
to random
influences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Systematic
influences
( for example,
size and
shape
of test rooms,
mounting
conditions
of test specimen,
calibration
of measuring
equipment
)
cannot
be
determined
by
a simple
procedure.
Generally,
comparison
measurements
in different
test set-ups and knowledge
of the random
un-
certainties
under these conditions
are necessary
in order to assess the syste-
matic
influences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In agreement
with modern
statistical
methods,
the concepts
of repeat-
ability
and reproducibility
of complete
results
are used in this standard,
rather
than the variance
of the individual
quantities
comprising
the result.
Repeatability
and reproducibility
offer a simple
means
of checking
and
stating
the precision
of measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 This
standard
which

<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard
( Part II  )  lays down procedures
for assessing uncertainty
in
the
acoustical
measurements
described
in
Parts
III

of
IS  :  9901t
due
to non-systematic
influences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Result-The
final value obtained
by following
the complete
set of
instructions
in the test procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 True
Value
-
For practical
purposes,
it is the value towards
which
the average
of single results obtained
by n laboratories
tends, when n tends
towards
infinity.
Consequently,
such a true value is associated
with the
particular
method
of test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Accuracy
-
The
closeness
of agreement
between
the true value and
the
mean
result
which
would
be obtained
by applying
the test proce-
dure a very large number
of times. The smaller
the systematic
part of the
uncertainty
which
affects
the result,
the more accurate
is the procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Precision
-
The closeness of agreement
between
the results obtained
by applying
the test procedure
several times under prescribed
conditions.
The
smaller
the random
part of the uncertainty,
the more precise is the
procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Repeatability
-
Qualitatively,
it is the closeness
of agreement
bet-
ween successive
results obtained
with the same test procedure,
on the same
test specimen
and under the same conditions
( same operator,
same appara-
tus, same
laboratory
and same intervals
of time ). Quantitatively,
it is
the value
below
which
the absolute
difference
between
two single
test
results
( pair ) obtained
in the above
conditions
may be expected
to lie
with a specified probability.
This quantity
is denoted
by r.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6 Reproducibility
-
Qualitatively,
it is the
closeness
of agreement
between
individual
results
obtained
with the same method
on the same
test specimen
but under different
conditions
( different
operators,
different
apparatus,
different
laboratories
and different
time ). Quantitatively,
it is
the value
below
which
the absolute
difference
between
two single
test
results ( pair ) on the same test specimen
obtained
by operators
in different
laboratories,
using the prescribed
test procedure,
may be expected
to lie
with a specified
probability.
This quantity
is denoted
by Q.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7  Arithmetic
Mean
-
The arithmetic
mean
x for a given set of results
is defined
by the equation:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 *
X=-E
Xi
n  i-l<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n = number
of observed
values xi, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>x = an estimator
for the true value of the mean.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:99Ol(PartII)-1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8 Variance
-
Qualitatively,
a measure
of the dispersion
of a series of
random
results
about
their
average.
Quantitatively,
for a given
set of
results,
the sum of the squares
of the deviation
of each result from
the
arithmetic
mean,
divided
by the number
of degrees
of freedom.
In the
simple
case of n consecutive
( ungrouped
) observations,
the variance
is
calculated
according
to the
equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
$2 is an estimator
for the true value a* of the variance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.9 Standard
Deviation
-
The
positive
square root
s of the variance,
s is an estimator
for the true value of CT of the standard
deviation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.10
Degrees
of Freedom-The
number
of degrees
of freedom
ZJ is
equal to the number
of independent
terms contained
in the expression
for
the variance.
In the simple case of consecutive
( ungrouped
) observations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>v=n-1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.11 Probability
Level -
The probability
that the statement
in question
is true. In this standard,
a probability
level of 95 percent is used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. MEASUREMENT
PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  For routine
testing
according
to this series of standards,
on many
occasions
only one test on a specimen
is carried
out. In such cases, no
reliable
figure
for the confidence
to be placed
in the result is obtained.
In the interest
of reliability,
it may, therefore,
be advantageous
to perform
two tests and check
the difference
of the results against
the repeatability
r of the test procedure.
If their difference
is less than or equal to r, the test
operator
may consider his work as being under control and take the average
of the two results as the estimated
value of the quantity
being tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2
Before
routine
acoustical
testing
is taken
up by an organization,
the repeatability
of the test procedure
and the test set up shall be checked
as to its capability
of producing
reliable
and
repeatable
results.
These
checks should be repeated
from time to time, especially
whenever
changes
in the procedure,
the test set-up or the instrumentation
are made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3
It is recommended
that different
testing- organizations
collaborate
so as to check each- other’s
results for reproducibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:99Ol(PartII)-1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Check OT Repeatability<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1  As a standard
check of repeatability
of airborne
and impact
sound
measurements
under given conditions,
the following
method
shall be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2  A set of six-complete
measurements,
for example;
R, D,Z
or  L,
respectively,
as a function
of frequency,
is grouped into pairs of consecutive
measurements,
without changing
the original order of the set. The difference
in results between
the two members
of every pair is compared
at all fre-
quencies with the requirements
in 4 and Table
1. If these values are exceeded
at any one frequency,
all the results are rejected
and the method of checking
isrepeated
completely.
In case of a second failure to achieve the prescribed
values, the test procedure
and/or the test set-up are considered
inadequate
and shall be improved
to obtain
the required
repeatability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
When carrying out repeatability
checks, the details of the test procedure
should not be reobcated
to the extent
of using. for examole.
identical
oositions
for the microphone, loudspeaker or tapping ma&me,
as thisAwould result $ values
of r unattainable
under
practical
conditions.
Rather,,
these influences be varied
in such~a way as to obtain independent and representatrve
samples of the quantities
affecting the repeatability ( that is, the average sound pressure levels in the rooms ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  REQUIREMENTS
FOR REPEATABILITY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Since
the procedure
outlined
in this standard
has not yet been used
in building acoustics on a broad scale, precise numerical
data of the standard
deviation
of complete
results
exist
only for one laboratory.
From
these
values, tentative
figures for repeatability
requirements
have been calculated
and are given
in Table
1. A simplified
method
for carrying
out inter-
laboratory
measurement
for
determining
these

The determination
of repeatability
according
to this method
in one
laboratory
is very laborious,
since approximately
35 degrees
of freedom
are considered
necessary
for calculating
sufficiently
exact values of s. More-
over, a more reliable
value of the standard
deviation
of the standardized
procedure
will be obtained
if a number
of measurements
on separate
test
specimens
of the same construction
are carried out in different
laboratories.
In
this case,
the standard
deviation
for calculating
the repeatability
is
given
