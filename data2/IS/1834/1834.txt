<<HEADING level=3>>SPECIFICATION FOR
HOT APPLIED SEALING COMPOUNDS FOR
JOINTS IN CONCRETE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>( First Revision)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 14 March
1984, after the draft finalized by the
Building Construction Practices Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Most sealing compounds are bituminous.
The important properties
required
in sealing
compounds
are that it can be applied without
difficulty, are
not unduly affected by temperature
variation,
adhere
strongly to the concrete, and resist any tendency to flow out of the joint
under hot weather conditions or loss of resiliency during cold weather
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Under certain circumstances some of the properties are less important
than the others.
Where the road or runway is not heavily cambered,
a
lower value of resistance to flow may be accepted; in situations where loose
grit is never present in quantity on the surface, resistance to ingress of
water may be of less importance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard
was originally
published in 1961.
In this revision
the physical requirements have been simplified and only important require-
ments retained.
The requirements of softening point, increase in softening
point after heating, filler settlement,
resistance to grit penetratiun
on
impact test and flash point have been dropped,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard
is  complied
with,
the
final value,
observed or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in
accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
specifies
hot applied
sealing
compounds
intended
for
use
in
sealing
joints
in concrete
roads,
runways,
bridges
and
other
strur
:es.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The material
covered
by this standard
is suitable
only for longitudinal
and transverse
joints
not more than
12 m apart
and
where
the effect
of
the breakdowns
of the seal is unlikely
to be serious and the need
to reseal
at more
frequent
intervals
is unlikely
to cause
serious
inconvenience
to
the users and the use of a more
expensive
high
extension
type sealant
is
not justified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  MATERIALS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Joint sealing
compounds,
composed
of suitable
mixtures
of materials,
shall form a resilient
and adhesive
barrier
in concrete
joints
and
shall
be
capable
of resisting
the
infiltration
of *water
and
the
ingress
of solid
particles.
They
shall not be unduly
affected
by temperature
variation,
and shall resist  any  tendency
to flow out of the joint
or be picked
up by
vehicle
tyres under
hot
weather
conditions.
They
shall
not
become
brittle
or suffer loss of resiliency
during
cold weather
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 On heating
in suitably
designed
kettles
they
shall
be capable
of
acquiring
a pouring
consistency
enabling
them
to be run
molten
in a
unibrm
manner
into all types of horizontal
joints
without
difficulty.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8 Sealing
compounds
shall
be employed
for filling
contraction
and
construction
joints
as well as a sealing
medium
above
expansion
joint
fillers [see IS  :  1838 ( Part I )-1983+]
to a depth not exceeding
40 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Suitable
primers
may
be first applied
to the
vertical
faces
of the
concrete
joint
before
the
pouring
of sealing
compounds
in order
to
improve
the adh&ve
qualities
of the latter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

which are subjected

Machine
-
The design of the extension
machine
shall
be such that the assembled
jig may
be clamped
in the machine
holding
the test blocks
12 mm apart,
and that from this position
the two halves of
the jig holding
the
blocks
may
be
pulled
apart
at a rate of 3.00 f
0.01
mm per hour for at least 4 hours.
Means
shall
be provided
for
surrounding

between
the

PREPARATION
OF TEST
SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.1 Preparation
of Mortar
Blocks  -The
mortar
shall be thoroughly
compacted
in the mould in about four layers with a suitable
hand-operated
tamper.
The
blocks
shall
be cured
in the mould
for 24 hours in moist
air
(that
is, under
a damp
cloth ), then
removed
from
the
mould
and cured
for a further
6 days in water.
After curing,
the 50 x 25 mm
test faces shall be ground
with 80 grade
carborundum
powder and water
on a level glass surface
until the laitmce
is completely
removed.
Fresh
Carborundum
powder
shall be used for each block.
Any blocks damaged
during curing or grinding
or which are found after grinding
to contain
any
cavity more than I.5 mm in diameter
in the test face, shall be rejected.
After
grinding
the blocks shall be washed in benzene
to remove
all tracesof
any
shutter oil used in the moulds.
They
shall then be washed
in methylated
spirit and finally in water.
The blocks shall then be dried at a temperature
of 110°C for at least 12 hours and stored in a desiccator
until required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.2
Pouring
of the Sealing
Compound
-The
test blocks
shall
be
placed in the assembled
metal jig at room temperature,
care
being
taken
not to handle
the test faces.
The sample of joint sealing
compound
shall
be heated
and poured
in accordance
with
the
procedure
described
in A-2.2.
Sufficient
sealing
compound
shall be poured
at one time
into
the space between
the test blocks to provide
the excess
sealing
compound
referred
to in C-1.2.
After cooling
for 1 hour
at room
temperature
this
excess sealing
compound
shall be removed
with a hot knife
to give a test
specimen
of 50  x  25  x  12 mm.
After the sealing compound
is poured,
the
test blocks
with the specimen
between,
shall remain
rigidly
clamped
in
the jig until after the ends of the jig
have
been
rigidly
clamped
to the
extension
machine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the suppliers
of the sealing
compound
under test recommend
the
use of the primer
to increase
adhesion
to the concrete,
the test faces of the
prepared
test mortar
blocks
shall
be painted
with
the
recommended
primer.
This
shall
be
well
brushed
in the test surfaces,
carrying
the
primer
up to and slightly over the edge of the blocks,
care being taken
to
avoid leaving
a thick film of primer
on the blocks.
The blocks
shall then
be stored for 16 to 24 hours in a dust-free
atmosphere
to allow the primer
to dry bCf6re they are placed in the jig.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>C-3.1  The prepared specimen in the jig shall be stored for 16 to 24 hours
at a temperature
of 0°C.
It shall then be transferred
to the extension
machine, and the two halves of the jig shall be rigidly clamped to the
two face8 of the extension ma’chine.
The clamp holding the two halves
of  the  jig together shall then be removed.
Atthis stage the test faces of
the concrete blocks shall be 12 mm apart, parallel
to each other,
and
perpendicular
to the direction of pull, and the block8 shall be incapable of
any movement other than that imparted
by controlled
movement
of the
extension machine.
The te8t specimen shall immediately
be surrounded
with chopped ice and allowed to stand for 15 minutes.
The test specimen
shall then be extended at a rate of 3.00fO*Ol mm per hour for a dirtance
of 6 mm, the ice being replenished as often as required during the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the conclusion of extension the Specimen, complete with blocks,
rhall be removed

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) it remain8 adhering to both te8t blocks; and
b) no cavity ha8 formed in any of the four exposed surface8 of the
test specimen with an opening more than 40 mm8 in areas.
If
more than
one cavity
ha8 formed, their area8 shall be added
together and the total shall not exceed 40 mm’.
The
cavities
may
be found
to occur either in the body of the sealing
