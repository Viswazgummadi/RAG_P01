<<PARAGRAPH>>Dams (Overflow and Non-Overflow)
and Diversion Works Sectional Committee, WRD 9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Dams
(Overflow
and Non-Overflow)
and Diversion
Works Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Water
Resource Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to the commencement
of actual construction
of any work in the bed of a river, it becomes obligatory,
in
practically
all the cases, to exclude temporarily
the river flow from the proposed work area during the construc-
tion period so as to permit the work to be done in dry or semi-dry condition. An efficient scheme of diverting the
river flow away from the work area should aim at limiting the seepage into the work area to a minimum.
Proper
planning
and design of such temporary diversion work would be greatly influenced
by the design flood for such
work in addition to other factors. This standard gives the guidelines for estimation ofdesign
flood for diversion
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no IS0 standard on the subject. This standard has been prepared based on indigenous
manufacturers’
datalpractict?s
prevalent
in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed
or calculated
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
should be rounded off in accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised’.
The number of significant
places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
lays down the guidelines
for computa-
tion of design flood for temporary
diversion
of river
during construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The study is based on the frequency
distribution
of
flood peaks (annual, or for specific months ofthe year)
or flood volumes, construction
cost of diversion works
and cost of damages in case of failure as illustrated in
the top portion of Fig. 1. Peak flow is plotted along the
abscissa
and its probability
of occurrence
(or return
period)
is along the ordinate. It is convenient
to keep
the same abscissa for the hydro-economic
analysis in
the lower part of the figure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  FACTORS AFFECTING
THE SELECTION OF
FLOOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Usually,
in the design of any diversion work it is not
economically
feasible to plan on diverting the largest
flood that has ever occurred
or may be expected to
occur at the site and consequently
some lesser require-
ment should be decided upon. This would obviously
depend upon the risk involved in the diversion scheme
under consideration.
In the case of an earthfill dam,
where considerable
areas of the foundation
and the
structure
are exposed
or where overtopping
of the
embankment,
while under construction,
may result in
serious damage or loss of the partially completed work,
the importance
of eliminating
the risk of flooding is
relatively great. This consideration
is not as important
in the case of a concrete dam since the flood waters
may, if the location of appurtenant
structures permits,
overtop the dam with little or no adverse effect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cost of diversion works designed to control differ-
ent peak floods are expressed as annual costs for plot-
ting the construction
cost curve.
The costs from all
damages that will arise from inadequacy
of the capac-
ity of diversion works of different sizes should be esti-
mated, multiplied
by the probability
of such an event
occurring
in any year and plotted against the relevant
flood discharge to draw the~annualized
damage cost
curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Construction
costs and damage
costs are added to
give the total cost curve. The lowest point of the total
cost curve represents the optimum economic
capacity
of the diversion
works capable of meeting the speci-
fied performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following
should be considered
while deciding
the diversion
flood capacity:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The period of stoppage of works during flood
seasons and the number of flood seasons which
are to be managed
during the work;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This process is the basis for estimating the dimensions
of the diversion works, but, of course, costing the risk
to human life and other types of damages is very diffi-
cult. It is also difficult to make any realistic estimate of
the flood peak liable to cause this damage. Neverthe-
less, it should be possible to determine
the upper and
lower limits ofthese curves with an acceptable degree
of accuracy.
The confidence
band has been drawn in
Fig. 1 on the flood frequency
line at the top and on the
construction
cost, damage cost and total cost curves
at the bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3  OFTlMIZATION TECHNIQUE TO DECIDE
DIVERSION FLOW CAPACITY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Despite the uncertainties
in hydrology
and in costing
these items, there is no significant
difference
in the
optimum capacities read from the lowest point of the
mean curve and the top and bottom limit curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Designing
the discharge
capacity
of the diversion
works may be thought of in terms of an optimization
calculation
taking safety into account. Optimization
aims at minimizing:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the above analysis,
the increase in the cost of
protection works to handle progressively
larger floods
may be compared with the cost of damages resulting if
such flood occurred. Judgment may be made in deter-
mining the amount of risk that can be taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the construction
cost ofthe diversion works, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the cost of damage that would result from under-
design not only at the construction
site itself but<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 14815 : 2000<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For small dams to be constructed in a single season, it
would be sufficiently conservative to provide for the
largest flood likely to occur in a 5 year period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The higher of the two should be taken as the capacity
of the design flood for diversion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Diversion Capacity for Embankment Dams<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 DESIGN FLOODS FOR DIVERSION CAPACITY
FORDIFFERENTTYPESOFDAMSAND
BARRAGES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Overtopping of a partly completed embankment dam
would be very serious and even disastrous.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1  For Small and Intermediate Dams<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The diversion design flood should be arrived at
according to criteria of risk and damage discussed in 2
and 3. However, the guidelines given in  4.1  and 4.2
would be useful to arrive at the capacity of diversion
flood for different types of dams and barrages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Usually a frequency of 5 to 20 years flood is taken to
decide the capacity of diversion works. In case the
diversion arrangements like tunnels are to be used sub-
sequently as permanent structure like tunnel spillway,
the capacity may be equal to the discharging capacity
of the permanent structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Diversion Capacity  for Concrete  Dams and
Barrages<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2  For Large Dams<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The capacity of the diversion flood for concrete dams
and barrages may be less because flood higher than
the designed one could be passed safely over the partly
constructed dam. The following criteria would help in
deciding the capacity  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The diversion capacity should be evaluated on the
basis of risk and cost factors as outlined in 2 and 3.
However, for large dams, it is desirable that 100 years
flood should be adopted for diversion works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Suitable protection measure should be taken at the end
of the construction season for the top and downstream
ofthe embankment dam to pass surplus flow consider-
ing the possibility of the flood exceeding the design
diversion flood.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
