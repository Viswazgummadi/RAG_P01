<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Second Revision 1 was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian Standards
on
7 February 1989, after the draft finalized by the Planning,
Byelaws and Dimensional Co-ordination
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1960 and revised in 1976. The present revision has been under-
taken with a view to updating its contents. In this revision, building design and construction
aspect
has been incorporated
in detail covering fire safety. The site location aspect has also been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Libraries of all types are expanding at an enormous rate. Increase in demand for documents,
official
policy and increase in literacy make this process inevitable. Since the development of new library takes
several years, the stock to be accommodated
on the opening day, therefore,
will be larger than was
estimated when the planning started.
Therefore, it.  is  absolutely
essential to estimate the areas of the
library building at a given future
date and relate the requirements to that date. The additions and
alterations later are likely to cause fire hazards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The recommendations
made in this standard
may not, however, ~meet all the situations
that may
arise in ‘individual cases and it may become necessary to ~deviate from the provisions
of this standard
or suitably adapt them to meet such situations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied
with,
the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.  The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

FOR DESIGN
4.4 Dormitory
Library<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-The
essential
function
of a dormitory
library
is to store readinq
materials
weeded
out
by
any smgle large library
and,‘or
by different
service
libraries
in a region
or a state.
It is not
a service
library.
Whenever
any reading
material
stored
in a
dormitory
library
is required
by a reader,
it will be
sent on to his service library.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 This standard
has ‘open access’ libraries
in
view as the design for, ‘open access’ will also suit
the ‘closed system’ whereas the converse
is not
true. A note on basic principles of design is given
in Annex B indicating the factors to be taken into
account in the design of a library building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5  LOCATION
4 CLASSIFICATION
OF LIBRARIES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The proper location of a library will substan-
tially influence the extent to which its services
will be made-use of by the
reading
public.
The
location of a library should be such that it is con-
veniently
accessible
to those it is designed to
serve. The,site selected for building should satisfy
the following norms:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.0 For the purpose
of this standard,
libraries
have been grouped into the following categories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Public Library ( PL )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) National
Library
( NL ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) State Library ( SL ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Adequate
separation
( about 10 m ) should
preferably
be
available
between
the
building
and
the
other
neighbo#uring
buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) City Library ( CL ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) District Library
( DL ), and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Branch Library ( BL ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The site shall not be in
the immediate
neighbourhood
of
any
hazardous
occupancy.
4.2 Academic Library ( AL )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Librachine
or mobile
or travelling
library
is covered
separately
in IS 2661  :  1978.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C)  The  site shall abut on a road
of not less
than  12  m width. One end of the road shall
join another road of the same width and
the road shall not have a dead end.<<HEADING_END>>

of watar is assured for
fire ‘fightine purposes.
e) A
public
fire
brigade
is
within
easy
running distance from the site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>52.4
Dormitory Library<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A dormitory library may be located in an area
where land is inexpensive and available for future
extension. It shall have unobstructed
access all
the year round from the service library concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The following
general
considerations
shall
apply in regard to the location of different kinds
of libraries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the
general reading room to the stack room.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Where necessary, two or more users may be
accommodated
in one room depending
upon the
size and the kind of library and the intensity to
its use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3  The general reading room should be close
to the entrance.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 Additional rooms may be added to those given
in Table 1 to meet special needs, such as, repro-
graphy, music library, map library, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.6 The librarian or the deputy librarian
should
have his room in close proximity
to the general

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  Each floor of the library building shall be at
one single level to facilitate the movement of book
trolley from one part to another.
Thresholds shall

tier to another
where there are three or more
tiers in the stack room,
should be through
elect-
ric lifts provided
within the stack
room with
landing at every tier
of the stack room and at
other connected adjacent rooms. In large libraries
where quick mechanical
carriage
of books and
related
materials
are required,
special arrange-
ments, such as, pneumatic tubes and belt conve-
yors may become necessary. This may require to
be considered at the initial stages of design of the
library and its building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.8 The technical
staff shall have independent
access to the stack and ‘catalogue areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Therefore
and in view of
design of the library building, This would parti-

to be under the control
of the circulation
staff within the counter enclosure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to
have a

for passing of books between the readers

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3 DIMENSIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.1 The basic dimensions
of a library
building
shall be in multiples or submultiples
of 100 mm
module. The dimensions
concern
every piece of
library furniture -
the small
primary
charging
tray, the final charging
tray,
the
primary
work
box for the sections, the trays in the work tables,
the work tables themselves, the catalogue cabinets,
the book trolleys,
the book
racks, the window
sills, the reader’s tables, the circulation
counter,
the turnstile of the circulation
counter,
the height
of the book rack, the height of the windows and
doors, etc. The
dimensions
of each
of
these
should register with one another.
The cost of
production,
servicing and replacement-will
swell
unnecessarily
if they do
not all
conform
to
modular standard
dimensions. Economy
of space
and comfort
to reader
are the deciding factors
in fixing the various dimensions.
Special attention
should also be given to economical storage and
proper protection of books.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
