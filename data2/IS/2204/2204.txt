FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
InstiA
tution on 22 October
1962, after
the draft
finalized
by the Building
Construction
Practices
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Building Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Reinforced
concrete
shell roofs are chosen commonly
for covering
large clear areas
using the minimum of intermediate
supports, such as
in factory buildings,
godowns, power stations,
garages,
island platforms
of railway stations, stadia, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 This standard is intended
to give a general
guidance
to those
engaged in the construction
of reinforced
concrete
shell roofs.
Because
of the multiplicity
of shapes employed in modern shell construction,
it is
difficult
to lay down rules
which
will have a universal
application.
It needs hardly be emphasized
that the design and construction
of sheil
roofs is a specialized
job
and the specifications
of the designer
shall
always prevail over the general regulations
laid down in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of this
standard has taken into consideration
the views of builders and techno-
logists and has related the standard
to the building
practices
followed
in the country
in this field.
Due weightage
has also been given to the
need for international
co-ordination
among
standards
prevailing
in
different countries of the world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Wherever
a reference
to any Indian Standard
appears
in this code,
it shall be taken as a reference to the latest version of the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Metric
system has been adopted
in India
and all quantities
and
dimensions in this standard have been given in this system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For
the
purpose
of deciding
wh ther
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied with, th e-fie nal value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded off in
accordance
with IS : 2-1960
Rules for Rounding
Off Numerical
Values
(  Revised  ).
The number of significant

standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.7 This standard
is intended chiefly to cover the technical provisions
relating to reinforced concrete
shell roof construction,
and it dots not
cover all the necessary provisions of a contract.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.S  This standard covers the  in-situ  construction
of reinforced concrete
shells of single and double curvature.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2 Precast and prestressed shells  are not  covered in this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X,3 Shells of light weight concrete  are  also excluded from the scope of
this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>28 For  the  purpose

Cylindrical
shells with the two
springings at different levels and built in sing!e or multiple bays and
having provisions for north-light
glazing ( see Fig. 7 )_<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.0  Ruled Surfaces  -A
surface which can be generated entirely by a
straight line,
The surface is said to be singly ruled if at every point a
single straight
line only can be ruled and  ‘doubly
ruled  ’  if at ever)
point two straight
lines can be ruled.
Cylindrical
shell and conoid
( see Fig. 8 ) are
examples
of singly ruled surfaces,
and .hyperbolic
paraboloid
( see Fig. 9A and 9B ) and inverted
umbrella ( see Fig. 10 )
are examples of doubly ruled surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Ruled surfaces have a practical
advantage
that they can be formed
by straight
plank shuttering.
Doubly ruled surfaces
obviously
have
greater advantage
for shuttering than singly ruled surfaces.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.9  Shells of Revoiution-
Those generated
by curves revolved about
iheii axis of symmetry.
Examples
are segmental
domes
(see Fig.  11  ),
paraboloids
of revolution
and hyperboloids
of revolution.
The term
‘  hyperboloid
of revolution ‘) unless otherwise
qualified,
will mean
hyperboloid of revolution of one sheet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3. NECESSARY
INFORMATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 For the efficient
construction
of shell
roofs,
detailed
information
with regard
to &e following
shall
be furnished
by the designer
to the
builder:
Working
drawings
showing
the
orientation
and
arrangement
of
shells,
dimensions,
details
of
reinforcement
including
exact
positioning,
and
other
salient
features,
such as arrangement
of
north
lighting,
skylight,
roof
drainage,
construction
joints
and
expansion
joints,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Before the construction,
the builder
shall  give detailed
consideration
to the design
and
fabrication
of formwork
and centering.
The details
of hrliiwork
and the sequence
of erection
and release
of formhork
use:1
in shell construction
shall be as approved
by the designer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. DESIGN
CONSIDERATiONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Slope -
Generally,
if the slope
of the shell exceeds
45”, it will bt,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_15>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Is:2204-1962<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>too steep for easy concreting
and will necessitate
the use of backforms
( see Note ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -It
is the experience
of some builders that concreting
can be done with-
out the use of backforms
up to a slope of 60’ if it is for short distances,
and with
cautioas
tamping,
satisfatitory
compaction
of concrete
even up to a slope of 65O
would be possible without backforms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1  The
thickness
of singly-curved
shells
shall,
in no case,
be less
than 5 cm.
It is the usual practice
to thicken
the shells near the edges
and the traverses.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
The thickness
of shells
of double-curvature
shall,
in no case,
be
less than 4 cm.
This
minimum
thickness
is adequate,
as shells of double
curvature
are non-developable
and hence are more resistant
to buckling.
Moreover,
flexural
stresses
are small.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3  End Frames or Traverses -
An  ‘  end frame  ’  or  ‘  traverse
’  is provided
to preserve
the shape
of the shell.
It may
be a solid diaphragm,
an
arch rib, a portal
frame
or a bowstring
girder.
Where
a clear
soffit
is
required,
especially
where
travelling
formwork
is employed,
the end
frames
may consist
of up-stand
ribs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Reinforcement<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1  The diameter
of reinforcement
shall
not be less than
5 mm in
the unthickened
portion
of the shell, and shall not be greater
than
the
following
limits:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10 mm dia
For shells from 4 cm up to less than
5 cm thick<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12 mm dia
For shells from 5 cm up to less than
6.5 cm thick<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16 mm dia
For shells 6.5 cm and
over in thick-
ness<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1.1
The maximum
diameters
specified
in 4.4.1 apply only
to the
unthickened
portion
of the shell.
Larger
diameters
for reinforcement
will be permissible
subject
to the approval
by the designer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2
The maximum
spacing
of reinforcement
in any direction
shall
be
limited
to five
times
the
thickness
of the
shell
and
the
area
of
unreinforced
panel
shall
in no
case
exceed
15  d2  where
d  is
the
thickness
of the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.3
The total
depth
occupied
by reinforcement
in the direction
of
thickness
in the unthickened
portion
of the shell
shall
not exceed
three
times the maximum
permissible
diameter
for reinfor ct mcnt

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1  Generally,
a nominal mix of 1  :  2  :  4 (by nominal volumes ) may
be used for shells of medium dimensions and a nominal mix by volume
of 1  :  14  :  3 for very large shells.
In no case shall the nominal mix for
concrete used in shell construction
be lower than 1  :  2  :  4. It is, however,
desirable
that the required
strength
for concrete
is arrived
at from
considerations
of stresses in the shell and its elastic stability, and the
mixes specified by strength
rather
than
by nominal
volumes.
Rich
mixes will be generally undesirable as the concrete shrinks more, giving
rise to cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2 Wherever
feasible,
the
maximum
size
of aggregate
shall
be 20 mm.
If there are difficulties in placing
such a concrete,
the
maximum size may be restricted
to 12 mm provided the requirements
for strength are satisfied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - ‘  20  mm maximum size  ’  of eggregste corrwponda to  *  12 mm nominal
size  ’  according to *IS  :  383-1952 Specification for Coarse and Fine Aggregates from
Netural Sources for Concrete.
4.5.3 It is advisable to use an air-entraining
agent so that satisfactory
workability is obtained without increasing the water content of the mix.
Concrete
having excessive water contents
should be avoided as it is
likely to slip down steep slopes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  SEQUENCE OF CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Shells may have edge members which are designed to act in unison
with the shells; adjacent shells may also have been designed to take the
loads in unison.
For ease and economy of construction,
however,
it is
generally
necessary
to construct
the various elements separately.
In
order that the .final stress
pattern
in the completed
structure
may
conform as closely as possible to that assumed by the designer, it is
necessary
that
the
designer
should specify the essential
conditions
governing the sequence of construction.
The actual sequence proposed
by the builder shall be subject to the designer’s approval before construc-
tion starts on any of the elements of the shell structure and this sequence
shall not be varied without the designer’s approval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 In the type of shell roofs, covered by this standard,

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  The
reinforcement
in
shell
structure
including
edge
members,
traverses,
etc, shall
be placed
as shown
in the drawing
accompanying
the design.
To ensure
monolithic
connection
between

members,
the shell reinforcement
shall bc adequately
anchored
into
the
edge members
or vice versa,
by providing
suitable
bond
bars
from
the
edge members
to the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1  Reinforcement in the Shell-
As far as possible,
hooks
shall

to
the plane
of the
shell.
Only
the

joints
in the bars shall be used and the joints
shall be staggered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -Welding

is used,
it shall
be done
with  extreme
caution
for successful
results.
7.1.3 Provision
of special
couplings
may
be advantageous
in edge
members
of large spans as it would
avoid
congestion
of bars ( see Note )
due to laps and
hooks.
In such cases,
the details

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1
The full thickness
of,the
shell
shall
be concreted
in one operation.
The positioning
of the construction
joints
shall
be as indicated
by the
designer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The portion
of an up-stand
member,
if any,
shall
be concreted
as
soon as possible
after
the concreting
of the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Edge members
and end
frames
shall
be concreted
first.
A slump
of 4 cm for the concrete
will be sufficient.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 For casting
the shell either
hand tamping
or mechanical
compaction
by vibrators
may be used.
The concrete
shall have a slump of not less
than
5 cm,
if hand
tarnping
is used.
Concreting
may
be
done
in
panels
of
convenient
dimensions
and
shape.
In
the case
of singly-
curved
shells,
the panel
should
be laid
parallel
to the
curved
edge
in order to limit the effect
of shrinkage;
each
panel
shall
be started
at
the lowest
level
and
worked
upwards.
In the case
of doubly
curved
shells,
the
arrangement
of panels
shall
be
decided
by the
designer
giving due consideration
to shrinkage
effects.
Mechanical
compaction
shall be done by using screed
vibrators
generally.
Needle vibrators
may
be used
in thickened
portions
of the shell
as advised
by the designer;
however,
use of needle
vibrators
shall be restricted
to edge
members
or
thickened
portions
of the
shell
where
the
depth
will
be
sufficient
to accommodate
these vibrators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.4 Concreting

This
thickness
of the shell
shall
also
be
accurately
checked at typical points in between the thickness
guides on
the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7 Proper arrangements
shall be rr.Jde to avoid displacement
of steel
during placing of concrete by providing walkways above the level of the
finished concrete
and
supported

the
reinforcement
at intervals
so as to avoid disturbance
of the reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.8 Construction Joints -Construction
joints
shall invariably
be along
the curve.
They
shall
preferably
be located
along
a line of zero
shear
stress,
as for example,
along
the
directrix
at mid-span.
The
construction
joints
shall be finished in such a way that new concrete
will effectively
bond with the old.
When the work is commenced
the
next day, the joints
shall be cleaned with wire brushes and slushed with
cement slurry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.9 The surface of the concrete
shall be finished vith wooden floats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.10 The portions of the shell that are already

quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10. CURING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1 In a shell roof, the ratio of the exposed
area
to the volume of
concrete is relatively
much larger in comparison
with normal reinforced
concrete
structures.
Hence,
extreme
care
is
required
in
keeping
the surface
sufficient!y
damp
for curing.
As soon as concrete
has
sufficiently hardened
to prevent
damage
to it, it shall
be kept conti-
nuously moist for the first 24 hours by covering
the surface
with wet
canvas or gunny bags.
Thereafter,
the surface
shall
be kept continu-
ously
moist
for a period
of at least
10 days by sprinkling
water or
by covering it with gunny bags or similar
materials
which are sprayed
over with water periodically;
alternatively
curing compounds
may be
used with the approval of the engineer in-charge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  The process of decentering
shall be gradual
and without
shock and
so controlled
that
the .ovcrall
stress
pattern
in the
structure,
at any
stage
of decentering
is reasonably
similar
to the pattern
expected
in the
design.
Supports
of adjacent
edge members
may
have
to be lowered
simultaneously
with those
of the shell.
The
decentering
procedure
to
be actually
adopted
shall be subject
to the designer’s
approval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1  -
As D  general guido, the decentering
may commenre
when concrete has
attained
a strength
equal to twice the maximum dead load stress
multiplied
by  a
factor
equnl to FcjFb,
where Fc = ultimate
crushing
sfrength
of concrete,
and
Fb =  ultimate
buck!ing strength
of ihe concrete
in tho shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 -
Generally in the absence of test results on cubes,
the centering
of the
shell may
be removed
at the end of 14 days, and the decentering
the bottom
shuttering
of the edge members
and the end frames may be done at the end
of 21
days.
Uy casting
the latter
a  week in advance
