<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after the
draft
finalized by the Building Construction
Practices Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Use of stone masonry work is known and practised from the earlier days and natural building stone
is extensively
available
in many parts of this country.
The types of stone masonry construction
followed
depends on local factors
like physical characteristics
of the stone, climatic conditions,
workmanship,
etc. Certain
broad
principles
in laying, bonding, breaking of joints and finish shall
be complied
with in order that the masonry
develops
adequate
strength
and presents
a neat
appearance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
(Part 2 ) covers ashlar masonry
which is commonly
used in stone work in most
cases.
Part I of the standard
covers rubble
masonry.
Ashlar
masonry
is generally
used in
important
buildings
where strength
and the life of the structure
is the criterion.
This type of
masonry is also abundantly
used in facing of the stone masonry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1967.
The present revision has been taken up to incorporate
the improvements found necessary in light of the usage of this standard and suggestions
by various
bodies implementing it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard
several construction
agencies in this country having wide
experience in stone work have been consulted.
Due weightage has also been given to international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing in different countries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding whether
a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of 7 days.
The top of the masonry work shall be left flooded
with water, with the close of the day.
Watering
shall be done
carefully
so as not to iisturb
or
wash out green mortar and use of perforated
rose
