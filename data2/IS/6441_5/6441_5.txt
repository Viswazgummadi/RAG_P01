FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Part V  )  was adapted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 21 February
1972, after the draft finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
-&rgineering Division ~Counci!.
0.2 Autoclaved
cellular
concrete
is a class of material,
which -has been
developed commercially
abroad and is in the process of development in
this country also.
A series of Indian
Standards
on cellular
concrete
is
being formulated so as to provide guidance in obtainiug
reliable
products
in autoclaved cellular concrete.
The Sectional
Commrttee has considered
it desirable
to issue a standard
for the methods of test for autoclaved
cellular concrete products for the guidance of manufacturers
and users.
0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.
0.4 For convenience
of reference,
‘Indian
Standard
methods of test for
autoclaved cellular concrete products’ has been grouped into the following
nine parts;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
( Part V ) covers
the method
for tlctermining
the
compressive strength of autoclaved cellular concrete products using cubes.
. ..’
2. TEST
SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Size, of Specimens
-
Compressive
strength shall be determined
on
cubes with an edge length of 15 cm.
When the specimens are taken from
samples of smaller thickness,
cubes may be built up, without gluing, of
two or three plane, ground square slices of thickness 7.5 cm and 5 cm
respectively.
In such cases, the direction
of compression during testing
shall be perpendicular
to the broad faces ( plane surfaces  )  of these slices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.~1.1 Specimens
may be prepared from items which have previously
been lrsed for other tests, provided the specimens are cut at least 15 cm
from an area where visible damage or changes to the normal structure and
appearance
have occurred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  Number
of Specimens
-
For every sample that is to be tested for
compressive strength, three cubes shall be taken and these shall form a test
series.
Wherever
possible, one cube shall be prepared from the upper
third of the sample, one from the middle and one from the lower section
determined
in the direction
of rise of the concrete
mass during manu-
facture,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Preparation
of Specimens
-
The specimens shall be cut by means
of rotating blades of steel or Carborundum, or similar devices.
shall not contain reinforcement
rods.
The pieces
All surfaces shall be clean cut and
-plane.
Particular
care shall be taken that the pressure faces of the cubes,
that is, the faces which are in contact with the platens of the test machine
do not deviate from planeness by more than 0.1 mm.
The same accuracy
shall apply to the joint faces if the cubes are made up of several slices as
mentioned
in 2.1.
Planeness shall be checked across the two diagonals
using a straig.ht-edge.
Deviations
shall be corrected
by means
of dry
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>grinding, mrllmg or a similar process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.1
Grinding the Specimen -
For plane-grinding
of the cubes, slab ~of
sandstone
or Carborundum
shall be used as a grinding medium.
While<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Krintling.
the slab
is
kept
horizontal
and is continuous!y
flushed with
water. ‘The grinding operation consists of continuous and uniform circular
movements of the test cube on the grinding slab.
It shall be ensured that
all the surfaces of the slab are used in order to avoid an uneven wearing
of the same.
The cube shall be pressed hard against the slab~to ensure
even grinding.
The operation is continued until the cube, after checking
by a steel ruler against light, appears to be even.
The best results are
oljtained
by  dragging the ruler slowly, along the cube surface, first parallel
to one diagonal and then to the other.
Before checking, all the dust from
the surface of the cube shall be wiped out, otherwise a thin layer may
conceal
unevenness of the surface.
Having grdund one series of cubes,
grinding of another will be started.
By the time the second lot is ground
the surfaces of the cubes of first lot shall have dried out and flaws, if any,
in th‘e exactness of the grinding, which were invisible,
as long as the cube
rema.inetl wet c~ln be clctectcd.
Such cubes shall be repaired by regrinding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  Conditioning -
Prior to testing, the specimens shall be conditioned
to a moisture content between
10 f 2 percent by weight as average
of
three cubes and not less than 7 percent for any one of the cubes, calculated
on dry weight at 105°C.
If drying is necessary,
it shall be conducted at a
temperature
not exceeding
50°C.
After drying and prior to testing the
specimens
shall be stored at room temperature
until temperature
cquili-
bpium has been reached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -Five
hours
storage
at
room
temperature
is generally
sufficient
if the
drying temperature applied has been 5O’C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. TESTING EQUIPMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Compression Testing Machine -  shall preferably
be hydraulically
operated and shall permit reading of ultimate load with a maximum error
of f 2-O percent.
The machine
shall be equipped with suitable controls
to comply with 4.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Calliper -
shall be capable of readings with an accuracy of 0.1 mm.
The measuring faces shall have an area of at least 50 mm*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Straight-Edge<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4 Balance -
shall have a weighing accuracy of 0.5 g.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5  Drying
Oven -
shall be capable
of maintaining
temperatures
at
105 f
5°C and 50 f 5°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Determination
of Density
of Specimens
Under Test Condi-
tions -
The .specimens shall be weighed and measured according to the<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS L 6441 ( Part V ),- 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>procedure
described
in IS :6441
( P&t I )-1972*.
Dimensions
of the
pressure surfaces shall be measured with an accuracy of f 0.1 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Testing Under Compression Load -  The cubes shall be placed in
the compression machine and load applied perpendicular
to the direction
of the slices from which the cube thickness has been built up.
For cubes
which have been prepared
in one piece, the direction
of load shall be
perpendicular
to the direction of rise of the mass during production.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1 The specimens shall be loaded at the rate of 0.5 to 2 kgf/cm* in
such a way that failure occurs within 30 seconds.
4.3  Moisture Content at Testing -
After loading, the specimens shall
be weighed and dried out at 105 f
5°C until constant weight is obtained
as described in the procedure for determining
the bulk density of aerated
concrete
[see IS:6441
(  Part I )-1972* 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  The moisture content
F  of the dry material
s!iall be determined
according to the following equation:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>AW
F--w-
X 100 percent<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A W =  weight loss during drying in g, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W = weight of the dried out sample in g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The compressive strength ec,, follows from:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ecu =  -$-
kgf / cm*<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where
L =  breaking load in kgf, and
A = area in ems over which load  L  was applied.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 The bulk density Y J’ ( of dry material ) shall be calculated from the
following equation:
WI
Y-V =
-ixo.olF
/  V  g/cm3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Wi = weight of the cube in g prior to testing,
F
=  moisture content in percent at the time oftesting,
and
V
=  volume in cm3 at the time of testing.<<HEADING_END>>
