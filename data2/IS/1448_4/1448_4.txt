<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  Four methods
are
prescribed
for the dcterminarion
of asll: sulphatcd
ash and water soluble ash of prtroleum
products
and greases.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 Method
A is suitable
for the determination
of ash from distillate
and
residual
fuel oils, gas turbine
fuels,
crude
oils, lubricating
oils, waxes and
other petroleum
products,
in which any
ash-forming
materials
present
are
normally
consideked
to be undesirable
impurities
or
contaminants
( see
Note 1 ). The method
is limited to petroleum
products
which are free from
added ash-formimg
additives,
including
certain
phosphorus
compounds
( see
Note 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -
In certain
type of samples,
all of the ash forming
metals
may not be
retained
quantitatively
in the ash.
This is particularly
true of distillate
oils which
require
a special
ashing procedure
in order to retain
mrtals
quantitatively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2-
This method
is not intended
for the analysis
of unused lubricating
oils
fontaining
additives,
for such samples
use Method
C; neither
it is intcndrd
for the
analysis
of lubricating
oils containing
lead,
nor for used engine crankcase
oils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1.3  Methods
Br and B, are prescribed
for the determination
of ash from
greases.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.4 Method
C describes
a p:ocedure
for determining
the
sulphated
ash
from
unused
lubricating
oils
containing
additives
and
from
additive
concentrates
used in compounding.
These
additives
usually
contain
one
or
more
of the
following
metals:
barium,
calcium,
magnesium,
zinc,
potassium,
sodium
and tin.
The
elements
of sulphur,
phosphorus,
and
chlorine
may also be present
in combined
form.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.4.1
Application
of this method
to sulphated
ash levels below O-02 per-
cent is restricted
to oils containing
ashless
additives.
The
lower limit
of
the method
is 0.005 percent
sulphated
ash.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.4.2
There
is evidence
that magnesium
does not react in the same way
as other alkali metals
in this test.
If magnesium
additives
are present the
data should be interpreted
with caution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.4.3
There
is evidence
that samples
containing
molybdenum
may give
low results because
molybdenum
compounds
may not be fully recovered
at
the temperature
of ashing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.5 Method
D is applicable
to all types of petroleum
oils, either unused or
used. When
the samnle under
test contains
lead compounds
or some of the
alkali
metals,

<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of these methods,
the following
definitions
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  Ash -
The
inorganic
residue
left after
the ignition
of the
sample
under
prescribed
conditions,
calculated
as the percentage
by mass of the
original
sample.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Sulphated
Ash -
The
ash that
remains
after
the sample
has been
carbonized
and the residue
subsequently
treated
with sulphuric
acid and
heated to constant
mass.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Water Soluble Ash --  The
water
soluble
portion
of the ash of the
sample, calculated
as the percentage
by mass of the original
sample.<<HEADING_END>>

A -
ASH FROM PETROLEUM
PRODUCTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Outline of the Method -
The sample
contained
in a suitable vessel
is  ignited
and allowed
to burn
until only ash and carbon
remain.
The
carbonaceous
residue is reduced
to an ash by heating
in a muffle furnace
at 7759,
cooled,
and weighed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1
Evaporating
Dish
or Crucible -
made
of platinum,
silica,
or
porcelain,
of 90 to 120-ml capacity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2
Electric Mufle Furnace -
capable
of maintaining
a temperature
of
775°C f
25:C, and preferably
having suitable apertures at the front and
rear so as to allow a slow natural draught of air to pass through.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.1  Heat
the evaporating
dish or crucible
at 700°C to 800°C for
10 minutes
or more.
Cool to room temperature
in a suitable container
( See Note ) and weigh to the nearest 0.1 mg.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NATE -  ‘The container
in which
the dish or crucible
is cooled
should
not
contain a desiccating
agent.
In addition, all weighings
of the crucibles
should be
performed
as soon as the crucibles
have cooled.
If it should be necessary
that the
crucibles remain in the desiccator
for a longer period, then all subsequent’weighings
should
be made
after
allowing
the crucibles
and contents
to
remain
in the
desiccator
for the same length of time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
The quantity of sample to be taken depends upon the ash content
of the material.
Weigh into the dish or crucible sufficient sample ( up to
a maximum
of 100 g ) to give up to 20 mg of ash.
For sample mass
which require
more than one filling of the dish, obtain the mass from the
difference
between
the initial
and final
mass
of
a
suitable
sample
container.
Weigh the sample to the nearest 0.1 percent.
Heat the dish
or crucible and sample until the contents become capable of being ignited
with a flame.
Maintain
at such a temperature
that the sample continues
to burn at a uniform and moderate
rate, leaving only ash and carbon
when the burning ceases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CAUTION
h The
sample may
contain
water,
which
can cause
spattering.
The
operator
should heat
the sample
cautiously
in a
hood while wearing safety goggles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  If the sample contains sufficient moisture to cause foaming
and loss ol
material,
discard the sample and to an additional sample add 1 to 2 ml of 99 percc nt
iso-propyl
alcohol
before
heating.
If
this is not satisfactory,
add
10 ml of an
equivolume
mixture
of toluene and iso-propyl alcohol
and mix thoroughly.
Place
several strips of ashless filter paper in the mixture and heat; when the paper
begins
to  bum, the greater
part of the water is found to have been removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3
Heat the residue in the muffle furnace at 775 f
25°C until all
carbonaceous
material has disappeared.
Cool the dish to room tempera-
ture in a suitable
container
as prescribed
in 3.3.1,
and weigh to the
nearest O-1 mg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.4
Reheat
the dish at 775°C for 20 to 30 minutes, cool in a suitable
container
as prescribed
in 3.3.1
and reweigh.
Repeat
the heating
and
weighing until consecutive weighings differ by not more than 0.5 mg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  Two
methods
are prescribed
for determining
ash from
greases,
Method
Br
is a rapid
routine
method
and is substantially
the same as
Method
A ( see 3 ).
Method
Bs, which
involves
sulphation,
gives more
concordant
results than Method
B,, but requires
more
time
and manipu-
lation and  shall be used as a referee method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2
Method
Bs
is also
preferred
because
Method
Br is sometimes
unsatisfactory
for the following
reasons:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Sodium
carbonate
derived
from the soap may
react
with inorga-
nic fillers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) The
ash may
react
with the porcelain
crucible
during
the long
continued
heating
necessary
to burn off all carbon;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) If
much
sodium
or
potassium
carbonate
is present,
the ash is
fusible
and often
encloses
carbon,
making
complete
removal
of
the latter very difficult;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Results
are low when easily reducible
oxides of volatile metals are
present;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) There
is uncertainty
as to when
calcium

SULPHATED
ASH
FROM
UNUSED
LUBRICATING
OILS AND ADDITIVES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.0 Outline of the Method -.  The sample is ignited
and burned until
only ash and carbon remain.
After cooling, the residue is treated with
sulphuric acid and heated at 775°C until oxidation of carbon
is complete.
The
ash is then
cooled,. re-treated
with sulphuric acid, and heated at
775°C to constant mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Significance and Use -
The sulphated ash may be used to indicate
the concentration
of known metal-containing
additives
in new oils. When
phosphorus is absent, barium calcium,
magnesium,
sodium and potassium
are converted
to their
sulphates
and
tin ( stannic ) and zinc to their
oxides ( see Note 1 ).
Sulphur and chlorine
do not interfere
but when
phosphorus is present with metals,
it remains partially
or wholly in the
sulphated ash as metal phosphates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
Since
zinc sulphate slowly decomposes
to its  oxide
at the ignition
temperature
specified
in the
method,
samples
containing
zinc
may
give
variable
results unless the zinc sulphate
is completely
converted
to the oxide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 -
This method
is not intended
for the analysls
of used
engine
oils or
oils
containing
lead.
Neither
it is recommended
for the
analysis
of non-additive
lubricating
oils, for which
Method
A should
be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  3 -
For best results on samples
containing
less than 0’1 percent sulphated
ash, platinum
dishes should
be used.
The precision
values
shown
in 5.7 for this type
of sample
were so obtained.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1  Dish -

capacity
is specified,
except
for samples
containing
elements injurious to platinum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the entire residue.
Again heat the dish as in 5.4.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.8
Again place the dish in the furnace
at 775 f
2.5%
and maintain
at that temperature
for 30 minutes.
Cool
the dish to room
temperature
in a suitable
container
( see Note under
5.4.2
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Zinc dialkyl
or alkaryl
dithiophosphates
and blends containing
these
additives
may give a residue which is partially
black at this stage.
In this case,
repeat 5.4.7 and 5.4.8 until a white residue is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.9
Weigh
the dish and residue to the nearest
0.1 mg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Repeat
5.4.8
and 5.4.9
until two successive
weighings
differ by
no more than
1.0 mg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
Normally
one repeat
will suffice, unless a high proportion
of  zinc is
present,
when three or four heating

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.11  For samples expected
to contain
0.02 percent
or less of sulphated
ash, determine
a sulphuric
acid blank by adding
1 ml of the concentrated
sulphuric
acid to a tared platinum
dish or crucible,
heating
until fumes are
no longer
evolved
and then
heating
in the furnace
at
775 f
25°C
for
30 minutes.
Cool the dish or crucible
to room temperature
in a suitable
container
and
weigh
to the
nearest
0.1 mg.
If any ash is found
in the
sulphuric
acid, an
adjustment
to the
mass
of
sulphated
ash
obtained
is made by subtracting
the mass of ash contributed
by the sulphuric
acid,
determined
from the total volume of sulphuric
acid itsed and the mass of
ash found for the 1 ml blank,
from
the total mass in grams
of sulphated
ash for the sample.
Use this corrected
mass m, in calculating
the percent
sulphated
ash.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Calculation -
Calculate
the mass of sulphated
ash as a percentage
of the original
sample
as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>100 m
Sulphated
ash, percent
by mass =

WATER SOLUBLE ASH<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Outline of the Method -
The
water soluble
ash is determined
by
boiling
the ash,
as obtained
by Method
A or Method
C, in water,
filte-
ring and evaporating
the filtrate
to dryness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6;2  Procedure -
Place the dish or crucible
containing
the ash, as obtained
by Method
A or Method
C, in a beaker,
add about
350 ml of water,
cover
the
beaker
with
a watch-glass
and
boil
gently
for
about
15 minutes.
Remove
the
dish or crucible
from
the water and
wash any residue
into
the beaker
with
a fine jet
of water.
Heat
the beaker
until the volume
of
water
is
reduced
to
about
50
ml.
Filter
through
a
filter
paper
( Whatman

dish of 200-ml capacity.
Rinse
the beaker and the filter
paper with hot water1 and filter the rinsings into the evaporating dish.
Place the evaporating dish on a steam bath, and evaporate the contents to
dryness.
Remove
the evaporating
dish from the steam-bath,
wipe the
outside with a clean cloth,
and put it into an oven maintained
at 105°C.
At the end of one hour remove the dish from the oven, cool in desiccator
and weigh again.
Repeat the drying until the mass is constant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
