<<HEADING level=1>>( Third Revision)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Third Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 31 October
1986, after the draft finalized by the
Foundation
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the
Civii Engineering Division Council.
0.2 Series of indian
Standards
on design and construction
of various.
types of foundations (shallow, deep and special types) have been formmated
covering their specific requirements.
Many of the requirements for design-
ing of such foundatidns are common for all types of foundations.
In order
that these general requirements
are not repeated
in each of such Indian
Standards, this basic Indian Standard
covering
such general requirements
has been formulated.
This Indian Standard
was first published in 1961
and revised in 1966 and 1978, which covered requirement
for shallow
foundations.
During the past seven years, new Indian Standards covering
design and construction of various types of foundations
have been formu-
lated.
It was, therefore,
decided to revise this standard so as to cover the
general requirements for
design and construction
not
only for shallow
foundation-but
also for all types of foundations.
Opportunity has also been
taken to transfer the general requirements covered in IS  :  1080-1980*, which
is also being revised
simultaneously,
so that it covers only the specific
requirements applicable to design and construction of shallow foundations.
0.3 The design of the foundation,
of the ground are inter-related.
super-structure
and the characteristics
In order
to obtain maximum economy,
the supporting ground, foundation
and
super-structure should be studied
as a whole.
The design of a foundation involves both geotechnical aspects
of supporting ground and the
structural
aspects of the foundation mate-
rials.
The aim is to proportion the foundation ( plan dimensions ) in such
a way that net loading intensity
of pressure coming on the soil does not<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is complied
with, the final value,

<<PARAGRAPH>>5. SITE INVESTIGATION
5.1 The investigation of the site is an essential prerequisite to theconstruc-
‘.
tion of all civil engineering works with a view to assess the general suitabi-
lity of the site for the proposed new works and to enable in preparing an
adequate and economic design.
In particular,
it is necessary to assess the changes that may occur
during or after the construction of the structure due to the choice of mate-
rials or methods
of construction
which may adversely
affect safety of
structure or after its performance or utility.
5.2 The investigation of the site should
be carried out in accordance with
the principles
set in IS  :  1892-19797.
As a preliminary,
it is usually
judicious to collect
information
relating to the site prior to commencing
its exploration.
The exploration
of the site for an important structure
requires the exploration and sampling of all strata likely to be significantly
affected by the structural load.
The extent of this exploration
will depend
on the site and structure.
In any case, particular
attention
shall be paid
to the ground
water level, underground
water courses, old drains, pits,
wells, old foundation,
etc, and presence of excessive sulphates or Other<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The site should also be
explored in detail, where necessary, to ascertain the type consistency, thick-
ness, sequence and dip of the strata.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Mass movements
of the ground are liable to occur from causesinde-
pendent
of the loads imposed
by the structure.
These include mining
subsidence,
land
slips,
unstable
slopes and
creep on clay slopes.
These factors
shall be observed
in detail during site investigation
and
taken into account
in the layout
and design of the proposed works.
However, if necessary, expert advice regarding the geological
and hydro-
logicai characteristics of the site shall be sought.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1 Mining subsidence is liable to occur in mining areas.
The magni-
tude of the movement and its distribution
pver the area of the workings
and their vicinity can be roughly estimated.
Where future subsidence is
likely, care should be taken to design the superstructure and foundation
sufficiently strong or sufficiently flexible to cater for probable
ground
movements.
Long continuous
buildings should be avoided and
large
building should be divided into independent
sections of suitable size, each
with its own foundations.
Expert advice from appropriate
mining autho-
rity should be sought.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2 Cuttings, excavations
or sloping ground near foundations
may
increase
the possibility
of shear failure
in the ground supporting the
foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On sloping ground
on clay soils there is always a tendency for the
upper layers of soil to move downhill, the extent, however, depends on the
type of soil, the angle of slope,
ground water regime and climatic condi-
tions.
Instability
may develop even after
a long  period of apparent
stability, particularly in stiff, fissured and over consolidated clay soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Uneven
surface of a slope on virgin ground, curved tree trunks,
tilted fence posts, tilted boundary walls, etc, indicate the creep of the sur-
face layers.
Areas subject to land slip and unstable slopes shall, therefore,
be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.3 Some clayey soils are susceptible to shrinkage and cracking in dry
and hot weather, and swelling in wet weather.
These conditions are simu-
lated, sometimes, by extraneous
agencies like trees, boiler installations,
furnaces, kilns, underground cables, services and refrigeration installations.
These factors shall be studied carefully
before designing any foundations.
Shrinkage of clay soils may be increased by the drying effect produced by
nearby trees and shrubs.
Swelling may occur, if they are cut down.
NO
trees which grow to a large size shall be planted within 8 m of foundations
of buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1S :  1904 - 1986<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.4 New
constructions
may
interfere
with
drainage
regime of the
ground
and affect the stability
of existing structure.
Adequate
precautions
should
be taken to protect these.
On
the uphill
side
of a building
on a
sloping
site, land drainage
requires
special consideration
for diverting
the
natural
flow of water away from
the foundations.
If excavation
involves
cutting
through
existing
land
drains,
consideraticn
should
be given for
diverting
into the ground-drainage
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>%3.§ Increase
in moisture
extent
results
in substantial
loss of bearing
capacity
in case of certain
types
of soils
which
may
lead
to differential
settiements.
On sites liable to be water iogged in
wet weather,
it is desir-
rable
to
determine
the
contour
of. the
water-table
surface in order to
indicate
the directions
of the natural
drainagd
and
to obtain
the basis of
the design of intercepting
drains to prevent
the influx of ground
water into
the site from higher ground.
The
seasonal
variation
in the level of the
water table
is of
importance
in some
cases.
In case of soils with low
permeability,
the water levels in boreholes
or observation
wells may take
a considerable
time to reach equilibrium
with ground
water
Spot readings
of Vater level in boreholes
may, therefore,
give an erroneous
impression
of
the true ground
water level.
It is generally
determined
by measuring
the
water
level
in the borehole
after a suitable
time lapse for which a period
of 14 hours
or more
be used
as the case may
be.
In
soils with high
permeability,
such as sand and gravels,
lapse
of sometime
is ustially
suffi-
zient, unless the hole has been sealed with
drilling
mud.
In
these cases it
nay be necessary
to resort ?o indirect
means
to estab!ish the approximate
location
of the water
table.
Where
deep
excavation
is required,
the
location
of water
bea,ring
strata
should be determined
with particular
care
and
the
water
pressure
in each should
be observed
so that necessary
precautions
may be taken during excavation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.6
In certain
localities
where considerable
quantities
of soluble salts
are
contained
in
ground
water
and
soil,
portland
cement
concrete,
especially
thin members
or buried metals are subjected
to deterioration
and
corrosion.
Certain
soils
have
a corrosive
action on metals, particular1.y
on cast iron, due to either chemical
or bacteriological
agency.
In industrial
areas,
corrosive
action
may
arise
from
industrial
wastes that have been
dumped
on the site.
Chemical
analysis
of samples of ground
water or soil
( or sometimes
both ) should
be done
to assess the necessity of speciai
precautions.
The following
are settle of suggested
methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Dense cement concerete
M20 mix or richer
may
be used
to reduce
permeability
and
increase
resistance
tc attack from sulphates
( see
I§ : 456-1978”
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*code
of  practice  for plain and reinforced concrete (  rhird  revision ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Portland pozzolana cement may be used to control and reduce the
activities of the sulphates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Special cements like high alumina
cement,
super sulphated cement,
which are sulphate resistant, may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) A thick coating of bitumen may be given over the exposed surfaces
of foundation
below the water table to prevent infiltration of water
into the foundation ( see IS  :  5871-1970* ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) A thick layer of cement concrete (with sulphate resistant cement )
and coated with bitumen be laid before laying of foundation concrete
to prevent infiltration of water from sulphate bearing soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - The  soluble salts are usually sulphates of calcium, magncaium and
sodium.  Water containing these salts gets into the concrete and reacts with the set
cement or hydraulic lime.
This reaction is accompanied
by considerable
expansion
which leads to the deterioration
and cracking of the concrete.
The amount  of  soluble
sulphates may be considered
excessive from
the point of attack on concrete if it is

<<PARAGRAPH>>6. METHODS
OF SITE EXPLORATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 The most common and satisfactory
methods
of site explorations are
given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Trial pits,
b) Boring, and
c) Headings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The details of these methods are given in IS  : 1892-1979f.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. DEPTH OF FOUNDATION
7.1 The depth to which foundations should be carried depends upon the
following principal factors:
The securing of adequate allowable bearing capacity.
In the case of clayey soils, penetration
below the zone where shria-
kage and swelling due to seasonal weather changes, and due to trees
and shrubs are likely to cause appreciable movements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In fine sands and silts, penetration
below the zone in which trouble

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The maximum
depth of scour, wherever relevant, should also be
considered and the foundation
should be Iocatqd sufficiently below
this depth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Other factors such as ground movements and heat transmitted from
the building to the supporting ground may be important.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 All foundations shall extend to a depth
of at least 50 cm below natu-
ral ground level.
On rock or such other weather resisting natural ground,
removal of the top soil may be all that is required.
In suchcases, the
surface shall be cleaned and, if necessary, stepped or otherwise prepared so
as to provide
a suitable bearing and thus prevent slipping or other
unwanted movements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 Where there is excavation, ditch, pond,
water course, filled up ground
or similar condition
adjoining or adjacent
to the subsoil on which the
structure
is to be erected and which is likely to impair the stability of
structure, either the foundation of such structure shall IX carried down to
a depth beyond the detrimental infiuence of such conditions,
or retaining
walls or similar works shall be constructed
for the purpose
of shielding
from their effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 A foundation
in any type of soil shall be below the zone significantly
weakened by root holes or cavities produced
by burrowing animals or
works.
The depth shall also be enough to prevent the rainwater scouring
below the footings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5 Clay soils, like black cotton
soils, are seasonally affected by drying,
shrinkage
and cracking
in dry and hot weather, and by swelling in the
following wet weather to a depth which will vary according to the nature
of the clay and the climatic condition of the region.
It is necessary in
these soils, either to place the foundation
bearing
at such a depth where
the effects of seasonal changes are not important
or to make the founda-
tion capable of eliminating the undesirable effects due to relative move-
ment by providing
flexible type of construction
or rigid foundations.
Adequate load counteraction
swelling pressures also provide
satisfactory
foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Where footings are adjacent to sloping ground or where the bottoms of
the footings of a structure are at different levels or at levels different from
those ,of the footings of adjoining structures,
the depth of the footings
shall be such that the difference in footing elevations shall be subject to the
following limitations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When the ground
surface slopes downward adjacent to a footing,
the sloping surface shall not intersect a frustum of bearing material<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

soil
and horizontal
distance from
the
lower
edge of the footing to the sloping surface shall be at least 60 cm for
rock and 90 cm for soil ( see Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of footings in granular
soil, a line drawn between the
lower adjacent edges of adjacent footings shall not have a steeper
slope than one vertical to two horizontal ( see Fig. 2 ).
In case of footing
of clayey soils a line drawn between the lower
adjacent edge of the upper footing and< the upper adjacent edge of
lower footing shall not have a steeper slope than one vertical to two
horizontal ( see Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 The requirement
given in 8.1 shall not apply under the following
conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>aj  Where adequate provision is made for the lateral support ( such as
with retaining walls ) of the material supporting the higher footing.
b) When the factor of safety of the foundation
soil against shearing is
not less than four.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. EFFECT OF SEASONAL WEATHER CHANGES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>- 9.1  During periods of hot, dry weather a deficiency of water develops near
the ground surface and in clay soils, this is associated with a decrease of
volume or ground shrinkage and the development of cracks. The shrinkage
of clay will be increased by drying effect produced by fast growing and
water seeking trees.
The range of intluence depends on size and number
of trees and it increases during dry periods.
In general, it is desirable that
there shall be a distance of at least g m between such trees.
Railer
installations,
furnaces,
kilns,
underground
cables and
refrigeration
installations and other artificial sources of heat may .also cause increased
volume changes of clay by drying out the ground beneath them, the drying
out can be to a substantial depth. Special precautions either in the form of
insulation or otherwise should be taken.
In periods of wet weather, clay
soils swell and the cracks lend to close, the water deficiency developed in
the previous dry periods
may be partially
replenished
and a subsurface
zone or zones deficient
in water may persist for many years.
Leakage
from water mains and underground sewers may also result in large volume
changes.
Therefore, special care must be taken to prevent such leakages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

These include mining
subsidence,
landslips
on unstable
slopes
and creep on clay slopes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1 Mining Subsidence -
In
mining
areas,
subsidence
of the
ground
beneath
a building
or any other structure
is liable
to occur.
The magni-
tude
of the movement
and
its distribution
over the area are likely to be
uncertain
and attention
shall,
therefore,
be directed
to make the founda-
tions and structures
sufficiently
rigid and strong to withstand
the probable
worst loading
condition.
In this connection,
reference
should
also be made
to
5.3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2  Landslip Areas<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.1  The construction
of
structures
on slopes which are suspected
of
being unstable
and are subject to landslip
shall be avoided.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.2 On Joping
ground
on clay soils, there is always a tendency
for the
upper
layers
of
soil to move
downhill,
depending
on lype of soil, the
angle of slope, climatic
conditions,
etc.
In some cases, the uneven
surface
of the slope on a virgin ground
bill
indicate
that
the area
is subject to
small
iand
slips
and,
therefore,
if used
for foundation,
will obviously
necessitate
special design consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.3 Where there may be creep of the surface layer
of the soil, protec-
tion against creep may be obtained
by following
special design
considera-
tions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.4 On
sloping
sites,
spread
foundations
shall
be on a horizontal
bearing
and stepped.
At ail changes
of levels,
they shall be lapped at the
steps
for a distance
at least
equal
to the thickness
of the foundation
or
twice the height of the step, whichever is greater.
The steps sha!l not be of
greater height than the thickness
of the foundation,
unless special precautions
are taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.5 Cuttings,
excavations
or sloping
ground
near
and below founda-
tion level may
increase
the possibility
of shear
failure of the soil.
The
foundation
shall be well beyond
the zone of such shear failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.6 If the probable
failure surface intersects
a retaining
wall or other
revetment,
the latter shall be made strong enough
to resist any unbalanced
thrust.
In
case
of doubt,
as to the
suitabmty
of the natural
slopes or
cuttings,
the structure
shall be kept well away
from
the top
of the slopes,
or,the slopes shall be stabilized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.7 Cuttings
and
excavations
adjoining
foundations
reduce stability
and increase
the likelihood
of differential
settlement.
Their effect should
be investigated
not only when they exist
but
also when there is possibility
that they are made subsequently.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_15>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Is: 1904-1986<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.8  Where a structure
is to be placed on sloping ground, additional
complications are introduced.
The ground itself, particularly
if of clay,
may be subject to creep or other forms of instability,
which may be
enhanced if the strata dip in the same direction
as the ground surface.
If
the slope of the ground
is large,
the overall
stability of the slope and
substructure
may be affected.
These aspects should be carefully investi-
gated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.  PRECAUTIONS
FOR FOUNDATIONS
ON INCLINED
STRATA<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  In the case of inclined strata, if they dip towards a cutting or base-
ment, it may be necessary to carry foundation below the possible slip planes,
land drainage also requires special consideration, particularly
on the uphill
side of a structure
to divert the natural
flow of water away from the
foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.  STRATA OF VARYING THICENESS
12.1 Strata of varying thickness, even at appreciable depth, may increase
differential settlement.
Where necessary, calculations
should be made of
the estimated settlement
from different
thicknesses
of strata and the
structure should be designed accordingly.
When there is large change of
thickness of soft strata, the stability of foundation
may be affected.
Site
investigations should, therefore, ensure detection of significant variations in
strata thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13. LAYERS OF SOFTER MATERIAL
13.1 Some soils and rocks have layers of harder material between thin
layers
of softer material,
which may not be detected unless thorough
investigation
is carried
out.
The softer
layers may undergo marked
changes in properties if the loading on them is increased or decreased by
the proposed construction or affected by related changes in ground water
conditions.
These should be taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14. SPACING BETWEEN EXISTING AND NEW FOUNDATION
14.1 The deeper
the new foundation
and the nearer to the existing it is
located, the greater the damage is likely to be.
The minimum horizontal
spacing between existing and new footings shall be equal to the width of
the wider one.
While the adoption of such provision shall help minimizing
damage to adjacent foundation, an analysis of bearing capacity and settle-
ment shall be carried
out to have an appreciation
of the effect on the
adjacent existing foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.  LOADS ON FOUNDATIONS
15.1 Loads on a foundation are those forces imparted
by thestructure,

<<PARAGRAPH>>(ii) horizontal or lateral, and (iii) moment or couple.
The following loads
shall be considered for design of foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>151.1  Pemzanent Load -  This is the actual service load/sustained
load
consisting of dead loads and live loads of a structure which give rise to
stresses and deformations
in the soil below
foundation
causing
its
settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1.2  Transient Load -  This is a momentary
or sudden load imparted
to a structure
due to wind or seismic vibrations.
Due to its transitory
nature, the stresses in the soil below the foundation
carried by such loads
are allowed certain percentage increase over the allowable safe values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1.3 Foundations shall be proportioned
for the following combination
of loads:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Dead load + live load, and
b) Dead load + live load + wind load or seismic load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1.4 Dead load
also includes the weight of column/wall, footings,
z,ndations,
the overlying fill but excludes the weight of the drsplaced
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1.5 Live loads from the floors above as specified in IS  :  875 ( Part 2 )-
1987* shall be taken in proportioning
and designing the foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.16 Where wind or seismic load is less than 25 percent of that due to
dead and live loads, it may be neglected in design and first combination of
load shall be compared
with the safe bearing load to satisfy allowable
bearing pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1.7 Where wind or seismic load is more than 25 percent of that due
to dead
and live loads, foundations
may be so proportioned that the
pressure due to combination
of load ( that is, dead + live -,‘- wind load )
does not exceed the safe bearing capacity by more than 25 percent.  When
seismic forces are considered,
the safe bearing capacity
shall be increased
as
specified in  IS  :  1893-1984t. In non-cohesive soils, analysis for liquefaction
and settlement under earthquake shall also be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16. SETTLEMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.1 Uniform Settlement - The magnitude
of the settlement
that should
occur, when foundation
loads are applied to the ground, depend on the
rigidity of substructure and compressibility
of the underlying
strata.

In sand and

the settlement
is
likely to be complete

In strata

For the safety of foundations,
the
engineer-in-charge
should
be well familiar
with
all causes
of settlement.
Foundations
may
settle
due to some combination
of the following
reasons:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

settlements
because
of the extrusion
of water
from
the voids.
Pumping
water or

water by wells or pipes from
granular
soils without

may, in a period
of time, carry
a sufficient amount
of fine particles

to the load mentioned
in 15.1.3(b).
since
in such type of soils,

<<PARAGRAPH>>16.3.2 For fine grained

the
settlements
shall

to permanent
loads.
Dead load
and all fixed
equipments
are
considered
as permanent.
Generally,
one half of the design
live load may
be taken
as being permanent.
The
engineer
shall
use his judgement
in
each project work to determine
what
loads
are permanent
and
what
are
temporary.
Therefore,
it appears
reasonable
to reduce
the
differential
settlement
due to live load variation
by maintaining
equal
pressure
for all
foundations
under the service load.
This
may
be done
by the following
procedure:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

shall be calculated
on the basis of soil test data and in the absence
of such
data for preliminary

<<PARAGRAPH>>19. PRELIMINARY
WORK FOR CONSTRUCTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.1  The construction
of access
roads,
main
sewers
and
drains
should
preferably
be completed
before
commencing
the
work
of foundations;
alternatively,
sufficient precautions
shall be taken
to protect
the already
constructed
foundations
during
subsequent
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.2  Clearance
of Site -
Any
obstacles,
including
the
stump
of trees,
likely to interfere
with the work shall be removed.
Holes
left by digging,
such as those due to removal
of old foundation,
uprooted
trees, burrowing
by animals,
etc, shall be back-filled
with soil and well compacted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19.3  Drainage -
If the site of a structure
is such that surface water shall
drain towards
it, land may
be dressed
or drains
l,lid ?o divert the water
away from t!le site.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.4 Setting Out -.  Generally
the site shall
be levelled
before the layout
of foundations
are set out.
In case of sloping
terrain,
care shall be taken
to ensure that
the
dimensions
on plans
are set out
correctly
in one or
more horizontal
planes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.5 The layout of foundations
shall be set out
with
steel
tapes.
Angle!:
should be set out with theodolites
in the case
of important
and mlricate
structures
where the length of area
exceeds
16 m.
In other cases ihese
shall be set out by measurement
of sides.
Jn rectangular
or square setting
out, diagonals
shall be checked
to ensure
accuracy.
The
setting
out of
walls shall be facilitated
by permanent
row of pillars, parallel
to and at a
suitable distance
beyond
the periphery
of the building.
The
pillars shall
be located
at junctions
of cross
walls with the penphera!
line of pillars.
The centre lines of the cross
walls
shall
be extended
to and permanently
erected
on
the plastered
tops of the corresponding
sets of pillars.-
The
datum
lines parallel
to and at the known
fixed
distance
from the
centre
lines of the external
walls also be permanently
worked
on the correspond-
ing rows of pillars to pillars to serve as checks on the accuracy
of the work
as it proceeds.
The
tops
of these
pillars
shall be at the same level and
preferably
at the plinth
or floor level.
The pillars shall be of sizes not !ess
Phan 25 cm wide and shall be bedded sufficiently
deep
into ground
so that
they are not disturbed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>20.3 Excavation
in clay or o.ther soils that are liable to be effected by
exposure to atmosphere
shall, wherever possible, be concreted as soon as
they are dug. Alternatively the bottom of the excavation shall be protected
immediately by 8 cm thick layer of cement concrete not leaner than mix
1  : 5 :  10 over which shall come the foundation
concrete;
or in order to
obtain a dry hard boftom,
the last excavation
of about
10 cm shall be
removed only before concreting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>20.4 The refilling of the excavation
shall he done with care so as not to
disturb the constructed foundation, and shall be compacted
in layers not
exceeding
