FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 12 March
1985, after the draft finalized
by the Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineer-
ing Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number
of standards
on methods
of testing
of cement and concrete
has
already
been
published.
Having
recognized
that
reliable
and
reproducible
test
results
could
be obtained
only with use of
standard
testing
equipment
capable
of giving
desired
level
of
accuracy,
the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had taken up formulation
of
Indian
Standards
on instruments
for testing
cement
and concrete
and, as
a result, a number
of Indian
Standards
on instruments
for testing
cement
and
concrete
have
already
been
published.
These
standards
are
expected
to promote
development
and manufacture
of standard
testing
equipment
in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
Accordingly,
this standard
has been prepared
to cover
the
require-
ments of cylinder
measures
used in tests for determination
of air content
of hydraulic
cement
mortar.
The
method
for
determination
of
air
content of hydraulic
cement
mortar
is covered
in IS  :  4031-1968*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given to
international
coordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
For the purpose
of decidin;
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or anaiy<is,
shall be rounded
OR in accord-
ance with IS  :  2-1960t.
The
number
of significant
places retained
in the
rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
covers the requirements
of cylinder
measures
used in
tests for determination
of air content
of hydraulic
cement
mortar.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  MATERIALS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The
material
of
construction
of
cylinder
measure
shall
be
brass,
stainless
steel or any other material
not attacked
by cement
mortar.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  A
cylindrical
measure
having
an inside
diameter
of 75 *
1.5 mm
and a depth ( approximately
90 mm ) adjusted
by
standardization
with
water
to contain
400 f
1 ml at 27 f
2°C ( see Note ).
For the purpose
of this test, the capacity
of the measure
in millilitres
is the
mass
of the
water
content
of the measure,
in grams,
divided
by O-997, no correction
in weight
being made for the buoyant
effect of air.
The
measure
shall
have
a uniform
wall
thickness.
The
thickness
of the wall and bottom
shall be not less than 3 &m. The total mass of the empty measure
shall not
be more than 900 g.
The top surface
of the rim shall be faced smooth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The 400-1111 measure may be calibrated
readily
by filling with distilled
water at 27 f 2°C to a point where the meniscus extends appreciably
above the top of
the measure
placing
a clean
piece of plate glass on the top of the measure, and
allowing the excess water to be squeezed out.
The
absence
of air bubbles as seen
through
the glass ensures that the measure is completely full.
Care shall be taken
that the excess water is wiped from the sides of the container before weighing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  ACCESSORIES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Straight Edge -
Steel straight
edge shall not be less than
100 mm
long and not less than
1.5 mm nor more than 3 mm in thickness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Spatula -
A spatula
with
a steel
blade
150
mm
in length
and
10 mm in width,
with straight
edges and a wooden
handle.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Tapping
Stick -
Tapping
stick
shall
be made of teak wood or
other suitable
timber,
having
a square
cross-section
of 16 mm side and a
length
of 150 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. MARKING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
The
following
information
shall be clearly
and indelibly
marked

each of the cylinder
measures:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Name
of the
manufacturer
or his registered
trade-mark
or both,

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  Cylinder
measures
may also be marked
with the IS1 Certification
Mark.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The use of the ISI Certification
Mark is governed
by the provisions
of
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
( Certification
Marks)
Act and
the Rules and
Regulations

thereunder.
The
ISI
Mark
on products covered by an Indian
Standard ccnveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply
with
the
requirements
of that standard under a well-defined
system of inspection,
testing and
quality
control which is devised and supervised by JSI and operated
by the producer.
IS1
marked
products
are also continuously
checked
by IS1 for conformity
to that
standard as a further
safeguard.
Details
of conditions
under which a licence for the
use of the ISI
Certification
Mark
may be granted to manufacturers
or processors,
