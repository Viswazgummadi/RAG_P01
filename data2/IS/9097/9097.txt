FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Instittnion
eon 28 February
1979, after the draft finalized by the Canals and Canal
Linings Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 For conserving
water,
preventing
water
logging and many
other
purposes, canal systems are being provided with various types of linings.
Use of hot bitumen or bituminous
felts for canal lining is one of the
alternatives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Bitumen, a bye-product
of petroleum industry and well known for its
binding and water-proofing
qualities is being increasingly used in lining
work all over the world.
Its main advantage
over the conventional
materials is that no water is required during construction
and no curing is
necessary.
The structure can be put to use immediately after the construc-
tion is over.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-0.4 Bitumen lining consists of spraying a layer of bitumen at high tempera-
ture on the prepared
subgrade.
It is protected
from damages due to
animal traffic and weathering by giving suitable covering of soil ( see Fig. 1).
0.5  At places where spraying in-situ is costlier and time consuming, bitumen
felts of adequate thickness and durability are used as the lining material.
These felts are also given a suitable covering of soil to avoid damages
( see Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
provides guidelines
for laying lining of canals with:
(a) hot bitumen, and (b) bitumen felts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 These guidelines apply to minor distributaries and minors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard the following definitions shall apply:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Lip Cutting -It
is the extra width provided at the inner face of the
bank under compaction
to allow for any lapses in compaction
due to the
inability of compacting rollers to cover the edge of the bank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Made Up  Ground -  Excavated soil or rock deposited for the purpose
of filling a depression or raising a site above natural level of the ground.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Subgrade - The surface specially prepared against which lining shall
be laid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Bitumen - It is a non-crystalline
solid or viscous material
having
adhesive properties,
derived from petroleum, either by natural or refinery
processes and substantially sciluble in carbon disulphide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Membrane - Any functionally continuous flexible structure of bitumen
or prefabricated
impregnated bituminous felts suitably reinforced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6 Primer - Usually a medium curing cut back bitumen or road tar of
sufficiently low viscosity when used as an initial application
to improve
adhesion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3. INFORMATION
REQUIRED<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The
information
on
the following
points
shall
be required
before
taking up the work of lining:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nature of Soil —  The
nature
of the soil
influences
infiltration,
cohesion, permeability
and water holding capacity, etc.
It should
be known whether the soil is sandy, loam, silt, silty clay.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Position of Subsoil Water
Level —  The position
of subsoil water
level be observed before taking up the work of lining.
The lining
technique to be adopted
depends upon the position of water table.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cross-Section
of the Canal —  The bed width, depth, bed slope are
required to be known from the L-section of the canal to be lined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. BITUMEN
AS LINING
MATERIAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1
The bitumen
used
shall conform
to S 35 of IS: 73-1961” or 85/25
specified in IS: 702-1961T.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Bitumen Felts —  The bitumen felts used, shall be as per Type 2 Grade II
of 1S:7193-19741.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. PREPARATION
OF SUBGRADE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  Cutting
Reaches
—  The
subgrade
should
be suitably
shaped
to the
required cross-section before applying the lining.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Filling
Reaches ~
In the case of filling reaches the compaction
and lip
cutting should be su]tably planned to consider the position of bitumen lining
so that the channel attains the designed cross-section
after the protective
cover is laid over the asphaltic lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  Compaction
of the Soil  —  The compaction
of the subgrade
is to be
done at optimum
moisture
content
in accordance with IS: 2720 ( Part II )-
1973$.
The subgrade should be allowed to dry before the lining is applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Side
Slope — The  side slope should be flatter than the angle of repose.
For normal
soils, the slope could
be 1~: 1.
For sandy soils the section
should have a slope of 2:1 or flatter.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5  Weed  Growth —  For preventing
weed growth,
it will be advisable to
sterilize the soil by use of sodium chlorate or sodium carbonate
which may
be sprayed
as a 5 percent solution
in water at the rate of 2 l/m~ of the
subgrade.
The-tree roots and any other sharp projections
are also removed
before laying the lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6. LINING
TECHNIQUE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Bitumen
Lining -
Crude
oil or emulsified
bitumen
is sprayed
over the
subgrade
at the rate of 0.5 l/m2.
A water resistant
film is formed
due to
surface
tension
which results
in a good bond between
the bitumen
and the
subgrade.
Bitumen
of
grade
mentioned
in
4.2
is heated
in
heating
pans up to a temperature
of 175°C. The hot bitumen
is spread on the sides
first and
then
on the bed with a spraying
equipment.
Lining
thickness
varying
from
3 to 6 mm
( 3.25 to 6.5 kg/m2 ) is laid.
The membrane
so formed
is covered
with suitable
protective
cover
of soil to protect
it
from damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The following
procedure
is adopted
for using bitumen
felts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The
prefabricated
asphaltic
membranes
are laid
with
an over-
lapping
of 100 mm at the sides and ends.
The overlap
should
be
provided
in the direction
of the flow of water;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The overlapping
joint is sealed with hot bitumen
( grade 90115 or
llS/lS
) at the rate of 0.5 kg/m2 or suitable
cold adhesive;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Suitable
protective
covering
is then laid over the membrane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  PROTECTIVE
COVER<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  Soil
Cover-The
bitumen
lining
is given a covering
of soil varying
from 150 to 200 mm in thickness
which is quite sufficient.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  PRECAUTIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  While heating
the bitumen
it should
be ensured
that the material
is not
overheated.
It should
be properly
stirred
for uniform
heating.
Nobody
should
be allowed
to walk on the sprayed
bitumen
to avoid damage
to the
lining.
In the case of felts no sharp tools should
damage
the lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
