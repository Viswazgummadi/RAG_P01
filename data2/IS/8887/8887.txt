<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Bitumen, Tar and Their Products Sectional Committee
had been approved by the
Petroleum, Coal and Related Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was first published in 1978. The revision is necessitated as a result of inclusion of
some new tests and deletion of obsolctc ones and incorporating
Amendment No. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision the storage period has been increased from 90 days to one year.The requirement for ‘Binder
content’ has been deleted as the same is represented by the requirement
for ‘Residue by evaporation’
(Tests on residue), which has been upgraded. Precision clauses have been incorporated
in the methods
of tests for the requirements of ‘Residue on sieve’ and ‘Stability to mixing with cement’. Test method for
‘Particle charge’ requirement
has been changed.
The requirement
‘Stability
to mixing with coarse
aggregate’ has been deleted and a new requirement
‘Coating ability and water resistance’ has been
incorporated.
The requirement for ‘Solubility’, using carbon disulphide, has been deleted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Most bituminous binders used in the construction of roads arcviscous semisolids at normal temperature.
Therefore, these require to be brought to a fluid state by heating,  by  dilution
with solvent or by emulsifying
before being applied in thin film. Use of emulsions facilitates not only flow at atmospheric temperature
but also application to damp road surfaces and wet aggregates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen emulsions are dispersions of very fine bitumen particles in an aqueous medium. They arc easy
to handle and find a wide application in road construction and maintenance; soil stabilization; grouting;
tack coating;
surface dressing; seal coating; premixing;
dust laying and in various other special cir-
cumstances where cold application of bitumen is desirable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen emulsions may be of anionic type or cationic type. Bitumen emulsions for roads of anionic type
are covered in IS 3117  :  1965 ‘Specification for bitumen emulsion for roads (anionic type) (unde~?~visiorz)‘,
and this standard covers bitumen emulsions of the cationic-type for roads. The choice of the type of
emulsion for a particular situation would depend upon types of aggregates, climatic conditions, environ-
mental conditions, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the guidance of the users, the recommended
uses of different types of cationic emulsions covered in
this standard are given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to international
co-ordination
among
the standards and practices prevailing in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in
the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requircmcnt of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or caiculated, expressing the result  of  a  test or analysis, shall be rounded offin accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revisccl)‘. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value shall be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is at the interface with the bitumen particle; an
