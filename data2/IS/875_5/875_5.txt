FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
( Part 5 ) ( Second
Revision
) was
adopted
by
the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 3  1  August
1987, after the draft
finaliz-
ed by the Structural
Safety
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by
the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.
0.2 A building
has
to perform
many
functions
satisfac orily.
Amongst
these functions
are the utility
of the building
for the
intended
use and
occupancy,
structural
safety,
fire safety;
and
compliance
with
hygienic,
ganitation,
ventilation
and day light standards.
The design of the building
is dependent
upon the minimum
requirements
prescribed
for each
of the
above functions.
The minimum
requirements
pertaining
to the
structural
safety of buildings
are being
covered
in this code by way of laying down
minimum
design loads which have to be assumed
for dead loads, imposed
loads, snow loads and other external
loads, the structure
would be requir-
ed to bear.
Strict conformity
to loading
standards
recommended
in
this
code, ‘It is hoped,
will not only ensure
the structural
safety of the buildings
which
are being
designed
and
constructed
in the country
and
thereby
reduce
the
hazards
to life and property
caused by unsafe structures,
but
also eliminate
the wastage
caused
by assuming
unnecessarily
heavy
load-
ings.
Notwithstanding
what
is stated
regarding
the structural
safety of
buildings,
the application
of the provisions
should
be carried
out by com-
petent
and responsible
structural
designer
who would
satisfy
himself that
the
structure
designed
in
accordance
with this code meets
the desired
performance
requirements
when
the same
is carried
out
according
to
specifications.
0.3 This
standard
code
of
practice
was first published
in 1957 for the
guidance
of civil engineers,
designers
and architects
associated
with plann-
ing and
design
of buildings.
It
included
the provisions
for basic design<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS t 875 ( Part 5 ) - 1987<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>loads ( dead loads, live loads, wind loads and seismicloads ) to be assumed
in the design of buildings. In its first revision in 1964,
the wind pressure
provisions were modified on the basis of studies of wind phenomenon and
its effects on structures, undertaken by the special committee in consultation
with the Indian Meteorological
Department.
In addition
to this, new
clauses on wind loads for butterfly type structures were included; wind
pressure coefficients for sheeted roofs both curved and sloping were modi-
fied; seismic load provisions were deleted ( separate code having been
prepared ) and metric system of weights and measurements was adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 With the increased adoption of the code, a number of comments
were received on the provisions on live load values adopted for different
occupancies.
Simultaneously live load surveys have been carried
out in
America, Canada and other countries to arrive at realistic live loads based
on actual
determination
of loading
( movable
and immovable
) in
different occupancies.
Keeping this in view and other developments in the
field of wind engineering, the committee responsible for the preparation of
the standard decided to prepare second revision in the following five parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Part 1 Dead loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Part 2 Imposed loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Part 3 Wind loads
Part 4 Snow loads
Part 5 Special loads and load combinations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Earthquake load is covered in a separate standard, namely IS  :  1893
1984* which should be considered along with the above loads.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.2 This code ( Part 5 ) deals with loads and load effects ( other than
those covered
in Parts
1 to 4, and seismic
loads ) due
to temper-
ature changes, internally
generating
stresses ( due to creep,
shrinkage,
differential
settlement,
etc ) in the building and its components, soil and
hydrostatic pressure, accidental loads, etc. This part also includes guid-
ance on load combinations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The code has taken into account the prevailing practices
in regard to
loading standards followed in this country by the various municipal autho-
rities and has also taken note of the developments in a number of countries
abroad.
In the preparation of this code, the following national
standards
have been examined:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This code ( Part 5 ) deals with loads and load effects due to temper-
ature changes, soil and hydrostatic pressures, internally generating stresses
( due to creep, shrinkage, differential settlement,
etc ), accidental
loads
etc, to be considered in the design of buildings as appropriate.
This part
also includes guidance
on load combinations.
The nature of loads to be
considered for a particular
situation is to be
based
on
engineering
judgement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TEMPERATURE
EFFECTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Expansion
and contraction
due to changes in temperature
of the
materials
of a structure
shall be considered in design. Provision shall be
made either to relieve the stress by provision of expansion/contraction
joints in accordance with IS  :  3414-1968*
or design the structure
to carry
additional
stresses due to temperature
effects as
appropriate
to
the
problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1 The
temperature
range
varies for different regions and under
different diurnal and seasonal conditions. The absolute maximum and
minimum temperature which may be expected
in different localities in
the country are indicated in Fig. 1 and 2 respectively. These figures may
be used for guidance in assessing the maximum
variations of temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2 The temperatures indicated in Fig. 1 and 2 are the air tempera-
tures in the shade. The range of variation in temperature of the building
materials
may be appreciably greater or less than the variation
of air
temperature and is influenced by the condition of exposure and the rate at
which the materials composing the structure absorb or radiate heat.
This
difference in temperature variations of the material and air should be given
due consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.3
The structural analysis must take into account: (a) changes of the
mean ( through the section ) temperature in relation to the initial temper-
ature ( st ), and (b) the temperature gradient through the section,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.3.1 It should be borne in mind that the changes of mean temper-
ature in relation to the initial are liable to differ as between one structural
element and another in buildings or structures,
as for example,
between
the external walls and the internal elements of a building. The distribution
of temperature
through section of single-leaf
structural
elements
may
be
assumed linear for the purpose of analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.3.2 The effect of mean temperature
changes tl, and ts, and the
temperature
gradients u1 and vs in the hot and cold seasons for single-leaf
structural elements shall be evaluated ori the basis of analytical principles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nom 1 -
For portions
of the structure
below
ground level, the variation of
temperature
is generally insignificant.
However,
during
the period of
construction
when the portions of the structure are exposed to weather
elements,
adequate
pro-
vision should be made to encounter
adverse effects, if any.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
If it can be shown by engineering
principles,
0; if it is known from
experience,
that
neglect
of some or all the effects of tern erature do not affect the
structural safety and rerviceability,
they need not be cons~  3  ered in  design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. HYDROSTATIC
AND SOIL PRESSURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 In the design ofstructures
or parts of structures
below
ground
level,
such as retaining
walls and ‘other walls in basement
floors. the pressure
exerted by soil or water or both shall be duly accounted
for on the basis
of established theories.
Due allowance shall be made for possible surcharge
from stationary
or  moving loads. When
a portion or whole
of the soil is
below the free water surface, the lateral
earth pressure
shall be evaluated
for weight of soil diminished
by buoyancy and the full hydrostatic pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1 All foundation slabs and other footings
subjected
to water
pres-
sure shall be designed
to resist a uniformly
distributed
uplift
equal to the
full hydrostatic
pressure.
Checking
of overturning
of foundation
under
submerged
condition
shall
be done
considering
buoyant
wei ght of
foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 While determining
the lateral soil
pressure on column
like
structural
members,
such as pillars
which
rest in sloping
soils,
the
width
of the
member shall be taken as follows ( see Fig. 3 ):<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.  FATIGUE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 General -
Fatigue cracks are usually initiated at points of high stress
concentration.
These stress concentrations
may be caused by or associated
with holes ( such as bolt or rivet holes in steel structures ), welds includ-
ing stray or fusions in steel structures, defects in
materials,
and local and
general changes in geometry
of members.
The
cracks
usually propogate
if loading is continuous.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where there is such loading cycles,
sudden changes
of shape of a
member or part of a member,
specially in regions of tensile stress and/or
local secondary bending, shall be avoided,
Suitable
steps shall be taken to
avoid critical vibrations due to wind and other causes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Where
necessary, permissible stresses shall be reduced to allow for the
effects of fatigue. Allowance for fatigue shall be made for combinations
of
stresses due to dead load and imposed load. Stresses
due to
wind and
earthquakes may be ignored when fatigue is being considered unless other-
wise specified in the relevant codes of practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_11>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18:875(Part5)-1687<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each element of the structure
shall be designed for the number of
stress cycles of each magnitude to which it is estimated that the element
is liable to be subjected during the expected life of the structure. The
number of cycles of each magnitude shall be estimated~ in the light of
available data regarding the probable frequency of occurrence of each type
of loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTB -  Apart from
the general observations
made
herein
the
code
is unable
to provide
any precise guidance
in estimating
the probablistic
behaviour
and response
of structures
of various
types
arising
out of
repetitive
loading
approaching
fatigue
conditions
in structural
members,
joints,
materials,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  STRUCTURAL
SAFETY DURING
CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  All loads required to be carried
by the structures
or any part
of it
due to storage or positioning of construction materials and erection equip-
ment including all loads due to operation of such equipment, shall be
considered as erection loads. Proper provision shall be made,
including
temporary
bracings to take care of all stresses due to erection loads. The
structure
as a whole and all parts of structure in conjunction with the
temporary
bracings shall be capable of sustaining these erection loads
without exceeding the permissible stresses specified in respective
codes of
practice.
Dead load, wind load and such parts of imposed load as would
be imposed on the structure during the period of erection shall be taken
as acting together with erection loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  ACCIDENTAL
LOADS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.0 General-The
occurrence of accidental loads with a significant value,
is unlikely on a given structure over the period oftime under consideration,
and also in most cases is of short duration. The occurrence of an accidental
load could in many cases be expected to cause severe consequences unless
special measures are taken:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The
accidental
loads arising out of human
action
include
the
following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) Impacts and collisions,
b) Explosions, and
c) Fire.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Characteristic
of the above stated loads are that they are not a come-
quence of normal use and that they are undesired, and that extensive
efforts are made to avoid them. As a result, the probability
of occurrence
of an accidental load is small whereas the consequences may be severe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_12>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS: 875 (Parts)-
1987<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The causes of accidental loads may be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) inadequate
safety of equipment
( due to poor design  or poor
maintenance ); and
b) wrong operation ( due to insufficient teaching or training, indis-
position, negligence or unfavourable external circumstances ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most cases, accidental loads only develop under a combination of
several unfavourable occurrence. In practical applications, it may be ncces-
sary to neglect the most unlikely loads. The probability of occurrence of
accidental loads which are neglected may differ for different consequences
of a possible failure. A data base for a detailed calculation
of the proba-
bility will seldom be available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  Dcfcrmination of Accidsrrtal  Loads -
Types
and
magnitude
of accidental
loads should
preferably
be based on a risk analysis.
The
analysis
should consider all
factors influencing
the magnitude
of the action,
including
preventive
measures
for
accidental
situations.
Generally,
only
the
principal
load bearing
system need
be
designed
for relevant
ultimate
limit
statea.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Impacts
and Collisions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1  General -
During
an impact,
the kinetic
impact energy has to be
absorbed by the vehicle hitting the structure and by the structure itself.
In an accurate analysis, the probabihty of occurrence of an impact with a
certain energy and the deformation characteristics of the object
hitting
the structure and the structure itself at the actual place nhust be consider-
ed. Impact energies for dropped objects should be based on the actual
loading capacity and lifting height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Common sources of impact are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) vehicles;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2  Collisions Between Vehicles and Structural Elements -
In road tra&z,
the requirement that a structure shall be able to resist collision may be
assumed to be fulfilled if it is demonstrated that the structural element is
able to stop a fictitious vehicle, as described in the following.
It is assum-
ed that the vehicle strikes the structural element at height of 1.2 m in any
possible direction and at a speed of 10 m/s ( 36 km/h ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_13>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 875 ( Part 5 ) - 1987<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fictitious vehicle shall be considered to consist
of two masses
ml  and  ma  which during
compression
of the vehicle produce an impact
force increasing uniformly from zero,
corresponding
to the rigidities Cr
and Cs. It is assumed
that the mass  ml  is breaked completely
before the
braking of mass  m,  begins.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following numerical
values should be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ml  = 400 kg, Cr = 10 000 kN per m the vehicle is compressed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ms  = 12 no0 kg, C’s = 300 kN per m the vehicle is compressed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  The described
fictitious collision corresponds in the case of a non-elastic
structural
element to a maximum
static
force of 630 kN for the mass ml and 600 kN
for the mass ms irrespective
of the elasticity.
assume the static force to be 630 kN.
It will, therefore,
be on the safe side to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition, braking of the mass  ml  will result in an impact wave,
the effect of which will depend to a great extent on the
kind of structural
element concerned.
Consequently,
it will not always be sufficient to design
for the static force.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3  Safe0 Railings -
With regard to safety railings put up to protect
structures against collision due to road traffic, it should be shown that the
railings are able to resist on impact as described in 6.1.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
When a vehicle collides with safety
railings, the kinetic energy of the
veh+e
will be absorbed in part by the deformation
of the railings
and,
in part by
the deformation
of the vehicle.
The part
of the kinetic energy
which the railings
should be able to absorb without breaking down may be determined
on the basis of
the assumed rigidity of the vehicle during the compression.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4  Crane Impact Load on BuJer Stab -
The basic
horizontal
load  Py
(  tonnes ), acting along the crane track produced by impact of the crane
on the buffer stop, is calculated by the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where
V-<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>speed at which the crane is travelling at the moment
of
impact ( assumed equal to half the nominal value ) (m/s>;

flexible load suspension and loading capacity
not exceed-
ing 50 t, and O-2 m in every other cranes; and
M -
the reduced crane mass (t.s*/m); and is obtained

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  Explosions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1  General -
Explosions may cause impulsive loading on a structure.
The following types of explosions are particularly relevant:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Internal gas explosions which may be caused by leakage of gas
piping ( including piping outside the room ), evaporation
from
volatile liquids or unintentional evaporation from surface mate-
rial ( for example, fire );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Internal dust explosions;
c) Boiler failure;
d) External gas cloud explosions; and
e) External explosions of high-explosives ( TNT, dynamite ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The coda1 requirement regarding internal gas explosions is given
in 6.2.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2  Explosion Efect in Closed Rooms -
Gas explosion may be caused,
for example, by leaks in gas pipes ( inclusive of pipes outside the room ),
evaporation from volatile liquids or unintentional evaporation of gas from
wall sheathings ( for example, caused by fire ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -
The

and the
ductility
and
dynamic

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1  Characteristic Values -
As  regards buildings in which the indivi-
dual floors are acted upon by a total characteristic
imposed action of up
to 5.8 kN/ma, vertical actions on air raid shelters generally locared below
ground level,
for example,
basement, etc, should be considered to have
the following characteristic
values:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) Buildings with up to 2 storeys
28 kN/m*<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) Buildings with 3 to 4 storeys
34 kN/m*<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c) Buildings with more than 4 storeys

<<HEADING level=3>>d) Buildings of particularly stable construction
28 kN/ms
irrespective of the number of storeys<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of buildings with floors that are acted upon by a charac-
teristic imposed action larger than 5.0 kN/m*, the above values should be
increased
by the difference

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1  General -
Possible extraordinary
loads during a fire may be
considered as accidental actions, Examples are loads from people along
escape routes and loads on another structure from structure failing because
of  d tie.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.2  Thermal Efect  During  Fire -
The thermal effect during fire may
be determined from one of the following methods:
a) Time-temperature

<<PARAGRAPH>>8. LOAD COMBINATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.0  General
-
A judicious combination
of the loads ( specified in Parts 1
to 4 of this standard
and earthquake ), keeping in view the probabi-
lity of:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) their acting together, and
b) their disposition in relation to other
loads and severity of stresses
or deformations
caused by combinations
of the various
loads is
necessary to ensure the required safety and economy in the design
of a structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  Load Combinations
-
Keeping
the aspect specified in 8.8, the vari-<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ous  loads should, therefore, be combined in accordance with thestipulations
in the relevant design codes. In the absence of such recommendations,
the following loading combinations,
whichever combination
produces the
most unfavourable effect in the building, foundation
or structural member
concerned may be adopted ( as a general
guidance ).
It should also be
recognized in load combinations that the simultaneous occurrence of maxi-
