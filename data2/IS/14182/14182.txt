<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
has been
adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft
finalized by the Adhesives Sectional
Committee,
had been approved
by the Petroleum,
Coal and
Related Products
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Solvent cements
consist of essentially a solution of vinylchloride
homo-polymer
or co-polymer
dissolved
in organic solvent.
These solvent
cements
can be used for joining
unplasticized
PVC pressure
pipe-s
complying
with the
requirements
of IS 4985  :  1988 ‘Specification
for
unplasticized
PVC pipes for potable water supplies ( second  revision )‘.  A recommended
procedure
for joining PVC pipes and fittings is given in IS 7634 ( Part 3 )  :  1975 ‘Code of practice
for plastic
pipe work for potable water supplies  :  Part 3 Laying and jointing
of UPVC pipes’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Information
regarding the selection
of solvent cement
of right
quality
is given in Annex D of
this standard
for guidance
only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Solvent cement for plastic pipes is made from flammable liquids.
It is the responsibility
of the
manufacturer
of the product
to give detailed
information
regarding
the use of this product to
the users who in turn should establish appropriate
safety and health
practices
and determine
the
applicability
of regulatory
limitations
prior to use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While
preparing
this
standard,
considerable
assistance
has been
derived
from
ASTM D
2564  :  1988 Standard specification
for solvent cements
for polyvinyl

<<PARAGRAPH>>Use 51.2 mm ( 2 inch ) PVC pipe and coupling
for the test.
The minimum
socket depth of the
coupling shall be 38 mm.
The dimensions
of
the pipe and fitting socket
shall be such that
the pipe will enter the socket
from
l/3 to 2/3
of the full socket depth dry when
assembled by
hand.
Cut the pipe into 150 mm
lengths
and join the
couplings.
The pipe must be fully bottomed
in
the fitting socket.
Close
the
ends of the test
specimens

<<HEADING level=3>>GUIDE FOR PVC SOLVENT CEMENT SELECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Table 2 Guide for Selection of Solvent Cement
for  Various Pipe Sizes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ED-1  The successful
joining
of PVC
pipes and
fittings
larger
than
50 mm
and
all
non-inter-
ference
type joints
requires
the
use
of solvent
cements
that have higher
gap-filling
properties
than
the minimum
viscosity
( 90 mPa ) cements
permitted
in this specification.
The ability
of a
solvent
cement
to fill a gap in
a pipe joint
can
be determined
by considering
its
viscosity
and
wet-film
thickness
( Note
1 ).
A guid-e
to the
proper
selection
of a cement
for
various
pipe
sizes
is given
in
Table
2 where
cements
are
classified
~( for purposes
of identi.fication
) into
three ~types as
regular-bodied,
medium-bodied,
or heavy-bodied,
based
on
minimum
wet-film
thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1  The wet-film
thickness
of a solvent
cement can be
measured
by using a Nordson
Wet Film
Thickness
Gauge or equivalent.
It is available
from
Nordson
Corp.,
Amherst.
OH 44001, as Nordson
No. 79-0015.
To use this gauge, dip a short length
of 25 mm pipe
vertically
into
the
cement
at
a
temperature
of
approximately
27°C to a depth of
40 to 50 mm
for
a period of 15 s. Measure
the wet-film
thickness
on
the top surface
of the pipe with the end of the gauge
about 10 mm from the end of the pipe.
With a little
care and experience
the
wet
cement
layer
can be
readily
measured
to f 0.05 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-I.1  IManufacturers’
recommendations
for
pipe size
application
should
be
followed,
for
guidelines
shown
in the table
are general
ones.
Note
that solvent
cement
properties
may vary
considerably
among
manufacturers.
There
are
also situations
where joint
fits vary for different
applications
of
the
same
nominal
pipe
size.
In such cases manufacturer’s
instructions
may
be followed
strictly
( Note
2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 Medium-bodied
and
heavy-bodied
cement
can
generally
be used for smaller
pipe
size
than
that
shown in Table 1 in case manufacturer’s
instructions
say so.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
