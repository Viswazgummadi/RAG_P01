<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Third
Revision
) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was originally
published
in
1955 and subsequently
revised in 1962 and 1970.
The present
revision
has been taken up in the
light of experience
gained
with
the use of this standard.
The
major
changes
in this revision
include
deletion
of acid
resistance
and
water
absorption
test,
and
inclusion
of
density
test as an optional
requirement
in line
with
the
international
practices.
Impermeability
test has
been made optional
in this
revision.
In
the
composition
of such
sheets,
addition
of some other suitable
fibres and pozzolanic
material
have also been permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this
standard,
due weightage
has also been given to the international
coordination
among
the standards
and practices
in different
countries
in
addition
to relating
it to the practices in the
field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test shall be rounded
00 ilr accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised
)‘.
The
number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For the purpose of measuring
the thic!:ness,
a dial thickness
gauge
having a flat
anvil of not
less than
9 mm
diameter
accurate
to measure
0 1 mm shall be used. The thickness
measurement
shall be made
along
the width
on
each
end of
the sheet. For corrugated
sheets,
measure
at least
three corrugations
at each end of the sheet exclud-
ing side laps. For semi-corrugated
sheets, measure
at least three
spots
at each
end of the
sheet in
which
extreme
flat
portions
shall
be
included.
Thickness
shall be
measured
at a distance
not
less than 20 mm from
the edge.
Each
individual
measurement
shall be not less than the minimum
