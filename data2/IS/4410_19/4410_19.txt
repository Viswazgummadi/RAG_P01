<<PARAGRAPH>>Terminology Relating to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee, RVD 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 19) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Terminology Relating to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had been approved by the
River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A large number of Indian Standards have already been printed covering various aspects of river valley
projects and some more are in the process of formulation.
These standards include technical terms, and
precise definitions for these are required for avoiding ambiguity in their interpretation.
To achieve this
aim, Terminology Relating to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee is bringing out Indian Standard
Glossary of terms relating to river valley projects (IS 4410), being published in parts. This part contains
definitions of terms relating to grouting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 19) covers the definitions of
terms relating to grouting for river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8 Curtain Grouting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Curtain grouting refers to grouting through one or
more lines of deep holes in order to create a barrier
against seepage and it is necessary to reduce the
uplift pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Ascending  Stage  Grouting<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Grouting a hole in stages as defined by packers  in
the hole from the bottom upwards.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.9 Collar of Mole<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Agitator<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The opening of hole at surface or opening of stand
pipe, protruding out of ground level is called collar
of hole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A machine employed for agitating an already mixed
grout to maintain the grout in colloidal/suspended
state, during storage or grouting operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.10 Contraction Joint Grouting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Backfill Grouting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Contraction joint grouting is done to seal the con-
traction joint opening between blocks to make
whole concrete to behave as monolith.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Due to the irregular excavated section of the rock,
empty pockets are left behind the concrete in the
lining in the arch portion of a tunnel or a cavity.
Backfill grouting is the process of filling these
spaces by sand-cement grout. The grout is injected
through pipes set in concrete lining or through
holes drilled through concrete lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.11 Descending Stage Grouting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It involves drilling a shallow hole and grouting
under low pressure.
The hole is redrilled to a
greater
depth
and regrouting is done at higher
pressure.
The process is repeated
as often as
desired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Circulating System<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The piping arrangement by which grout is conveyed
from the grout pump to the grout hole and through
a return line from the hole to the grout tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.12 Full Depth Grouting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grouting in which the entire depth of a hole is
grouted in one operation by connecting the grout
supply lint to the manifold at the top of the hole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Concrete Grouting Pad<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A concrete grouting pad/slab is provided with or
without embedded pipes on the rock foundation
under the impervious core of fill dams to enable
grouting of shattered upper layers of the rock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.13 Grouting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Process of injecting mixtures of cement slurry or
other suitable material into confined and inacces-
sible spaces (cracks and crevices) so that the whole
formation may act as a monolithic mass to with-
stand the high pressure and loads to which it may
be subjected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6 Consolidation
or Blanket Grouting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consolidation grouting is done to bind and densify
the natural foundation strata to make it capable of
supporting the load  by  sealing cracks and gaps so as
to behave as monolithic mass and to improve the
overall elastic behaviour and bearing capacity of
foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.14 Grouting Pattern<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An arrangement of holes for grouting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.15 Grout Pressure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7 Contact Grouting or Pack Grouting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The process of grouting behind the concrete lining
or steel liner to fill the shrinkage gap and voids, if<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pressure under which the grout is injected is
called the grout pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

water into a hole through a direct connection or a
packer to measure acceptance under test condi-
tions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Ashort  length of pipe, installed at the top of a grout
hole through which drilling is done and/or to which
the grout header is attached for the purpose of
injection by grout.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Application of cement slurry to surface rock as a
means of filling cracks and surface irregularities or
open joints to prevent leakage and slacking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.18 Grout Refusal<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When rate of grout intake of a hole or stage reduces
beyond a specified limit, averaged over a given time,
at a particular pressure, the hole is said to have
attained a state of grout refusal and grouting of a
hole is said to be completed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
