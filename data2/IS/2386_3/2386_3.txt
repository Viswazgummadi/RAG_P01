FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This  Indian Standard ( Part III ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 22 August 1963, after the draft finalized by
the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Building Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 One of the,major contributing factors to the quality of concrete is the
quality of aggregates used therein. The
test methods given in this
standard are intended to assist in assessing the quality of aggregates.
In
a given situation, for a particular aggregate, it may not be necessary to
-assess all the qualities and therefore it is necessary to determine before-
hand the purpose for which a concrete is being used and the qualities of
the. aggregate which require to be assessed. Accordingly, the relevant
test methods may be chosen from amongst the various tests covered in
this standard. For the convenience of the user, the test methods are
grouped into the following eight parts of Indian Standard Methods of
Test for Aggregates for Concrete ( IS  :  2386-1963 ):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Particle Size and Shape<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The Sectional Committee responsible for the preparation of this
standard has taken into consideration the views of the concrete specialists,
testing authorities, consumers .and technologists and has related the
standard to the practices followed in the country in this field.
Further
the need for international co-ordinatiod among standards prevailing in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ISt2386(PartIII)L1963<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>different countries of the world has also been recognized.
These con-
siderations led the Sectional
Committee
to derive assistance from the
published standards and publications of the following organizations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>British Standards Institution
American Society for Testing and Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4. Wherever
a
reference
to any Indian
Standard
appears
in these
methods, it shall be taken as a reference to its latest version.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard
is complied with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of ‘a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accord-
ance with IS  :  2-1960 Rules for Rounding Off Numerical Values (  Revised ).
The number of significant places retained
in the
rounded
off value
should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.6 This standard is intended chiefly to cover the technical
provisions
relating to testing of aggregates for concrete,
and it does not include all
the necessary provisions of a contract.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard ( Part III ) covers the following tests for aggregates for
concrete:<<HEADING_END>>

b) Determination of bulk density and voids,
c) Determination
of necessary
adjustment
for bulking of
fine
aggregate ( field method ), and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d) Determination
of surface
moisture
in fine aggregate
(field
method ).<<HEADING_END>>

at the end of the soaking period, air entrapped in or bubbles on the
surface of the aggregate shall be removed by gentle agitation.
This may
be achieved by rapid clockwii and anti-clockwise rotation of the vessel
between the operator’s hands.
233.1
The vessel shall be overfilled by adding distilled water and
the plane ground-glass disc slid over the mouth so as to ensure that no
air is trapped in the vessel. The vessel shall be dried on the outside and
weighed ( weight A ).

<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Object -
This
method
of test covers
the procedure
for determining
unit weight or bulk density and void of aggregates.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -
The bulk density is the weight of material in a given volume, and for the
purpose of this standard it is measured in kilograms per litre.
The bulk density of an
aggregate is affected by several factors, including the amount of moisture present and the
amount of effort introduced in filling the measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -It
is emphasized that this is a laboratory
test intended fbr comparing
properties of different aggregates.
It is not generally suitable for use as a basis for
quoting mix design conversion factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3-
Considerably
more compactive
effort is used in the determination
of
angularity number [ see IS  :  2336 ( Part I )-1963 ] than in this test, and hence the valuer
for bulk density and voids are different.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Apparatus -

shall consist of the following:

The

The

The

of the aggregate
shall then be levelled
with
a straightedge.
The

-
Sand
brought
on to a building
site or other
works may
contain
an amount
of moisture
which will cause it, when loosely filled into
a container,
to occupy
a larger
volume
than it would occupy
if dry.
If
the sand is measured
by loose volume,
it is necessary
in such a case to
increase
the measured
volume
of the sand,
in order
that
the amount
of
sand. put into the concrete
may
be the amount
intended
for the nomingl
mix
used
( based
on dry
sand )
It
will be
necessary
to increase
the
volume of sand by the  ‘  percentage
’  bulking.
The correction
to be made
is only
a rough
approximation,
because
the system of measurement
by
loose volume is a rough method
at the best, but a correction
of the right

and should be applied in order
