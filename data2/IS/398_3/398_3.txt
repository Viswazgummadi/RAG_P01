F O R E W O R D
0.1  This Indian Standard (Part III) (Second Revision) was adopted by
the Indian Standards Institution on 3 June 1976, after the draft
finalized by the Conductors and Power Cables Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Electrotechnical Division Council.
0.2  This standard was originally published in 1953 and the first revision
was brought out in 1961. The second revision has been undertaken with
a view to effecting the following modifications:
a) To line up with the international standards;
b) To further rationalize the sizes of stranded aluminium conductors,
steel reinforced aluminium conductors and to introduce a few sizes,
which will have a higher aluminium/steel ratio;
c) To introduce aluminized-steel reinforced aluminium conductors;
and
d) To
introduce
aluminium
alloy
stranded
conductors
(aluminium-magnesium-silicon type).
0.2.1  While revising this standard, it was decided to issue it in different
parts covering different types of conductors. This part dealing with
aluminized-steel reinforced aluminium conductors form Part III of the
series. Other parts in the series are given below:
Part I Aluminium stranded conductor
Part II Aluminium conductor, galvanized-steel reinforced
Part IV Aluminium alloy stranded conductors (under preparation)
0.3  The important deviation from the standards published by the IEC is
with respect to the value adopted for resistivity. Owing to difficulties in
getting EC grade aluminium of a higher conductivity locally, the
standard has prescribed a resistivity of 0.028 45 ohm.mm 2 /m at 20°C,
whereas the value prescribed in the IEC standard is 0.028 264
ohm.mm 2 /m at 20°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 398 (Part III) - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  In the preparation of this standard, considerable assistance has been
derived from AS 1220, Part . . ‘Draft Australian Standard Specification
for aluminium conductors for overhead transmission purposes: Part . .
Aluminized-steel reinforced (ACSR/AZ), Doc : 1898’ issued by the
Standards Association of Australia.
0.5  The values of modulus of elasticity and coefficient of linear
expansion are given in Appendix B for information.
0.6  This edition 3.3 incorporates Amendment No. 2 (May 1983) and
Amendment No. 3 (April 1985). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.
0.7  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final values, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off values should be the same as that of the specified values in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SECTION I
GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard (Part III) covers the requirements and tests for
aluminium conductors, aluminized-steel reinforced used for overhead
power transmission purposes.
2. TERMINOLOGY
2.0  For the purpose of this standard, the following definitions in addition
to those given in IS : 1885 (Part XXXII)-1971† shall apply.
2.1 Aluminium
Conductor,
Aluminized-Steel
Reinforced  —
Conductor consisting of seven or more aluminium and aluminized steel
wires built up in concentric layers. The centre wire or wires are of
aluminized steel and the outer layer or layers of aluminium.
2.2 Diameter  — The mean of two measurements at right angles taken
at the same cross section.
2.3 Direction of Lay  — The direction of lay is defined as right-hand or
left-hand. With right-hand lay, the wires conform to the direction of the
central part of the letter Z when the conductor is held vertically. With
left-hand lay, the wires conform to the direction of the central part of the
letter S when the conductor is held vertically.
2.4 Lay Ratio  — Ratio of the axial length of a complete turn of the helix
formed by an individual wire in a stranded conductor to the external
diameter of the helix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 398 (Part III) - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. PHYSICAL CONSTANTS FOR HARD-DRAWN ALUMINIUM
3.1 Resistivity  — The resistivity of aluminium depends upon its purity
and its physical condition. For the purpose of this standard, the
maximum value permitted is 0.028 45 ohm.mm 2 /m at 20°C, and this
value has been used for calculation of the maximum permissible values
of resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — It is not intended to check the resistivity from the measured values of
resistance.
3.2 Density  — At  a  temperature  of  20ºC, the density of hard-drawn
aluminium has been taken as 2.703 g/cm 3 .
3.3 Constant-Mass Temperature Coefficient of Resistance  — At a
temperature of 20°C the constant-mass temperature coefficient of
resistance of hard-drawn aluminium, measured between two potential
points rigidly fixed to the wire, the metal being allowed to expand freely,
has been taken as 0.004 per degree Celsius.
3.4 Coefficient of Linear Expansion  — The coefficient of linear
expansion of hard-drawn aluminium at 0°C has been taken as
23.0 × 10 –6  per degree Celsius. This value holds good for all practical
purposes over the range of temperature from 0°C to the highest safe
operating temperature.
4. PHYSICAL CONSTANTS FOR ALUMINIZED STEEL WIRES
4.1 Density  — At a temperature of 20°C, the density of aluminized steel
wire has been taken as 7.80 g/cm 3 .
4.2 Coefficient of Linear Expansion  — In order to obtain uniformity
in calculations, a value of 11.5 × 10 –6 /°C has been taken as the value for
the coefficient of linear expansion of aluminized steel wires used for the
cores of steel reinforced aluminium conductors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SECTION II
MATERIALS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. MATERIAL
5.1  The conductor shall be constructed of hard-drawn aluminium and
aluminized steel wires which have the mechanical and electrical
properties specified in Tables 1 and 2.

TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12. TESTS
12.1 Selection of Test Samples
12.1.1  Samples of individual wires for tests specified in  12.2 ,  12.3 ,  12.4 ,
12.5  and  12.6  shall normally be taken by the manufacturer before
stranding, from the outer ends of not less than 10 percent of wire coils.
12.1.2  Alternatively, if desired by the purchaser at the time of placing an
order that the tests be made in the presence of his representative,
samples of wire shall be taken from lengths of stranded conductors.
Samples shall then be obtained by cutting 1.2 metres from the outer end
of the finished conductor from not more than 10 percent of the finished
reels or drums. If there is more than one length on any reel or drum, the
sample shall be taken from the outer length.
12.1.3  Coils offered for inspection shall be divided* into equal lots, the
number of lots being equal to the number of samples to be selected, a
fraction of a lot being counted as a complete lot. One sample coil shall be
selected at random from each lot.
12.2 Breaking Load Test  — This test shall be made on both
aluminium and aluminized steel wires.
12.2.1  The breaking load of one specimen cut from each of the sample
taken under  12.1.1  or  12.1.2  shall be determined by means of a suitable
tensile testing machine. The load shall be applied gradually and the rate
of separation of the jaws of the testing machine shall be not less
than 25 mm/min and not greater than 100 mm/min.
The ultimate breaking load of the specimens shall be not less than the
appropriate value specified in Tables 1 and 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*This may be done physically or on the basis of identification numbers of the coils
offered for supply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 398 (Part III) - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.3 Ductility Test  — This test shall be made on aluminized steel
wires only, by either of the two tests given in  12.3.1  and  12.3.2 .
12.3.1  Torsion Test —  One specimen cut from each of the samples taken
under  12.1.1  or  12.1.2  shall be gripped at its ends in two vices, one of
which shall be free to move longitudinally during the test. A small
tensile load not exceeding 2 percent of the breaking load of the wire,
shall be applied to the sample during testing. The specimen shall be
twisted by causing one of the vices to revolve until fracture occurs and
the number of twists shall be indicated by a counter or other suitable
device. The rate of twisting shall not exceed 60 rev/min.
When tested before stranding, the number of complete twists before
fracture occurs shall be not less than 18 on a length equal to 100 times the
diameter of the wire. The primary fracture shall show a smooth surface at
right angles to the axis of the wire. Any secondary fracture shall be ignored.
When tested after stranding, the number of complete twists before
fracture occurs shall be not less than 16 on a length equal to 100 times
the diameter of the wire. The fracture shall show a smooth surface at
right angles to the axis of the wire.
12.3.2  Elongation Test —  The elongation of one specimen cut from each
of the samples taken under  12.1.1  or  12.1.2  shall be determined. The
specimen shall be straightened by hand and an original gauge length
of 200 mm shall be marked on the wire. A tensile load shall be applied as
described in  12.2  and the elongation shall be measured after the
fractured ends have been fitted together. If the fracture occurs outside
the gauge marks, or within 25 mm of either mark and the required
elongation is not obtained, the test shall be disregarded and another test
made. When tested before stranding, the elongation shall be not less
than 4 percent. When tested after stranding, the elongation shall be not
less than 3.5 percent.
N OTE  — The choice between the torsion test and the elongation test shall be at the
discretion of the purchaser. In the absence of any definite indication from the
purchaser torsion test shall be carried out in preference to elongation test.
12.4 Wrapping Test  — This test shall be made on both aluminium and
aluminized steel wires.
12.4.1  Aluminium Wires —  One specimen cut from each of the samples
of aluminium wire taken under  12.1.1  or  12.1.2  shall be wrapped round
a wire of its own diameter to form a close helix of eight turns. Six turns
shall then be unwrapped and again closely wrapped in the same
direction as before. The wire shall not break or show any crack.
N OTE  — Slight surface cracks shall not constitute cause for rejection.
12.4.2  Aluminized Steel Wires —  One specimen cut from each of the
samples of aluminized steel wire taken under  12.1.1  or  12.1.2  shall be
wrapped round a mandrel of diameter equal to 4 times the wire diameter to
form a close helix of 8 turns. Six turns shall then be unwrapped and again
closely wrapped in the same direction as before. The wire shall not break.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

only.
The electrical resistance of one specimen of aluminium wire cut from
each of the samples taken under  12.1.1  or  12.1.2  shall be measured at
ambient temperature. The measured resistance shall be corrected to the

<<PARAGRAPH>>The resistance corrected at 20°C shall be not more than the maximum
value specified in Table 1.
12.6 Aluminizing Test  — This test shall be made on aluminized steel
wires only.
12.6.1  This test shall be made on one specimen cut from each of the
samples of aluminized steel wires taken under  12.1.1  or  12.1.2 .
12.6.2  The adherance of aluminium coating, mass of coating and
continuity of coating shall be in accordance with IS : 3835-1966*.
13. REJECTION AND RETESTS
13.1  Should any one of the test pieces selected fail to pass the tests,
three further samples from the same batch shall be selected, one of
which shall be from the length from which the original test sample was
taken, unless that length has been withdrawn by the supplier.
13.2  Should all of the three test pieces from these additional samples
satisfy the requirements of the tests, the batch represented by these
samples shall be deemed to comply with the standard. Should the test
pieces from any of the three additional samples fail, the batch
represented shall be deemed not to comply with the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

by multiplying the mass of an equal length of straight wire by the
appropriate constant set out in Table 5. The masses of the steel core and
aluminium wires are calculated separately and added together.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

a) 98 percent of the sum of the breaking loads of the aluminium wires
plus 89 percent of the sum of the breaking loads of the aluminized
steel wires, when taken from the stranded conductor and tested; or
b) 98 percent of the sum of the breaking loads of the aluminium wires
plus 85 percent of the sum of the breaking loads of the aluminized
steel wires, based on the breaking loads of the component wires
before stranding, that is, the coil.
A-3.2  The values of approximate breaking load of conductors, given in
Table 3 have been calculated in accordance with  A-3.1  (b) and on the
basis of the minimum breaking loads of the component wires given in
Tables 1 and 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
