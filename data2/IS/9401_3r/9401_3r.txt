<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee, RVD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This lndian Standard (Part 3) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by.
the Measurement of Works ofRiver Valley Projects Sectional Commit tee had been approved by the River
Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In measurement of works of river projects a large diversity of methods exist at present according to local
practices. The lack of uniformity creates complications
regarding measurements
and payments. This
standard is being formulated in various parts, covering each type of work separately. This part is intended
to provide a uniform basis for measuring the work done in respect of grouting for river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 3) was first published in 1980. With the experience gained by its usage and by the
revision and updation of related standards, it was necessary to revise the standard so as to bring it in line
with the current field practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain portions of the standard which dealt with grouting procedure have been deleted as the same are
adequately covered in the revision of the standard relating to pressure grouting (IS 6066  :  1994).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part has also been brought in line with the other parts of the standard which deal with measurement
of various items of work of river valley projects. Due care has been taken to ensure conformity with the
Indian Standard relating to analysis of unit rate of grouting (1s 13418  :  1992).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of measurements made in accordance with  this  standard, if the final value, observed
or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off
numerical values (revised)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
