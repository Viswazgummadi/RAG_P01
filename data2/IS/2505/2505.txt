Sectional Committee,
HMD 18<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Third Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Construction
Plant and Machinery
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Heavy Mechanical
Engineering
Division Couccil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The compaction
of concrete by vibration
has revolutionized
the concept
of concrete
technology,
making possible practical use of low slump, stiff mixes for production
of high quality concrete with
required
degree of strength,
density,
durability
and impermeability.
Immersion
vibrators
are
most commonly
used for compaction
of plain as well as reinforced
concrete
and are known
for
their efficacy and ease of operation
even in thin and narrow sections, intricate forms,
and sections
with closely spaced reinforcement.
This standard has been prepared
with a view to providing
guidance both in the manufacture
and purchase of concrete
vibrators
of immersion
type capable
of giving satisfactory
performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pneumatic
or electrically driven motor in head type immersion vibrators
and flexible
shaft driven
immersion
vibrators of size larger than 90 mm are not covered in the standard
although
some of
the provisions may also apply to these types of vibrators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
prime
mover
to be used with the vibrator
shall be of sufficient power to ensure required
performance.
The prime mover may be with internal combustion
engine or electric
motor
con-
forming to relevant Indian Standards.
It may be mounted
on a suitable base.
A suitable
device
foi
starting or stopping the vibrator without disconnecting
the flexible shaft from the prime mover
may also be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The moving parts of the vibrator
shall be suitably
encased
and appropriate
safeguards
against
accident be provided.
Suitable earthing and other
safety
arrangements
shall also be provided
for the electrical motors and components
in accordance
with the provisions
of relevent
Indian
Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1963 and subsequently
revised in 1968 and 1980.
The present
revision has been done with a view to incorporate
modifications
necessary as a result of experience
gained with the use of this standard.
immersion vibrators have been added.
In this revision, provisions
relating
to pendulum
type
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A mere measurement
of amplitude and frequency
may not always yield a firm basis for judging
the efficiency of an immersion vibrator.
On the other hand, a direct measurement
of the degree
and uniformity
of compaction
of concrete achieved with such a vibrator would give a more con-
vincing and fairer appreciation
of its performance.
However, in view of large number of variables
involved, it has not been found feasible as yet to prescribe in this standard a simple and practical
method
of test for direct
measurement
of compaction
characteristics.
Further
the Sectional
Committee
has also appreciated
that even the requirements
in regard to amplitude
and frequency
may considerably
vary from case to case and, therefore,
the attempt
in this standard has been
made to lay down, only the limiting ranges to the operational
and performance
characteristics
besides the physical dimensions of the vibrators,
on the basis of available
technical
literature
on
the subject, experience
and the current manufacturing
practices in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard, considerable
assistance
has been given by Central
Building
Research Institute,
Roorkee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  : 1960  ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical values (  revised
)‘.
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the
same
as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
