FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part VI)
( First
Revision
) was adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 February
1972, after
the draft
finalized
by the Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.
0.2 With
a view to establish
uniform
procedures
for the determination
of
different
characteristics
of soils and
also for facilitating
a comparative
study
of the results,
the Indian
Standards
Institution
is bringing
out
this  ‘  Indian
Standard
methods
of test for soils ’ (IS : 2720)
which
is
being
published
in parts.
Thirty-three
parts
of this
series
have
been
published
so far.
0.3 This part, first published
in 1964, deals with the methods
of test for
the determination
of shrinkage
factors
for soils.
Factors,
such
as the
shrinkage
limit, shrinkage
ratio, shrinkage
index and volumetric
shrinkage
may be. .etermined
from the results
of the test described.
The
method
for determining
the value of linear
shrinkage
on the basis of results of test
conducted
for obtaining
the shrinkage
limit has been found unsatisfactory
and a direct
method
for determining
this property
has been
covered
in
IS  :  2720 ( Part
XX )-1966*.
Hence
reference
to linear
shrinkage
has
been deleted
from this revision.
As weight
measurements
can
be made
more accurately
than
volume
measurements,
the former
method
has been
specified
in this revision
for the determination
of the volume
of the soil
pat.
The
inside
edge of the shrinkage
dish has been rounded
so that air
entrapped
during
the measurement
of the volume
of the pat is minimized.
Recently
it has
been
recognized
that
shrinkage
upon
drying
is also
indicative
of the structure
of the soil.
The
greater
the
shrinkage
the
more
dispersed
the
strcture.
It
is possible,
therefore,
to study
the
shrinkage
behaviour
of undisturbed
soil of natural
or man-made
deposits
and get an idea of its structure.
In this revision
the term shrinkage
limit
( undisturbed
soil)
has been introduced
to define
this property
and
a
method
included
for its determination.
Consequently,
the term originally
known
as shrinkage
limit
has
been
re-designated
as shrinkage
limit
( remoulded
soil ).

Paste-
Place about
30 g of the soil sample
obtained
in 4.1 in the evaporating
dish and thoroughly
mix with distilled
water in an amount
sufficient
to fill the soil voids completely
and to make
the soil pasty enough

In
the
case
of friable
soils
the
amount
of
water
required
to obtain
the desired
consistency
is equal
to or slightly
greater
than the liquid limit; in the case of plastic soils it may exceed
the

removing
the excess by pressing the plain glass plate firmly
over the top of the shrinkage
dish in such a way that
the plate
is flush
xvith the top of the dish and no air is entrapped,
weighing
the mercury

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Filling
the Shrinkage
Dish-
Coat
the inside
of
the
shrinkage
dish with a thin layer  of  silicone  grease or Vaseline
or some other
heavy
grease
to
prevent
the
adhesion
of soil
to
the
dish.
Place
in
the
centre
of the shrinkage
dish an amount
of the soil paste equal
to about
one-third
the voiume
of the shrinkage
dish, and allow the paste to flow to
the edges
by tapping
the shrinkage
dish
on a firm
surface
cushioned
by
several
layers
of
blotting
paper,
rubber
sheet
or similar
material.
Add an amount
of the soil paste approximately
equal to the first portion,
and tap the shri,lkage
dish as before
until
the paste is thoroughly
com-
pacted
and
all
included
air
has
been
brought
to the surface.
Add
more
soil
paste
and
continue
the tapping
until
the shrinkage
dish is
completely
filled and excess soil paste stands
out about
its edge.
Then
strike
off the excess
soil paste with a straight
edge, and wipe off all soil
adhering
to the outside
of the shrinkage
dish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Weigh
immediately
the shrinkage
dish as filled in 5.3 and record
the
weight
as the
weight
of the shrinkage
dish and wet soil pat.
Allow
the soil pat to dry in air until
the colour
of the pat turns
frcm
dark
to
light.
Then
oven-dry
the pat in the shrinkage
dish to constant
weight
at 105 to 1 IO%, cool in a desiccator
and weigh immediately
after removal
from the desiccator.
Record
the weight
as the weight
of shrinkage
dish
and dry soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Volume
of the Dry
Soil Pat -
Determine
the volume of the dry
soil pat by removing
the pat from the shrinkage
dish and immersing
it in
the glass cup full of mercury
in the manner
given in 5.5.1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.1
Fill the glass cup to overflowing
with
mercury
and remove
the
excess mercury
by pressing the glass plate with the three prongs (see Fjg. 1 )
firmly over the top of the cup, collecting
the excess mercury
in a suitable
container.
Carefully
wipe
off any
mercury
which
may be adhering
to the outside of the cup.
Place
the cup, filled
thus with mercury,
in
the
evaporating
dish
taking
care
Ilot
to spill any mercury
from the
glass cup, and place the oven-dried
soil pat on the surface
of the mercury
in the cup.
Then
carefully
force the pat under
the mercury
by means of
the
glass plate
with
the same prongs
( see Fig.
1 ) and press the plate
firmly over the top of the cup, the displaced
mercury
being
collected
in
the evaporating
dish without
spilling
out of it.
Care shall be taken to
ensure
that
no air is trapped
under
the soil pat.
\Veigh the mercury
so displaced
by the dry soil pat to an accuracy
of 0.1 g and determine
its
volume by dividing
this weight
by the unit weight
of mercury.
Record
this volume
as the volume of the oven-dry
soil pat, T-0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
