FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Part II ) ( First Revision
) was adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 28 February
1983, after the draft
finalized by the Cement and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
was
first
published
in
1966
as  ‘  IS  :  35cO-1966
Specification
for load bearing
lightweight
concrete
blocks’.
The first
revision
is being issued under the modified title  ‘  Specification
for con-
crete masonry units: Part II Hollow and solid lightweight
concrete blocks’
and supercedes
IS  :  3590-1966.
Part I of this standard
covers
hollow
and
solid
concrete blocks of normal weight.
This
modification
in title
is intended for facilitating
the co-ordination
of requirements
of various
types of concrete masonry units, covered under various Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
This
standard
incorporates
significant
modifications
especially
with regard to the classification
of the blocks and physical
requirements
such as dimensions, compressive
strength
values,
water
absorption
and
drying
shrinkage.
Also this revision
covers
hollow
blocks
of close-’
cavity type apart from hollow blocks of open cavity.
The requiremen.;
of
load bearing
and non-load bearing blocks have been separately
given
in this standard to the extent possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Concrete masonry, already extensively
used in building
construction
abroad,
is likely
to make
very
considerable
headway in this country
because of the many advantages,
such as durability,
strength
and
struc-
tural stability,
fire resistance,
insulatton, and sound absorption it possesses.
Concrete masonry construction
is also economical
because
of the follow-
ing aspects:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the units are relatively
large and true in size and shape.
This
insures rapid construction
so that more wall is laid per man-hour
than in other types of wall construction;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 21S5 ( Part II ) - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) fewer joints result in a considerable saving in mortar as compared
to hormal masonry construction; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the true plane surface obtained does not require plaster.
Even
when plaster is used for any reason, the quantity
required
for
satisfactory coverage is significantly small.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 Concrete
masonry
has an attractive
appearance and is readily
adaptable
to any style of
architecture.
It lends itself
to a wide
variety of surface finishes for both exterior and interior
walls.
It may
also be finished with cement plaster, gauged with lime or a plasticizer.
Concrete
masonry units provide
a strong mechanical key, uniting the
concrete masonry backing and the plaster finish in a strong permanent
bond.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Concrete masonry units are used for both load-bearing
and non-load
bearing walls, for partitions and panel walls, as backing for other types
of facing material, for piers; pilasters and columns,
for retaining walls,
garden
walls, chimneys
and fire places, as fillers in concrete joist floor
construction, and as shuttering for beams and lintels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1 Concrete
masonry units manufactured
from lightweight aggre-
gate concrete
are used for both
load bearing
and non-load bearing
internal wails, partition and panel walls, inner leaf of cavity walls or as
backing to brick masonry and for external load bearing walls as well as
panel walls in steel or reinforced
concrete
frame construction
when
protected from weather hy rendering  or  by some other efficient treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of. deciding whether
+ particular
requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accor-
dance with IS : 2-1960+.
The number of significant places retained
in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>

may also be developed
by treating
the
face
of the units
while
still green
by wire brushing
or combing,
by
slightly
eroding
the surface
by playing
a fine spray of water upon it,
and by splitting ( split block ).
Colour may be introduced
by. incorpo-
rating

<<HEADING level=3>>E-4. PROCEDURE
FOR TESTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-4.1  Immediately
after removal of the specimens from the water, the
grease shall be wiped from the steel balls and the length
of each speci-
men measured to an accuracy of 0902 5 mm by the apparatus described
in E-2.1.
This shall be taken as the original wet measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
The instrument reading required is not the absolute length of the specimen
but the defference in length between the specimens and an Invar rod of approxima-
tely the same length.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-4.2  The specimens shall then be dried for at least 44 hours in an oven
of the type described in E-2.2, at the specified temperature and humidity.
The specimens shall then be removed from the oven and cooled
for at
least 4 hours in a desiccator
containing
solid calcium
chloride or a
saturated solution of calcium chloride.
Each specimen
shall then be
measured as described in  E-4.1,  at a temperature of 27 & 2’C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-4.3 The cycle of drying, cooling and measuring shall be repeated until
constant length is attained, that is, when the difference between consecu-
tive readings separated by a period of drying of at least 44 hours followed
by cooling for at least 4 hours, is less than 0905
mm for a 15 cm
specimen and pro rata for a larger specimen.
The final reading shall be
taken as the dry measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-4.4 During the above drying process further wet specimen
shall not
be placed
in the same oven and there shall be free access of air to all
surfaces of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-4.5 After the dry measurement
has been taken, the length of the
specimen shall be measured, adjacent to the steel balls, to the nearest
millimetre and this shall be taken as the ‘dry length’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-5. CALCULATION
OF RESULTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E-5.1 The ‘drying shrinkage’ shall be calculated for each specimen as the
difference between the ‘original wet measurement’ and the ‘dry measure-
ment’ expressed as a percentage of the  ‘dry length’.<<HEADING_END>>

PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-l.1
The specimens which have previously
been used for the drying
shrinkage
test ( see Appendix E ) shall after the completion
of that test,
be immersed in water for  4  days, the temperature
being
maintained
at
27 f
2°C for  at least  4 hours prior to the removal  of the specimens and
the wet length measured.
The moisture movement shall be determined
as the difference
between
the dry and wet lengths and expressed as a
percentage
of the dry length for each specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-1.2
Should the value obtained
with any one of the three specimens
tested be greater than the limit specified in 8.7, the test shall be repeated
on the further
three blocks which
were set aside.
In repeating
the
moisture movement test, the drying shrinkage test shall be repeated if the
previous speoimens have failed on that test also; otherwise,
the drying
shrinkage
test may
be omitted.
The
three new specimens,
in that
event, shall be dried
to constant
length
at 50 f
