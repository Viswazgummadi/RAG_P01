<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was ado
on 18 September 1968, after the x
ted by the Indian Standards Institution
raft finalized by the Cement. and Con-
Crete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.
0.2 Hydraulic cement, more commonly known as cement, is one of the most
extensively used basic materials in all. civil engineering constructions.
Tremendous progress in the civil engineering industry and the exacting
demands of engineers for high quali
7
building materials have resulted
in the development of a large variety o hydraulic cements, both for specia-
lized and general use in civil engineering constructions. There are a number
of technical terms connected with the production and use of different type
of hydraulic cements, which quite often require clarifications to give precise
meaning to the stipulations in the standard specikations and other technical
documents.
This standard has been prepared with the object of defining
various  terms relating to hydraulic cements.
0.3 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been  given to
international co-ordination among the standards and  practices  prcvaili
in diierent countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the fiel
3
in this country.
0.4 This standard is one of a series of Indian Standards on cements. Other
standards published in the series are the following:
‘IS  *  269-1967 Ordinary,

<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 This  standard lays down the general definitions applicable to hydraulic
cements, as well as the particular ddinitions and the denominations which
pertain to each type of cement.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. GENERAL
DEFINITIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2,l Hydraulic
cement
-
Finely ground material which on addition of
requisite quantity of water is capable of hardening both under water and in
tir by the chemical interaction
of its constituents with water, and is also
capable of bending together appropriate materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Component  Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.1  Principal Com@nent Materials -
The principal materials used in the
manufacture of hydraulic cement should have either hydraulic or pozzolanic
properties.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.1.1
Hydraulic jwo~erties -
Hydraulic properties are the ability of  a
material to set and harden in the presence of water, with formation of stable
wmpounds.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1.2
Pozzolanic @ropertiGs -
The ability of a material
to combine
chemically with calcium hydroxide in the presence of water under ambient
temperature forming compounds having cementitious properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Portland Clinker -
Clinker, consisting mostly of calcium silicates,
obtained by heating to incipient fusion a predetermmed
and homogeneous
mixture of materials principally containing lime ( CaO ) and silica ( SiO, )
with a smaller proportion of alumina
( Also, ) and iron oxide ( FesO, ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3
Granulated Blartjhace
Slag -
Blastfurnace slag in granulated form is
used for the manufacture. of hydraulic cement.
Blastfurnace slag is non-
metallic product consisting essentially of glass containing silicates and alumino
silicates of lime and other bases, which is developed simultaneously with iron
in blastfurnace or electric pig iron furnace.
Granulated slag is obtained by
further processing the molten slag by rapidly chilling or quenching it with
water or steam and air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.4
High Alumina Clinker -
Clinker consisting mainly of mono calcium
aluminates and obtained by complete or partial fusion of a predetermined
mixture of materials mainly containing alumina ( Also, ) and lime ( CaO )
with smaller proportions of iron oxides, silica (.SiOs ) and other oxides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.5
PozzoCana -An
essentially silicious material which while in itself
possessing little or no cementitious properties will, in finely divided form
and in the presence of water, react with calcium hvdroxide at ambient tern--
pcrature
to form compounds
possessing
cementitious
properties.
