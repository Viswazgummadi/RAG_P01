FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part V )
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 29 January
1980,
after
the draft finalized
by
the Method
of Measurement
of Works of River
Valley
Projects
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
In measurements
of quantities
in construction
of river valley projects
a large diversity
of methods
exists at present according
to local practices.
This
lack
of uniformity
creates
complication
regarding
measurements
and payments.
The estimator
is also left in doubt
as to the  true
mean-
ing
and
intention
of items
in the schedule
of work.
This
standard
is
intended
to provide
a uniform
basis for measuring
masonry
works in the
construction
of river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
The
provisions
contained
in
this
standard
will
generally
have
precedence
over
the
provisions
in
IS  : 1200 (  Part III
)-1976*
and
IS  :  1200
( Part IV )-1976t.
However,
the
provisions
of both
these
standards
and this standard
be considered
complimentary
and
supple-
mentary
to each other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In reporting
the result
of measurements
made
in accordance
with
this
standard,
if
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
is to be
rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960:.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This
standard
( Part
V ) covers
the
method
of measurement
of
masonry
works
in
river
valley
projects
( dams
and
appurtenant
structures
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9401  (  Part V ) - 1980<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The
purpose
of measurement
of proposed
work
is preparation
of bill
of quantiries
for estimating
and tendering.
The
purpose
of measure-
ment of executed
work is assessment
of value
of work for payment.
In
either case the method
of measurements
should
be such that
it is fairly
quick,
reasonably
accurate
and amenable
to check
at any time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  In case of measurement
of proposed
work,
the dimensions
are scaled
or read
from
drawings
and then
worked
up that is reduced
to length,
area,
or volume
in  recognized
units
of measurements
for the  particular
item.
In
case
of assessment
of executed
work,
the
dimensions
are
measured
in the field.
Calculations
of length,
area,
volume,
weight,
etc, are made
on the basis of these dimensions
and payments
are made
accordingly.
Where
measurement
of a number
of units
are the same it
is the usual practice
to take measurements
of one unit and
multiply
the
calculated
length,
area or volume
by the number
of units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
Measurements
shall
be
taken
to nearest
centimetre
including
of
levels.
Fractions
less than
half shall
be disregarded
and fractions
half
and above are to be regarded
as unity.
Areas shall be worked
out to be
nearest
0.01 m2 and cubic contents
shall be worked out to nearest
0.01 ms.
However,
in measurement
of repetitive
nature,
this practice
shall
be
applied
to the total of the item and not to individual
unit.
It is essential
that measurements
shall be as accurate
as  possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4
Measurements
are closely linked
with detailed
drawings,
description
of items
and
specifications
of
the work.
These
should,
therefore,
be
very clear
and properly
worded
and the order
of precedence
shall
be
sanctioned
drawings,
approved
specifications
and
specified
description
of items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  MEASUREMENT
OF IRREGULAR
AREAS AND VOLUMES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The
irregular
area
shall
be
divided
into a number
of figures
of
known
area, say, triangles,
rectangles,
etc.
The remaining
part  (  which
cannot
be formed
into a triangle
or a regular
figure ) may
be evaluated
by taking
out average
height
drawn
on a common
base
by  Simp,ons
Rule.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2
In case of an irregular
volume,
the volume
shall
be determined
by
the  Prismoidal formula.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
