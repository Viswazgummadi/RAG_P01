<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part II) (First Revision) was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 1 October 1974, after the draft tinalized_by
the Stones Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineermg
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Building stones are available in large quantity in various parts of the
country and to choose and utilize them for their satisfactory performance, it is
necessary to know the various strength properties determined according to
standard procedure.
This standard has, therefore, been formulated to cover
the standard method for determining the strength properties of various stones.
This standard covering compressive, transverse and shear strength properties
was published in 1957 and is being revised based on the actual use of it in the
past 17 years and the experience gained in testing of building stones for these
properties in the various research laboratories of this country. In this revision,
property of tensile strength has also been added which is also important for
assessing the suitability of stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
This standard is now being issued in four parts, each part covering a
specific property to facilitate the use of this standard.
Part II covers the
determination of transverse strength of natural building’stones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this
standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall
be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard (Part II) lays down the procedure for the determination of
transverse strength of natural building stones used for constructional purposes.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2. SELECTION
OF SAMPLES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The sample shall be selected to represent a true average of the type or
grade of stone under consideration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The sample shall be selected from the quarried scone or taken from the
natural rock, as described in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and shall be of adequate size to
permit the preparation of the requisite number of test pieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1
Stones from Ledges or Quarries -
The ledge or quarry face of the stone
shall be inspected to determine any variation in different strata.
Differences
in colour, texture and structure shall be observed.
Separate
samples of
stone weighing at least 25 kg each of the unweathered specimens shall be
obtained from all strata that appear  to  vary in colour, texture and structure.
Pieces that have been damaged by blasting, driving wedges, heating, etc, shall
not be included in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Field Stone and Boulders -A
detailed inspection of the stone and
boulders over the area shall be made‘where the supply is to be obtained. The
different. kinds of stones and their condition at various quarry sites shall be
recorded.
Separate samples for each class of stone that would be considered
for use in construction as indicated by visual inspection shall be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 When perceptible variations occur in the quality of rock, as many samples
as are necessary for determining the range in properties shall be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  TEST PIECES
AND CONDITIONING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Test pieces shall be made from samples selected in accordance with 2 and
shall be blocks of size 20  x  5  x 5  cm.
The test pieces shall be measured at
the centre section.
The,width shall be measured to.the nearest 0.2 mm and
the thickness shall be taken as the average of three measurements
to the
nearest O-2 mm, one taken at centre and the’other two near edges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The direction of the rift shall be carefully marked on each test piece after
finishing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Three test pieces shall be usedfor conducting the test in each of the condi-
tions mentioned in’3.3.1 and 3.3.2 separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1
The test ‘pieces shall be immersed in water maintained
at 20 to
30°C for 72 h before testing and shall be tested in saturated,condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.2
The test pieces shall also be tested in dry condition and shall be dried
in an oven at 105+5%
for 24 h and cooled in a desiccator to room tempe-
rature (20 to  30°C).<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Each
test piece to be
tested shall be evenly supported upon two
self-aligning: bearers  (A  and  B  in Fig. 1) 4 cm in diameter, the distance between
the centres of bearers being 15 cm.
Bearer  A  is supported horizontally on
two bearer screws (C in Fig. l), which carry hardened steel balls (D in Fig. 1)
concentric
with the bearer.
Bearer  B  is supported on one such bearer
screw and ball.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The load shall then be applied centrally at a uniform rate of 200 kg/min
through a third bearer (E in Fig. I), also 4 cm in diameter,
placed mid.
Way between the supports upon the upper surface of the specimen (Sin Fig. 1)
and parallel
to the supports.
The length of all bearers shall exceed the
maximum width of the specimen to be tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  EVALUATION
AND REPORT
OF TEST RiESULTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The transverse strength of the specimen tested shall be calculated

average depth in cm of the test piece at the mid section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  The average of all the three results (separately for saturated and dry
condition) shall be taken forthe purpose of determining transverse strength of
the sample.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 In case any specimen gives  a  value of as much as 15 percent below
the average, it may be examined for defects and if the low value appears to
be due to a flaw or faulty test piece, a-fresh test shall be made and the average
of three tests taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 The transverse strength of the sample shall be expressed in kg/ems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
