FOR SEISMIC
INSTRUMENTATION FOR RIVER
VALLEY PROJECTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 17 November
1968,
after the draft
finalized
by
the
Earthquake
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Evaluation
of seismic status of faults and thursts and collection and
maintenance
of seismological
data both in preconstruction
as well as
postconstruction
stages of a river valley project are of vital importance
because
of safety reasons.
In
addition
to permanent
installation
of
instruments within the dam and appurtenant structures and in the surround-
ing areas,
the
study
of microtremors
and predominant
period
with
temporary instruments
as given in detail under 3 will be supplementary
and may be regarded as a part of the site investigations
for selecting the
best suitable type of foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
The recommendations
given in this standard may, however, also
be used for investigation of seismicity of site for any project besides river
valley projects, if the situation and the magnifude of the project justifies so.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the fmal
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in
the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This
standard
covers recommendations
for (a) instrumentation
for
investigation
of seismicity,
(b) study of microtremors
and predominant
period of a dam site and  (c)  permanent
installation
of instruments in the
dam and appurtenant structures and in the surrounding areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Distribution
of Earthquake
Epicentres
in the Vicinity
of
the
Site (,Particularly
of Those
Which
are not Felt by People ) -
Five
observatories
shall he set up around
the site, of which at least one shall be
the main
otservatory
and the other
subsidiary
observatories.
The
main
observatory
shall
be located
near
the
proposed
site
and the subsidiary
observatories
around
it.
The
spacing
of observatories
shall not exceed
70 km.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1
The siting of the main and subsidiary
observatories
will, holvever,
require
consideration
of the geological
structures
and soil characteristics
of
the area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2
It is desirable
that this set up of observatories
as recommended
in 2.1 should be installed
at least 6ve years before
the design stage of the
project.
The setting up of a comprehensive
network
requires
some time
before it becomes
fully operative.
In order
to meet
the demands
for an
early
commencement
for the recording
of the
seismic
events,
provision
should be made for an eariy setting up of the main observatory,
so that the
general
level of seismicity
at a project site may be monitored
ahead
of the
installation
of the fall network.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.3
The instrument

the observatories
sha!l be so constructed
that
the
diurnal

inside
the room are not more
than 5°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Accelerographs
with specifications same as those under 2.23
shall be
installed in the dam at the base ( in gallary near the foundation ) and at
the top of the dam.
If the height of the dam exceeds 100 m, one accelero-
graph shall also be installed near the mid-height of the dam. The accelero-
graph locations may be suitably selected to avoid the background
seismic
noise created
due to the vibrations
originating
from the appurtenant
works of the dam.

with damping nearly critical and shall be actuated by the accelerograph
starting mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Dynamic water pressure gauges may be installed on the up stream
face of the dam ( below the minimum draw down level and above the silt

The dynamic pressure measuring range of the gauges shall not be
less than the corresponding hydrostatic head.

The nature of this protection
For example, if the observatory is

drift with the other rooms in front of it.
In such a construction, the vault
