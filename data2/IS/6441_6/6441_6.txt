FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part
VI)
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 22 March
1973, after
the draft finalized
by the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Autoclaved
cellular
concrete
is a class of material,
which
has  .  been
developed
commercially
abroad
and
is in the process
of development
in
this country
also.
A series of Indian
Standards
on cellular
concrete
is
being formulated
so as to provide
guidance
in obtaining
reliable
products
in auroclaved
celiular
concrete.
The Sectional
Committee
has considered
it desirable
to issue a standard
for the methods
of test for autoclnvcd
cellu-
lar concrete
products
for the guidance
of manufacturers
and users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4  For convenience
of reference,
‘  Indian
Standard

of
test
for

In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,
it shall be dane in accordance with IS : 2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard ( Part VI ) covers the method of test for the strength,
deformation
and
cracking
( under
short
duration
load ) af flexural
members such as floor or roof slabs of cellular concrete subject to bending.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Z TEST SPECIMEN<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Size of the Specimen -
The test specimen. shall be the full size
member as to be actually used in construction
satisfying the requirements
of the relevant
Indian Standard
(or the requirements
specified by the
manufacturer
) in respect of shape and dimensions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Condition
of the Test Specimen<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  Moisture
Content -The
moisture content of the concrete
during
the test should be indicated
and should be not less than 10 percent,by
weight, when determined in accordance with IS  :  6441 ( Part I )-1972t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Te&fierature
of Specimen -
The
temperature
of the concrete shall
not be materially
different from the ambient
temperature
in which it is
being tested and  in  any case not less than 0°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. TEST ARRANGEMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The member
to be tested shall be simply supported
at the ends.
The supports shall
consist of 25-mm
thick horizontal
mild steel plates
bedded on rigid supports of steel  or  concrete. The ends of the member shall
be fully in contact
with the steel plate
over the whole width
of the
member.
The bearing width and the span used for the test shall be the
same as those indicated
by the manufacturer
and to be actually used in
construction practice ( see Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

packing,
not less than 12 mm thick and of the same
plan dimensions as the steel pIatens.
The  packing
shaU be placed
between
each

platen and the top of the member.
The span shall be
taken as the distance between the centms of the bearing
( see Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The

PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Zero for
the
deflection
measurements
shatl be
taken
immediately
after  the  member
had been placed  in  position.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  The
loading
apparatus
shall then be fixed and the load
applied
in
Stages.
At the end of this stage the load, including
the self weight of the
m~mber
and
the weight
of the Ioading apparatus,
shall be equal
to the
design dead load for the member.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1
After
an
interval
of
about
5
min
loading
shall
be
increased
gradually
until
the load
equals
the combined
dead and design
live loads
for the member.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2,2
After a further
intcrwd of about 5  min  loading shall be increased
at-adually until the Ioad equals the combined
dead
and twice the design
five loads.
At
that load, the deflection shall be noted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3
After a further interval of about 5 min loading shail bc increased
at a rate of about + of the design live load per minute until failure occurs
or the mid-span
d~fkction
is 1/60 of the span, M$hichever is earlier.
If
the member
is not tested  [o  failure: then a hypothetical
failure load shall
be assumed w be Lhat Ioad for wh]ch the red-span
deflection
is 1/60 of
the span.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4
Defection
and strain measurements ( see 5.3 ) shall be
recorded
at the beginning
and where applicable
at the end of each of the loading
stages; intermediate measurements may also be made if required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
