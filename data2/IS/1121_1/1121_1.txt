F O R E W O R D
0.1  This Indian Standard (Part I) (First Revision) was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 1 October 1974, after the draft
finalized by the Stones Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2  Building stones are available in large quantity in various parts of
the country and to choose and utilize them for their satisfactory
performance, it is necessary to know the various strength properties
determined according to standard procedure. This standard has,
therefore, been formulated to cover the standard method for
determining the strength properties of various stones. This standard
covering compressive, transverse and shear strength properties of
building stones was published in 1957 and is being revised based on
the actual use of it in the past 17 years and the experience gained in
testing of building stones for these properties in the various research
laboratories of this country. In this revision, property of tensile
strength has also been added, which is also important for assessing the
suitability of stone.
0.2.1  This standard is now being issued in four parts, each part
covering a specific property to facilitate the use of this standard. Part I
covers the determination of compressive strength of natural building
stones.
0.3  This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (September 1980).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.
0.4  In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be
rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS : 2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard (Part I) lays down the procedure for the
determination of compressive strength of natural building stones used
for constructional purposes.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2. SELECTION OF SAMPLES
2.1  The sample shall be selected to represent a true average of the type
or grade of stone under consideration.
2.2  The sample shall be selected from the quarried stone or taken from
the natural rock, as described in  2.2.1  and  2.2.2  and shall be of
adequate size to permit the preparation of the requisite number of test
pieces.
2.2.1  Stones from Ledges or Quarries  — The ledge or quarry face of the
stone shall be inspected to determine any variation in different strata.
Differences in colour, texture and structure shall be observed.
Separate samples of stone weighing at least 25 kg each of the
unweathered specimens shall be obtained from all strata that appear
to vary in colour, texture and structure. Pieces that have been
damaged by blasting, driving wedges, heating, etc, shall not be
included in the sample.
2.2.2  Field Stone and Boulders  — A detailed inspection of the stone
and boulders over the area shall be made where the supply is to be
obtained. The different kinds of stones and their conditions at various
quarry sites shall be recorded. Separate samples for each class of stone
that would be considered for use in construction as indicated by visual
inspection shall be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. TEST PIECES AND CONDITIONING
3.1  Test pieces shall be made from samples selected in accordance
with  2  and shall be in the form of cubes or cylinders. They shall be cut
or drilled from the samples. The diameter or lateral dimension
(distance between opposite vertical faces) of a test piece shall not be
less than 50 mm and the ratio of height to diameter or lateral
dimension shall not be less than 1:1 (  see also   6.2  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — Test pieces prepared out of broken beams in the transverse test [ see
IS : 1121 (Part II)-1974*] may also be used.
3.1.2  The load-bearing surfaces shall be finished to as nearly true,
parallel and perpendicular planes as possible by using rock cutting
saws, grinding polishing wheels or abrasive powder. The dimensions of
the faces under loading shall be measured to the nearest 0.2 mm.
3.1.3  The load-bearing surfaces and the direction of the rift shall be
carefully marked on each test piece after finishing.
3.1.4  Three test pieces shall be used for conducting the test in each of
the conditions mentioned in  3.1.4.1  and  3.1.4.2 . In each of these
conditions, separate tests shall be made for the specimen when the
load is parallel to the rift and perpendicular to the rift. In all twelve
test pieces shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1121 (Part I) - 1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.4.1  The test pieces shall be immersed in water maintained at 20 to
30°C for 72 h before testing and shall be tested in saturated condition.
3.1.4.2  The test pieces shall also be tested in a dry condition and shall
be dried in an oven at 105 ± 5°C for 24 h and cooled in a desiccator to
room temperature (20 to 30°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. APPARATUS
4.1  A testing machine of sufficient capacity for the tests and capable of
applying load at the specified rate shall be used. The machine shall be
equipped with two steel bearing plates with hardened faces. One of the
plates (preferably the one that normally bears on the upper surface of
the test pieces) shall be fitted with a ball seating in the form of a
portion of a sphere, the centre of which coincides with the central point
of the face of the plate. The other compression plate shall be plain rigid
bearing block. The bearing faces of both plates shall be preferably
larger than the nominal size of the test piece to which the load is
applied. The bearing surface of the plates when new, shall not depart
from a plane by more than 0.012 5 mm at any point. The movable
portion of spherically seated compression plate shall be held on the
spherical seat, but the design shall be such that it is possible to rotate
the bearing face freely and tilt it through small angles in any direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. PROCEDURE
5.1  The load shall be applied without shock and increased
continuously at a rate of approximately 140 kg/cm 2  of the area per
minute until the resistance of the test piece to the increasing load
breaks down and no greater load is sustained. The maximum load
applied to the test piece shall be recorded and the appearance of the
stone and any unusual features in the type of failure shall be noted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. EVALUATION AND REPORT OF TEST RESULTS
6.1  The maximum load in kg supported by the test piece before failure
occurs, divided by the area of the bearing face of the specimen in cm 2
shall be taken as the compressive strength of the specimen.
6.2  When the ratio of height to diameter (or lateral dimension) differs
from unity by 25 percent or more, the result shall be calculated to that
standard test piece as follows :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C p

h
÷

C c  =

C p  =
compressive strength of the specimen having a height greater
than the diameter or lateral dimension,
b
=
