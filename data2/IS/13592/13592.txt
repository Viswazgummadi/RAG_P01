<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by
the Plastic Pipes and Fittings Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unplasticized
PVC pipes are widely used in practically
all types of piping systems.
This standard
has been formulated
with a view to provide guidelines in the manufacture
and use of UPVC pipes
for soil and waste discharge system including ventilation
and rainwater
for inside buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this siandard, assistance has been derived from the following IS0 Standards:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) IS0 3633  :  1991 Unplasticized
polyvinyl chloride
( PVC-U ) pipes and fittings for soil and
waste discharge ( low and high temperature
) systems inside buildings + Specification<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) IS0 8283  :  1991 Plastic

for
discharge systems inside buildings  :  Part 1 Unplasticized
polyvinyl

( PVC-U ) and
chlorinated
polyvinyl

( PVC-C ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test
or analysis,
shall
be
rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values ( revised )‘.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the

only those
additives that are needed to facilitate the manu-
facture of sound pipes of good surface finish,

of use.
None
of these additives
shall
be used separately
or together
in quantities
sufficient
to -constitute
a toxic hazard,
impair
