<<PARAGRAPH>>Hot-Dip Sprayed and Diffusion Coatings Sectional Committee, SMDC 28<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 22 December 1988, after
the draft finalized by the Hot-Dip Sprayed and Diffusion Coatings Sectional Committee had been
approved by the Structural and Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion of steel reinforcement in RCC constructions is assuming alarming proportions. In
desperate efforts to restore structures, very often temporary repair methods are adopted. One of
the reliable methods of long term measures which could prevent corrosion of concrete
reinforcement bars totally, is through giving a hot dip galvanized zinc coating on these bars. The
use of galvanized bars is justified fully both technically and economically in highly corrosive areas,
such as, in severe marine corrosion belts and areas suffering from industrial pollution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Keeping in view the likely demand for hot-dip galvanized concrete reinforcement bars in our
country, it was felt necessary to prepare this standard. It is hoped that this standard specification
will help the users to procure galvanized steel bars of acceptable quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, considerable assistance has been derived from ASTM
767M-1985 ‘Zinc coated (galvanized) steel bars for concrete reinforcement’, issued by the American
Society for Testing and Materials, USA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (April 2001). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the results of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  rev i sed  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1  The coating class to be selected depends on the
aggressiveness of the surrounding area, that is,
chemical plants, marine areas, or if the water/aggregate
used contains chemical salts, the class of coating shall
be subject to mutual consent between the galvanizer
and the end user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The concrete reinforcement steel bars shall
conform to IS 2062 : 1984, IS 1786 : 1985 and
IS 432 (Part 1) : 1982.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Quality of Zinc<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2  The nominal diameter of a deformed bar is equivalent
to that of a plain round bar having the same mass per
metre as the deformed bar. Coating masses shown in
Table 1 are based on as assumed area ratio 1.2 : 1
(actual to nominal surface area of the reinforcing bar).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Zinc used for galvanizing shall conform to any
of the grades specified in IS 209 : 1992 Zinc
ingot or IS 13229 : 1991 Zinc for galvanizing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 12594 : 1988<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Retest<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Freedom from Defects
The zinc coating shall have no bare spots. The
coating shall be free of blisters, flux spots or
inclusions, dross and acid or black spots (  see
IS 2629 : 1986 ). Bars that stick together after
galvanizing shall be rejected. The presence of
tears or sharp spikes which make the bar
hazardous to handle shall be the cause for
rejection.
5.3 Adhesion of Galvanized Coating
The coating shall be adherent and it shall not
be affected/damaged by any reasonable process
of handling or erection.
5.4 Chromating
The galvanized coating shall be chromate
treated to preclude a reaction between the bars
and fresh portland cement paste. Proprietary
chromating solutions of equivalent strength
may also be used in place of the generic
chemical treatment.
5.4.1  In case the chromate treatment is
performed immediately after galvanizing, it
may
be accomplished
by quenching the
reinforcement bars in a solution containing at
least 0.2 percent by mass of sodium dichromate
in water (2 kg/m 3   ) or by quench chromating in
a minimum of 0.2 percent chromic acid
solution.
The
galvanized
bars
shall
be
immersed in the solution at a temperature of at
least 32°C for at least 20s.
5.4.2  In case the galvanized bars are at
ambient temperature, the chromate treatment
shall be the same as prescribed in  5.4.1  except
that 0.5-1.0 percent concentration of sulphuric
acid shall be added as an activator of the
chromate solution. In this case, there is no
temperature requirement for the activated
chromate solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the average coating mass fails to meet the
requirements of Table 1, six additional random
samples from the lot shall be taken. If the
average coating mass of these six samples
conforms to the requirements of Table 1, the lot
shall be accepted. No individual zinc coating
mass of the test sample shall vary 10 percent
less than the mass specified in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 FABRICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Fabrication Before Galvanizing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case the bars are bent cold prior to
galvanizing, these shall be fabricated to a bend
diameter equal to or greater than 6  d  for bar
sizes up to 20 mm and 8  d  for bar sizes larger
than 20 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.1  The bar may be cold bent closer then
specified in  7.1  if stress relieved at a
temperature from 480 to 560°C for 1 h per
25 mm of bar diameter.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Fabrication After Galvanizing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case galvanizing is performed before
bending, some cracking and flaking of the
galvanized coating in the area of the bend shall
not be the cause of rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1  Damage to the coating as a result of
fabrication is not subject to repair unless
desired in accordance with supplementary
requirement  see   8 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The tendency for cracking of the zinc coating
increases with bar diameter and with severity and rate
of bending.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 SUPPLEMENTARY REQUIREMENTS
OF GALVANIZED COATING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bars shall be supplied with the following
supplementary requirements when specified by
the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 SAMPLING AND CRITERIA FOR
CONFORMITY
6.1 Number of Tests
Unless otherwise agreed to, three percent
random samples subject to a minimum of three
samples from each lot shall be drawn and
tested for ascertaining the conformity of
galvanized coating on concrete reinforcement
bars. The average coating mass of these tests
shall conform to the requirement of Table 1. No
individual zinc coating mass of the test sample
shall vary 10 percent less than the mass
specified in Table 1.
6.1.1   Lot
All bars of one size furnished to the same
hot-rolled reinforcing bar specification that
have
been
galvanized
within
a
single
production shift, from one bath, shall be
grouped together to constitute a lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Sheared Ends<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sheared ends shall be coated with a zinc-rich
formulation and the dried film shall have 92-95
percent zinc content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Damaged Coating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Damage of the coating as a result of bending
shall be repaired with zinc-rich formulation
and the dried film shall have 92-95 percent zinc
content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9 INSPECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The material shall be inspected at the
galvanizer’s plant prior to despatch. However,
if specified, the purchaser may make the tests
which govern the acceptance or the rejection of
the materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
