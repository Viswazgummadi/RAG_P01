FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Part 7 ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on
14 December
1984,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Measurement
of Works
of River
Valley Projects Sectional Committee<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.  had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 In the measurement
of quantities
in construction
of river
valley
projects a large diversity of methods exists at present according to local
practices.
This
lack
of
uniformity
creates
complication
regarding
measurements
and payments.
This
standard is intended to provide a
uniform basis for measurement
of joints in the construction of river valley
projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the result of measurements
made in accordance with this
standard,
if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded off,
it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
covers
the method
of measurement
of joints
and
connected auxiliary
works in river valley projects, such as dams, hydraulic
structures, canals and power houses.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Clabbing
of
Items
-
Items
may be clubbed
together provided
that break-up of clubbed items is on the basis of detailed
descriptions
of
items as sTated in this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Booking
of
Dimensions
-
In booking dimensions,
the order shall
he consistent
and generally
in the sequence of length, breadth or width
and height or depth or thickness.<<HEADING_END>>

system, as fixed in place, unless otherwise stated herein, as given below:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Dimensions shall be measured to the nearest 0.01 m; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Weight shall be worked out to the nearest 0’01 kg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  Description
of Items-Description
