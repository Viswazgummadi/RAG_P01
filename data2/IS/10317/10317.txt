<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 October
1582, after the draft finalized by the Water
Requirements
for Crops Sectional Committee had been approved
by the
Agricultural
and Food Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Irrigation
water plays a vital role in many soil process.
The manner
in which water is distributed
within the soil mass depends to a
consider
able extent on the individual soil properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In rating land for irrigation
( agriculture
), first attention
should be
given to physical
condition
which make the land adoptable
to careful
control of moisture.
Freedom from undesirable
chemical
characteristics
receives second consideration
and third, the soil properties
which
effect
the inherent productivity
are to be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 It is hoped, that this guide would help in deciding the method of
irrigation,
suitable crops for the area in relation to efficient
utilization of
water.
This
would
also be useful
to planners
in selecting
site for
irrigation
projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expres-
sing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
gives
guidelines
for evaluation
of soil properties in
relation to irrigation.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Texture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1  Texture
is an expression to indicate the coarseness or fineness of
the soil as determined
by the relative
proportion
of the various
sized
primary
particles
in the soil mass.
It is one of the fundamental
and
permanent
characteristics
that has direct bearing
on structure,
porosity
adhesion
and consistency.
Sandy soils of open characters
possess good
drainage
and aeration and are usually
loose and friable
and easy to
handle
in tillage
operation.
Clayey
and silty soils owing to have large
surface area possess high absorbtive
and retention
capacity
for moisture.
They
usually
have
fine pores,
are moderate
to poor in drainage and
aeration and are relatively
difficult
to handle
for cultivation
purpose.
Proforma

land

has also been
mentioned

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1  Infiltration
is the downward
entry of
water into the soil.
It is
the maximum
rate at which
a soil in a given condition
at given time can
absorb
rain or irrigation
water.
It is classified
as below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C/ass
Basic Ingilteration Rate

<<HEADING level=3>>2.3.2
Infiltration is a dynamic and quite variable character
of  soil  and
can be fairly well controlled by management
practices.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.4 Permeability<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.1  Permeability
are of two types (i) Qualitative
(ii) Quantitative.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.1.1
Qualitative
-
The quality or state of porous medium relative
to the readyness with which such a medium conducts or transmit fluids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.1.2
Quantitative
-
The
specific
properties
governing
the rate or
readyness with which a porous medium
transmits
fluid under
standard
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.2
The permeability
depends upon pore size distribution
of the soil.
Texture and structure
of a soil often studred in field
for qualitative
assessment
of permeability.
Concentration
and composition
of salts
dissolved in irrigation
water also effect the permeability
of soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.3
The degree of permeability
may be distinguished
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Permeability
Class
mm/hour<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Very slow
Less than 1.2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is not applicable
to deep black
soil
because of their unique properties.
Deep black soils ( vertisols ) which
are inherently slowly permeable
due to expanding 2: 1 Iattic type minerals
do not qualify for irrigability
class-A, they  would  qualify for B, C & D
Class.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:10317 - 1982<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5 Drainage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.1  The processes
of discharge
of water from an area of soil by sheet
or  stream;
flow ( surface
drainage
) and
removal
of excess
water
from
within
soil
by
downward
flow through
the soil ( internal
drainage
).
Generally
speaking
coarse texture
soil drain better than
fine texture
soil.
Drainage
depends
directly
on permeability
of soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.2
Standards
followed for drainage
for irrigability
class are as below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A and B Class
:
Lower
subsoil
is at least moderately
permeable
or permeable
layer of at least 6 inch thickness
occurs
immediately
below
soil but within
10
feet ( sand and gravels
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C and D Class
:
Moderately
permeable
subsoil
or other
perme-
able layer
of at least
6 inch
thickness
occurs
with depth of 10 metres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Soil Temperature<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.1  Soil
temperature
has
extensive
effect on
soil
properties
and
behaviour.
The water holding
capacity
of soil decreases
slightly
with
rise in temperature.
Soil moisture
is the most vital controlling
factor
in
soil temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
