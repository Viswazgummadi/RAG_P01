F O R E W O R D
0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 10 November 1959, after the draft finalized by the Cement
and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Building
Division Council.
0.2  Testing plays an important role in controlling the quality of cement
concrete work. Systematic testing of the raw materials, the fresh
concrete and the hardened concrete is an inseparable part of any quality
control programme for concrete which helps to achieve higher efficiency
of the materials used and greater assurance of the performance of the
concrete in regard to both strength and durability. The test methods
used should be simple, direct and convenient to apply. This standard has
been prepared with this object in view and provides a guide to the
determination of compressive strength, flexural strength and modulus of
elasticity of concrete. Sampling and analysis of concrete have been
covered separately in IS : 1199-1959 Methods of Sampling and Analysis
of Concrete.
0.3  The Sectional Committee responsible for the preparation of this
standard has taken into consideration the views of concrete specialists,
testing authorities, consumers and technologists and has related the
standard to the practices followed in the country in this field. The need
for international co-ordination between standards prevailing in different
countries of the world has also been recognized. These considerations led
the Sectional Committee to derive assistance from the published
standards and publications of the following organizations:

0.4  The Indian Standard Methods of Sampling and Analysis of Concrete
(IS : 1199-1959) is a necessary adjunct to this standard. Besides, this
standard requires reference to the following Indian Standards:

0.4.1  Wherever a reference to any standard mentioned in  0.4 , except
IS : 460-1953, appears in this standard, it shall be taken as a reference
to the latest version of the standard.
0.5  In pursuance of the decision of the Government of India to introduce
a uniform system of weights and measures throughout the country
based on the metric system, in this standard, all dimensions and values
have been given in metric units only. It is hoped that this step will
facilitate the change-over to the metric system by the industry more
expeditiously.
0.6  This edition 1.2 incorporates Amendment No. 2 (July 1991). Side bar
indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of the
amendment.
0.7  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with *IS : 2-1949 Rules for Rounding Off Numerical Values.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value
should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.
0.8  This standard is intended chiefly to cover the technical provisions
relating to the testing of concrete, and it does not include all the
necessary provisions of a contract.
1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard covers tests for the determination of compressive
strength, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity of cement concrete.
2. MAKING AND CURING COMPRESSION TEST SPECIMENS IN
THE LABORATORY
2.1  This clause specifies the procedure for making and curing
compression test specimens of concrete in the laboratory where accurate
control of the quantities of materials and test conditions are possible and
where the maximum nominal size of aggregate does not exceed 38 mm.
The method is specially applicable to the making of preliminary
compression tests to ascertain the suitability of the available materials
or to determine suitable mix proportions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 516 - 1959<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Sampling of Materials  — Representative samples of the materials
of concrete for use in the particular concrete construction work shall be
obtained by careful sampling. Test samples of cement shall be made up
of a small portion taken from each of a number of bags on the site. Test
samples of aggregate shall be taken from larger lots by quartering.
2.3 Preparation of Materials  — All materials shall be brought to
room temperature, preferably 27° ± 3°C before commencing the tests.
The cement samples, on arrival at the laboratory, shall be thoroughly
mixed dry either by hand or in a suitable mixer in such a manner as to
ensure the greatest possible blending and uniformity in the material,
care being taken to avoid the intrusion of foreign matter. The cement
shall then be stored in a dry place, preferably in air-tight metal
containers.
Samples of aggregates for each batch of concrete shall be of the desired
grading and shall be in an air-dried condition. In general, the aggregate
shall be separated into fine and coarse fractions and recombined for each
concrete batch in such a manner as to produce the desired grading. IS
Sieve 480 shall be normally used for separating the fine and coarse
fractions, but where special gradings are being investigated, both fine
and coarse fractions shall be further separated into different sizes.
2.4 Proportioning  — The proportions of the materials, including
water, in concrete mixes used for determining the suitability of the
materials available, shall be similar in all respects to those to be
employed in the work. Where the proportions of the ingredients of the
concrete as used on the site are to be specified by volume, they shall be
calculated from the proportions by weight used in the test cubes and the
unit weights of the materials.
2.5 Weighing  — The quantities of cement, each size of aggregate, and
water for each batch shall be determined by weight, to an accuracy of 0.1
percent of the total weight of the batch.
2.6 Mixing Concrete  — The concrete shall be mixed by hand, or
preferably, in a laboratory batch mixer, in such a manner as to avoid loss
of water or other materials. Each batch of concrete shall be of such a size
as to leave about 10 percent excess after moulding the desired number of
test specimens.
2.6.1   Machine Mixing —  When the mixing drum is charged by a power
loader, all the mixing water shall be introduced into the drum before the
solid materials; the skip shall be loaded with about one-half of the coarse
aggregate, then with the fine aggregate, then with the cement and
finally with the remaining coarse aggregate on top. (If all-in-aggregate is
used, the skip shall be loaded first with about one-half of the aggregate,
then with the cement and finally with the remaining aggregate on top.)
Where the mixing drum is hand-loaded it shall be charged with the dry
materials in a similar manner, and the water shall be added
immediately before the rotation of the drum is started. The period of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 516 - 1959<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>mixing shall be not less than 2 minutes after all the materials are in the
drum, and shall continue till the resulting concrete is uniform in
appearance. When using pan mixers, the concrete shall be heaped
together before sampling.
2.6.2  Hand Mixing —  The concrete batch shall be mixed on a
water-tight, non-absorbent platform with a shovel, trowel or similar
suitable implement, using the following procedure:
a) The cement and fine aggregate shall be mixed dry until the
mixture is thoroughly blended and is uniform in colour,
b) The coarse aggregate shall then be added and mixed with the
cement and fine aggregate until the coarse aggregate is uniformly
distributed throughout the batch, and
c) The water shall then be added and the entire batch mixed until the
concrete appears to be homogeneous and has the desired
consistency. If repeated mixing is necessary, because of the
addition of water in increments while adjusting the consistency,
the batch shall be discarded and a fresh batch made without
interrupting the mixing to make trial consistency tests.
2.7 Workability  — Each batch of concrete shall be tested for
consistency immediately after mixing, by one of the methods described
in IS : 1199-1959. Provided that care is taken to ensure that no water or
other material is lost, the concrete used for the consistency tests may be
remixed with the remainder of batch before making the test specimens.
The period of re-mixing shall be as short as possible yet sufficient to
produce a homogeneous mass.
2.8 Size of Test Specimens  — Test specimens cubical in shape shall
be 15 × 15 × 15 cm. If the largest nominal size of the aggregate does not
exceed 2 cm, 10 cm cubes may be used as an alternative. Cylindrical test
specimens shall have a length equal to twice the diameter. They shall be
15 cm in diameter and 30 cm long. Smaller test specimens shall have a
ratio of diameter of specimen to maximum size of aggregate of not less
than 3 to 1, except that the diameter of the specimen shall be not less
than 7.5 cm for mixtures containing aggregate more than 5 percent of
which is retained on IS Sieve 480.
2.9 Moulds
2.9.1   Cube Moulds —  The mould shall be of 150 mm size conforming to
IS : 10086-1982*.
2.9.1.1  In assembling the mould for use, the joints between the sections
of mould shall be thinly coated with mould oil and a similar coating of
mould oil shall be applied between the contact surfaces of the bottom of
the mould and the base plate in order to ensure that no water escapes
during the filling. The interior surfaces of the assembled mould shall be
thinly coated with mould oil to prevent adhesion of the concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Specification for moulds for use in tests of cement and concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 516 - 1959<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.9.2   Cylinders —  The cylindrical mould shall be of 150 mm diameter
and 300 mm height conforming to IS : 10086-1982*. The mould and base
plate shall be coated with a thin film of mould oil before use, in order to
prevent adhesion of the concrete.
2.9.3   Tamping Bar —  The tamping bar shall conform to  6.1 (a) of
IS : 10086-1982*.
2.10 Compacting  — The test specimens shall be made as soon as
practicable after mixing, and in such a way as to produce full compaction
of the concrete with neither segregation nor excessive laitance. The
concrete shall be filled into the mould in layers approximately 5 cm
deep. In placing each scoopful of concrete, the scoop shall be moved
around the top edge of the mould as the concrete slides from it, in order
to ensure a symmetrical distribution of the concrete within the mould.
Each layer shall be compacted either by hand or by vibration as
described below (  see   2.10.1   and   2.10.2  ). After the top layer has been
compacted, the surface of the concrete shall be finished level with the top
of the mould, using a trowel, and covered with a glass or metal plate to
prevent evaporation.
2.10.1  Compacting by Hand —  When compacting by hand, the standard
tamping bar shall be used and the strokes of the bar shall be distributed
in a uniform manner over the cross-section of the mould. The number of
strokes per layer required to produce specified conditions will vary
according to the type of concrete. For cubical specimens, in no case shall
the concrete be subjected to less than 35 strokes per layer for 15 cm
cubes or 25 strokes per layer for 10 cm cubes. For cylindrical specimens,
the number of strokes shall not be less than thirty per layer. The strokes
shall penetrate into the underlying layer and the bottom layer shall be
rodded throughout its depth. Where voids are left by the tamping bar,
the sides of the mould shall be tapped to close the voids.
2.10.2  Compacting by Vibration —  When compacting by vibration, each
layer shall be vibrated by means of an electric or pneumatic hammer or
vibrator or by means of a suitable vibrating table until the specified
condition is attained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — The mode and quantum of vibration of the laboratory specimen shall be as
nearly the same as those adopted in actual concreting operations.
2.11 Capping Specimens  — The ends of all cylindrical test specimens
that are not plane within 0.05 mm shall be capped. Capped surfaces
shall not depart from a plane by more than 0.05 mm and shall be
approximately at right angles to the axis of the specimens. The
planeness of the cap shall be checked by means of a straight edge and
feeler gauge, making a minimum of three measurements on different
diameters. Caps shall be made as thin as practicable and shall not flow
or fracture when the specimen is tested. Capping shall be carried out
according to one of the following methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 516 - 1959<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.11.1  Neat Cement —  Test cylinders may be capped with a thin layer of
stiff, neat Portland cement paste after the concrete has ceased settling
in the moulds, generally for two to four hours or more after moulding.
The cap shall be formed by means of glass plate not less than 6.5 mm in
thickness or a machined metal plate not less than 13 mm in thickness
and having a minimum surface dimension at least 25 mm larger than
the diameter of the mould. It shall be worked on the cement paste until
its lower surface rests on the top of the mould. The cement for capping
shall be mixed to a stiff paste for about two to four hours before it is to be
used in order to avoid the tendency of the cap to shrink. Adhesion of
paste to the capping plate may be avoided by coating the plate with a
thin coat of oil or grease.
2.11.2  Sulphur —  Just prior to testing, the cylindrical specimens may be
capped with a sulphur mixture consisting of 2 or 3 parts sulphur to 1
part of inert filler, such as fire-clay. The specimens shall be securely held
in a special jig so that the caps formed have true plane surfaces. Care
shall be taken to ensure that the sulphur compound is not over-heated
as it will not then develop the required compressive strength. Sulphur
caps shall be allowed to harden for at least 2 hours before applying the
load.
2.11.3   Hard Plaster —  Just prior to testing, specimens may be capped
with hard plaster having a compressive strength of at least 420 kg/sq cm
in one hour. Such plasters are generally available as proprietry
material. The cap shall be formed by means of a glass plate not less than
13 mm in thickness, having a minimum surface dimension at least
25 mm larger than the diameter of the mould. The glass plate shall be
lightly coated with oil to avoid sticking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — Ordinary plaster of paris will not serve the purpose of the capping
material due to its low compressive strength.
2.11.4  As soon as possible after the concrete is mixed, a mortar shall be
gauged using a cement similar to that used in the concrete and sand
which passes IS Sieve 30 but is retained on IS Sieve 15. The mortar shall
have a water/cement ratio not higher than that of the concrete of which
the specimen is made, and shall be of a stiff consistence. If an excessively
wet mix of concrete is being tested, any free water which has collected on
the surface of the specimen shall be removed with a sponge, blotting
paper or other suitable absorbent material before the cap is formed. The
mortar shall then be applied firmly and compacted with a trowel to a
slightly convex surface above the edges of the mould, after which the
capping plate shall be pressed down on the cap with a rotary motion
until it makes complete contact with the rim of the mould. The plate
shall be left in position until the specimen is removed from the mould.
2.12 Curing  — The test specimens shall be stored in a place, free from
vibration, in moist air of at least 90 percent relative humidity and at a
temperature of 27° ± 2°C for 24 hours ± ½ hour from the time of addition
of water to the dry ingredients. After this period, the specimens shall be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 516 - 1959<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>marked and removed from the moulds and, unless required for test
within 24 hours, immediately submerged in clean, fresh water or
saturated lime solution and kept there until taken out just prior to test.
The water or solution in which the specimens are submerged shall be
renewed every seven days and shall be maintained at a temperature of
27° ± 2°C. The specimens shall not be allowed to become dry at any time
until they have been tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. MAKING AND CURING COMPRESSION TEST SPECIMEN IN
THE FIELD
3.1  This clause deals with the procedure for making and curing
compression test specimens of concrete sampled during the progress of
construction where the nominal maximum size of the aggregate does not
exceed 38 mm.
3.2  Size of test specimen, apparatus to be used and procedure to prepare
specimens shall be the same as specified in  2 .
3.3 Curing  — The test specimens shall be stored on the site at a place
free from vibration, under damp matting, sacks or other similar material
for 24 hours ± ½ hour from the time of adding the water to the other
ingredients. The temperature of the place of storage shall be within the
range of 22° to 32°C. After the period of 24 hours, they shall be marked
for later identification, removed from the moulds and, unless required
for testing within 24 hours, stored in clean water at a temperature of 24°
to 30°C until they are transported to the testing laboratory. They shall
be sent to the testing laboratory well packed in damp sand, damp sacks,
or other suitable material so as to arrive there in a damp condition not
less than 24 hours before the time of test. On arrival at the testing
laboratory, the specimens shall be stored in water at a temperature of
27° ± 2°C until the time of test. Records of the daily maximum and
minimum temperature shall be kept both during the period of the
specimens remain on the site and in the laboratory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. SECURING AND PREPARING SPECIMENS OF HARDENED
CONCRETE FOR COMPRESSION TEST
4.1  This clause deals with the procedure for securing and preparing
compression test specimens obtained from hardened concrete after the
concrete has been laid in position.
4.2  The test specimens shall be procured from hardened concrete
according to the method described in  4  of IS : 1199-1959*.
4.3  Cores to be tested for compression strength shall have ends that are
reasonably even, perpendicular to the axis and of the same diameter as
the body of the specimen. A core which, before capping, has a maximum
height of less than 95 percent of the diameter, or after capping, a height
less than its diameter shall not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_11>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 516 - 1959<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 Capping  — The ends of the specimen shall be capped before testing.
The material used for the capping shall be such that its compressive
strength is greater than that of the concrete in the core. Caps shall be
made as thin as practicable and shall not flow or fracture before the
concrete fails when the specimen is tested. The capped surfaces shall be
at right angles to the axis of the specimen and shall not depart from a
plane by more than 0.05 mm. The capping of specimens shall be carried
out as described in  2.11 .
4.5  After checking for irregularities, the core shall be placed in water at
a temperature of 24° to 30°C for 48 hours before testing. The overall
height of the specimens, with capping shall be measured to the nearest
millimetre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. TEST FOR COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE
SPECIMEN
5.1  This clause deals with the procedure for determining the
compressive strength of concrete specimens.
5.2 Apparatus
5.2.1  Testing Machine —  The testing machine may be of any reliable
type, of sufficient capacity for the tests and capable of applying the load
at the rate specified in  5.5 . The permissible error shall be not greater
than ± 2 percent of the maximum load. The testing machine shall be
equipped with two steel bearing platens with hardened faces. One of the
platens (preferably the one that normally will bear on the upper surface
of the specimen) shall be fitted with a ball seating in the form of a
portion of a sphere, the centre of which coincides with the central point
of the face of the platen. The other compression platen shall be plain
rigid bearing block. The bearing faces of both platens shall be at least as
large as, and preferably larger than the nominal size of the specimen to
which the load is applied. The bearing surface of the platens, when new,
shall not depart from a plane by more than 0.01 mm at any point, and
they shall be maintained with a permissible variation limit of 0.02 mm.
The movable portion of the spherically seated compression platen shall
be held on the spherical seat, but the design shall be such that the
bearing face can be rotated freely and tilted through small angles in any
direction.
5.3 Age at Test  — Tests shall be made at recognized ages of the test
specimens, the most usual being 7 and 28 days. Ages of 13 weeks and
one year are recommended if tests at greater ages are required. Where it
may be necessary to obtain the early strengths, tests may be made at the
ages of 24 hours ± ½ hour and 72 hours ± 2 hours. The ages shall be
calculated from the time of the addition of water to the dry ingredients.
5.4 Number of Specimens  — At least three specimens, preferably
from different batches, shall be made for testing at each selected age.
N OTE  — When a full investigation is being carried out, it is advisable for three
separate batches to be made for each given variable. An equal number of
specimens for each variable should be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_12>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 516 - 1959<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 Procedure  — Specimens stored in water shall be tested
immediately on removal from the water and while they are still in the
wet condition. Surface water and grit shall be wiped off the specimens
and any projecting fins removed. Specimens when received dry shall be
kept in water for 24 hours before they are taken for testing. The
dimensions of the specimens to the nearest 0.2 mm and their weight
shall be noted before testing.
5.5.1  Placing the Specimen in the Testing Machine —  The bearing
surfaces of the testing machine shall be wiped clean and any loose sand
or other material removed from the surfaces of the specimen which are
to be in contact with the compression platens. In the case of cubes, the
specimen shall be placed in the machine in such a manner that the load
shall be applied to opposite sides of the cubes as cast, that is, not to the
top and bottom. The axis of the specimen shall be carefully aligned with
the centre of thrust of the spherically seated platen. No packing shall be
used between the faces of the test specimen and the steel platen of the
testing machine. As the spherically seated block is brought to bear on
the specimen, the movable portion shall be rotated gently by hand so
that uniform seating may be obtained. The load shall be applied without
shock and increased continuously at a rate of approximately
140 kg/sq cm/min until the resistance of the specimen to the increasing
load breaks down and no greater load can be sustained. The maximum
load applied to the specimen shall then be recorded and the appearance
of the concrete and any unusual features in the type of failure shall be
noted.
5.6 Calculation  — The measured compressive strength of the specimen
shall be calculated by dividing the maximum load applied to the
specimen during the test by the cross-sectional area, calculated from the
mean dimensions of the section (  see also   4.5.1  of IS : 1199-1959* ) and
shall be expressed to the nearest kg per sq cm. Average of three values
shall be taken as the representative of the batch provided the individual
variation is not more than ± 15 percent of the average. Otherwise repeat
tests shall be made.
5.6.1  A correction factor according to the height/diameter ratio of
specimen after capping shall be obtained from the curve shown in Fig. 1.
The product of this correction factor and the measured compressive
strength shall be known as the corrected compressive strength, this
being the equivalent strength of a cylinder having a height/diameter
ratio of two. The equivalent cube strength of the concrete shall be
determined by multiplying the corrected cylinder strength by 5/4.
5.6.2   Report —  The following information shall be included in the report
on each test specimen:
a) identification mark,
b) date of test,

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2  Bearing Plates —  Two metal bearing plates not less than 6.5 mm
or more than 19 mm thick shall be provided. The plates shall be 10 cm
square for the beams 10 cm in depth and 15 cm square for the
beams 15 cm in depth with the surfaces machined to a permissible
variation not exceeding 0.02 mm. The distance between the opposite
edges shall be the specified size ± 0.02 mm and the angle between the
edges shall be 90° ± 0.5°.
6.3 Test Specimens  — The length of the broken portions of the beams
selected for the compression test shall be at least 5 cm greater than the
depth of the beam and the broken portions shall be free from cracks,
chipped surfaces or other obvious defects within the length to be tested.
6.4 Procedure  — During the interval between testing the specimens as
beams and testing the broken portions as cubes, the specimens shall be
stored in water at a temperature of 24° to 30°C and shall be tested
immediately on removal from the water and while still in the wet condition.
6.4.1  Placing the Specimen in the Testing Machine —  The bearing
surfaces of the testing machine and the bearing plates shall be wiped
clean and any loose sand or other material shall be removed from the
surfaces of the specimen which are to be in contact with the bearing
plates. The specimen shall be placed between the bearing plates in such
a manner that the upper bearing plate is directly over the lower plate
and the bearing plates extend at least 25 mm from each end of the
specimen. A device which ensures the proper location of the upper plate
with reference to the lower plate is shown in Fig. 2. No packing shall be
used between the faces of the specimen and the bearing plates. The
specimens shall be tested with the moulded sides in contact with the
plates. The load shall be applied without shock and increased
continuously at a rate of approximately 140 kg/sq cm/min until the
resistance of the specimen to the increasing load breaks down and no
greater load can be sustained. The maximum load applied to the
specimen shall then be recorded and the appearance of the concrete and
any unusual features in the type of failure shall be noted.
6.5 Calculation  — The equivalent cube strength of the specimen shall
be calculated by dividing the maximum load by the area of contact of the
bearing plates and shall be expressed to the nearest kg/sq cm.

8.1  This clause deals with the procedure for determining the flexural
strength of moulded concrete flexure test specimens.
8.2 Apparatus
8.2.1  The testing machine may be of any reliable type of sufficient
capacity for the tests and capable of applying the load at the rate
specified in  8.3 . The permissible errors shall be not greater than ± 0.5
percent of the applied load where a high degree of accuracy is required
and not greater than ± 1.5 percent of the applied load for commercial type
of use. The bed of the testing machine shall be provided with two steel
rollers, 38 mm in diameter, on which the specimen is to be supported,
and these rollers shall be so mounted that the distance from centre to
centre is 60 cm for 15.0 cm specimens or 40 cm for 10.0 cm specimens.
The load shall be applied through two similar rollers mounted at the
third points of the supporting span, that is, spaced at 20 or 13.3 cm
centre to centre. The load shall be divided equally between the two
loading rollers, and all rollers shall be mounted in such a manner that
the load is applied axially and without subjecting the specimen to any
torsional stresses or restraints. One suitable arrangement which
complies with these requirements is indicated in Fig. 3.
8.3 Procedure  — Test specimens stored in water at a temperature
of 24° to 30°C for 48 hours before testing, shall be tested immediately on
removal from the water whilst they are still in a wet condition. The
dimensions of each specimen shall be noted before testing. No
preparation of the surfaces is required.
8.3.1  Placing the Specimen in the Testing Machine —  The bearing
surfaces of the supporting and loading rollers shall be wiped clean, and
any loose sand or other material removed from the surfaces of the
specimen where they are to make contact with the rollers. The specimen
shall then be placed in the machine in such a manner that the load shall
be applied to the uppermost surface as cast in the mould, along two lines
spaced 20.0 or 13.3 cm apart. The axis of the specimen shall be carefully
aligned with the axis of the loading device. No packing shall be used
between the bearing surfaces of the specimen and the rollers. The load

<<PARAGRAPH>>9. DETERMINATION OF THE MODULUS OF ELASTICITY BY
MEANS OF AN EXTENSOMETER
9.1  This clause specifies the procedure for making and curing test
specimens, determining the modulus of elasticity of concrete in
compression by means of an extensometer where the maximum nominal
size of aggregate does not exceed 38 mm.
9.2 Size of Specimens  — The test specimens shall consist of concrete
cylinders 15.0 cm in diameter and 30.0 cm long. Alternately, other sizes
of cylinders or square prisms may be used provided that the
height/diameter or height/width ratio is at least 2.
9.3  Sampling, apparatus and procedure shall be as described in  2 .
9.4 Preparation of Test Specimens  — The test specimens shall be
prepared in accordance with  2  and shall be stored in water at a
temperature of 24° to 30°C for at least 48 hours before testing. At least
three specimens shall be made and tested.
9.5 Age at Test  — Normally test shall be made when the specimens
reach the age of 28 days.
9.6  In order to determine the compressive strength of the concrete, three
test specimens for compressive strength shall be made together with
each set of cylinders or prisms in accordance with  9.2 . The test
specimens for compressive strength shall be made from the same sample
of concrete as the cylinders or prisms and shall be cured and stored
under identical conditions.
9.7 Apparatus
9.7.1  Testing Machine —  The testing machine shall comply in all
respects with the requirements of  5.2.1  and in addition shall be capable
of maintaining the load at any desired value.
9.7.2  Extensometers —  Two extensometers are required each having a
gauge length of not less than 10.2 cm and not more than half the length
of the specimen. They shall be capable of measuring strains to an
accuracy of 2 × 10 –6 . Mirror extensometers of the roller or rocker type
are suitable.
9.8 Procedure  — The three test specimens for compressive strength
shall first be tested in accordance with  5  and the average compressive
strength shall be recorded. Immediately on removing the cylinder or
prism from the water and while it is still in a wet condition, the
extensometers shall be attached at the ends, or on opposite sides of the
specimen and parallel to its axis, in such a way that the gauge points are
symmetrical about the centre of the specimen and in no case are nearer
to either end of the specimen than a distance equal to half the diameter
or half the width of the specimen. The extensometers shall be fixed with
the recording points at the same end. The specimen shall be
immediately placed in the testing machine and accurately centred. The
load shall be applied continuously and without shock at a rate<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_20>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 516 - 1959<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of 140 kg/sq cm/min until an average stress of (  C  + 5 ) kg/sq cm is
reached, where  C  is one-third of the average compressive strength of the
cubes calculated to the nearest 5 kg/sq cm. The load shall be maintained
at this stress for at least one minute and shall then be reduced gradually
to an average stress of 1.5 kg/sq cm when extensometer readings shall
be taken. The load shall be applied a second time at the same rate until
an average stress of (  C  + 1.5 ) kg/sq cm is reached. The load shall be
maintained at this figure while extensometer readings are taken. The
load shall again be reduced gradually and readings again taken at
1.5 kg/sq cm. The load shall then be applied a third time and
extensometer readings taken at ten approximately equal increments of
stress up to an average stress of (  C +  1.5 ) kg/sq cm. Readings shall be
taken at each stage of loading with as little delay as possible. If the
overall strains observed on the second and third readings differ by more
than 5 percent, the loading cycle shall be repeated until the difference in
strain between consecutive readings at (  C  + 1.5 ) kg/sq cm does not
exceed 5 percent.
9.9 Calculation  — The strains at the various loads in the last two
cycles shall be calculated separately for each extensometer and the
results shall be
plotted graphically against the stress. Straight lines
shall be drawn through the points for each extensometer; the slopes of
these two lines shall be determined and from them the average value
shall be found. If the difference between the individual values is less
than 15 percent of the average value, this average value, expressed in
kg/sq cm to the nearest 1 000 kg/sq cm shall be recorded as the modulus
of elasticity of the concrete. If the difference is greater than 15 percent,
the specimen shall be re-centred in the testing machine and the test
repeated. If the difference after re-centring and testing is still greater
than 15 percent of the average value, the results of the test shall be
discarded.
9.10 Report  — The following information shall be included in the
report:
a) identification mark;
b) date of test;
c) age of specimen;
d) shape and nominal dimensions of specimen;
e) modulus of elasticity; and
f) remarks, such as number of loading cycles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10. DETERMINATION OF THE MODULUS OF ELASTICITY BY
ELECTRODYNAMIC METHOD
10.1  This clause specifies the procedure for determining the modulus of
elasticity of concrete by an electrodynamic method, namely by
measuring the natural frequency of the fundamental mode of
longitudinal vibration of concrete prisms. This is a non-destructive test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_21>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 516 - 1959<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and therefore the same specimens may subsequently be used for the
flexural strength test specified in  8 .
10.2 Specimens  — The specimens shall in all respects comply with the
requirements of  9.2 .
10.3 Apparatus  — The apparatus shall consist of the following.
10.3.1  A variable frequency oscillator with a working range up to 10 000
cycles per second, reading to an accuracy of ± 0.5 percent. A means of
varying the output power shall be incorporated, and the output power
shall be not less than 2 watts.
10.3.2  An electro-magnetic exciter unit of the moving-coil or variable
air-gap type. If the moving-coil type is used, the former and coil should
have as low an inertia as possible, the mass being not more than 0.2
percent of the mass of the specimen (the former should be of light card or
paper). A suitable type of instrument is shown in Fig. 4. If a variable
air-gap exciter unit is used, this shall be of a similar type to the pick-up
unit.
10.3.3  An electro-magnetic pick-up unit of the ordinary telephone type.
Alternatively, a piezo-electric gauge may be used, provided that its mass
is not more than 0.2 percent of the mass of the specimen.
10.3.4  An audio-frequency amplifier.
10.3.5  An amplitude indicator consisting of a voltmeter, milliammeter or
cathode ray oscilioscope.
10.3.6  A fixed clamp or support with a maximum width of
th of the length of the specimen. If a variable air-gap exciter unit is
used in conjunction with a variable air-gap pick-up, the support shall be
metallic and earthed.
10.4 Procedure  — Immediately on removal from water, except when
the specimen is less than 24 hours old, and while still in a wet condition,
the specimen shall be clamped or balanced at its centre on the fixed
support. Where a moving-coil type of exciter unit is used, the moving-coil
portion shall be fixed to the middle of one end face of the specimen as
indicated in Fig. 4. It may be fixed to the specimen by means of resin or
other suitable adhesive. The resin can conveniently be applied with an
electric soldering iron. A disk of tinfoil, of 5 cm diameter, shall be lightly
greased to ensure adhesion and placed on the centre of the other end of
the specimen, and the pick-up unit shall be placed with the diaphragm
as close as possible to the foil but the pick-up unit shall not be allowed to
touch the tinfoil or the specimen. If a variable air-gap exciter is used,
this shall be mounted in a similar manner to the pick-up, using a disk of
tinfoil. The exciter unit shall be driven by the variable frequency
oscillator and the oscillations received by the pick-up unit shall be
amplified by the audio-frequency amplifier and applied to the indicator
in such  a  manner as  to show the amplitude of the oscillations received.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency of excitation shall be varied until resonance is obtained in
the fundamental mode of longitudinal vibration. The frequency shall be
recorded as the natural frequency of the fundamental mode of
longitudinal vibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — Resonance is indicated by a maximum deflection of the indicator, but
several maxima may be obtained, and experience is necessary to know which is the
maximum required. Frequencies within ± 10 percent of the expected value, which
may be calculated from the formula given in  10.6  should be investigated. Values of
the modulus of elasticity range from 1.4 × 10 5   kg/sq cm for low-quality concretes at
early ages to 5 × 10 5   kg/sq cm for high-quality concretes at greater ages. This
represents a frequency range of 125 000/ l  cycles per second to 225 000/ l  cycles per
second, where  l  is the length of the specimen in cm. It is usually possible to obtain
resonance also at the frequency of the first harmonie which is twice the
fundamental frequency and these two conditions are normally the most well
defined.
10.5 Measurements  — The following measurements shall be made on
the specimen:
a)  Weight  — The wet specimen shall be weighed to an accuracy of 0.25
percent.
b)  Length  — The length of the specimen shall be determined to an
accuracy of ± 1 mm, the average being taken of at least four
symmetrically placed measurements.
c)  Depth and Breadth  — The average depth and breadth of the
specimen shall be determined to an accuracy of ± 0.2 mm, the
average being taken in each case of at least six measurements
spaced equally along the length of the specimen.
