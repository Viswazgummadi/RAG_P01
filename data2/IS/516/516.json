Systematic testing of the raw materials, the fresh\nconcrete and the hardened concrete is an inseparable part of any quality\ncontrol programme for concrete which helps to achieve higher efficiency\nof the materials used and greater assurance of the performance of the\nconcrete in regard to both strength and durability. The test methods\nused should be simple, direct and convenient to apply. This standard has\nbeen prepared with this object in view and provides a guide to the\ndetermination of compressive strength, flexural strength and modulus of\nelasticity of concrete. Sampling and analysis of concrete have been\ncovered separately in IS : 1199-1959 Methods of Sampling and Analysis\nof Concrete.\n0.3  The Sectional Committee responsible for the preparation of this\nstandard has taken into consideration the views of concrete specialists,\ntesting authorities, consumers and technologists and has related the\nstandard to the practices followed in the country in this field. The need\nfor international co-ordination between standards prevailing in different\ncountries of the world has also been recognized. These considerations led\nthe Sectional Committee to derive assistance from the published\nstandards and publications of the following organizations:\nB RITISH  S TANDARDS  I NSTITUTION\nA MERICAN  S OCIETY   FOR  T ESTING  M ATERIALS\nA MERICAN  C ONCRETE  I NSTITUTE\nC ANADIAN  E NGINEERING  S TANDARDS  A SSOCIATION\nR ESEARCH , D ESIGN  & S TANDARDIZATION  O RGANIZATION , M INISTRY   OF\nR AILWAYS , G OVERNMENT   OF  I NDIA\nT HE  C ONCRETE  A SSOCIATION   OF  I NDIA\n0.4  The Indian Standard Methods of Sampling and Analysis of Concrete\n(IS : 1199-1959) is a necessary adjunct to this standard.

Test samples of cement shall be made up\nof a small portion taken from each of a number of bags on the site. Test\nsamples of aggregate shall be taken from larger lots by quartering.\n2.3 Preparation of Materials  \u2014 All materials shall be brought to\nroom temperature, preferably 27\u00b0 \u00b1 3\u00b0C before commencing the tests.\nThe cement samples, on arrival at the laboratory, shall be thoroughly\nmixed dry either by hand or in a suitable mixer in such a manner as to\nensure the greatest possible blending and uniformity in the material,\ncare being taken to avoid the intrusion of foreign matter. The cement\nshall then be stored in a dry place, preferably in air-tight metal\ncontainers.\nSamples of aggregates for each batch of concrete shall be of the desired\ngrading and shall be in an air-dried condition. In general, the aggregate\nshall be separated into fine and coarse fractions and recombined for each\nconcrete batch in such a manner as to produce the desired grading. IS\nSieve 480 shall be normally used for separating the fine and coarse\nfractions, but where special gradings are being investigated, both fine\nand coarse fractions shall be further separated into different sizes.\n2.4 Proportioning  \u2014 The proportions of the materials, including\nwater, in concrete mixes used for determining the suitability of the\nmaterials available, shall be similar in all respects to those to be\nemployed in the work. Where the proportions of the ingredients of the\nconcrete as used on the site are to be specified by volume, they shall be\ncalculated from the proportions by weight used in the test cubes and the\nunit weights of the materials.\n2.5 Weighing  \u2014 The quantities of cement, each size of aggregate, and\nwater for each batch shall be determined by weight, to an accuracy of 0.1\npercent of the total weight of the batch.\n2.6 Mixing Concrete  \u2014 The concrete shall be mixed by hand, or\npreferably, in a laboratory batch mixer, in such a manner as to avoid loss\nof water or other materials. Each batch of concrete shall be of such a size\nas to leave about 10 percent excess after moulding the desired number of\ntest specimens.\n2.6.1   Machine Mixing \u2014  When the mixing drum is charged by a power\nloader, all the mixing water shall be introduced into the drum before the\nsolid materials; the skip shall be loaded with about one-half of the coarse\naggregate, then with the fine aggregate, then with the cement and\nfinally with the remaining coarse aggregate on top. (If all-in-aggregate is\nused, the skip shall be loaded first with about one-half of the aggregate,\nthen with the cement and finally with the remaining aggregate on top.)\nWhere the mixing drum is hand-loaded it shall be charged with the dry\nmaterials in a similar manner, and the water shall be added\nimmediately before the rotation of the drum is started.

Surface water and grit shall be wiped off the specimens\nand any projecting fins removed. Specimens when received dry shall be\nkept in water for 24 hours before they are taken for testing. The\ndimensions of the specimens to the nearest 0.2 mm and their weight\nshall be noted before testing.\n5.5.1  Placing the Specimen in the Testing Machine \u2014  The bearing\nsurfaces of the testing machine shall be wiped clean and any loose sand\nor other material removed from the surfaces of the specimen which are\nto be in contact with the compression platens. In the case of cubes, the\nspecimen shall be placed in the machine in such a manner that the load\nshall be applied to opposite sides of the cubes as cast, that is, not to the\ntop and bottom. The axis of the specimen shall be carefully aligned with\nthe centre of thrust of the spherically seated platen. No packing shall be\nused between the faces of the test specimen and the steel platen of the\ntesting machine. As the spherically seated block is brought to bear on\nthe specimen, the movable portion shall be rotated gently by hand so\nthat uniform seating may be obtained. The load shall be applied without\nshock and increased continuously at a rate of approximately\n140 kg/sq cm/min until the resistance of the specimen to the increasing\nload breaks down and no greater load can be sustained. The maximum\nload applied to the specimen shall then be recorded and the appearance\nof the concrete and any unusual features in the type of failure shall be\nnoted.\n5.6 Calculation  \u2014 The measured compressive strength of the specimen\nshall be calculated by dividing the maximum load applied to the\nspecimen during the test by the cross-sectional area, calculated from the\nmean dimensions of the section (  see also   4.5.1  of IS : 1199-1959* ) and\nshall be expressed to the nearest kg per sq cm. Average of three values\nshall be taken as the representative of the batch provided the individual\nvariation is not more than \u00b1 15 percent of the average. Otherwise repeat\ntests shall be made.\n5.6.1  A correction factor according to the height/diameter ratio of\nspecimen after capping shall be obtained from the curve shown in Fig. 1.\nThe product of this correction factor and the measured compressive\nstrength shall be known as the corrected compressive strength, this\nbeing the equivalent strength of a cylinder having a height/diameter\nratio of two. The equivalent cube strength of the concrete shall be\ndetermined by multiplying the corrected cylinder strength by 5/4.\n5.6.2   Report \u2014  The following information shall be included in the report\non each test specimen:\na) identification mark,\nb) date of test,\nc) age of specimen,",

TEST FOR FLEXURAL STRENGTH OF MOULDED FLEXURE\nTEST SPECIMENS\n8.1  This clause deals with the procedure for determining the flexural\nstrength of moulded concrete flexure test specimens.\n8.2 Apparatus\n8.2.1  The testing machine may be of any reliable type of sufficient\ncapacity for the tests and capable of applying the load at the rate\nspecified in  8.3 . The permissible errors shall be not greater than \u00b1 0.5\npercent of the applied load where a high degree of accuracy is required\nand not greater than \u00b1 1.5 percent of the applied load for commercial type\nof use. The bed of the testing machine shall be provided with two steel\nrollers, 38 mm in diameter, on which the specimen is to be supported,\nand these rollers shall be so mounted that the distance from centre to\ncentre is 60 cm for 15.0 cm specimens or 40 cm for 10.0 cm specimens.\nThe load shall be applied through two similar rollers mounted at the\nthird points of the supporting span, that is, spaced at 20 or 13.3 cm\ncentre to centre. The load shall be divided equally between the two\nloading rollers, and all rollers shall be mounted in such a manner that\nthe load is applied axially and without subjecting the specimen to any\ntorsional stresses or restraints. One suitable arrangement which\ncomplies with these requirements is indicated in Fig. 3.\n8.3 Procedure  \u2014 Test specimens stored in water at a temperature\nof 24\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C for 48 hours before testing, shall be tested immediately on\nremoval from the water whilst they are still in a wet condition. The\ndimensions of each specimen shall be noted before testing. No\npreparation of the surfaces is required.\n8.3.1  Placing the Specimen in the Testing Machine \u2014  The bearing\nsurfaces of the supporting and loading rollers shall be wiped clean, and\nany loose sand or other material removed from the surfaces of the\nspecimen where they are to make contact with the rollers. The specimen\nshall then be placed in the machine in such a manner that the load shall\nbe applied to the uppermost surface as cast in the mould, along two lines\nspaced 20.0 or 13.3 cm apart. The axis of the specimen shall be carefully\naligned with the axis of the loading device. No packing shall be used\nbetween the bearing surfaces of the specimen and the rollers. The load\nshall be applied without shock and increasing continuously at a rate\nsuch that the extreme fibre stress increases at approximately 7 kg/sq",
