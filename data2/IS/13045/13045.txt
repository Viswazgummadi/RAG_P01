<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD
*<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalize&
by the Fire
Safety Sectional
Commit’tee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division.
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fires occur frequently
in the flour mills due to frictional
heat generated
in the rollers and also.
sparks from foreign material coming in alongwith grains.
The other causes and spread of fires in
this type of factories are bad house keeping, congestion,
faulty electrical
equipment,
height of the
building and use of combustible
materials in the construction
of buildings including
the conveying
arrangement.
In order to reduce fire losses, besides installation
of adequate fire fighting equipment,
it is necessary to plan carefully the layout of the building, provision of external
stair cases and the
arrangements
for storage of grains and finished products.
This standard
has been formulated
to
cover these aspects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Provisions of this Code are supplimentary
to the relevant
statutory requirements
as laid down ia
Indian Factory Act, Petroleum
Rules, Gas Cylinder Rules,  etc.<<HEADING_END>>
