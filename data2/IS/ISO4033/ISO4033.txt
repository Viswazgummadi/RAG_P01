<<PARAGRAPH>>This international
Standard incorporates some changes,
primarily
in width across flats, from the previous metric
practice in a number of countries. These changes were made
to achieve international agreement and to improve product
design and utilization of material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 1 lists the ratios for the sizes selected by lSO/TC 2 to
be IS0 standard (bold type) and in addition four sizes
(light type) which currently are being produced and used
in substantial quantities in many countries of the world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At
its meeting in May 1977, ISO/TC
2 studied several
technical reports analvsing design considerations influencing
determination
of the best series of widths across flats for
hexagon
bolts,
screws and nuts. A primary
technical
objective was to achieve a logical ratio between underhead
bearing surface area (which determines the magnitude of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The four sizes (widthsacross flats of 15, 17, 19 and 22 mm)

be phased out of production
and use. During a
transitional period, to assist designers and manufacturers,
and in particular to give needed information for mainten-
ance and repair requirements, the dimensions of the four
sizes are given in table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
