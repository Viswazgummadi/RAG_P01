FOREWOR-D<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 25 November
1975, after the draft finalized by the Canals and Canal
Linings Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Lime concrete lining had been used with success on some canal systems.
The question of their selection
for use on a particular project,
however,
would be governed by the economics of the proposal which would depend
to a very great extent on the availability of good banker for manufacturing
lime vis-a& the availability
of cement,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE
1.1
This standard covers lining of canals using kankar-lime
concrete and
any other type  of  cheap  lining where kankar is available.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The use of this type of lining shall be restricted to small medium size
irrigation
channels
with capacities
up  to  200  cumecs and in which the
velocity of water does not exceed  2  m/s.

OF SUBGRADE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Reaches With Expansive Soils -
_
.~.
As far as possible lining should be
avoided
in expansive clays.
But if the canal has to traverse a reach of
expansive clay with no alternate
route of economically
feasible condition,
it  may be done with any of the practices detailed under  51.1  and 5.1.2 to
reduce the damage
depending
upon the swelling
properties of the soil
encountered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Clays vary So much in characteristics
that the pressure required
to pre-
vent expansion may be less than  0’07  kgf/cms (*068 kN/ms ) in some types and as much
as 103 kgf/cms ( 10.297 kN/ms)
or higher in others.
In many cases the practices
recommended
in  5.1.1  and 5.13
may not be adequate needing detailed investigations
to find out a practicable
solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  If the expansive clay is in thin layer or in small pockets in an
otherwise suitable subgrade it shall be over excavated and replaced with a
suitable non-expansive soil and compacted suitably.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  7873 - 1975<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2  Swelling of the clay encountered
can be controlled by loading the
surface with a non-expansive
compacted
soil or gravel 60’0 cm and filled
to the grade of the underside of lining with good draining material leading
away the seepage water to specially constructed point either to the outside
of the canal or releasing it into the canal by providing suitable pressure-relief
valves. However, the excavated surface of expansive clay shall be given a
coat of asphalt before loading it to prevent the entry of water into the clay.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Preparation of Subgrade Consisting of Rock-
The subgrade shall
be~prepared and dressed true to level and according to the required cross
section of the canal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1
All excavation including overbreakage below lines of underside of
lining shall be filled completely up to the lines of the underside of lining
with compacted graded filter material.
Care shall be exercized in selecting
refill material for use over fractured rock or cobbles because of the danger
of washing fines into the subgrade voids and thus losing lining support. The
selected material shall be such as to resist such piping and, otherwise, shall
.  be selected for impermeability
and ease of placement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  Preparation of SabgadeConsisting
of Earth -
The subgrade shall
be prepared, dressed and rolled true to level and according to the required
cross section of the canal to form a firm compacted bed for the lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1
In other than predominantly
sandy reaches where the dry bulk
density of the natural soil is not less than 1.8 g/cm’, initial excavation shall
be done up to about 30 cm above the final section and the cutting to final
shape shall be done immediately before lining ( see also 5.3.6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2
Sample profiles true to the cross section of the canal shall be made
at suitable intervals of 3 to 5 metres to ensure correct formation of subgrade.
To ensure uniformity of side slopes a chord shall be stretched across two-
third spacer which shall be run under the chord to check the evenness of the
surface.
This process shall be repeated at short intervals along the slopes
till the surface between two profiles is properly levelled and dressed from
top to bottom.
the profile.
Suitable wooden templates may be used to lay and check<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -In
straight
reaches,
an interval
of 3 to 4 m is recommended
for sample

<<PARAGRAPH>>S-3.3 If at any point material as prepared subgrade has been excavated
beyond the neat lines required to receive lining the excess excavation
sha!l
be filled with material
compatible
with subgrade material
and thoroughly
compacted in accordance with 5.3.5 and 53.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.3.1
When partial filling of an existing canal is necessary to reduce
the cross-sectional
area to that required for lined canals the fill shall be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.4 To cover up any lapses in the compaction of the inner core of the
banks near the edges and to allow sufficient width for a labourer
to work
conveniently a lip-cutting width of not less than 50’0 cm horizontally
shall
be provided.
Depending upon the nature of soil and the side slopes of the
canal the lip cutting width may be in the range of 50 to 100 cm,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.5  Compaction of Subgrade in Predominantly Sand3 Reaches<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.5.1
Bed -
The compaction of the bed shall be done by oversatu-
rating the bed by flooding it with water before lining is laid.
5.3.5.2
Sides
vibrocompactors.
-
The compaction of sides shall be done preferably by
To prevent loss of moisture of the lining, suitable mea-
sures should be adopted.
Wherever
there is over cutting, refilling should
be done with lean concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Admixtures
of 5 percent cement are generally found satisfactory.
5.3.6
Compaction of Subgrade in Other Than Predominantly Sandy Reaches -
All compaction shall be done at optimum moisture in convenient
layers not
more than 15’0 cm thick to “obtain a dry bulk density of not less than
95 percent of the density of optimum moisture content obtained in accord-
ance with IS  :  2720 ( Part VII )-1965*.
5.3.6.1
Where the dry bulk density of the natural soil is equal to or
more than 1’8 g/cm8, the procedure described in 5.3.1 shall be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.6.2
Bed-Where
the dry bulk density of the natural soil is less
than 1’8 g/cm5 and the subsoil water is near the subgrade, the compaction
shall be done by under cutting the bed by 7’5 cm and then ploughing up to
15’0 cm below the subgrade level.
The loosened’soil
shall then be recom-
pacted with sheep foot rollers or other suitable devices.
Where the subsoil
water is low, requiring
no dewatering
and the dry bulk density of the
natural soil is less than 1’8 g/cm*, compaction
shall be done by digging the
canal up to subgrade level and after that loosening the earth below subgrade
up to 15.0 cm by disc harrows, or ploughing and compacting
the same to a
layer of 11’0 cm.
After that, the second layer of 15’0 cm of earthshall
be
laid over
the
compacted
layer by taking
earth from lip cutting
and
compacting
this to a depth of 11’0 cm.
The compacted layer of 7.0 cm
above the subgrade level shall be removed and the subgrade brought to
design profile before laying the lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.6.3
Sides -
Compaction
of sides shall be done by manual labour
or suitable compactors to a depth of 30’0 cm to obtain a minimum dry bulk
density of not less than 90 percent of the density of optimum
moisture
content obtained in accordance with IS  :  2720 ( Part VIf )-1965*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Underdrainage -
For
a  lined canal whcrc tlic ground water level is
higher or likely to be higher than water level inside the canal so as to cause
damaging differential
pressures on the lining., or where the subgrade is
sufficiently impermeable
to prevent free drainage of the underside of lining
in case of rapid draw down, pressure relief arrangements for underdrainage
shall be provided in accordance with IS :4558-1968*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5  Anti-salt
Treatment -
Soil in all reaches
shall bc tested for salt
contents before the lining is started.
Where the salt contents
are over
I.00 percent or sodium sulphate is over 0’36 percent, the subgradc shall be
first covered with about 2 mm thick layer of bitumen obtained by evenly
spraying bitumen at a rate of about 2’35 l/m?-. To get a good bond between
bitumen and soil, crude oil at a rate of 0’5 l/m” shall be sprayed over it in
advance of spraying bitumen.
In case such a situation is encountered
only
in small pockets the replacement of subgrade by suitable earth for a suitable
depth from adjoining reaches shall be considered, if economical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5J.l
Before spraying crude oil, subgrade shall be perfectly
dry, clean
and free from dirt, and crude oil shall be allowed to penetrate the subgrade
surface.
Bitumen shall be heated to a temperature
of 175°C and applied
to the subgrade by a suitable sprayer. Immediately following the application
of bitumen, dry Sand shall be uniformly spread.
Lining should be started
6 to 12 hours after spraying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  LAYING OF CONCRETE LINING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Lime concrete mix should be proportioned
in such a way that, after
compaction,
it shall have a minimum compressive strength of 50 kgf/cm’
( 4 903.3 kN/ms ) at the age of 28 days, the specimens being moist cured
during
the
period.
For determining
compressive
strength ‘unconfined
compression
tests eon cylindrical
specimens with a height to diameter ratio
of two shall be carried out according to IS  :  2541-1974t.
The mix should
have a minimum flexural strength of 14 kgf/cm2 ( 13’729 kN/m2  ) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Lime
concrete
to be used for lining shall also meet the following
additional requirements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Test specimen shall effectively withstand erosion by the continuous
lateral action of jets of water with a velocity not less than 4 m/s
for at least 150 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
