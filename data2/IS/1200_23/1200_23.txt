the Sectional
Committee
during
its second
revision
decided
that
each
trade
as
given in IS  :  1200-1964*
shall
be issued
separa-
tely
as a different
part
as it would be helpful
to
users
in
using
the specific
standard.
This
part

the

work
applicable
to buildings
as well as
to civil engineering
works
was published
sepa-
rately
in the year
1971 and further
revised
in
1977.
In view of the large
number
of comments
received
on this part,
the Sectional
Committee
decided
to issue a fourth
revision
incorporating
the changes
to keep the latest
method
as being
followed
by
most
of
the
organizations.
The
principal
modifications
are in respect
of rein-
forced
cement
concrete
sheet,
timber
sheet,
and
bored
piles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(Part
23 ) ( Fourth
Revision)
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on
16 November
1988,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the
Method
of Measurement
of Works
of Civil Engineering
( Excluding
River
Valley
Projects
) Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Measurement
occupies
a
very
important
place in the planning
and execution
of any civil
engineering
work from the time
of first estimates
to the final
completion
and settlement
of pay-
ments
of project.
Methods
followed
for measure-
ment
are
not
uniform
and considerable
differ-
ences
exist
between
practices
followed
by
different
construction
agencies
and also between
various
Central
and State
Government
Depart-
ments.
While
it is recognized
that each
system
of measurement
has to be specifically
related
to
administrative
and
financial
organizations
within
a department
responsible
for the work, a
unification
of the
various
systems
at technical
level
has
been
accepted
as
very
desirable
specially
as it permits
a wider range
of operation
for civil engineering
contractors
and
eliminates
ambiguities
and
misunderstandings
arising
out
of
inadequate
understanding
of
the
various
systems
followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
