<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after the draft finalized by the Agricultural
Tractors and Power Tillers Sectional Committee had been approved by the Food and Agriculture
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard due consideration
has been given to  Central

1988
and Rules framed thereunder,
and Safety Standard ( SS- 15 ) of Automotive Research Association
of India.
However, it is subject to restrictions imposed under these as amended from time to time wherever applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>In preparation of this Indian Standard considerable assistance has been derived from ASAE  (American
Society
ofAgricu/tzmal
Engineers)
Standard, S 279.9 July 1993.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated expressing the result of a test shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2:1960
‘Rules
for rounding off numerical values (  revised)’.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
