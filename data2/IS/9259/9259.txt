FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 10 July 1979, after the draft finalized by the Soil Engineering and Rock
Mechanics
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Indian Standards
Institution
has already published
a series of
standards on methods of testing soils.
It has been recognized that reliable
and intercomparable
test results can be obtained only with standard testing
equipment capable of giving the desired level of accuracy.
The Sectional
Committee
has, therefore,
decided to bring out a series of specifications
covering the requirements
of equipment used for testing soils to encourage
its development and manufacture
in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The equipment
covered in this standard is used for determination
of
liquid limit ( mechanical
method ) covered in IS  :  2720 ( Part V )-1970*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard
covers the minimum requirements
for the apparatus.
The apparatus may also be manufactured
with a revolution
counter to
indicate
the number
of falls of cup automatically
and/or a motorized
driving arrangement
to give approximately
120 revjmin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-196OT.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1  The liquid limit device shall be constructed
in accordance
with
Fig. 1.
It shall consist of a base carrying a sliding carriage assembly to
which a cup is hinged.
The cup shall be suspended in such a way that it
may be raised and dropped through a height of 10 mm with the help of a
lead screw provided at the back of the sliding carriage.
For ease of opera-
tion,
the handle
to rotate
the cam shall be provided
for right-hand
operation.
For rubber feet made of the same material
shall be fixed to
the base.
The cup shall have the dimensions as detailed in Fig. 1.
The
inside of the cup shall be finished smooth.
The cup shall have a brass
follower block brazed to it for being suspended from the sliding carriage
with the help of a brass pin.
It shall be suspended from the top bracket
with the help of the brass pin in such a way that it falls freely without hav-
ing much play at its hinge.
The sliding carriage shall have two grooves to
facilitate adjustment of fall of the  CUP to  10 mm.
The contract face of the
cam shall be smoothly curved.
The sliding carriage shall be secured to
the top of the cam housing with two knurled head screws made of brass.
The handle shall be fixed to the cam shaft.
The handle knob shall have
free rotating movement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
