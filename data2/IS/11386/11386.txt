FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 30 August 198.5, after the draft finalized by the Construction
Plant
and Machinery
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Proper and efficient mixing of concrete is an important factor affecting
the quality of concrete and the progress of concrete operations.
Thorough
mixing of concrete
ingredients
would depend to a large extent on the
efficiency of mixer. A number of standards have, therefore, been brought
out on the different types of concrete mixers ( and a few more are under
preparation
) with a view to guiding the manufacturers
and purchasers
in obtaining concrete
mixers
with guaranteed
minimum
performance.
There are number
of technical terms connected
with concrete
mixers
and quite often requires
clarifications
to clearly define different types of
mixers and to give precise meaning to the stipulation
in the standards
and other technical documents
relating to concrete
mixers.
This stan-
dard has been prepared
with the
object of unifying
various technical
terms and expressions
in connection
with the manufacture,
use, and
classification
of concrete mixers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard

<<HEADING level=3>>2.7  Forced Action
Mixer
a)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Batch
Type -
A forced action mixer of a batch type has pan
( or trough ) and set of blades ( or paddles ) moving relatively
one to the other.
The mixing action is accomplished
by the
relative movements
between the mix, the pan and the blades
( or paddles ).
,Continuous

In a continuous
type, the mixer consists
of a drum in which there are two horizontal
parallel shafts
u ith blades.

action
takes place hy the simultaneous
contrary revolutions
of the parallel shafts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8  Free-Fall
Mixer
( Drum Type ) -
A free-fall
mixer
has a drum
with series of blades fitted internally,
which rotates
about
a horizontal
or inclined axis.
The mixing action is achieved by causing each part
of the mix to be lifted in turn as the drum rotates
and at a certain
point in each revolution
allowing it to be dropped or directed towards
the bottom of the drum where it combines
with other parts of the mix
.
in continuously
changing sequence to form a homogeneous
mix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.9  Free-Fall
Continuous
Mixer -
A mixer
with
a cylindrical
drum
of the non-tilting
type rotating about a horizontal
axis.
The ingredients
fed at one end by a funnel or hopper are moved
by blades fixed to the
drum to the opposite discharging
end, the charging, mixing

<<HEADING level=3>>2.10 Gyramixer
-
A portable
pan mixer in which the ingredients
are
mixed by gyratory action of blades in a horizontal
stationary mixing pan.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.11 Loading Point -
The loading point is used to establish the loading
height above the datum ground level and is that point to which material
should be raised in order to commence
charging
the loading
skip or
mixer itself as applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.12 Mixing Cycle - This is the time taken to mix one batch satisfac-
torily
from the moment the materials
are discharged
into the mixer
until the mixed concrete
is completely
discharged.
The mixing cycle
shall comprise the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Charging Time -
It is the time required
for charging all the
unmixed materials including water into the mixer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

drum having two openings.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.15 Pan Type Concrete Mixer -
The pan mixer is an annular
mixer of
particular low lime and compact design.
The mixing arm consisting of
steel bar and fit:ed with mixing paddles, rotate in the annular
mixing
chamber.
The material to be mixed is moved quickly from internal
and external zones to the central zone and turned round in an extensive
manner in continuously
changing
direction,
including
pan bottom
to
upwards.
The mix is thus in continuous
motion which results in faster
homogenization
at short mixing time.
The. annular pan rotates about a
vertical axis in which steel bars and mixing paddles which are concen-
trically placed, rotate in the mixing chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
