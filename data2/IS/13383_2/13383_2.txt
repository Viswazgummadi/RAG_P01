<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 2) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after the draft
finalized by the Illumination Engineering and Luminaires Sectional Committee had been
approved by the Electrotechnical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The object of this standard is to recommend the adoption of the test procedures that will give
acceptable results in determining and reporting the photometric characteristics of luminaires
intended for use of road and street lighting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 2) is one of the series of Indian Standards which deals with the methods of
photometry of luminaires. The series consist of the following parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods of photometry of luminaires:
Part 1
Luminaires intended for use of interior lighting;
Part 2
Luminaires for road and street lighting; and
Part 3
Luminaires for floodlighting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation of this standard, assistance has been derived from CIE Publication No. 27
(TC-2.4) 1973 on Photometry of luminaires for street lighting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard supersedes IS 7678 : 1975 ‘Method of photometric testing of incandescent type
luminaires for general lighting services’ which covers the method for photometric testing of
filament type general lighting luminaires.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (October 2000). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
applies
to
testing
of
luminaires designed primarily for road and
street lighting, suitable for ac electricity supply
and using the following lamp types:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The light output ratio is defined as the ratio of
the light output of the luminaire measured
under specified practical conditions, to the sum
of the individual light outputs of the lamps
operating outside the luminaire under specified
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) High pressure mercury vapour;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Blended or self — ballasted mercury
vapour;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The
‘specified
conditions’
should
be
the
standard conditions defined in  5.3 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Low pressure sodium vapour;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) High pressure sodium vapour;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Tubular fluorescent;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Photometric Characteristics<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Incandescent; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Tungsten halogen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
requirements
described
in
these
recommendations
relate
to
the
following
characteristics. They can be divided into the
measured characteristics, that is, those directly
measured with laboratory instruments, and the
derived characteristics which can be calculated
from the measured ones and used in the
application of the luminaires. The derived
characteristics are more closely related to
lighting
application
than
to
photometric
measurements, but it is emphasized that these
recommendations only deal with the measured
photometric characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 DEFINITIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard the
following definitions shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Luminaire Photometry per 1 000 Lamp
Lumens<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Photometric measurements of a luminaire
converted into a total luminous flux of 1 000
lumens from all the lamps in the luminaire
together, when these are operated under
standard test conditions (  see   5.3  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Measuring Half-Plane (C-Plane)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Distribution of Luminous Intensity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>That portion of any vertical plane through the
photometric light centre of a luminaire, which
is wholly to one side of the vertical axis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Distribution of luminous intensity in specified
directions per 1 000 lamps lumens (  see   2.1  ).
The directions in which the luminous intensity
needs to be measured will depend on the later
use of the measurements (  see   2.3  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3 Distribution of Luminous Intensity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>By the luminous intensity distribution of a
luminaire or light source is meant the luminous
intensities of the luminaire or light source in all
directions. The luminous intensity distribution
may be represented by tables, diagrams or
curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Flashed Area<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The flashed area is used in the calculation of
glare in street lighting installations. It is the
area of orthogonal projection of the light
emitting surface of a luminaire on a plane
perpendicular to a given direction of viewing
within which the luminance exceeds 1 percent
of the brightest part. For the purpose of the
determination of the glare control mark the
direction of viewing in specified as  = 76°C in
the plane C = 0°.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4 Test Distance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Photometric test distance is the distance from
the photometric centre of the distribution
photometer to the surface of the photocell,
taking into account the distance to and from
any mirror or mirrors that may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>gives a luminous intensity as a function of the
horizontal angle C and the vertical angle Y
(C Y-system,  see  Fig. 1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4 Presentation of Distribution Intended
for Luminance Calculations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Luminance calculations are practically always
made by means of the computer. The light
distribution must, therefore, be given in digital
form (a light distribution table). The table<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The table should be given in the following
form:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The reference half-plane (that is C = 0°) should
generally be orientated parallel to the road as
shown in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 SELECTION OF TEST APPARATUS,
PROCEDURES AND METHODS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where that light distribution according
to the construction of the luminaire can be
considered symmetrical about the half-planes
C = 270° and C = 90°, the table may contain
only
the
luminous
intensities
for
the
half-planes from C = 270° to C = 90°. Each
value in the table (except for C = 270° and
C = 90°) will then be the mean value of the two
readings in symmetrical directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accuracy of a street lighting design
depends
upon
a
knowledge
of
the
characteristics
of
the
road
surface,
the
performance of the luminaires and of the
associated lamps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accuracy of photometric measurement is in
turn depended upon the apparatus used, and
also on the testing procedure adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5 Presentation of Distribution Intended
for General Purposes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Sources of Error<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In General, two kinds of errors impair
accuracy, namely, systematic errors, inherent
in the test methods used, or caused by
imperfections of instruments; and random
errors, due to variations in test conditions
outside the photometrist’s control. It is the
latter which affects repeatability. Examples of
such sources of errors are given in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The presentation may be given in (one or more
of) the following forms:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A polar curve in a vertical plane parallel
to the road axis;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A polar curve in a vertical plane through
the peak intensity, if different from (a);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) A conical light distribution through the
peak intensity. The value of the constant
angle  shall be stated; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>with sufficient accuracy and that a realistic
comparison between different luminaires can
be made. Provision is, therefore, made in these
recommendations for: (a) appropriate standard
test conditions ( 5.3 ); (b) acceptable variations
produced by limitations of the laboratory and
its apparatus, for example, temperature and
orientation during test ( 5.4 ); and (c) correction
factors where a service condition causes the
luminaire
to
operate
differently
to
the
laboratory standard test conditions ( 5.5 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Acceptable Order of Accuracy of
Photometric Measurement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recommended that the sum of any
systematic error and random error, specified by
the standard deviation, is not greater than:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— For measurement of luminous intensity:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>± 5 percent or for the lower intensities
± 2 cd/1000 lm, whichever is the greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— For measurement of angle:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Standard Test Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>± 0.5°<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The standard test conditions should be taken
as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Selection of Apparatus and Testing
Procedures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Luminaire
orientation
: The luminaire should be
suspended in the position
for which it is designed to
operate in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Apparatus and testing procedures listed in
Annex
A
are
considered
acceptable
for
photometry of street lighting luminaires within
the scope of these recommendations and to the
order of accuracy nominated in  4.3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Light source : Fundamentally the photo-
meter should be calibrated
with the lamp, operated
under the same conditions
for
which
the
nominal
luminous flux is measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Calibration Procedures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The distribution photometer may be calibrated
either by the relative or by the absolute (or
direct) method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For most lamps this means
freely suspended in either
horizontal
or
vertical
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the relative method the luminous flux of the
lamp(s) used for the test is obtained from
measurement of intensity distributions in
terms of arbitrary units of the photometer scale
reading.
Intensity
measurements
on
the
luminaire being tested are then made in the
same arbitrary units of scale reading. A
description of this method is given in  8 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If lamp data are published
for
the
lamp
in
both
horizontal
and
vertical
positions,
the
position
during calibration should be
the same as the operating
position in the luminaire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the absolute method both the lamp(s) and
the photometer are calibrated in absolute units
against standard light sources of which the
luminous flux (in lumens) or the intensity (in
candelas) are known.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Air movement
and ambient
temperature<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>: Still air at 25°C in the
vicinity of the luminaire, or
bare
lamp(s)
when
calibrating the photometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 LABORATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR
TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Test ballasts
: The same ballasts should be
used
for
testing
the
luminaire
and
the
bare
lamps, and they should be
representative
for
the
manufacturer’s
normal
production.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Photometric tests on luminaires should be
carried out under the conditions and with the
corrections, where applicable, as described
in  5.5 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Practical Test Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Object of Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As it is virtually impossible to carry out
photometry on a lamp or luminaire without
some variation in ambient temperature and
some movement of air within its vicinity, tests
should be made to ensure that the laboratory<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The object of the tests is to provide the users
and manufacturers of luminaires with such
information of the photometric characteristics
of the luminaires under test that calculations
of lighting installations may be carried out<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13383 (Part 2) : 1992<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>conditions are satisfactory. Where the output of
a lamp or luminaire is affected by changes in
ambient temperature or air movement the
recommendations of  5.4.1  and  5.4.2  should be
observed. Usually these considerations only
apply when testing tubular fluorescent lamps
or luminaires incorporating them, but may be
important for some other types of discharge
lamps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Electric Power Supply<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.1   Supply Voltage and Frequency<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The voltage and frequency at the supply
terminals of the luminaire, except where
tungsten filament lamps are used should be
taken as the rated values marked on the
luminaire. If not marked the rated voltage and
frequency of the ballast should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.1   Ambient Temperature Variation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During photometric measurements the supply
voltage and frequency should be maintained
constant within ± 0.5 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mean ambient temperature t m  should be
equal to 25 ± 2°C throughout the test on the
lamp or luminaire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE — It will be necessary to control the variation in
voltage and frequency to a closer tolerance when
selecting tests lamps in accordance with  7.2 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
difference
between
mean
ambient
temperature t m  for the lamp during calibration
and mean ambient temperature t m  for the
luminaire during the test should not exceed
2°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In
the
case
of
luminaires
incorporating
tungsten filament lamps the voltage should be
controlled to within ± 0.2 percent or better.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be noted that many matt black paints
have a reflection factor as high as 4 percent
when new and unmarked. For angles of
incidence close to the plane of such surfaces the
reflection factor is much higher. Where
possible,
therefore,
screening
should
be
arranged so that stray light from the luminaire
reaches the photocell only after two or more
reflections from blackened surfaces. Where
only one surface can be provided it may be
necessary to cover it with black velvet, black
carpet, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2   Limits of Error Due to Air Movement<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2.1   General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Movement of air may be caused by draughts,
air conditioning, or motion of the luminaire on
the photometer. It is recommended that the
following tests be made to ensure that the
laboratory conditions are satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.4.2  Air movement due to draughts or air
conditioning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Possible paths of stray light which should not
be overlooked are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Luminaire — blackened surface (floor,
screen, etc) — mirror — photocell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A bare lamp mounted on the photometer should
be stabilized, as in  8.2 , in the proposed
laboratory
conditions,
and
the
luminous
intensity in a specified direction measured at a
known
ambient
temperature.
The
air
conditioning plant should then be switched off,
any remaining draughts reduced as far as
practicable, and the lamp re-stabilized and the
luminous intensity again measured at the same
ambient temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Luminaire — blackened surface (floor,
screen, etc) — luminaire — mirror —
photocell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Luminaire — mirror — luminaire —
mirror — photocell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 REQUIREMENTS FOR TEST
APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A similar test should be carried out on the
luminaire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The
requirements
in
this
clause
are
supplementary to the laboratory conditions
described in  5 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These tests should be repeated for a number of
positions of the lamp or luminaire in the
photometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Requirements for Photocells<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2.3   Satisfactory laboratory conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1   Performance of Photocells<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Laboratory conditions may be considered
satisfactory, if the sum of the differences
between the readings measured under  5.4.2.2
and  5.4.2.3  does not exceed 2 percent.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The photocell and its measuring circuit should
be stable in operation and not subjected to
fatigue when exposed to the maximum level of
illuminance encountered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13383 (Part 2) : 1992<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, for luminaires with an approxi-
mately cosine distribution in planes passing
through the long axis of the luminaire, the test
distance may be determined as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The combination of photocell and measuring
circuit
should
possess
essentially
linear
response to light up the maximum level of
illuminance encountered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The spectral sensitivity of the photocell should
closely follow the CIE spectral luminous
efficiency curve. It is recommended that the
stability of the spectral response be checked
periodically. A method of checking with colour
filters is given in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>either : fifteen times the dimensions of the
light emitting part normal to the
lamp axis,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or
: five times the dimension of the
light emitting part parallel to the
lamp axis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2   Measurement of Photocell Output<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test distance to be used will be the larger
distance of these two.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The output of the photocell should be measured
to an accuracy of ± 1 percent. If automatic
recording
equipment
is
used
for
the
measurement of photo current, it is important
that the maximum inherent errors of the
equipment
are
determined,
for
example,
delayed response to change in photo current,
and lack of response (a finite dead zone) to
small changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.3   Special Requirements for Mirrors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any mirror used in the construction of a
distribution photometer should be rigidly
supported and kept flat in all normal positions
of rotation. The variation of the reflectance
factor over its usable surface should not be
more than ± 3 percent from the mean. This
should be checked at regular intervals using
the method described in  6.3.4  or a similar one.
Errors introduced by mirrors may be caused by
one or more of the following factors:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3  Additional Requirements for the Auxiliary
Photocell Used in the Monitored Light Source
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The auxiliary photocell used in the monitored
light source method should comply with the
above requirements. In addition, it should be
shielded so as to respond only to light from the
centre position of the luminaire. The photocell
may be mounted at any convenient distance,
but should be rigidly fixed and rotate with the
luminaire. The position chosen should not
cause any disturbance of light reaching the
main photocell when at normal measuring
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) departures of the mirrored surface from a
plane surface, for example, ripples in glass
due to method of support, sagging etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) variation in reflectance factor over the
main
reflecting
surface
of
silver,
aluminium, etc;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) variation in transmission through the
glass, when the reflecting surface is on the
rear side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Requirements for Distribution
Photometers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) light scattering due to scratches, dust, etc;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1   Selection of Performance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) spectral selectivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The selection of a distribution photometer for
use in an industrial laboratory involves the

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4  Testing of Mirrors for Variation in
Reflectance Factor<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>By setting the photometer so that the effective
position of the photocell is at nadir and moving
a light source in a horizontal plane through the
optical centre of the photometer, variation in
the reflectance factor of the mirror over the
area traversed can be measured. The light
source should have an essentially uniform light
distribution in directions near the vertical, and
the apparent area should be approximately
0.003 m 2  (that is, a 100 W inside white
incandescent lamp) with the photocell placed in
its normal position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) mounting the luminaire on the normal
service position, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) a test distance complying with the
recommendation below (  see   6.3.2  ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2   Test Distance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general the test distance should not be less
than fifteen times the maximum dimension of
the light emitting part of the luminaires.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13383 (Part 2) : 1992<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The variation of the angle of incidence on the
photocell and of the distance between the
photocell and the light source, when moving
this, must be taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.3   Ageing of Lamps<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All lamps should be aged until the light output
is shown by successive readings to be stable.
Ageing should be carried out by cycle operation
of the lamps close to their electrical design
specifications for a recommended minimum
period of 100 h in the case of tungsten filament
and tubular fluorescent lamps and 200 h for
other lamps. A suggested cycle consists of
15 min off period every 4 h. The position of
lamps during ageing should be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE — Variation observed by such a test will be due
to one or more of the causes listed under (a) to (d)
of  6.3.3  above.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.5  Special Requirements for Luminaires
Mounted in Their Designed Operating Positions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Movement of the luminaires should be smooth,
free from rocking and in the case of luminaires
using tubular fluorescent lamps, sufficiently
slow so as not to upset the air temperature
within the luminaire (  see   5.4  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Tubular fluorescent — horizontal<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Low pressure sodium — horizontal<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the U bend type the plane through the
limbs should be vertical unless otherwise
specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Mirror Goninometer method is recommended
for accurate measurements. However in the absence of
mirror goninometer other methods using convential
goninometer may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1  The lamp should be marked to ensure that in
subsequent use it is operated in an identical position
including its orientation about the long axis.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 PREPARATION OF LAMPS AND
LUMINAIRES FOR TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  After ageing any lamp showing an abnormal
distribution of metallic sodium should be discarded.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preparation of lamps and luminaires for
testing should comply with the following
recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the lamp is of a type which is intended to be
used either horizontally or vertically the
stability should be checked for both positions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Test Lamps<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.4   Stability of Lamps<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1   Selection of Lamps for Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lamps should be regarded as stable when the
variation in luminous flux during consecutive
switch-ons is not greater than ± 1 percent, and
when the variation between the mean values
for any consecutive switch-ons is not greater
than 2 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lamps selected for test should comply with
the
relevant
Indian
standards.
If
such
standards do not exist, the lamps should
comply as close as possible with the nominal
specifications of the lamp manufacturer. In the
case of tubular fluorescent lamps, the variation
from a uniform circular distribution in a plane
at right angles to the axis should not exceed 3
percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.5   Tests for Lamp Stability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tests may be made either by measurement of
total flux in an integrating sphere or by
measurement of luminous intensity in one
direction at 90° to the lamp axis in a
distribution photometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lamps for
multiple
lamp
luminaires, if
intended to be of the same type and wattage,
should be matched for light output within a
spread of 3 percent when operated on the same
supply and ballast circuit. They may then be
used in calibration and test without regard to
the light output which might be obtained on the
circuits of the luminaire ballasts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lamps should not be moved between
measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>For tubular fluorescent lamps air temperature
in the vicinity of the lamp should be stable
throughout this test, and the air draughtfree
(  see   5.4.2  ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The lamp should furthermore comply with the
specifications given in  7.2.2  and  7.2.4 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.2   Diffusing Quality of Lamps Bulb<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.6   Handling of Aged Lamps<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For lamps with a phosphor or diffuse coating of
the bulb should correspond to the average of
the production.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Aged lamps should be carefully handled. This is
particularly important for low pressure sodium<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13383 (Part 2) : 1992<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It
is
recommended
that
the
following
conventions are adopted, where possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>lamps both when hot and cold because a sudden
movement can alter the distribution of sodium
within the arc tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tungsten filament lamps with a ring-type
filament should be positioned so that the
filament gap faces across the street. A
plane-type filament should be aligned so that
the filament lies in the C = 0° and C = 180°
half-planes (  see   3.5  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.7   Mounting of Bare Lamps in Photometer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is most important that curing calibration of
the distribution photometer the bare lamp or
lamps are mounted in the position for which
they are specially designed or for which the
lamp photometric data are normally prepared.
For example, most low pressure sodium lamps
should be mounted horizontally, since except
for the lowest wattage they will not operate
satisfactorily in any other orientation. Tubular
fluorescent
lamps
should
be
mounted
horizontally as lamp data are usually only
prepared for that condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Low pressure sodium lamps of the ‘U’ tube type
should be mounted so that the plane through
the
two
tubes
is
vertical,
unless
the
manufacturer has specified otherwise. Low
pressure sodium lamps of the linear type
should be mounted so that the plane containing
the profile of the grooves is vertical, unless the
manufacturer has specified otherwise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lamps of the type designed for universal
mounting such as some types of high pressure
mercury vapour lamps can be mounted in
either position provided lamp photometric data
are published for the position chosen, but
preferably in the same position as the operating
position in the luminaire. In such cases the
orientation of the lamp during calibration
should be included in the test report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>High pressure sodium or mercury vapour lamps
when mounted vertically should be arranged so
that the arc tube support rods are in a vertical
plane perpendicular to the kerb lines. If there is
only one support rod it should be located
towards the house side. When such lamps are
mounted horizontally the arc tube support rods
should preferably be in a vertical plane. If there
is only one rod it should be located towards the
zenith.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Test Ballast<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A
small
variation
from
the
above
recommendations, which does not significantly
change the light distribution, is permissible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.1   General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The output of the luminaire is affected by the
ballast used. In the case of tubular fluorescent
lamps of the ballast position and method of
attachment are also important, and they should
be positioned as intended by the luminaire
manufacturers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The alignment of the lamp should be recorded
in the test report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.3   Mounting of Luminaire in Photometer<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The luminaire should be mounted in the
distribution photometer so that the photometer
light centre of the luminaire (  see   7.4.4  )
corresponds with the optical centre of the
photometer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Ballasts used for test on the luminaire should
comply with the specification in  5.3 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Preparation of Luminaires for Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.1   Selection of Luminaire<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The luminaires should be levelled according to
the manufacturer’s instructions so that its
alignment is mechanically true.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The luminaire selected for test should be
representative of the manufacturer’s regular
product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If instructions are not provided, then the plane
containing the lower edge of the luminaire
canopy (or the plane containing the reflector
opening if this is lower) should be taken as one
reference and the longitudinal axis, determined
from the outer edges of the luminaire, when
viewed in plan, should be taken as the second
reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The optical parts should be clean, and all
components rigidly located in their designed
positions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.2   Alignment of Lamp in Luminaire<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The photometric distribution of a luminaire is
somewhat dependent upon the alignment of the
lamp in relation to the position of a filament
gap, arc tube support, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mounting of the luminaire should also
comply with.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The principle underlying the relative method of

<<PARAGRAPH>>R C,

<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.1   Determination of
x<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>x  is determined from a number of intensity
readings and calculated by means of a suitable
procedure, for example, direct calculation,
Russel angles, zone factors, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The stabilization of the lamps and luminaire,
the calibration of the photometer and the
procedures for testing should comply with the
provisions in this section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The necessary number of intensity readings
will depend on the light distribution, but in
general 18 to 20 readings in each of 12 to 20
vertical half-planes will be adequate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Stabilization of the Lamps, Luminaire
and Photometer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lamps, luminaire and measuring devices
can be regarded having reached stability when
the
variation
between
three
successive
readings of luminous intensity of flux at
intervals of not less than 15 min does not
exceed 1 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For lamp types for which certain assumptions
on the light distribution can be made, fewer
readings may be sufficient. The accuracy of
such a simplified procedure should, in these
cases, be verified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.2   Calibration of the Photometer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Experience may show that a bare incandescent
lamps is sufficiently stable within 10 min, and
most gaseous discharge lamps after 30 min
operation. For metal halide lamps, however,
the stabilization time may vary between 30 min
and 6 h.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The photometer can be calibrated according to
the principle described in  8.3.1  measuring the
lamp or lamps just prior to or immediately after
the measurement of the luminaire.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A detailed description of how the calibration
may be carried out is given in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The stabilization period of luminaires may be
much greater than that for the respective bare
lamps, particularly in the case of tubular
fluorescent lamps which may require periods in
excess of 2 h.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Precautions should be taken to ensure that the
given direction can be reproduced in the
photometer, for example, by marking the lamp
and the direction should be so chosen that the
variation of the luminous intensity with the
angle is small.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care should be taken to stabilize the measuring
circuits and associated devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_12>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13383 (Part 2) : 1992<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The position of the lamp axis should be as
recommended in  7.2.7 . Lamps should be
carefully positioned in the photometer, using
any convenient method, so that their axis is
either vertical or horizontal, which is relevant.
It is not advisable to simply insert the lamp
into the lampholder and assume it is correctly
aligned. Lamps fitted with bayonet caps may
require a modified lampholder to provide a
sufficiently rigid support.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4 Procedure for Measurements on the
Distribution Photometer — Lamps and
Luminaire in Standard Test Condition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the lamps and luminaire are located in
the distribution photometer in accordance
with  5.3  and laboratory temperature variation
complies with  5.4.1  then measurements can be
reported as relating to the standard laboratory
test condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Precautions should be taken to avoid the
creation of cool spots with tubular fluorescent
lamps. The light output of a tubular fluorescent
lamp operated in some multi-lamp circuits is
affected by the operating temperature of the
other lamp (or lamps) in the same circuit. In
such cases the other lamps not under test
should remain energised, but should be freely
suspended horizontally outside the luminaire,
in still air at 25°C. It should not be necessary to
remove the ballast from the luminaire for
photometric measurement on the lamp.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9 TEST REPORT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following list is intended as a guide to the
information which should be included in a test
report covering photometric measurements on
a luminaire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of this information should be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) to correctly inform the user of the data as
to the nature of the various controlled
conditions under which the luminaire was
measured; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The precautions under  7.2.7  relating to low
pressure sodium lamps should be observed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) to give sufficient information so as to
relate the photometric information to the
particular
luminaire
tested.
Without
which the report may become quite
meaningless.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A check on lamp stability should be made at
intervals during the test by comparing readings
taken at the nadir. The drift in such readings
should not exceed 2 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — It may be necessary to sight from the photocell
position to ensure that the view of the lamp is not
obstructed by the supporting structure. Should this be
unavoidable at some angles then the reading at these
angles may be interpolated from measurements either
side or alternatively taken as equal to the reading
diametrically opposite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>METHOD OF CHECKING STABILITY OF SPECIAL RESPONSE OF A
PHOTO-ELECTRIC CELL USING COLOUR FILTERS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-1  It is recommended that the stability of the
spectral response of a photocell and associated
filter be checked periodically. This may be done
simply by using the cell to make periodic
measurements of the luminous transmittances
of three stable colour filters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to extraneous effects. The light source should
be an incandescent lamp operated at the same
colour temperature on each occasion, usually
2856 K (CIE Illuminant A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements should be made at a normal
illuminance level. High illuminance of the
photocell should always be avoided. It is
recommended that, in the case of selenium
photovoltaic cells, the illuminance should not
exceed a level at which the cell begins to show
non-linearity. In practice this is commonly in
the region of 200 lux for a cell operating with
zero external resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1  Filters with characteristics similar to the following are
satisfactory for this measurement:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Blue filter

<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of the Standard Mark is governed by the provisions of the  Bureau of Indian
Standards Act, 1986  and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder. The Standard Mark on
products covered by an Indian Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply with the requirements of that standard under a well defined system of inspection,
testing and quality control which is devised and supervised by BIS and operated by the
producer. Standard marked products are also continuously checked by BIS for conformity to
that standard as a further safeguard. Details of conditions under which a licence for the use of
the Standard Mark may be granted to manufacturers or producers may be obtained from the
Bureau of Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
