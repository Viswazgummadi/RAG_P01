<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian
Standard
( Part II ) ( Second
Revision
) was adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on  22 March
1973, after the draft finalized
by the Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
With
a view to establish
uniform
procedures
for the determination
of
different
characteristics
of soils
and
also
for
facilitating
comparative
studies
of the results, the Indian
Standards
Institution
is bringing
out this
Indian
Standard
methods
of
test for
soils
( IS  :  2720 )
which
will be
published
in parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This
part
was
first
published
in
1964
and
revised
in
1969
to
include
two rapid
field methods
for the determination
of water
content
in soils.
In this second
revision,
rapid
determination
of water
content
with
infra-red
lamp
torsion
balance
moisture
meter
and
rapid
deter-
mination
of water
content
from the gas pressure developed
by the reaction
of calcium
carbide
with the free
water
content
of the
soil have
been
included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

In reporting
the result
of a test or. analysis made in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded

and heat
the sand-bath.
Care shall be taken not to get the sand-bath
too hot.
During
heating,
the
specimen
shall be turned frequently
and thoroughly
with the palette

to assist the evaporation
of water,
care being
taken
to see that no soil is
lost in the process;
Dry the specimen
to constant

by the
difference
between
two consecutive
masses of the container
with lid or the
tray with the dried specimen
taken at suitable intervals
after initial drying,
being
a maximum
of 0.1 percent
of the original
mass of the soil specimen.
When
drying
is complete,
remove the container
or the tray from the sand-
bath, ,cool and weigh ( H’s).
The container
should be weighed with lid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  -Avoid
overheating.
A convenient method of detecting overheating
of the
soil is by the use of small pieces of white paper

Moisture
Meter-The

<<PARAGRAPH>>21.1.1
The equipment should be of two main parts, the infra-red lamp,
and the torsion balance.
The infra-red
radiation should be provided by
250  watt
lamp built in the balance
for use with an alternating
current
220-230 V, 50 cycle, single phase mains supply.
Provision should be made
to adjust the input voltage to the infra-red
lamp to control the heat for
drying of specimen.
A suitable thermometer graduated from 40 to 150”~
should be provided for ascertaining
the temperature
of drying in the pan
housing.
The
weighing
mechanism,
a torsion balance,
should have a
built in magnetic damper.
The.balance
scale should be divided in terms
of water percentages,
from 1 to 100 percent water content in 0.2 percent
divisions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

that
the temperature
of drying is around
11O’C.
The

NOTE  -Keep
a watch on the columu of mercury

records a temperature
of 105*C, control the variac in such a manner that
there is no more rise in the temperature
beyond 110%
and the temperature

If for a particular
