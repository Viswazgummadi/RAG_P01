<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Part 11 ) (Third
Revision
) which
is identical
with ISO
4042:1999
‘Fasteners
—
Electroplated
coatings’
issued
by the International
Organization
for Standardization
( ISO ) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian Standards
on the recommendation
of the Bolts, Nuts and Fasteners
Accessories
Sectional
Committee
and approval
of the Basic and Production
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 1367 which covers the ‘Technical
supply conditions
for threaded
steel fasteners’
was originally
published
in 1961 and first revised
in 1967.
In the late seventies,
the second
revision
was taken
up when the work
of lSOiTC
2 ‘Fasteners’
taken into consideration
of our national
work on industrial
fasteners.
Accordingly,
the Committee
decided
that
IS 1367 should
be brought
out into several
parts,
each
part
covering
a
particular
feature
or property
of the fasteners.
Subsequently,
the second
revision
of this standard
was
published
in 1996 by adopting
ISO 4042:1989.
This third
revision
has been prepared
by adoption
of
latest
edition
of ISO 4042
published
in 1999.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The text
of ISO Standard
has been
approved
as suitable
for publication
as Indian
Standard
without
deviations.
Certain
terminology
and conventions
are, however,
not identical
to those
used in the Indian
Standards.
Attention
is drawn
especially
to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Wherever
the words
‘International

appear
referring
to this standard,
they should
be

<<HEADING level=3>>1  Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International
Standard
specifies
dimensional
requirements
for electroplated
fasteners
of steel or copper alloy. It
specifies
coating
thicknesses
and gives recommendations
for hydrogen
embrittlement
relief for fasteners
with high
tensile strength
or hardness
and for surface-hardened
fasteners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International
Standard
primarily
concerns
the electroplating
of threaded
fasteners,
but it may also be applied to
other threaded
parts. For the applicability
to screws that cut or form their own mating threads,
see clause 8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specifications
given in this International
Standard
may also be applied
to non-threaded
parts such as washers
and pins.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1
Dimensional requirements before electroplating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before
coating,
parts
shall
comply
with the
relevant
International
Standards
if applicable
or other
standards
as
specified,
except where threads
or other features
are specifically
manufactured
to allow, for functional
reasons,
the
application
of thicker coatings
than are possible
on normal threads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Coating thicknesses
which can be applied on ISO metric threads
in accordance
with ISO 965-1, ISO 965-2 and ISO
965-3 depend
on the fundamental
deviation
available,
which
itself depends
on the screw thread
and the following
tolerance
positions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
g, f, e for external
threads;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
G for internal threads
or H if required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tolerance
positions
apply prior to application
of the electroplated
coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2
Dimensional requirements after electroplating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After coating,
ISO metric screw threads
shall be gauged
in accordance
with ISO 1502 with a GO gauge of tolerance
position
h for external
threads
and H for internal threads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other product
dimensions
apply only before coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Care should be exercised where relatively thick coatings may affect dimensions with small tolerances as  in the case
of internal drives; in these cases an agreement should be made between the supplier and the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The applicability
of the recommended
coatings
to ISO metric threads
is limited by the fundamental
deviation
of the
threads
concerned
and hence, by the pitch and tolerance
positions.
The coating
shall not cause the zero line (basic
size) to be exceeded
in the case of external
threads,
nor shall it fall below this line in the case of internal threads.
This means that for an internal thread
of tolerance
position
H, a measurable
coating
thickness
can only be applied
to the threads
if the tolerance
zone is not taken up to the zero line (basic size).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 Other coating requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
electroplated
coating
shall
comply
with
the
provisions
of the
relevant
International
Standards
(ISO 1456,
ISO 1458, ISO 2081,
ISO 2082) for the coating
concerned
in respect
of appearance,
adhesion,
ductility,
corrosion
resistance,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 Hydrogen
embrittlement
relief<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases of parts<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
with high tensile strength
or hardness
or which have been surface hardened,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
which have absorbed
hydrogen
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
are under tensile stress<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>there is the risk of failure due to hydrogen
embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the core or surface
hardness
is above 320 HV, process
investigation
shall be conducted
using a test to detect
hydrogen
embrittlement,
for example
the “Parallel
bearing
surface
method”
in accordance
with ISO 15330,
to be
sure that the process
with regard to embrittlement
is under control.
If embrittlement
is discovered,
modification
of
the manufacturing
process
will be necessary,
such as the inclusion of a baking process
(see informative
annex A for
more information).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 1367 (Partll
):2002
ISO 4042:1999<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
fasteners
of
hardness
in excess
of 365 HV,
a written
agreement
should
exist
between
the
customer
and
manufacturer
to define how to manage the risk. If written agreement
does not exist, the manufacturer
shall process the
parts in accordance
with his recommended
practices to reduce the risk of hydrogen embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Complete
elimination
of hydrogen
embrittlement
cannot be assured.
If a reduced
probability
of encountering
hydrogen
embrittlement
is desired,
alternative
procedures
should
be evaluated.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Investigations are proceeding to develop methods for the reduction of hydrogen embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7
Corrosion
protection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The corrosion
protection
of an electroplated
coating depends
to a considerable
extent on its thickness.
In addition to
greater
coating
thickness,
a chromate
conversion
treatment
can be specified
for increased
corrosion
protection
on
zinc and cadmium
coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Contact
with
other
metals
and
materials,
the frequency
and
duration
of wetting
and
service
temperatures
may
influence
the protective
performance
of coatings
and expert advice is essential
when uncertainties
of choice arise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Coatings
of Zn
and
Cd applied
to ferrous
substrates
are
less
electropositive
than
the
steel
base
metal
and
consequently
provide
cathodic
protection.
In contrast,
Ni and Cr coatings
are more electropositive
than the steel
base metal and may intensify part corrosion
where the coating
is damaged
or pitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cadmium
coatings are dealt with in ISO 2082.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Zinc coatings
are dealt with in ISO 2081.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nickel coatings
are dealt with in ISO 1458.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nickel + chromium
and copper + nickel + chromium
coatings are dealt within

treatments
are dealt with in ISO 4520.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE
Information on salt spray corrosion protection performance of metallic coatings is  given in informative annex  B.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 Applicability
to fasteners
that cut or form their own mating threads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All recommended
coatings
may be applied
to screws
that cut or form
their
own
mating
threads
such
as wood
screws,

Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 1
The following two paragraphs are essentially the text of the introduction of ISO 9588:—3) (see[21).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When atomic hydrogen enters steels and certain other metals, for example aluminium
and titanium alloys, it can cause
loss of ductility
or load carrying
ability, cracking
(usually as submicroscopic
cracks)
or catastrophic
brittle failures
at
applied stresses well below the yield strength or even the normal design strength for the alloys. This phenomenon
often
occurs
in alloys that show no significant
loss in ductility when measured
by conventional
tensile tests, and is frequently
referred
to as hydrogen
induced
delayed
brittle failure,
hydrogen
stress
cracking
or hydrogen
embrittlement.
The
hydrogen
can be introduced
during
heat treatment,
gas carburizing,
cleaning,
pickling,
phosphating,
electroplating,
autocatalytic
processes
and in the service
environment
as a result
of cathodic
protection
reactions
or corrosion
reactions.
Hydrogen
can also be introduced
during fabrication,
for example
during roll forming,
machining
and drilling
due to the break-down
of unsuitable
lubricants
as well as during welding
or brazing operations.
Parts that have been
machined,
ground, cold-formed
or cold-straightened
subsequent
to hardening
heat treatment
are especially
susceptible
to hydrogen
embrittlement
damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The results of research work indicate that the susceptibility
of any material to hydrogen embrittlement
in a given test is
directly related to its hydrogen entrapment
population
(type and effectiveness
of traps). Therefore
the time-temperature
relationship
of the baking process
is dependent
on composition
and structure
of steels as well as plating metals and
plating procedures.
Additionally,
for most high strength steels, the effectiveness
of the baking process falls off rapidly
with reduction of time and temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
“Traps” refer to certain metallurgical sites within the steel structure,  such as inclusions, foreign atoms, dislocations, etc.,
to which atomic hydrogen may bond. Hydrogen thus bonded is no longer free to migrate to areas of high stress and contribute to
the initiation of embrittlement fracture. Traps maybe
of the reversible or non-reversible type. For further information see Professor
Troiano’s paper [31.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are many reasons why a fastener
may become embrittled. The total manufacturing
process has to be controlled
in such
a way that the probability
of embrittlement
will be reduced
to a minimum.
This annex
gives examples
of
procedures
by which the probability
of hydrogen
embrittlement
can be reduced during the manufacturing
process for
electroplating
of fasteners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2
Stress relief<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fasteners
which have been cold worked hardened to  320  HV or above and are to be electroplated
may benefit from a
stress relieving process. This process should be carried out before application
of the cleaning
process
defined in A.3.
The temperature
and duration
applicable
to the process
will vary according
to the design,
manufacturing
and heat
treatment
conditions
of the parts concerned,
and shall be notified to the coater, if the process is required in accordance
with
clause 12. Parts
with
a hardness
above
320 HV that
have
been
machined,
ground,
cold-formed
or cold-
straightened
subsequent
to heat treatment should be treated according to ISO 9587.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stress
relief may not be desirable
in cases where residual stresses
are intentionally
introduced,
for example,
screws
which are thread rolled after heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.3
Cleaning
processes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydrogen
absorption
of the steel, leading to brittle failure after electroplating,
maybe
induced by the cleaning process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise
agreed,
parts heat-treated
or work-hardened
to a hardness
of 320 HV or above should be cleaned
with an inhibited acid, alkaline or mechanical
process.
Immersion time in the inhibited acid depends
on the as-received
surface condition
and should be of minimum duration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE
Inhibited acid is an acid to which a suitable inhibitor has been added to reduce corrosive attack on the steel and
absorption of hydrogen.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Parts heat treated or cold worked to a hardness
greater than 385 HV or property class 12.9 and above, should not be
subjected
to acid cleaning
treatment.
Special
pre-treatments
are advisable
using
non-acidic
methods
such
as dry
honing, abrasive
blasting or alkali derusting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steel parts should be supplied with a surface which can be prepared for electroplating
with a minimum
immersion
time
for cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4
Plating process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For fasteners
heat-treated
or cold-worked
to a hardness
greater than 365 HV high cathodic
efficiency
electroplating
solutions are advisable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5
Baking process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With increasing
hardness,
increasing
degree
of cold working
and increasing
content
of carbon
and/or certain
other
elements
of steel parts, the volubility
of hydrogen
and therefore
the amount
of absorbed
hydrogen
during
an acid
cleaning or electroplating
process increases. At the same time, the critical amount of hydrogen which may cause brittle
fracture decreases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The beneficial
effect of a baking
process
after electroplating
is removal
of hydrogen
by effusion
and/or
irreversible
trapping of hydrogen
in the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Parts should
be baked
within 4 h and preferably
within
an hour of electroplating
and before chromating,
to a part
temperature
of 200 “C to 230 “C. The maximum temperature
should take into account the coating material and type of
base material. Certain coatings, e.g. tin, and the physical properties of some parts, maybe
adversely
affected by these
temperatures.
In such cases, lower temperatures
and longer temper durations will be required. This should be agreed
beteen purchaser
and supplier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With increasing
coating
thickness
the difficulty
of removing
hydrogen
increases.
The introduction
of an intermediate
baking process when the coating is only 2 ~m to 5 ~m thick may reduce the risk of hydrogen embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The user may agree that other conditions
for embrittlement
reduction may be used provided they can be shown to be
effective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should not be assumed
that the baking recommended
will completely
prevent hydrogen
embrittlement
in all cases.
Alternative
baking times and temperatures
may be used if they have been shown to be effective for a part, but parts
should not be baked at a temperature
above the temperature
at which the parts were originally tempered.
Generally,
lower
baking
temperatures
require
longer
times
at temperature.
The
chemical
composition
of some
steels,
in
combination
with process
conditions,
may produce
a higher susceptibility
to hydrogen
embrittlement.
Fasteners
with
larger diameters
are less susceptible
than those with small diameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the time of publication
of this International
Standard
it was not considered
possible to give exact baking durations.
Eight hours is considered
a typical example of baking duration. However, baking durations
in the range of 2 h to 24 h at
200 “C to 230 ‘C
may be suitable
according
to the type and size of part, part geometry,
mechanical
properties,
cleaning processes
and electroplating
processes
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I)egrease
the  sample
of parts in an organic  solvent, dry thoroughly
and weigh to an accuracy of 1 in 10000.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the batch of fasteners
has been chromium-plated,
remove the chromium
by immersing
and stirring them in stripping
solution A, which dissolves
the chromium
in less than 2 rein, after which time there should be no appreciable
gassing.
The parts shall be removed without delay and rinsed in water, prior to stripping the nickel by the method given in either
D.2.1.1 or D.2.1 .2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.1.1
Nickel on steel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stripping
solution B (see D.2.2), maintained
between 75 ‘C and 85 “C, will completely
strip 7,5 ~m of nickel in 30 rein,
provided
the parts are turned over. The copper
undercoat
which is also stripped
will be counted
as if it were nickel,
provided
it does not exceed 0,5 pm in thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.1.2
Nickel on copper or copper alloy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stripping
solution C (see D,2.2), maintained
between 80 ‘C and 90 “C, will completely
strip 2,5 pm in about 10 min and
complete
removal
of the nickel will be indicated by the absence of further gassing.
Patts are usually suspended’ in the
solution
on thin copper wire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As soon as the nickel coating has completely
dissolved,
remove the parts, wash well with water, wipe and dip in clean
acetone.
Dry and reweigh as before.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
