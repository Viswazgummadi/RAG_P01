<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Clay Products for Building Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In recent years the brick industry
has been facing an acute shortage
of skilled moulders,
kiln
setters, firemen, etc, which resulted in a fall in production
and deterioration
in quality
of bricks.
Therefore the necessity of adopting some mechanized means of shaping the bricks so as to make the
process independent of individual skill was realized.
Simple brick making plants in which only the
shaping process is mechanized can be based on soft-mud, extrusion or semi-dry process.
At present
only the extrusion machines are produced indigenously and some expertise
in the manufacture
of
bricks by extrusion process already
exists in the country.
Therefore,
the need of unifying
the
practice being followed at present was also felt.
Moreover, in view of the growing energy crisis
there
is also
the
necessity
of
introducing
kiln
of
higher thermal
efficiency fulfilling
the
requirement of kiln for semi-mechanized
brick making process.
With a view to improve
the
manufacturing
operations and utilizing the existing knowledge
and experience,
this standard
has
been prepared to unify the practice followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1986.
This revision has been prepared
to include such of the
data which have been established since it was last revised, like manufacturing
bricks with various
additions as fly ash, sandy beam, rice husk, basalt stone dust, etc, details of firing process, besides
making other contents up to date.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4 SELECTION
OF SITE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 In selecting
the
site
for
a semi-mechanized
brickworks
due considerations
should
be given
to
the following
factors:
a>
Availability
of an ample reserve of clay
or
clays of the required
quality
at
the
site
or
within
economically
short distances
of it;
b)  Abundant
supply
of potable
water;
cl  Good communications;
d)  Proximity
to a market
for the products:
e>
Easy availability
of labour,
power and
fuel;
and
f-1  Low level
of sub-soil
water
in all seasons
(preferably
below 3 ml.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Additives<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain
additives
such as fly ashes,
sandy loam,
rice
husk
ash,
basalt
stone
dust,
etc, are often
required
not
only
to modify
the shaping,
drying
and firing behaviour
of clay mass but
are helpful
in
the
conservation
of
agricultural
land
and
utilisation
of waste
material
available
in
large
quantities.
These additives
should
have a desirable
level
of physical
and
chemical
characteristics
so
as to modify
behaviour
of
clay
mass
within
the
optimum
range
without
any adverse effect on the
performance
and durability
of finished
products.
Some of the basic
physico-chemical
requirements
of conventional
additives
are as under.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The
selected
site
shall
also
conform
to the
prevailing
town-planning
regulations,
specially
with regard
to the depth
and extent
of the large
pits that would invariably
be created as a result of
excavation
of clay.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

composition
similar to that of
brick

towards
strength

depending
on
the physico-chemical
and plastic
properties
of
soils to be used for brick making.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4  Basalt Stone Dust<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Basalt stone occurs underneath the black cotton
soil and its dust is a waste material available in
large quantities
from stone crushers. The finer
fraction
from basalt stone crushing
units
can
suitably
be mixed with soil mass to modify the
shaping, drying
and
firing
behaviour
of the
bricks.
The dust recommended
for use as an
additive
with brick earth should be fine (pass
1 mm screen), free from coarse materials or mica
flakes and should be of non-calcitic
or dolomitic
origin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The proportion
of fly ash mixed as an additive
to
the brick earth should be optimum
to reduce
drying
shrinkage,
check
drying
losses and to
develop
strength
on firing without
bloating
or
black coring
in fired product.
The crystallites
present
in the fly ash should comply
with
the
resultant high temperature phases in the finished
product.
The desirable
characteristics
of fly ash
which could be used as an additive to the soil
mass are given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the
mixer
section
where
two
shafts
carrying
a number
of blades
rotate in opposite
directions
which
mix
the
clay
with
further
quantities
of water
and
pug it into a stiff paste
which is propelled
forward
and dropped
into
the
lower deck of the machine.
The quantity
of water
added
to
the clay
in
the

space
between
the top of the temporary wall and the
main setting is closed up by corbelling
a row of
bricks on either side and covering
with a layer
of ash as in the main setting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1  The kiln should be constructed
on dry ground as far
away from pools, streams, river banks, etc, as possible.
The ground/sub-soil
water level
should
remain
at
least 3 m below the kiln floor during
the monsoon
period.
The level of the ground should be such that
rain water naturally drains away from all sides
of the
kiln.
2 All round
the kiln
sufficient
PUCCA
drainage
should be provided
to avoid formation
of  pools  during
rain anywhere
near the kiln.
3 For
all-weather
operation,
the
kiln
should
be
protected
by a shed.
4 A stand-by
diesel
engine-generator
of
adequate
capacity should be provided to take care of any inter-
ruption
in power supply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

with the fan.
A galvanized
steel sheet damper
shall be temporarily placed across the gap in the
partition wall between Chamber 8 and Chamber 9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3 Initiation of Fire and Control of Firing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.4 Fire shall be lit in temporary
furnaces
in
which rubble coal ( steam coal ) is burnt.
When
coal starts burning
vigorously
long tongues
of
flame are seen entering the first chamber.
Coal
shall be fed to the grates every 20-30 minutes.
After each feed, the furnaces shall be closed with
temporary doors or shutters to prevent
entry
of
excessive amounts of cold air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.1  At least 20 chambers of the kiln should be
loaded
before
starting
the fire. While loading,
one face of each partition wall should be plastered
with mud. The wickets of all the loaded chambers
should
be closed by temporary
brick walls and
plastered
over with mud.
Preferably
this wall
shall be of cavity construction
and the cavity<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 This schedule of firing does not apply rigidly
to all
kilns but shall be modified according to the nature
of
the clay and fuel used for burning.
2 Slack coal obtained

through a 12’5 mm IS Sieve.
All large lumps of coal
should bz crushed in a jaw-crusher
to below
10 mm
size.
3 At the time
of setting,
much
care is needed
to
ensure
correct
alignment
of brick
blades
and trace
holes.
Any mistake made at the time of setting
may
seriously affect the propagation
of fire and may lead
to uneven firing.
4 Before
starting
the
fire,
all dampers
must
be
thoroughly
checked
against
leakage.
All
damper
shafts should be correctly aligned and any imbalance
in the damper should be corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
