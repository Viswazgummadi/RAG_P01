Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The establishment of levels of performance for joints in
buildings has to be based on tests that will simulate the con-
straints associated with their behaviour in service. The func-
tions that a joint has to perform have been listed in IS0 3447.
The method of test specified in this International Standard
deals with point A.8 of subclause 3.1 of IS0 3447. The method
has been adapted from a standard test for the air permeability
of windows. Care should be taken in relating the results of
laboratory tests on joints to their actual performance  on  site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>For the purpose of this International Standard, the definitions
given in IS0 2444, together with the following, apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1
differential
pressure  :  Difference between the absolute
air pressure on the external surface of a joint and the absolute
air pressure on the internal surface of the samejoint. The dif-
ference is positive whenthe external pressure is higher than the
internal pressure. In the other case, it is negative. The differen-
tial pressure is expressed in pascals (Pa).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
air permeability
:  Inability of a joint to resist the passage
of air when it is submitted to a differential pressure across it.
The air permeability is characterized by a flow of air expressed
in cubic metres per hour per metre as a function of the differen-
tial pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies the test method to be
used in laboratories for assessing the air permeability of non-
opening joints in the exterior walls of buildings, whether the
joints have been subjected to prior ageing or not.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
This flow may be related to joint length (flow per unit of
length in cubic metres per hour per metre), or, for a junction*) between
two joints, to the flow at the junction (flow in cubic metres per hour).
Where the distribution of joints (length and junction) in an element is
known, the flow may also be related to the element surface area (flow
per unit of surface in cubic metres per hour per square metre).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2
Field of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard applies to joints between com-
ponents used in the exterior walls of buildings and fixed accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s recommendations. This International
Standard does not apply to joints within components (for
example the joint between glass fixed in a window frame and
sealed with a glazing compound), but applies to the joint be-
tween glass mounted in a fixed window frame on site.‘)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>The basic test apparatus comprises the following  :<<HEADING_END>>

materials to degradation over a period of time shall be tested

Means of measuring the flow of air into or out of the
chamber.<<HEADING_END>>

Joint width varying from minimum to maximum width
along length, and with adjacent components forming the
joint misaligned in the opposite direction to the plane of the
component surfaces (in the direction perpendicular to the
faces of the components) within given limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5
Means
of measuring
the differential
pressure be-
tween the two faces of the joint, i.e. between the joint surfaces
at any part of the wall or of the partition to be tested.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Junctions between joints shall also be tested under conditions
a) to d) above. To test a junction, for example between a ver-
tical joint and a horizontal joint, first test the junction formed
between lengths of the two types of joint and then test
separate lengths of the two types of joint. The effect of the
junction itself is then calculated by subtracting the air flows
through the two separate joints (correcting for length as ap-
propriate) from the air flow through the complete assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6  -Preparation
of the joint for testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The joint to be tested shall be installed between actual com-
ponents so as to withstand the test differential pressures
without deflecting to an extent likely to impair the joint or affect
its performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2
Three positive differential pressure pulses increasing
from 0 to maximum over a period greater than 1 s shall-be ap-
plied to the test chamber. Each pressure shall be maintained for
at least 3 s. These pressures shall be 10 % higher than the max-
imum differential pressure  Pmx  required for the following part
of the test (see 8.3) without however being less than 500 Pa
(see the figure).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The components surrounding the joint shall be chosen to repre-
sent the nature of the surface likely to occur in practice. Any ir-
regularities on that part of the component surface in contact
with any jointing product shall be tested for their effect on air
permeability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The joint shall be instalfed so that its external surface forms a
part of the internal face of one wall of the chamber for a
positive differential pressure and vice versa for a negative dif-
ferential pressure (see 8.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3
The joint shall then be subjected to increasing positive
differential pressures in stages of at least 10 s duration upto the
maximum differential pressure required for the test. This
maximum differential pressure shall be calculated from the
velocity of the wind acting on the joint in its intended location
in use. These differential pressures shall be 50, 100, 150, 200,
300,4.Q
500, and 600 Pa and can then be increased gradually
in steps of 250 Pa maximum if the differential pressure required
for the test is, exceptionally, greater than 600 Pa. The differen-
tial pressures shall then be applied in the reverse order. The
figure shows the sequence of operations for a required differen-
tial pressure Pmax less than 600 Pa, for example of 300 Pa [see
the figure, a)1 and for a required differential pressure of  -Pm,,
greater than 600 Pa, for example of 700 Pa [see the figure, bll.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7
Preparation
for test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Extraneous air leakage from the chamber, not imputable to the
joint, shall be measured and preferably eliminated. When the
extraneous air leakage is measured, it shall be determined with
the joint specimen sealed and at the differential pressures to be
exerted during the joint air permeability tests. (Care shall be
taken to ensure that the joint is well sealed over its face and at
its ends.  1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The metering equipment for the measurement of the air
permeability of the joint may be used for measuring the
extraneous air leakage or it may be necessary to provide ad-
ditional air metering equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4
The test shall be repeated with negative differential
pressures by reversing the installation of the joint so that its
interior surface forms a part of the internal face of one wall of
the chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method adopted to measure the air leakage shall be stated
in the test report. The air temperature of the laboratory and the
test chamber shall be measured and recorded in the test report.

Expression of results<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The air permeability at each differential pressure shall be
recorded to the nearest 0,l m3/h. The higher of the two flow
readings for each pressure (measured once during the increas-
ing phase and then during the decreasing phase) shall be noted
in the test report, together with the accuracy to be expected
from the measuring instruments used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
