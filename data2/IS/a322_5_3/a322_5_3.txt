Part 1, 2, 3 and 4 are thus not to be

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part 51%:~ 3 ) was
adopted
by
the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 28 October
1987, after the draft finalized
by
the Illuminating

Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the Electrotechnical
Division

IS : 2149*
was first published
in 1962 and
subsequently
revised in 1970 to include
photo-
metric
requirements
and
photometric
test
procedures.
In
order
to take
account
of the
developments
in the field of illumination
engi-
neering,
this standard
has
now
been
prepared
as a part of a new series of Indian
standards
on

The sections
of Part 5, in making
reference
to any other parts of the
standard,
specify
the
extent
to which that section
is applicable
and
the order in which the tests are to be performed
they also
include
additional
requirements
as
necessary.
The
order
in which the clauses
in
Part
1: 2, 3 and 4 are numbered,
therefore,
has
no particular
significance
as the order in which
their
provisions
apply
is determined
for each
type of luminaire
or group of luminaires
by the
appropriate
section
of
Part
5. All sections
of
Part 5 are self-contained

do not
contain

The
use
of
the
Standard

is
governed by the provisions of the Bureau of Indian
Standards Act, 1986 and the Rules and Regulations
made

The Standard
Mark on products
covered by an Indian
Standard
conveys the assu-
rance that they have been produced to comply with
the
requirements
of that standard
under
a well-
defined
system
of inspection,
testing
and quality
control which is devised and supervised by BIS and
operated
by the producer.
Standard marked products
are also continuously
checked by BIS for conformity
to that standard
as a further
safeguard.

under which a licence
for the  use,of  the
Standard  Mark may be granted
to manufacturers
or
producers
may
be obtained
from

<<HEADING level=3>>--IS : 10322 ( Part 5/Set 3 ) - 1987<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The values for the pull and the torque to be
applied depend
on the weight of the supply
cables. In general, the specified values are ade-
quate, but for luminaires intended to be moun-
ted higher than 20 m and where the weight of
the supply cables affecting the cord anchorage
exceeds 4 kg, a pull of 100N and the torque of
O-35 Nm are applied,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-6.3.1.2  The constant
evenly distributed
load is applied for
10 min on the luminaire
using sand bags providing 1.5 kN/ms ~of lantern
projected area for mounting heights up to 8 m,
2.0 kN/mZ for mounting heights of 8 m to less
than 15 m and 2.4 kN/n@ for mounting heights
of 15 m and over. The luminaire is then turned
180°, in the vertical plane, about
the point of
-attachment,
and the test is repeated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1.3
During the test, there shall be no
failure or movement about the point of attach-
ment and after either
part of this test, there
shall be no permanent set exceeding

shall be provi-
ded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1  The photometric data of a luminaire shall
consist of a set of luminous intensity
values in
different directions, derived from measurement
on a distribution photometer (gonophotometer).
The
coordinate
system to be used and the
directions
in which luminous intensity values
are required are specified in 12.2 to 12.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For adjustable lampholders or optical parts,
suitable
reference
marks
shall
be provided.
Compliance shall be checked by inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2 The coordinate
system used for defining
the space around the road lighting luminaire is
known as the C-gamma system and is shown in
Fig. 1. The centre
of the coordinate
system
coincides with the centre of the optical
system
of the luminaire.
The vertical axis of the system
is formed
by the perpendicular
line -dropped
from the centre of the luminaire to the horizon-
tal plane to be illuminated,
independent of any
luminaire
tilt.
Vertical
half
planes
rotate
around this axis.
The
half-planes
parallel
to
the longitudinal
roadway
axis are defined by
the angles C=
0” and C = 180’.
The
half-
planes
perpendicular
to
the
road
axis are
defined by the angles C = 90” on the road side
andC=
270’ on the kerbside.
The elevation
angles in these
planes are indicated
by
y,
increasing from vertically downwards y = 0” to
vertically
upwards y = 180’.
Every direction
is clearly defined b,y values of C and y.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
