<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of lndian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Soil
Quality
and Improvement
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Food and Agriculture
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ability of soil to store water is called its water retention
capacity.
This depends
upon the quantity
and
arrangement
of various  sized particles, namely, sand,-silt and  clay. Since water is retained
in the pores created
by the arrangement
of these primary particles,
it is more appropriate
to define water retention
in terms of size,
number
and arrangement
of pores rather than of particles. The porosity is more for clay than sandy soil.
In
swelling
soils porosity
can not be precisely
defined.
Similarly,
the presence of high organic carbon content
and sodium
in the exchange
complex
modify
the water retention
capacity
of soils. The use of the term
‘capacity’
is, however,
misleadin g as the soil-water
system is not static but dynamic.
The water movement
does not begin or cease at a particular
value of soil-water content but is a continuous
process.
For this reason
the use of soil-water
constants
such as hygroscopic
coefficient
point is not preferred as these represent
some
arbitrary
values.
More important
is the energy
with which water is held in the soil, also termed
as the
‘intensity’
parameter.
The energy of water in a saturated soil is nearly the same as that of pure free water at
the same temperature
and elevation.
However,
with the decrease
in water content
of sail, adsorptive
and
capillary
forces become increasingly
important and consequently
decrease the potential energy (capacity to do
work) of soil water. The total potential energy of water in soil is divided into four components,
namely, (i) the
matric potential,
due to attraction
of soil matrix for water, (ii) the osmotic potential
due to dissolved
salts,
(iii) the gravitational
potential
due to position,
and (iv) the pressure potential
due to external gas pressure or
water column.
In saturated
soil the matric potential
is negligible,
while for unsaturated
soils the pressure
potential
is negligible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Matric potential
results from forces associated
with the coloidal matrix and includes
forces associated
with
adsorption,
capillarity,
and curved air-water interfaces. This is defined with respect to a free water at the same
elevation
temperature
and pressure.
It has a negative
sign which is often expressed as matric suction or soil
moisture
tension.
Since the suction and tension terms are themselves
negative these are used with a positive
sign.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The soil-water
is not equally
available
to the plants in the entire soil-moisture
range from saturation
to any
value in the dry range. As the matric potential decreases so is the decrease in water avaitability.
The range’of
water potential
of agricultural
significance
is usually from -l/3 (or -l/10
for coarse textured
soils to -15 bar
under aerable soil conditions,
and between
positive heads -15 bar under unaerobic
conditions).
The particle
and pore-size
distributions
are reflected
in the relationship
between
water content
and water potential
of a
soil. The curves showing the relationship
are known as ‘soil moisture characteristic
curves’. These curves are
not unique in character as they exhibit certain amount of hysteresis
due to their dependency
on soil structure
but do provide
useful
information
on available
water storage capacity
of soils, moisture
depletion
at a
particular
suction
and basic information
regarding
soil-water
relationships.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard prescribes
method for determination
of
water retention
capacity
in soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2
DETERMINAT-fON
OF WATER RETENTION
CAPACITY
IN SOILS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In a saturated
soil at equilibrium
with free water at
the same elevation,
the actual pressure is atmospheric,
and hence the hydrostatic
pressure and the suction or
tension
are zero. As suction
is increased
or water
pressure becomes higher than atmospheric
the largest
pores
which
can
not
retain
water
against
this
exceeding
pressure
begin
to empty.
This critical
suction
is called the air-entry
suction.
Its. value
is
generally
-small and distinct
in coarse-textured
and
well aggregated
soils.
If suction is further increased,
more water is drawn out of the soil and more of the
relatively
large pores will drain cut.
In other words
as each increment
of water is lost from the soil,, the
work that must be done to remove the next increment
increases
(or soil will release water at higher applied
suctions).
The influence
of suction to remove a small
increment
of water is different
for each soil as the
amount
of water retained
in soil at equilibrium
is a
tinction
of the sizes and volumes
of the water-filled
pores and hence it is a function
of the matric suction
or matric
potential.
This
function
is determined
experiementally
and represented
graphically
by a
curve known as soil-moisture
retention
curve, or soil-
moisture
characteristic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tension Table -
In tension table the flexible
plastic
tubing
is tilled
with distilled
water
without any air bubble.
It is then placed on a
movable
arm of a stand having a scale.
The
desired
suction
is created
by varying
the
difference
in ~the levels of the fixed Buchner
funnel at the middle of sample soil core and
the point of outflow
in the flexible
tubing.
The undisturbed
soil sample is placed on the
saturated sintered disc glass funnel and a good
contact
between
the soil and sintered
plate
ensured.
The soil is fully
saturated
from
underneath
by raising the point of outflow of
the flexible
water
hanging
column.
After
saturation, cover the buchner funnel to prevent
evaporation
and lower the point of outflow
until
the desired
suction
is obtained.
The
suction may be kept 0, 20, 50, 100, 150 and
200 cm to determine
soil water
retention
corresponding
to 0 (saturation),
0.20, 0.05,
0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 bar. At each equilibrium,
when
the water
flow
ceases
through
the
outflow
tube of the hanging
column,
soil
sample is weighed, over-dried
and reweighed
to ascertain
the water retention
capacity
of
the soil at that suction. Usually water retention
up to 0.2 bar is determined
by this method
and beyond
this suction
it is determined
by
pressure plate apparatus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Tension Tub/e -
Consisting
of sintered disc
glass buchner
funnel of diameter aboyt 6 cm
and height
IO-12 cm, connected
to an over-
flow system by means of flexible transparent
plastic tubing.
The plate of the funnel
is of
sufficiently
fine porosity
(G-4) to preclude
air-entry
over the range of desired suction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure
Plate
Apparatus
-
Put desired
number
of rubber rings on the ceramic plate
cell. About 12 such rings are accommodated
in one plate cell. Prepare soil samples
after
grinding
and passing through a 2 mm round-
hole sieve. Pour a representative
soil sample
slowly with the help of a spoon into the rubber
ring. It is better to run a duplicate
sample for
each soil type. Level the samples in the rings<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure Plate -

<<PARAGRAPH>>sieving
alter
the
pore-size
distribution,
particularly
of larger pores,
and the water
retention
in the
low suction
range
with
disturbed
samples
may not reveal
the true
information.
The undisturbed
samples
are
taken with the help of specially designed core-
sampler
where
there
is a provision
to
accommodate
small rings, 3 cm high and of
about 6 cm in diameter.
The core sampler
is
slowly pushed into the soil to the desired depth
through
repeated
droppings
of the hammer
on the sampler.
This
way
representative
samples from a given depth in the soil profile
are obtained.
The core containing
rings
is
disconnected
and the rings are slowly pushed
out. The excess soil protruding
from the rings
is trimmed
off and the soil samples
along
with rings are wrapped
in the polyethylene
envelopes and may be stored in the refrigerator
for use. Rest ofthe procedure for determining
water
retention
capacity
is the
same
as
described
for disturbed
soil samples.
In
compact and slowly permeable
soils the time
required
for saturating
the soil samples
may
be extended.
It is also desirable
to saturate
the soil samples in the vacuum desiccator.
In
that case the ceramic
plate cell along
with
soil samples is put in the vacuum
desiccator
connected
with motor operated suction pump
assembly for about 10 minutes before placing
in the extractor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and note down the layout of samples placed
on the ceramic plate cell. Put excess of water
slowly on the plate cell and allow samples to
saturate
at least
for
16-20
hours
in the
presence
of free water.
After this period,
remove
the excess water from the ceramic
plate with a pipette
or syringe.
Mount
the
cell
in the extractor
and connect
up the
outflow tubes.
Use the plastic spacers if there
are more than one plate cells to be put inside
the extractor.
Close all unused
outlet ports
with the plug bolts that are provided.
Check
that ‘0’ ring is in place.
Mount lid and screw
down
clamping
bolts. Build up the desired
)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pressure
in the extractor
to the equilibrium
value somewhat
slowly. At this point water
will start flowing
out of the outlet tube and
continues
to flow till equilibrium
is reached
inside the extractor. After the equilibrium
has
been attained,
the samples
can be removed.
Most soils will approach hydraulic equilibrium
in one or two days depending
upon the soil
type.
Slowly permeable
soils like alkali soils
may take longer time.
At the close of the run
the pressure
regulator
is shut off and the
pressure
exhausted
from the extractor.
The
clampling
bolts and lid are removed
and soil
samples
transferred
immediately
to the
moisture
boxes.
The
moisture
boxes
containing
soil samples
are weighed
in the
balance
and fresh weight
is recorded.
The
moisture
boxes are put in the drying
oven.
The temperature
in the oven is maintained
at
105- 110°C and samples are dried to a constant
weight
at least for 12 hours and reweighed
after cooling
in a desiccator.
Determine
the
tare weight of the moisture
cans.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Calculations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The moisture
content
in the soil sample, after it has
been equilibrated
against
the applied
pressure
and
oven dried, is calculated
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Percent soil moisture content by weight (w)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedure
is repeated
for determining
water retention
at other equilibrium
pressures
to construct
the curve over the entire soil-
moisture
range.
It is desirable
to determine
soil-water
retention
at equilibrium
pressures
of 0, l/50, l/20, l/10,
l/3, l/2, 1, 5, 10 and
15 bar.
A plot of soil moisture
content (on
the X-axis)
versus suction (on the Y-axis) is
drawn.
Such curves can be drawn for different
soil types and water retention
at any given
suction can be obtained
from these curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
