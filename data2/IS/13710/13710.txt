<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Tndian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the Dentistry
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Medical
Equipment
and
Hospital
Planning
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this standard,
wherever
possible,
appropriate
test methods
have been specified as per the relevant
Indian
Standards
concerning
dental
cements.
However,
in view of a number
of unique
properties
exhibited
by the carboxylate
cements,
it has been
considered
necessary
to introduce
certain
new
test methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
is based on ISO 4104  :  1984 ‘Dental
zinc
polycarboxylate
cements
issued
by the
International
Organization
for Standardization
( ISO ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
is one of a series of Indian
Standards
on
dental
cements.
Other
standards
in the
series are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in accordance

<<PARAGRAPH>>Measure
the combined

quantity
of cement,
mixed as described
in 7.1,
to
cover the plate on the centre of one
of the
glass
plates ( see 7.6.1.1 ). Place the second
glass

apply,
by
means
of the loading
device ( see 7.6.1.2 ), a load
of mass

It is essential
to ensure
that
the cement
completely
fills the
area
between
the
two glass plates. Ten minutes
after the commence-
ment
of mixing,
measure
the
thickness
of the
two
glass

and
the
cement

micrometer
( see 7.6.1.3 ). Calculate
the difference
in the thickness
