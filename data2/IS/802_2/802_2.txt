F O R E W O R D
0.1  This Indian Standard (Part II) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 25 October 1978, after the draft finalized by
the Structural Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Structural and Metals Division Council and the Civil
Engineering Division Council.
0.2  With the publication of IS : 802 (Part I)-1977* provisions-
regarding loads, material, permissible stresses and design aspect have
been covered. In this part requirements regarding fabrication,
galvanizing, inspection and packing of overhead transmission line
towers have been covered.
0.3  This standard keeps in view the practices being followed in the
country in this field. Assistance has been derived from the ‘Guide for
design of steel transmission line towers’ issued by the American
Society of Civil Engineers.
0.4  This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (August 1992).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.
0.5  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS : 2-1960†. The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE
