<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee, CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Fourth Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 20 June
1989, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1951 and subsequently
revised in 1958, 1967 and 1976.
This
fourth revision incorporates the experience gained with the use of this specification
and brings the
standard in line with the present practices followed in the production and testing of cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since the third revision of this standard
was published, a large number of amendments have been
issued from time to time in order to modify various requirements based on experience gained with the
use of the standard and the requirements of the users, and also keeping in view the raw materials and
fuels available in the country for the manufacture
of cement.
The important amendments
include
increase in insoluble residue from 2 to  4  percent,
incorporating
33 MPa as the 28-day compressive
strength, making autoclave soundness test compulsory irrespective of magnesia content,
incorporating
a provision for retest in respect of autoclave
soundness test after aeration of. the cement, incorpo-
rating a clause on false set and permitting packaging of cement in 25-kg bags.
In view of these large
number of amendments,
the Sectional
Committee
decided to bring out this fourth revision of the
standard incorporating
all these amendments so as to make it more convenient for the users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Sectional Committee
also decided
that ordinary
Portland
cement should be designated by  its
28-day compressive strength and, therefore, the title of this standard has been-modified in this revision,
aftei taking out the provisions
relating
to low heat Portland
cement for covering in a separate
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mass of cement packed in bags and the tolerance
requirements
for the mass of cement packed in
bags shall be in accordance with the relevant provisions of the  Standards of Weights and Measures
( Packaged
Commodities ) Rules, 1977  and B-l.2 ( see Annex B ).
Any modification in these rules in
respect of tolerance on mass of cement would apply automatically to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard contains clause 11.4.1 which gives option to the purchaser and clauses 6.5 and 9.3 which
call for agreement between the purchaser and the supplier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard, considerable assistance has been rendered by the National Council
for Cement and Building Materials, New Delhi as many of the revisions are based on  the studies
carried out by them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation
of this standard is given
in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with 1s 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The  number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of  the  specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in aggregates
in some parts of the
country.
On large and

it is
advisable

In the case of reactive
aggregates,
the
use of cement
with alkali content
below 0.6 percent
expressed
as sodium
oxide
( Nap0 ), is recommended.
Where,
however,
such cements
are not available,
use of Portland pozzolana cement or cement pozzolanic
admixture is recommended.
