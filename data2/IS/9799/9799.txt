FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 29 April
1981, after the draft
finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
The Indian
Standards
Institution
has
already
published
a series
of
standards
on
methods
of testing
cement
and
concrete.
It
has been
recognized
that reproducible
and repeatable
test
results can be obtained
only with standard
testing
equipment
capable
of giving
the desired
level
of accuracy.
The Sectional
Committee
has, therefore,
decided
to bring
out a series
of specifications
covering
the
requirements
of equipment
used for testing
cement
and
concrete,
to encourage
their
development
and manufacture
in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This
standard
has
been
prepared
to
cover
the
requirements
of
pressure
meter used for the determination
of air content
of freshly mixed
concrete.
The method
of determining
air
content
using pressure
meter
has been covered
in IS : 1199-1959’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the
practices
in the
field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
ofthis
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
cjff in accord-
ance
with
IS:
2-1960t.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in
the rounded
off value should
be the same as that
of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

surface
of the flange.
The outer rim and lower surface
of the flange and
the sloping
interior
shall be such that the cover and the measuring
bowl

for a suitable
range
in
air
contc nt
shall
be in
percent
and
of
divisions
not
less
than 2 mm wide, and to an
accuracy
of 0.1 percent,
as determined
by
the proper
air pressure
calibration
test.
The
internal
diameter
of the
stand
pipe shall be such that
under
the
normal
operating
pressure,
the
water
column
will
be lowered
sufficiently
to measure
air content
up to
0.1 percent.
The applied
pressure
shall be shown by
a pressure
gauge
connected
to the air chamber
above the water column.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
