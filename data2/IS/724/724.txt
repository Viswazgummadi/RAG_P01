<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This revised Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 10 March 1964, after the draft finalized by
the Builder’s Hardware Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Building Division Council.
0.2  This standard was first issued in 1956 specifying the various
dimensions and other requirements of cup, ruler and square hooks
and screw eyes in the fps system. In view of the adoption of the metric
system of weights and measures by the Government of India, the need
for revision of this standard with a view to metricizing it and bringing
it in line with IS : 451-1961 Specification for Wood Screws (  Revised  )
in regard to form of screw thread and other relevant requirements,
has long been felt by both the trade and consumers. This revision,
therefore, specifies the various dimensions and other requirements of
hooks and eyes made of mild steel and brass in the metric units, and
the details of screw threads and other relevant requirements in
accordance with IS : 451-1961.
0.3  The Sectional Committee responsible for the preparation of this
standard has taken into consideration the views of producers,
consumers and technologists and has related the standard to the
manufacturing and trade practices followed in the country in this
field. Due weightage has also been given to the need for international
co-ordination among standards prevailing in different countries of the
world.
0.4  Wherever a reference to any Indian Standard appears in this
specification, it shall be taken as a reference to its latest version.
0.5  This edition 2.2 incorporates Amendment No. 2 (January 1988).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.
0.6  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 724 - 1964<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>accordance with IS : 2-1960 Rules for Rounding Off Numerical Values
(  Revised  ). The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.
0.6  This standard is intended chiefly to cover the technical provisions
relating to cup, ruler and square hooks and screw eyes, and it does not
include all the necessary provisions of a contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>l.1  This standard lays down requirements for mild steel and brass
cup, ruler and square hooks and screw eyes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. TYPES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Hooks shall be of the following types:
a) Shouldered cup hooks (  see  Fig. 1 )
b) Shouldered ruler hooks (  see  Fig. 2 )
c) Shouldered square hooks (  see  Fig. 3 )
d) Plain cup hooks (  see  Fig. 4 )
e) Plain ruler hooks (  see  Fig. 5 )
f) Plain square hooks (  see  Fig. 6 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Screw eyes shall be of one type as illustrated in Fig. 7.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. DESIGNATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The designation of hooks and screw eyes covered by this standard
shall be based on the type, length, and screw designation No. of the
