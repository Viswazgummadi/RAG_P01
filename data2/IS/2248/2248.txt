<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
covers
the
definition
of
common
terms applicable
to clay products
for
building.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.4  Maturing Temperature
-
The temperature
of firing at which
the
clay body
used in the
manufacture
of the building
material acquires
the
optimum
mechanical
strength
and
the
necessary
physical
properties
to satisfy
the
requirements
set down in the
standard
specifi-
cations for the relevant building material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  DEFINITIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 ‘Raw Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1  Clay -
An
earthy
or
stony
mineral
aggregate
consisting
essentially
of
hydr-ous
silicates
of alumina;
plastic
when
sufficiently
pulverised
and wetted:
rigid
when dry; and
vitreous
when
fired
to
a sufficiently
high
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.5  Pugging -
This is the process by which
the lean and plastic
clay is tempered
before
moulding.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.2  Shale -
A thinly
stratified,
consolidated
sedimentary
clay with well-marked
cleavage
parallel to the bedding.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.6  Sanding -
The operation
of imparting
to
the clay product
a rough face
by blowing sand
on to it, that
is, by
sand
blasting
prior to
drying.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.3  Surface
Clay
-
An
unconsolidated,
unstratified
clay, occurring
on the surface.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.7  Soaking -
The process
of imparting
heat
to the clay product
by maintaining
the tempe-
rature
constant
for a specified
period
near
about the maturing
temperature.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Manufacture<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.1  Flashing -
The operation
of heating the
clay products
with and without air alternately,
where irregularly
colourd
bricks or tiles are
required.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.8  Tempering -
This is the process of mixing
cIay, water
and other
ingredients,
if any, by
which a homogeneous
paste is produced.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.2  Hand Moulding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.9  Weathering
-
This
is the
process
of
exposing excavated
clay mass in the open air,
so that it comes in contact
with natural agen-
cies, such as sun, rain
and
frost due to which
there is change
in some
of the physical and
chemical
properties
that are helpful in subse-
quent treatment
and also impart better working
properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.2.1
Ground moulding -
When
the clay pro-
ducts are moulded by hand
on ground and the
moulder
shifts
his
position
as
moulding
progresses.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.2.2  Sand moulding -
The process
of moul-
ding of bricks
by hand
in which
fine sand is
used to dust the mould before
throwing in the
clot.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.210
Lime Blowing -
If the soil contains
lime
noduIes or calcarious
‘kankars’ the bricks get
cracked
due
to the
formation
of Calcium
Oxide within the brick mass during firing. The
oxides so formed expand after taking moisture
from the air and cause blowing of the bricks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.2.3  Slop moulding -
The process
of moul-
ding bricks
by hand
in which the
mould
is
dipped in water, before clay is thrown into it.<<HEADING_END>>

moulding
-
Where
bricks
are
moulded by hand on tabIe and then transported

dipped in water<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.11  Docking -
Docking

Lamination -
Lamination
is a defect
normalIy found
in the extruded
bricks caused
by the differential
movement
of the clay mass
when it is pushed by the auger or wing knife
of the extrusion
machine
towards the die of
the machine.
If the spacer is too short, there
may be hollow
core in the
centre
when the
clay mass enters the die.
In the die this core
is flattened
and owing
to the rotation
of the
clav it shows in the extruded
brick
as an ‘S’
crack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
