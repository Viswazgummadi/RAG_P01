FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 21 February
1974, after the draft finalized by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Perforated
concrete
pipes are
used
for
underdrainage
work
in
infiltration galleries, reclaiming water logged areas and for similar other
purposes.
This standard has been prepared with the object of providing
guidance to the manufacturers
and users in obtaining perforated
concrete
pipes capable of giving satisfactory
service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This
standard
contains
a
clause

shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant

case of pipes made from ordinary
Portland
cement or blastfurnace
slag
cement,
and not less than
1 week in case of pipes made from rapid-

Pipes may be water cured by immersing in
-water, covering with water-saturated
material or by a system of perforated
pipes, mechanical
sprinklers,
porous hose; or by any other
approved
method that will keep the pipe moist during the specified curing period.
In
the case of large
pipes .projecting
partly
above
water
level,
the
projecting portion shall be kept wet by any suitable means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
