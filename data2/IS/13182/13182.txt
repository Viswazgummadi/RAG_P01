<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the
Waterproofing
and Damp-Proofing
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bathroom,
kitchen,
water closet and to a lesser extent varandah,
balconies
and sunshades
may be
termed as wet areas of a buildings which are more vulnerable
to water due to their functional
require-
ments.
These wet areas are one of the main source of leakage and dampness in a building
which leads
to unhygeinic
conditions
affecting
badly
the health
and comfort
of the inhabitants
and seriously
deteriorating
the stability
of the building. The causes of dampness and leakage may be due to defective
design, sub-standard
material,
improper execution and incorrect
usage by the occupant.
This standard
is intended
to provide guidance on provisions for preventing
dampness
and leakage arising out of the
wet areas of a building under construction.
Problem of leakage and dampness in building already in
use require different approach
in the analysis of the cause and remedial
measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Where

shall be given
to the following:
i) Firstly, temporary
laying
of pipe line
and WC pan should be done by giving
temporary
packings.
The level should
be checked
and corrected
taking into
account the final finish level of floor-
ing. The WC pan may be taken out and
pipe joints filled up.
After WC pan is
fitted
and
jointed,
cement
concrete
block
should be put around this joint
and then depressed
portion
filled up.
ii) A suitable slope should be given to the
depressed RCC floor which
accommo-
dates
the pan ‘and trap
to lead the
water to the rear portion
of WC pan.
The
slab
should
not
be depressed
much beyond what is necessary
that is
only
that
portion
of the RCC
slab
which accommodates
the pan and the
trap should be depressed.
A corrosion
resistant GI pipe of 25 mm dia should
be provided
to drain off any
water
accumulated
in the
depressed
area
( see Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>f)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the bath and Indian type WC are
accommodated
in a single toilet connect-

the
slope of floor in

<<PARAGRAPH>>Where
squatting
pan is fixed with
rim
either in line with tile flooring below the
flooring the junction
of flooring tiles and
rim is the
main point
of leakage.
To
avoid
this
suitable
nonshrink,
bonding
material
should
be used for fixing the
last tile and the joint between
the floor-
ing and the rim of the WC ( see Fig. 3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As far as possible integral
tread WC pan
should be preferred
to avoid seepage from
the joints.
Where
separate

85/25 grade
bitumen
conforming
to
IS 702 : 1988 at the rate of l-5 kg/ma

<<PARAGRAPH>>When floor
trap is almost
at the floor
level, whenever
a great amount
of water
is suddenly spilt, a pool of water is creat-
ed around
the trap
which
may
cause
dampness. To prevent
this a well defined
waterproof
depression
should
be cons-
turcted
around
the trap. Waterproofing
of the depressed
area should be done as
explained
in 4.2.2 (e) ( iii ).
The depression in the RCC slab for fixing
of floor traps in kitchen
and bath should
be adequate.
c) When tran is located deen into the floor
space,
additional
piece Gf pipe shall be
provided to avoid any gap between floor
level and the top of the trap.
For this a
galvanized
or MS pipe which is custom
built
and which
can
be lead
caulked
properly with trap should be used ( see
Fig. 8 ).

of the cast iron
pipes and traps proper,
a measuring mug
made from galvanized sheet having cana-
city to havethe

specification,
shall be used. The quantity
of molten lead to be used shall be marked

<<PARAGRAPH>>the
tank,
therefore,
should
be
given
double
treatment
for
waterproofing.
Clearance
between the terrace
level
and
tank should be atleast one metre to facili-
tate
repairs, if any. The scour pipeline
should
be led to suitable outlet to avoid
damage to terracing
due to flow of water.
The pipe line should be capable of being
cleared during maintenance.
Overflow from the overhead
tank
should
not fall freely on the terrace
damaging
the waterproofing
treatment.
Overflow
should be led to a rain water pipe or any
other
outlet and should end in a mos-
quito proof coupling.
Under the overhead tank vegetation
like
peepal, lichen, moss, etc, can grow damag-
ing continuity
of
waterproofing
layer
thus providing
direct access to the water
to the building fabric. Special care has to
be taken
to avoid
nooks
and
corners
where moisture would encourage
speedy
growth
of vegetation.
Frequent
inspec-
tions are necessary to remove vegetation.
On the terrace
long horizontal
lengths
df piping are laid from the overhead
tank
to the shaft wherever water pipelines
are
taken down. These
pipelines
should
be
pla.ced on proper
pillars.
The persons
working
on the terrace have a tendency
to step on these pipelines,
thus damaging
the joints
through
which water leakages
can take
place.
In addition,
wherever
these
long
lengths
of pipelines
have
reverse
level air ‘lock
can take
place,
therefore,
such
situation
should
be
avoided.
The tank supports which may be of b:ick
masonry,
RCC and
steel
should
have
proper flushing with terracing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case
of water
supply
and
sanitary
piping, in course of time, some deficiencies
in the maintenance
may
lead to pipe
leakage.
If the pipes are placed
on the
wall, the leaked water will create damp-
ness on the wall. In the case of sanitary
piping it should be separated
by 100 mm
from
the
wall surface
and
the water
supply line should be separated by 40 mm
from the surface.
The pipes either cast iron or asbestos are
rigid compared
with building.
With
the
seasonal variation
of temperature,
build-
ings will have horizontal
and
vertical
displacement.
The pipe connections
to
the wall should be capable of absorbing
these
changes
in
the
sanitary
shaft
in the vertical and horizontal
directions.
Use of flexible
materials
like lead for
jointing
allows certain
amount
of play
whereas the cement joint will not allow
the same. Embedding of pipes on the shaft
walls or any other building portion increa-
ses the problems
of such changes due to
seasonal
variations
and special care has
to be taken to allow for the freedom
of
movement
while designing
the pipe sys-
tem along with shaft.
Sanitary shaft should be so designed
that
condensation
of water
does
not
take
place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
