<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after the draft
finalized by the Farm Implements and Machinery Sectional Committee had been approved by the Food and
Agriculture Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mouldboard plough is a primary tillage implement used for mechanical manipulation of soil. The mouldboard
ploughs drawn by animals are being manufactured and used in large numbers in the country. Earlier this
standard was published in two parts; Part 1 covering the requirements of turnwrest type and Part 2 fixed
type mouldboard plough. As presently turnwrest type mouldboard plough are not being manufactured and
used within the country, it was decided to withdraw the provision relating to this type of plough and publish
the standard covering
the requirements of fixed type only. In this revision the requirement of shares has
been included which was earlier covered in separate standard IS 6327  :  1971 ‘Animal drawn mouldboard
plough shares’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The figures given in the standard are meant to serve only as illustrations and should not be considered as
suggestive of any standard design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.  The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
