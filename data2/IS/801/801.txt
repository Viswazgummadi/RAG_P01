<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
(First
Revision)
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 January
1975, after the draft finalized
by the
Structural
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by
the
Structural
and
Metals
Division
Council
and
Civil
Engineering
Divicion
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Cold-formed
steel structural
members
are cold-formed
in rolls or press
brakes
from flat steel, generally
not thicker
than
12.5 mm.
For repetitive
mass production
they are formed
most economically
by cold-rolling,
while
smaller quantities
of special shapes are most economically
produced
on press
brakes.
The
latter
process,
with its great
versatility
of shape
variation,
makes this type of conrtruction’as
adaptable
to special requirements
as rein-
forced concrete
is in its field of use.
Members
are connected
by spot, fiilet,
plug or slot welds, by screw, bolts, cold ‘rivets or any other special devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3
This
type of construction
is appropriate
and economical
under one or
more  of the following
conditions:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Where moderate
loads and spans make the thicker,
hot-rolled
shapes
uneconomical,
for example, joists, purlins, girts, roXtrusses,
complete
framing
for
one-
and
two-storey
residential,
commercial
and
industrial
structures;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Where
it is desired that load-carrying
members
also provide
useful
surfaces,
for example,
iioor panels and roof decks, mostly installed
without any shoring
and wall panels;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Where sub-assemblies
of such members
can be prefabricated
in the
plant,
reducing
site erection
to a minimum
of simple operations,
for example,
sub-assembly
of panel framing
up to 3  x  4 metros and
more for structures
listed in (a), standardized
package
shed-type
utility buildings,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>at least three more tests of the same kind shall be made.
The
average of the three lowest values of all tests made shall then be
regarded as the result of the series of tests.
b) Determinations
of allowable load-carrying
capacity shall be made
on the basis that the member,
assembly, or connection
shall be
capable of sustaining a total load, including the weight of the test
specimen, equal to twice the live load plus one-and-a-half
the dead
load without failure.
Where the governing design load is due in
whole or part to wind, earthquake
loads, or combined forces, the
foregoing load factors shall be reduced by dividing by 14 in accord-
ance with 6.1.2.
Furthermore,
harmful local distortions which interfere with the
proper functioning
of the member or assembly or its connections
shall not develop during the test at a total load, including the weight
of the test specimen, equal to the dead load plus li times the live
load.
c) In evaluating
test results, due consideration
shall be given to any
differences that may exist between the yield point of steel from
which the tested sections are formed and the minimum yield point
specified for the steel which the manufacturer intends to use.
Consideration
shall also be given to any variation or difference
which may exist between the design thickness and the thickness of the
specimens used in the tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Full Section Tests -
These provisions are intended to apply only to
the determination
of the mechanical
properties of full formed sections for
;hr: purposes defined in 9.1.2.
They are not to be construed as permitting
the use of test procedures instead of the usual design calculations.
Tests to
determine mechanical properties shall be conducted in accordance with the
following:
a) For tensile yield point determinations
refer to 9.1.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Compressive yield point determinations
shall be made by means of
compression tests* of short specimens of the section and shall be taken
as the smaller value of either the maximum compressive strength of
the section divided by the cross-sectional
area or the stress defined
by one of the following methods:
1) For sharp yielding steel the yield point shall be determined by the
autographic
diagram method or by the total strain under load
method,
2) For gradual yielding steel the yield point shall be determined by
the strain under load method or by the 0.2 percent ofiet method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

described
above shall

the principal
effect of the loading
to which the member
will
be subjectecl
in service will be to produce
bending

shall be determined

In determining
such
yield point tests shall be made
on specimens
cut from the scctioil.
Each such specimen
shall consist of one ,complete
flange plus a por-
tion of the web of such flat-width
ratio that the value of Q for the
specimen
is unity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) For acceptance
and control
purposes,
two full section

made from each
lot
of not more than 50
tonnes
nor less than
30 tonnes of each
section,
or one test from
each
lot of less than
30 tonnes of each section.
For
this purpose
a lot may be defined
as that tonnage
of one section that is formed
in a single production
run of material
from one heat or blow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) At the option
of the manufacturer,
either
tension

tests may
be used for routine
.acceptance

purposes,

the manufacturer
demonstrates
that
such
tests reliably
indicate
the yield point of the section when subjected
to the kind of
stress under which the member
is to be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3.2
Tests  of  Flat Elements of Formed Sections -
The
yield point
of flats
Fvr  shall be established
by means of a weighted
average
of the yield points
of standard
tensile coupons
taken longitudinally
from the flat portions
of a
representative
cold-formed
member.
The
weighted
average
shall be
the
sum of the products of the average yield point for each flat portion
times the
ratio of the cross-sectional
area of that flat portion
to the total area of flats
in the cross section.
The exact number
of such coupons will depend on the
shape of the member,
that is, on the number
of flats in the cross section.
At
least one tensile coupon shall be taken from the middle of each flat.
If the
actual
virgin
yield point
exceeds
the specified
minimum
yield point,
the
yield point
of the flats  FYI  shall be adjusted
by multiplying
the test values
by
the ratio
of the specified
minimum
yield
point
to the actual
virgin
yield point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
