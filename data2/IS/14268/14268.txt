<<PARAGRAPH>>Concrete Reinforcement
Sectional Committee, CED 54<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
Concrete Reinforcement
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With the development
of prestressed concrete technology and its successful application in the field of
construction, it became necessary to use prestressing tendons capable of developing and retaining large
concentrated
prestressing forces. This led to the development of stress relieved strand. Low relaxation
strand is further improvement in this field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The low relaxation property is achieved by a process called ‘stabilising’. This is essentially a hot stretching
process, in which prestressing strand is subjected to a pre-determined
tension during stress-relieving heat
treatment. This results in linear hardening of the steel which substantially increases the resistance to creep
and thereby reduces the relaxation losses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given at Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (rev&d)‘. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

ing on the breaking strength of the strand given in

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3 The wire used in the manufacture
of the
strand shall be well and cleanly drawn to the
specified dimensions and shall be’ sound and free
from splits, surface flaws, piping and any other
defects likely to impair its use in the manufacture
of the strand and the performance of the strand in
prestressed concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 The nominal

nominal
cross sectional area and nominal mass per unit
length of the strand shall be as given in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Physical Requirements

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Strand<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1 The breaking strength,and 0.2 percent proof
load of the strand shall be determined in accord-
ance with IS 1521: 1972 and shall be not less than
the values specified in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The seven wires strand shall have a centre wire at-
least 1.5 percent greater in diameter than the sur-
rounding
wires enclosed
tightly by six helically
placed outer
wires with a uniform length of lay
of atleast 12 times but not more than 16 times
of the nominal diameter of the strand. The wire in
the strand shall be so formed that they shall not
fly out of position when the strand is cut without
seizing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2 Alternatively by mutual agreement between
the purchaser and the manufacturer, the load at 1.0
percent extension may be determined. In this test,
an initial
load equivalent
to
10 percent of
specified minimum breaking strength shall be ap-
plied to the test piece and a sensitive extensometer
then attached. The dial of the latter shall be ad-
justed to read 0.001 mm/mm of the gauge length to
represent the extension due to the initial load. In
case of dispute, 0.2 percent proof stress shall apply.
The load shall be increased until the extensometer
shows an extension corresponding
to 1.0 percent.
The load at this extension shall not be less than
the minimum 0.2 percent proof load specified in
Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3  ‘Joints<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1 There shall be no strand joints or strand
splices in any length of the completed strand, unless
specifically permitted by the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2 During process of manufacture of individual
wires for stranding, welding is permitted only prior
to or at the time of last heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.3 During fabrication of the seven wire strand,
buttwelded joints may be made in the individual
wires, provided there is not more than one such
joint in any 45 msection of the completed strand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Elongation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1 The total elongation under load shall not be
less than 3.5 percent on a minimum gauge length of
600 mm. The total elongation shall be measured by
a suitable extensometer which is attached to the test
piece, after an initial load equivalent to 10 percent
of the required minimum breaking load as specified
in Table 1 has been applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 Treatment of Strand<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1 After stranding, all strands shall be subjected
to a continuous thermal-mechanical
treatment to
produce the prescribed mechanical properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2 Temper
colours that may result from the
thermal operation
are considered normal for the
finished appearance of this strand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Following an extension of 1 percent, the exten-
someter
may be removed and loading continued
to ultimate failure. The elongation value is then
determined
by the movement between the jaw
gripping the test piece on the new base length of jaw
to jaw distance
to which will be added the value
of 1 percent determined
by the extensometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.3 After thermo-mechanical
treatment,
the
strand shall be reformed into coils or wound on to
reels, having core diameter of sufficient size and in
any case not less than 600 mm to ensure that the
strand will lay out straight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 Relaxation Properties<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 Workmanship
and Finish<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1 Low relaxation strand, when initially loaded
to 70 percent
of specified
minimum
breaking
strength of the strand shall have relaxation losses
of not more than 1.8 percent after 100 h and not
more than 2.5 percent after 1 000 h when tested
under the conditions given in 6.4.2 to 6.4.8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The finished strand shall be uniform in diameter
and shall be free from injuries, flaws and imperfec-
tions. Slight rusting, provided it is not sufficient to
cause pits visible to the naked eye, shall not be a
cause for rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
