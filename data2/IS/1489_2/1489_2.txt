<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Part 2 ) ( Third
Revision
) was
adopted
by the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards
after
the
draft
finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been  approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Portland-pozzolana
cement
can
be
produced
either
by
grinding
together
Portland
cement
clinker
and
pozzolana
with addition
of gypsum
or calcium
sulphate,
or by intimately
and uniformly
blending
Portland
cement
and fine pozzolana.
While
grinding
of the two materials
together
presents
no difficulty,
the mixing
of dry powders
uniformly
is extremely
difficult.
The blending
method
should,
therefore,
be
resorted
to
only
when the grinding
method
is impossible
or proves
uneconomical
in a particular
case.
Where
blending
method
is adopted,
every care should
be taken
to see that the blending
is as intimate
as possible.
Generally,
if the
blending
is not uniform,
it is reflected
in the performance
tests.
The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of this
specification
is of the
opinion
that
the
blending
method
should
be confined
to
factories
and such
other
works where
intimate
and uniform
blending
is feasible
with the employment
of requisite
machinery
so as to ensure
uniformity
of produc-
tion and guaranteed
performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Portland-pozzolana
cement
produces
less
heat
of hydration
and
offers
greater
resistance
to the
attack
of aggressive
waters
than
normal
Portland
cement.
Moreover,
it reduces
the
leaching
of
calcium
hydroxide
liberated
during
the setting
and hydration
of cement.
It is particularly
useful
in
marine
and hydraulic
construction
and other
mass concrete
structures.
Portland-pozzolana
cement
can
generally
be
used
wherever
33 grade
ordinary
Portland
cement
is usable
under
normal
conditions.
However,
it should
be appreciated
that all pozzolanas
need not
necessarily
contribute
to strength
at
early ages. In view of this fact, this present
specification
has been prepared
to enable
manufacturers
to
produce
Portland-pozzolana
cement
equivalent
to 33 grade
ordinary
Portland
cement
on
the
basis
of
3, 7 and 28-days
compressive
strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For construction
of structures
using
rapid
construction
methocls
like
slipform
construction,
Portland-
pozzolana
cemcnl
shall  bc used with caution since  4 to 6 h strength
of concrete
is significant
in  such
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published in 1962 and subsequently
revised
in 1967 and
1976.
In this revision
the
standard
has been
split into two parts
based
on the
pozzolana
used
in the
manufacture
of such
cements
in view of the
special
needs
of some
hydraulic
structures
which
require
pozzolana
cement
manufactured
only with fly ash pozzolana
and for
easy
identification
of pozzolana
used in the manu-
facture
of Portland-pozzolana
cement
in the
interest
of consumers.
Part
1 of this
standard
covers
pozzolana
cement
manufactured
by using
only
fly ash pozzolana
and Part 2 covers
pozzolana
cement
manufactured
by using either
calcined
clay or a mixture
of calcined
clay and
fly ash as pozzolana.
In
this revision
both
chemical
and
physical
requirements
have been kept the same as was given
in 1976
version
of this standard
as
amended
from time to time.
Various
requirements
of Portland-pozzolana
cement
given in 1976 version
of  this standard
had
been
modified
from time to time by issuing
amend-
ments
based
on the
experience
gained
with the use of the standard
and the requirements
of the users
and also keeping
in view the raw materials
and fuel available
in the country
for manufacture
of cement
The
important
amendments
include
lowering
the
value
of compressive
strength
in  lime reactivity
test from 5  MPa to 4 MPa,
incorporating
a value of 3 day compressive
strength
as 16 MPa, modifying
the requirement
of sulphuric
anhydride
( SOs ) and
insoluble
residue,
deleting
the
requirement
of
pozzolanicity
test, increasing
the value of 28 days
compressive
atrenth
from 31 MPa to 33 MPa, making
autoclave
soundness
test compulsory
irrespcctivc
of the
magnesia
content
in
cement,
incorporating
a provision
for retest
in respect
of autoclave
soundness
test after
aeration
of the cement,
incorporting
a clause
on false set of cement
and permitting
packaging
of cement
in 25 kg bag\.
All thc\c
an~encl-
ments
have been taken
care of in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mass of cement
