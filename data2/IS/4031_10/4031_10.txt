<<PARAGRAPH>>the individual tests.
Further,
since publication
.
.~~
of the original
standard
in 1968, a number of
standards covering the requirements
of different
equipment
used for testing of cement,
a brief
descripticn
of which was also covered
in the
standard, had been published.
In this revision,
therefore, reference
is given to different
instru-
ment specifications deleting the description of the
instruments, as it has been recognised that repro-
ducible
and
repeatable
test
results
can be
obtained
only with standard
testing equipment
capable of giving desired level of accuracy
This
part ( Part IO) covers determination
of drying
shrinkage of cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part 10 )
( First
Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
on 22 April
1988, after the
draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by
the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Standard
methods
of
testing
cement are
essential adjunct
to the cement
specifications.
This standard
in different
parts lays down the
procedure
for the tests to evaluate the physical
properties of different types of hydraulic cements.
The procedure for conducting
chemical
tests of
hydraulic cement is covered in IS: 4032-1985..<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose
of
deciding
whether
a
particular
requirement
of this standard is com-
plied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall
be rounded
off in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Originally
all
the tests
to
evaluate the
physical properties
of hydraulic
cements were
covered in one standard;
but for facilitating the
use of this standard
and future revisions,
it has
been decided
to
print the different
tests as
different parts of the standard and accordingly,
this revised standard
has been brought
out in
thirteen parts.
This will also facilitate updating<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

).<<HEADING_END>>

tory shall be 65 f 5 percent.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
( Part IO ) covers the
pro-
cedure for determining
the drying shrinkage of
hydraulic
cement as obtained
on
rectangular
specimens,
prepared
and tested under specified
conditions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The moist closet or the moist room

SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The samples of the cement shall be taken in
accordance
with the requirements
of IS  :  3535

<<PARAGRAPH>>On balance in use the permissible variation at a

variation on new balance shall be one-half of this
value.
The sensibility reciprocal
shall be not
greater than twice the permissible variation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is generally
defined as the change
in load required

specimens as when the initial measurement was
made.
When making the

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  After the specimens are measured
as in 8.2
at the age of 7 and 35 days, calculate the average
difference
in length of three specimens to the
