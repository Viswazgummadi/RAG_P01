F O R E W O R D
0.1  This Indian Standard (Part 24) (Third Revision) was adopted by
the Indian Standards Institution on 11 October 1983, after the draft
finalized by the Method of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering
(Excluding River Valley Projects) Sectional Committee had been
approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2  Measurement occupies a very important place in the planning and
execution of any civil engineering work from the time of first estimates
to the final completion and settlement of payments project. Methods
followed for measurement are not uniform and considerable
differences exist between practices followed by different construction
agencies and also between various Central and State Government
Departments and their undertakings. While it is recognized that each
system of measurement has to be specifically related to administrative
and financial organizations within a department responsible for the
work, a unification of the various system at technical levels has been
accepted as very desirable, specially as it permits a wider range of
operation for civil engineering contractors and eliminates ambiguities
and misunderstandings arising out of inadequate understanding of
various systems followed.
0.3  Among various engineering items, measurement of buildings was
the first to be taken up for standardization and this standard having
provisions relating to building works was first published in 1958 and
was revised in 1964.
0.4  In the course of usage of this standard by various construction
agencies in the country, several clarifications and suggestions for
modifications were received and as a result of study, the technical
committee responsible for this standard decided that scope of this
standard, besides being applicable to buildings, should be expanded to
cover method of measurement of civil engineering works like
industrial and river valley project works and accordingly second
revision of this standard was taken up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1200 (Part 24) - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1  Since different trades are not related to one another, the
Sectional Committee during its second revision decided that for each
trade as given in IS : 1200-1964* separate standards shall be issued as
different parts as it would be helpful to users in using the specific
standard. This Part 24 covering method of measurement of well
foundation applicable to buildings as well as to civil engineering works
was published in 1971. In view of the large number of comments
received on this standard (Part 24) the Sectional Committee decided to
revise this Part incorporating the changes to keep the latest method as
being followed by most of the organizations.
0.5  In case of such works, it is desired that the following information
be also made available:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) A general description of the nature of the work at site and the
cross-section of the river bed showing therein the low water
level and high flood level;
ii) Water logging whether due to nature of the soil or any other
reason; and
iii) The strata through which wells are likely to be sunk or reference
showing records of bores.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6  This edition 4.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (October 1989).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.
0.7  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a measurement, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960†. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard (Part 24) covers the method of measurement of well
foundations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. GENERAL

2.2 Booking of Dimensions  — In booking dimensions, the order
shall be consistent and generally in the sequence of length, width and
height or depth or thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1200 (Part 24) - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Description of Items  — The description of each item shall,
unless otherwise stated, be held to include where necessary,
conveyance and delivery, handling, loading, unloading, storing,
fabrication, hoisting, all labour for finishing to required shape and
size, setting, fitting and fixing in position, straight cutting and waste.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Measurements  — All work shall be measured net in decimal
system as fixed in its place as given below:
a) Linear dimensions shall be measured to the nearest 0.01 metre,
b) Areas shall be worked out to the nearest 0.01 square metre, and
c) Cubic contents shall be worked to the nearest 0.01 cubic metre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Work Measured Separately  — Unless otherwise clubbed under
2.1 , the work executed in the following conditions shall be measured
separately:
a) Work in dry soil,
b) Work in wet soil (30 cm above subsoil water),
c) Work in or under foul positions, and
d) Work interrupted by tides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5.1  The levels of high and low water/tides where occurring, shall be
stated.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — These conditions shall also include removing obstructions other than those
which are removed by mechanical or any other special method (  see   2.7  ).
2.6 Bills of Quantities  — The bills of quantities shall fully describe
the materials and workmanship, and accurately represent the work to
be executed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7  Removal of obstructions other than those mentioned in  2.5  met
with during sinking operations shall be measured separately on the
basis of quantum meruit.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. WELL SINKING<<HEADING_END>>
