<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
draft finalized
by the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>( Second Revision
) was adopted
bv the Bureau
of Indian
Standard+
ac.*r ” e
Foundation
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
tl.:
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Several Indian
Standards
have been published
for the
design
and
construction
of foundation
for
machines
of various
types,
These involves
the use of dynamic
properties
of soil.
The
need
for
a
standard
procedure
for the determination
of such properties
therefore
arose.
The standard
is meant
to fulfil this need.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The designer
should
choose
the
method
appropriate
to the
codditions
at a given
site.
In-situ
dynamic
test by the forced vibration
method
may be found
useful in most of the cases
even
though
it has the limitations
of the plate load test.
In layered
soils,
the wove
propogation
test
has
the
advantage
that the dynamic
properties
of the layer
of interest
can
be determined
by suitably
adjusting
the distance
between
the geophones.
The results obtained
by a free vibration
test
should
be used with caution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1969 and
subsequently
revised
in
1977 which
included
the
block vibration
tests both under free and forced
vibration
conditions,
shear
modulus
tests,
wave
propagation
tests and cyclic
plate
load
tests.
Guidelines
are
provided
for choosing
the design
parameters
consistent
with the conditions
of confinement
and strains
which
are
likely
to occur
in
an actual
problem.
This revision
has been taken up
to incorporate
further
improvements
found
necessary
in light of determination
of dynamic
properties
of soil, since its last publication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has
been
given
to international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
in addition
to relating
it to the
practices
in the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the result of a test made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final
value,
observed
or calculated
is to be rounded
off, it shall
be done
in accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules
for
rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The  vibration pick-ups should be fixed at the top
of the block as shown in Fig.1, such that it senses
vertical motion of the block. The vibration exciter
should
be mounted
on the block such that it
generates purely vertical sinusoidal vibrations and
line of action of vibrating force passes through the
centre of gravity of the block.
The
exciter
is
operated at a constant frequency. The signal of
the vibration pick-ups are fed into suitable electronic
circulatory to measure frequency and amplitude of
vibration. The frequency of the exciter is increased
in steps of small values, (l-4 cycles/set)
up to
maximum frequency of the exciter and the signals
measured. The same procedure should be repeated
if necessary for different excitation levels. The
dynamic force should never exceed 20 percent of
the total mass of the block and exciter assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

After the set-up has been arranged
the initial
readings
of the dial gauges
should
be noted
an
the first increment
of static load should
be applie $
to the plate. This load shall be maintained
constant
throughout
for a period till no further
settlement
occurs or the rate of settlement
becomes
negligible.
The final readings
of the dial gauges
should
then
be recorded. The entire
load is then removed quickly
but gradually
and
the plate allowed
to rebound.
When no further rebound
occurs or the rate of rebound
becomes
negligible,
the readings
of the dial gauges
should be again noted. The load shall then be increased
gradually
till its magnitude
acquires
a value equal
to the proposed
next higher stage of loading,
which
shall be maintained
constant
and the final dial gauge
readings
should be noted as mentioned
earlier.
The
entire, load should then be reduced to zero and final
dial
gauge
readings
recorded
when
the rate of
rebound
becomes
negligible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The block shall be excited into free vertical vibrations
by the impact of sledge hammer or any suitable device,
as near to the centre
of the top face of the block
as possible.
The vibrations
shall be recorded
on a
pen
recorder
or suitable
device
to measure
the
frequency
and amplitude
of vibration.
The test may
be repeated
three or four times.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of free vertical
vibrations
tests, the value
of CU shall be obtained
from the natural
frequency
of free vertical vibration using equation given at 5.4.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The damping

may be obtained

are continued

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2  Procedure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 The wave propagation
tests for determination
of shear modulus may be conducted by making seismic
waves
to pass through
the ground
by impact of a
hammer
and determining
the time of travel of these
waves between
two points at a known distance apart
or by measuring the phase difference between vibration
at two pointer
under
steady
vibrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A suitable
location
in the area where
this test is
to be conducted
is selected and radial lines are ranged
out from this point
for a distance
of 30 m to 40
m. Points are marked on these lines at 2 m intervals.
A velocity
pick-up
or a geophone
is fixed at the
origin of the radial lines and waves
are generated
near this point by impact of a 10 kg hammer
falling
through
a height of 2 m on a steel plate of 150
mm x 150 mm resting on a the surface
of ground.
An acceleration
pick-up is placed at a known distance
along one of the radial lines, the pick-ups is amplified
through universal
amplifier
and fed to two channels
of the same pen recorder.
The time taken
by the
waves to travel the distance
between
the two pick-
ups can be obtained
from these records.
The test
is repeated for different
known distance
between
the
pick-ups
along
all the marked
lines
one by one.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1
Elastic modulus  E  is determined
by equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9 GUIDANCE
FOR
CHOOSING
DESIGN
PARAMETFRES
FROM
IN-SITU
TESTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 The value of the dynamic
shear modulus
G is
affected
by a number
of parameters
out of which
confining
pressure, shear strain amplitude
and relative
density are most important.
It is observed that changes
in density from medium to dense state have relatively
insignificant
effect compared
to effect of confining
pressure
and shear strain amplitude.
Since the order
of strain
level
and confining
pressure
associated
with different
in-situ  tests are different,
tests may
be expected
to show a large variation,
as the strain
associated
with, say hammer
test is very small and
that with cyclic plate load test is very large. A rational
apprroach is therefore,
needed to arrive at a suitable
design
value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P  =
Mass density

<<PARAGRAPH>>E =

<<HEADING level=3>>Rock
0.15 to 0.25<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2
Depending
upon
the nature
of medium
involved,
and if the distance
between
pick-ups
is
sufficiently
large, both the arrival
of compression
and shear waves
may
be distinguishable
from the
records.
In
such
a case both  E  and G can be
determined
independently.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 In the range of strains associated
with properly
design
machine
foundations,
the effect of variation
in strain on shear modulus
is small and the values
of G for design
purposes
may be determined
from
the
in-situ  test
values
using
the relation
given
below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in wave propagation
tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
