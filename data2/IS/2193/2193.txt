<<HEADING level=1>>( First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
%&I&W& Institution on 29 August 1986, after uhe’diaft finalized by the
Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>$2 This standard has been prepared with the object of providing guid-
ance ta t&z man&tcturers and o&erd  ! in  obtaining precast prestressed
concrete street lighting poles capable of giving satisfactory service.  This
standard covers only poles in the manufacture
of which  prestressing
system and mechanical compacting methods, such as, vibrafion, shocking,
etc, have been. adopted.
It does not cover hand compacted poles.
Recommendations
regarding selectioa,,. handling and erection of poles
are covered in IS  :  7321-1974*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard was first published in a962 under the title ‘Specification
for prestressed concrete street lighting  i  columns’.
This modification in
title is intended to make it more clear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The present revision has been taken up with a view to incorporating
the modifications found necessary in the light of experience gained
during the use of this standard.
This revision incorporates significant
modifications in respect of materials, design, tests for poles and brackets,
and earthing of poles.
In addition, niodifications have been made in
respect of some other provisions, such as, length, outreach, cover of
concrete, tolerance on dimensions, sampling and inspection, marking, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the. fiscal value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of-a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accor-
dance with IS  :  2-1960t. The number of significant places retained in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard covers the requirements
for precast mprestressed con-
crete  poles  suitable for use in street lighting.
It also covers prestressed
concrete street lighting poles where
untensioned
longitudinal
reinforce-
ment is used to act in conjunction
with tensioned steel under load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 Concrete
fittings
attached
to or forming
part
of a pole are also
covered by this standard,
as far as practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.3 The poles covered by this standard
are not intended for overhead
wiring purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose
of this standard,
the following
definitions shall
apply.
2.1 Load Factor - The ratio of ultimate
transverse
load to the trans-
verse load at first crack.
For design,
the transverse
load at first crack
shall be taken as not less than the value of the working load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Maximum Working Load -
The miximum working load in the trans-
verse direction that is ever likely to occur
including
the wind pressure
on the pole.
This load is assumed to act at a point 600 mm below the
connection
of the bracket to the pole and will create
a bending moment
equal td  the sum of the bending moments caused by the following loads  :
a) Wind pressure on the pole,
bracket,
luminaire
and any raising
or lowering contact gear;
b) Overhanging weight of bracket and luminaire; and
c)  If raising and lowering gear is provided,
the weight of such gear
attached
to
the bracket
plus 50 percent of the weight of the
luminaire
and the moving part of gear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Mounting
Height -
The mounting
height
is the vertical distance
from the centre of the light source
to the road surface
or to the hori-
zontal plane through the nearest point of the road where the light source
is not vertically above it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Outreach - The outreach is the shortest distance between the verti-
cal through the centre of the base of the pole and the vertical through
the centre of light source.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5  Side E&y Lominaire -
A  luminaire in which the lead is taken
through its side.
2.6  Top  Entry Luminaire -
A  luminaire in which the lead is taken
through the top.
2c7  Ultimate Failure -  The conditions existing when the pole ceases to
sustain a load increment owing to either crushing of cdncrete, or
snapping of the prestressing tendon ,or permanent stretching of the steel
ih any paft of the pole.
2.8  Ultimate Transverse Load -  T&  load at which failure occurs when
it is ap lied to a point 600 mm below the .centre of light source and
perpen dp icular to the axis of the pole along the transverse direction with
the butt end of the pole planted to the required dept& as intended in
the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the top of the pole or fixed into a special
pole head of identical dimen-
sions, which may be a portion cut from a pole.
The pole or pole head
shall
be rigidly fixed in a vertical position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.2 Vertical and transverse test loads
calculated in accordance
with
5.7 and 5.8 shall be gradually applied at the end of the bracket, the ratio
between the vertical and transverse loads being kept constant.
When the
maximum working loads are reached, it shall be maintained
for at least
2 minutes and the maximum deflection shall be measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3 The load shall then be reduced to zero and the residual deflection
shall be measured after 10 minutes.

for overall
length,
cross-section
and uprightness
( see 3.2 >. A pole/
bracket failing to satisfy
one or more
of these requirements
shall be
considered
as defective.
All the poles/brackets
in the lot shall be con-
sidered as conforming
to these requirements
if the number of defective
poles/brackets
found in the sample is less than or equal to the corres-
ponding acceptance
number given in co1 3 of Table 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
