<<PARAGRAPH>>more resistant to buckling
than cylindrical
sheTls
and in general, require less thickness.
This saving
in materials is, however, often offset by the datively
expensive shuttering
required
for
casting
them.
Among
the doubly-curved
shells,  ’  the hyperbolic
paraboloid
and the
conoid
have,
however,
the
advantage
of less expensive shuttering because their
ruled surfaces can be formed
by straight
plank
shuttering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( First
Revision)
was
adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on I5
November
1988, after the draft finalized by
the
Criteria for Design of Special Structures
Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineer-
ing Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Shells and folded plates belong to the class of
stressed-skin
structures
which,
because
of
their
geometry
and small flexural rigidity of the skin,
tend to carry loads primarily by direct stresses acting
in their plane.
Wherever shell is referred to in this
standar$
it refers to thin shell.
On account
of
multiphclty of the types of reinforced
concrete
shell
and folded plate structures
used in present
day
building practice for a variety of applications demand-
ing roofing of
large column-free
area, it is not
practicable
to lay down a rigid code of practice to
cover all situations.
Therefore,
this standard
lays
down certain
general
recommendations
for
the
guidance of the designers.
.*<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Folded plates are often competitive
with shells
for covering large column-free
areas.
They usually
consume
relatively
more
materials
compared
to
shell
but this disadvantage
is often offset by the
simpler framework required for their construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 This standard was first published. in 1962.
The
present revision is based on the developments
in the
design of shell and folded plate structures subsequent-
ly and to include more rigorous methods
of analysis
which have become
available
to
enforce
more
rational criteria of design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Cylindrical shells have been in use in building
construction for the past six decades. Well developed
theories
exist
for
their
analysis.
Labour-saving
short cuts, such as, charts and tables
for
their
design, are also available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of
significant places retained in the rounded
off value
should  be  the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Although shells of double curvature,
with the
exception of domes, have been introduced on a large
scale comparatively recently into building construc-
tion, these are likely to be used more and more in
future.
Being non-developable
surfaces, they
are<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
lays down recommendations
for
the classification, dimensional proportioning,
analysis
and design of cast  in situ,
reinforced
concrete
thin
shells and folded plates.
This standard
does not
deal with construction
practices relating
to these
structures
which have
been
separately
dealt
in
IS  :  2204-1962*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Butterfly Shells -  Butterfly
shells
are
those
which consist of two parts of a cylindrical
shell
joined together at their lower edges (see Fig. 2).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Chord Width -  The chord width is the horizon-
tal projection of the arc of the cylindrical shell.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5  Continuous Cylindrical Shells -
Cylindrical shells
which
are
longitudinally
continuous

the
traverses (see Fig. 3 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose of this standard,
the following
definitions shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Doubly-curved
shells continuous
in one or both
directions
may be termed as continuous
shells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to the curve at that point.
The parabola,
value ofn is 1, -2 and -3 for cycloid, catenary
and para-
bola, respectively.
For an ellipse:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

A member
provided
at
the
edge of a shell.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R-
.  a2P
(a’  sin*+ + b* c&d )*I*
where
a  and b are the semi-major
and semi-minor
axes,
respectively,
and d is the slope of the tangent at the point.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Edge members increase the rigidity
of the shell
edge and h&p in accommodating
the reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.8  End Frames or
Traverses -
End
frames
or
traverses
are structures
provided
to support
and
preserve the geometry of the shell.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.16 Rise -
The vertical distance between the apex
of the curve representing the centre line of the shell
and the lower most springing.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
They may be solid diaphragms,
arch ribs,
portal
frames
or
bowstring
girders.
Where
a clear
soffit
is
required,
specially
for the use of movable
formwork,
the
end frames may consist of upstand ribs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.17 Ruled
Surfaces -
Surfaces
which
can
be
generated entirely by straight
lines.
The surface is
said to be ‘singly ruled’ if at every point, a single
straight line only can be ruled and ‘doubly ruled’ if
at every point, two straiglt
lines can be ruled.
Cylindrical
shells, conical
shells and conoids
are
examples of singly ruled surfaces;
hyperbolic
para-
bol jids and hyperboloids of revolution
of one sheet
are examples of doubly ruled surface ( see Fig. 6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.9 Folded Plates -
Folded plates consist of a series
of thin plates, usually rectangul
c, joined
monolithi-
cally along their common
e 2 ges and supported
on
diaphragms.
They are also known as hipped plates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  Shapes of Folded Plates and Their Applications -
A few of the commonly
used
shapes
of folded
plates are
shown
in Fig.
4.
The simplest
is V-shaped
unit (Fig.
4A) but this may not provide
enough
area of concrete
at
the top and bottom to resist the compressive
forces due
to bending and to accommodate
the reinforcement.
The
trough-shaPed
or the trapezoidal
unit (Fig. 4B and 4E)
eliminates  _  these
disadvantages.
Asy&meirical
section;
of the ‘2’ shape (Fig. 4C)
provided
with window
glazing
between
two adjacent
units serve as north-light
roofs for
factory
buildings.
The
shape
shown
in
Fig.
4D
is
obtained
by replacing
the
curved
cross-se&x
of
a
cylindrical
shell by a series
of straight
plates.
This has
the
advantage
of
greater
structural
depth
compared
to
other
shapes.
Buttetiy
type of folded
plates shown
in
Fig. 4F are also employed
to cover factory
roofs as there
are provisions
for window
glazing.
Tapering
plates
are
also used as roofs mainly
for aesthetic
reasons.
I-lipped
plate structures of the pyramidal
types are used for tent-
shaped roofs, cooling towers, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.18 Semi-Central Angle -
Half the angle subtend-
ed by the arc of a symmetrical circular
shell at the
centre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.19 Shells - Thin shells are those in which the
radius to thickness ratio should not be more than 20.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.20 Shells of Revolation -
Shells which are obtain-
ed when a plane curve is rotated
about
the axis of
symmetry.
Examples are segmental
domes, cones,
parab Jloids of revolution,
hyperboloids
OI revolu-
tion, etc ( see Fig. 7 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.21 Shells
of
Translation -
Shells
which
are
obtained when the plane of the generatrix
and the
directrix are at right angles.
Examples are cylindri-
cal shells, elliptic paraboloids, hyperbolic paraboloids,
etc ( see Fig. 8  ) ,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.10 Gauss Curvature -  The product
of the
two
principal curvatures,  ~/RI
and l/R1 at any point on
the surface of the shell.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.11 Generatrix, Directrix - A curve which moves
parallel to itself over a stationary
curve generates a
surface.
The moving curve is called the generatrix
and the stationary curve the directrix.
One of them
may be a straight line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.22 span -
The span of a cylindrical
shell is the
distance between the centre
lines of two adjacent
end frames of traverses (see Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  General -
Shells may be broadly
classified as
‘singly-curved’ and ‘doubly-curved’.
This is based
on Gauss curvature.
The gauss curvature of singly-
curved shells is zero because one of their principal
curvatures is zero.
They are, therefore,
developable.
Doubly-curved
shells are non-developable
and are
classified as synclastic or anticlastic
according
as
their Gauss curvature is positive or negative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.3  Thickness of Folded
Plates -  The thickness
of folded plates shall not normally
be less than

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Other Dimensions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1  CyIindrical Shells<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1.1  The span should
preferably
be
less
than 30 m.
Shells longer than 30 m will involve
special design considerations,
such as the application
of prestressing techniques.<<HEADING_END>>

the unit weights taken in accordance
with IS  :  875
(Part I)-1987*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Live loads, wind loads and snow loads shall be
taken as specified in IS  :  875 (Parts 2 to 4)-1987*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1.2 The width of the edge member
shall
generally
be limited to’ three times the thickness of
the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

IS  :  1893-1984t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1.3 The radius of shell structures
shall be
selected keeping
acoustic
requirements
in
view.
Coincidence
of the centre of curvature
with
the
working level should be avoided
unless
suitable
acoustic correction is made.
It is, however,
impor-
tant to note that even where coincidence of centre of
curvature with the working level is avoided, acoustic
treatment may be necessary iu certain cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Where concentrated
loads occur,
special consi-
derations should be given in analysis and design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  SELECTION OF DIMENSIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1.4 A single cylindrical shell whose span is
larger than three times the chord width shall have a
total depth, H, between
l/6 and l/l2 of its span
(the former value being applicable to smaller spans).
The rise in the case of a shell without edge members
shall not be less than l/l0 of its span.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1  Thickness
of Shells -
Thickness
of
shells
shall not normally
be less than 50 mm if singly-
curved and 40 mm if doubly-curved.
This require-
ment does not, however, apply to small precast con-
crete shell units in which the thickness may be less
than that specified above but it shall in no case be
less than 25 mm (see IS  :  6332-19842).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1.5 For a shell with chord width larger than
three times the span, the rise of the shell shall not
be less than l/8 of its chord width.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1.1 The reinforcement shall have a minimum
clear cover of 15 mm or its nominal
size whichever
is greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1.6 The chord width of shells shall
pre-
ferably be restricted to six times the span as other-
wise arch action is likely to predominate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2 Shells are usually thickened
for some dis-
tance from their junction
with edge members and
traverses.
The thickening
is usually of the order
of 30 percent of the shell thickness.
It is, however,
important to note that undue thickening
is undesir-
able.

<<PARAGRAPH>>8. ANALYSIS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.0  General -  Shells may be analyzed
either
by
linear elastic analysis based on theory of elasticity or
yield line theory.
Methods
based on yield
line
theory for shells are still the subject of research
and
experimentation
and, therefore,
for the present,
it
is recommended that they may be used along with
model tests to check the load carrying capacity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The common
classical methods
of analysis
of
shells are mentioned
in the following clauses for
use for the analysis of common types of shells that
are without any of the complexities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Cylindrical Shells<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The finite element method has become a practi-
cal and popular method of analysis for all types of
structures.
Many common and important
features
of shell and folded plate structures
that cannot
be
considered by classical methods can now be analyzed
satisfactorily
by the finite element
method.
For
example  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.1  Analytical Methodr -  The analytical methods
consist of two parts, membrane
analysis and edge
disturbance analysis.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.1.1  Membrane analysis -
In the membrane
analysis, the shell is regarded as a perfectly
flexible
membrane which is infinite in extent and is assumed
to carry loads by means of forces in its plane only.
This analysis gives the two normal
stress resultants
Nx and NY in the longitudinal
and the transverse
directions and the shear stress resultant Nxv.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.1.2  Edge disturbance
analysis -
Shells,
in
practice,
are always limited by finite
boundaries
where the boundary
conditions
demanded
by the
membrane theory are not obtained
with the result
that a pure membrane
state would seldom exist.
Edge disturbances
emanate
from the
boundaries,
altering the membrane
state and causing bending
stresses in the shell.
These are accounted
for bye,
carrying out the edge disturbance
analysis.
Usually
edge disturbance analysis is confined
to disturbance
emanating
from straight
edge as any disturbance
emanating from curved edges is damped
quite fast.
Even in the case of disturbance from straight edges,
the bending stresses would get damped out more
rapidly in shells having chord width larger than the
span and would seldom travel beyond
the crown,
with the result that the effect of the further edge
may be ignored without appreciable error.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>When one or more of these complexities occur in
shell structures, it is advisable to use finite element
method, at least for a final acceptance of the design.
Even normal
shell structures
of spans larger than
30 m should be analyzed
by finite element method
if it is expected
that there would be serious and
significant structural
participation
in the shell be-
haviour by the supporting units, such as, edge and
intermediate
beams, stiffners, and or intermediate
traverses ( specially flexible traverses ) cable supports,
columns, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of ignoring

that the shells may be treated as shallow

l/8 at
any point on it.
However, in normal cases, for practical
purposes, higher values ofp

considered
as shallow provided the span to rise ratio does
not exceed 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

infrequent.
However, should such cases arise, the
effects of both the edges shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3  Boundary
Conditions
for
Doubly-Curved
Shells -
In general,
in the membrane
analysis of
synclastic
shells, only one boundary
condition
is
admissible on each boundary.
For an anticlastic
shell, the boundary conditions
have to be specified
in a special manner
as the characteristic
lines of
such surfaces play a significant role in the membrane
theory.
The type of boundary
conditions
that can
be specified depend on whether or not the boundaries
of the shell are characteristic lines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2.2 Cylindrical shells with  L/R  greater than
or equal to n may be treated
as beams of curved
cross section spanning between the traverses and the
analysis carried out using an approximate
method
known
as the beam
method
(see
Appendix B)
which consists of the following two parts:
a) The
beam
calculation
which
gives
the
longitudinal stress resultant N, and the shear
stress resultant NXY, and
b) The arch calculation which gives the transverse
stress resultant NY and the transverse
moment
MY.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Further,
a membrane
state of stress
can
be
maintained in a shell only if the boundaries
are such
that the reactions exerted by the boundary
members
on the shells correspond to stresses in the shell at
the boundaries given by the membrane
theory.
It
is seldom possible to provide
boundary
conditions
which would lead to a pure membrane state of stress
in the shell.
In most practical
cases, a resort
to
bending theory becomes necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.3  Continuous Cylindrical Shells<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3.1 Only deep doubly-curved
shells behave
like membranes and it is only for such shells that
a membrane analysis is generally adequate for design
(see  also  8.0).
Bending analysis is necessary
for
all singly-curved
shells and shallow doubly-curved
shells.
The governing equation for bending analysis
of shallow shells are given in AppendixC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.3.1 Analytical methods -
In the analytical
methods, the problem of continuous
shells is solved
in two stages.
In the first, the shell is assumed
to
be  ‘simply
supported
over
one
span
and
all the stress resultants worked out.
In the second
stage, correcg;ns
for continuity are worked out and
are superimposed on the values corresponding
to the
simply supported span.
Long cylindrical shells can
be analyzed by approximating
the cylindrical profile
by a folded plate shape and applying
well known
analysis methods for continuous
folded plates (see
Appendix B).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The governing
equations
for bending analysis
of

shells

in<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.5  Bending ?heory  of
Shells
of
Revolution,
Symmetrically
Loaded -
In
synclastic
shells
of
revolution, such as, domes which are symmetrically
loaded, a more or less membrane
state of stress
exists.
The bending stresses are confined to a very
narrow strip close to edge members and get rapidly
damped out.
The bending stresses in domes can be
calculated with sufficient accuracy
by approximate
methods like Geckler’s approximation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.3.2  Beam method -
Solution of continuous<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>shell with -$ 2 ?r is simpler by the beam method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bending moment factors are obtained by solving
the corresponding
continuous
beam.
Thereafter,
analysis can be continued as in 8.1.2.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Donhly-Curved SheIIs<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.6  Funicular Shells -
The shapes of these shells
are so choosen
that, under uniformly
distributed
vertical loads, in a membrane
state of stress, they
develop only pure compression
unaccompanied
by
shear stresses.
Thus theoretically
no reinforcement
will be necessary except in the edge members.
Small
precast funicular
shells without any reinforcement
except in edge beams are suitable for roofs and
floors of residential,
industrial,
and
institutional
buildings (see IS  :  6332’1984* ). For roofs of larger
size,  in situ  construction
may be resorted to; in such
shells, provision of reinforcement is necessary to take
care of the effects of shrinkage,
temperature
and
bending.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1  Membrane
Analysis -
In
the
membrane
analysis, it is assumed that the shell carry loads by
in-plane
stress resultants
and usually
only
deep
doubly-curved
shells behave like membranes.
The
governing equations for membrane analysis of doubly-
curved are usually solved by using stress functions
( see Appendix C ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.2 Shallow  Shells -
Shells may be considered
shallow if the rise to span ratio is less than or equal
to l/5 and  p2  and  q’  may be ignored in all the ex-
pressions.
The shorter side shall be considered
as
the span for this purpose
for shells of rectangular
g*ound plan.
A shell with a circular ground plan
may beconsidered
shallow if the rise does not exceed
l/5 of the diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 Folded Plates -  The structural action of folded
plates may be thought of as consisting of two parts.
the ‘slab action’ and the ‘plate action’.
By the slab
action, the loads are transmitted to the joints by the
transverse bending of the slabs. The slabs, because of
their large depth and relatively small thickness, offer
considerable resistance to bending in their own planes
and are flexible out of their planes.
The loads are,
therefore,
carried
to the end diaphragms
by the
longitudinal bending of the slabs in their own planes.
This is known as ‘plate action’.
The analysis of
folded slabs is carried out in two stages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in the planes of the
slabs and these are known as plate loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Under
the
action of ‘plate loads’ obtained above, each slab is
assumed to bend independently
between the dia-
phragms, and the longitudinal
stresses at the edges
are
calculated.
Continuity
demands
that
the
longitudinal
stresses at the common
edges of the
adjacent slabs be equal.
The corrected
stresses are
obtained by introducing edge shear forces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Where lapping

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1 Types of Traverses -  Traverses
may be solid
diaphragms,
arches,
portal
frames,
trusses
or
bowstring girders. For shells with large chord widths,
it is advantageous
to have trusses in the form of
arches, trusses or bowsting girder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.4 The traverses
may be hinged to the columns,
except where the traverses and columns are designed
as one unit, such as in a portal frame. Provision
shall be made in the design of columns
to allow for
the expansion
or contraction
of traverses
due to
temperature changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1.1  Traverses
may be placed below or above
the shells. Where a clear soffit is required,
specially
to facilitate the use of movable formwork,
they may
be in the form of upstand ribs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11. DESIGN
OF EDGE BEAMS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.2  The simplest diaphragms for folded plates
are rectangular
beams with depth equal
to
the
height of the plate. The diaphragms are subject to
the action of the plate loads on one-half of the span
of the folded plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  Edge beams stiffen the shell edges and
act
together
with the shell in carrying the load of the
supporting system. They can either be vertical
or
horizontal.
Vertical beams are usually employed
in
long cylindrical shells wherein the cylindrical
action
is predominant.
Horizontal beams are employed
in
short cylindrical shells where transverse
arch action
is predominant.
It is preferable to completely
isolate
the structural
system of the shell structure
without
adding any other structure to it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Load on Traverses -
Traverses shall be design-
ed to carry,
in addition
to
their
own
weight,
reactions
transferred
from the shell in the form of
shear forces, and the loads directly acting on them.
For preliminary trial designs, however, the total load
on half the span of the structure may be considered
as a uniformly
distributed
vertical
load
on the
diaphragm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most of the shell forms, edge beams form part
of the shell structure itself. An analysis of the shell
structure
is carried
out along with the edge beam.
Analysis and design of edge beams should ensure
compatibility
of boundary
conditions
at the shell
edge.
Analysis
should
take
into
account
the
eccentricities,
if any, between the central line of the
shell and the edge beam. Analysis should also take
into account
the type of edge beam, interior
or
exterior,
as well as supporting
arrangement of the
edge beam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3 Design -
The shear forces transferred

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:2210-1988<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.1  Thickness -
A width of two to three times
the thickness
of the shell subject to a minimum of
15 cm is usually necessary for the edge beams.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2 Folded Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.1  Transverse
Reinforcement
-
Transverse
reinforcement
shall follow the cross section of the
folded plate and shall be designed to resist the trans-
verse moment.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.2  Reinforcements -
Edge beams carry
most
of the longitudinal
tensile forces due to  NX  in the
shell and hence main reinforcements
have to be
provided
for carrying
these forces,
It may
be
necessary
to provide many layers of reinforcement
in the edge beam. Design of reinforcements
should
ensure that the stresses in the farthermost layer does
not exceed the permissible
stresses.
Edge
beams
should also be designed for carrying its self-weight,
live load on the part of the shell, wind load and
horizontal forces due to earthquakes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.2  Longitudinal Reinforcement -
Longitudinal
reinforcement,
in general. may be provided to take
up the longitudinal
tensile stresses, in individual
slabs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.3  Diagonal
reinforcement
may be provided
for shear.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.  DESIGN OF REINFORCEMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.4 The section of the plate at its junction
with
the traverse shall be checked for shear stress caused
by edge shear forces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1 Shells -  The ideal arrangement
would be to
lay the reinforcement
in the shell to follow
the
isostatics, that is, directions of the principal
stresses.
However,
for
practical
purposes,
one
of the
following methods may be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.5  Reinforcement
bars
shall
preferably
be
placed, as closely as possible,
so that the steel is
well
distributed
in the body of the plate. Nominal
reinforcement
consisting
of minimum
8 mm dia-
meter bars may be provided in the compression zones
at about 200 mm centre-to-centre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One is the diagonal grid at 45” to the &is c+f the
shell, and the other the rectangular grid in which
the reinforcing bars run parallel to the edges of
the shell. The rectangular
grid needs additional
reinforcement at 45’ near the supports to take up
the tension due to shear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3 General -  The minimum
reinforcement
shall
conform to the requirements of IS  :  456-1978*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.1 In the design of the rectangular
grid for
cylindrical shells, the reinforcement
shall usually be
divided into the following three groups:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3.1  Diameters
of Reinforcement
Bars -  The
following diameters of bars may be provided
in the
body of the shell. Larger diameters may be provided
in the thickened portions, transverse and beams:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Longitudinal
reinforcement
to take up
the
longitudinal
stress Nx or  Ny
as the case may
be,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Minimum diameter  :  8 mm, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Maximum diameter  : 4  of shell thickness or
16 mm whichever is
smaller.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Shear reinforcement to take up the principal
tension caused by shear Nxy, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Transverse reinforcement
to resist NY and My.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.3.2  Spacing of Reinforcement -
The maximum
spacing of reinforcement in any direction in the body
of the shell shall be limited to five times the thick-
ness of the shell and the area of unreinforced
panel
shall in no case exceed
15 times the square of
thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.2 Longitudinal
reinforcement
shall be pro-
vided at the junction of the shell and the traverse to
resist the longitudinal
moment
M,  .  Where MX is
ignored in the analysis, nominal
reinforcement
shall
be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.3 To ensure monolithic
connection between
the shell and the edge members, the shell reinforce-
ment shall be adequately
anchored
into the edge
members and traverses
or  vice versa  by providing
suitable
bond bars from the
edge
members
and
traverses to lap with the shell reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
These limitations
do not apply to edge mem-
bers which are governed
by IS  :  456-1978+.<<HEADING_END>>

31 entitled
‘Design
of
Cylindrical
Concrete Shell Roofs’ are based on a
rigorous analytical method and are accurate
enough
for design of shells of all proportions.
However, as
values corresponding
only to two ratios of  R/d  are
given, interpolation
involved for ratios does not give
accurate
results. A subsequent
publication
by the
Portland

Chicago,
entitled
‘Coefficients for

Shell Roofs’, gives the coefficients
for 4 values of
R/d  making interpolation
easier.

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.1 This method,.due to Lundgren, consists of two
parts. In the first, known as the ‘beam calculation’,
the shell is treated as a beam of curved cross section
spanning between the traverses and the longitudinal
stress  Tx  and the shear stress S are determined.
In
the second, known as the ‘arch calculation’, a unit
length of the shell is treated as an arch subject to the
action
of applied
loads and specific shear which is<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>defined as the rate of change of shear or F.
This<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>calculation
yields the transverse
stress  T  ‘and the
transverse
moment
My.  For a detailed
treatment,
referenoe may be made to ‘Cylindrical Shells’ Vol I,

Press, the Institution
