<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, afler the draft finalized by the Information
System Security Sectional Committee had been approved by the Electronics and Telecommunication
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The central theme of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) is to enable the implementing
organization to enhance trust and confidence among its trading partners as well as within its own organization
on its ability to protect the information and information processing assets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Business needs of an organization can be broadly categorized into two types, one as ‘strategic needs’ and the
other as ‘imperative needs’. It is recognized that the risks to a business in relation to imperative needs are
significantly high as compared to strategic needs. The adoption of an Information Security Management System
(lSMS) is an imperative need of an organization’s business.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design and implementation of an organization’s Information Security Management System is influenced
by the prevailing threat scenario, risks to its information and information processing assets, their effect on
business processes, need for business continuity and the size and structure of the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is not the intent of this standard to imply uniformity in the structure of Information Security Management
Systems or uniformity of documentation. This standard can be used by internal and external parties, including
certification bodies, to assess the organization’s ability to meet stake holder’s, customer’s, regulatory and the
organization’s own requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard promotes the adoption of a ‘risk based approach’ when developing, implementing and improving
the effectiveness of the Information Security Management System, to enhance trust and confidence between the
organization and its customers, trading partners and other external agencies as well as within the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For an organization to carry out its business in a safe and secure manner, it has to identify all critical information
assets and manage numerous risks, threats and vulnerabilities associated with the information and informat ion
processing facilities and mitigate the risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The risk based approach enables the organization to systematically assess the risks, threats and vulnerabilityies
associated with the critical information assets and related information processing facilities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When used within the Information Security Management System, such an approach emphasizes the importance
of:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
awareness and understanding of risks, threats and vulnerabilities;
b)
selection and implementation of appropriate security controls;
c)
monitoring and reviewing the performance and effectiveness of the ISMS;
d)
keeping the security mechanism up-to-date; and
e)
continual improvement of the ISMS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The model of a risk-based Information Security Management System is shown in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
