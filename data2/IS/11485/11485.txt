<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
lays down the criteria
for hydraulic
design
of  sluices
in concrete
and masonry
dams.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 It does not cover the hydraulic
design of openings
for penstocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TYPES
OF SLUICES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Sluices
may
be
classified
depending
upon
their
purpose,
their
hydraulic
operation
or their alignment.
The first two types
have
been
described
in 0.2
and 0.3.
Based upon their alignment,
sluices may be
classified
as under.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1
Straight Barrel Sluice -
The
barrel
of this sluice
is kept
nearly
horizontal
between
the
entry
and
exit
transitions
( see Fig.
la).
This
sluice has the advantage
of having
minimum
length
due to
which
lesser
friction
losses take place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1.1
Horizontal
sluices
are
generally
used
under
the following
conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When
the sluices are drowned
at the exit; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) When
they
have to be located
at or near the river bed level, for
example,
in construction
sluices for river diversion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1.2
The
width of the
sluice
barrel
is generally
kept
uniform
throughout
the length
except
in the entry transaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1.3
If the sluice is designed
for pressure
flow  conditions
then the
top
profile
of the sluice may be given a slight constriction
in accordance
with 3.4.1.
On the other hand,
if free flow conditions
prevail
then
no
such constriction
is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2
Trajectory
Type
Sluice -
The
barrel
of
this
sluice is generally
kept horizontal
downstream
of the entry transition
up to the service
gate
to facilitate
resting of the latter.
Beyond
the service gate the bottom
of
the sluice conforms
to the parabolic
path of the trajectory
and meets
the
downstream
face of the dam section
tangentially
( see Fig.
1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2.2
The width
of the sluice is kept uniform
throughout
the length
except
in the entry transition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2.3
The
height
of the sluice is gradually
reduced
from
down-
stream
of the service
gate to the exit in order to ensure pressure
flow in
the sluce.
The
constriction
shall be in accordance
with  3.4.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  DESIGN
CONSIDERATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Fixation
of Size and Number
of Sluices
-
The size and number
of sluices required
to pass
the
desired
discharge
at a predetermined
reservoir
elevation
may
be
found based on the type of flow required
to
be maintained
in the sluice,
that is, either
pressure
flow or free flow or a
combination
of both.
The sluice dimensions
shall be so proportioned
as
to
provide
a minimum
of two number
of sluices but simultaneously
to
permit
inspection
and repair
of the same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1
Pressure Flow in the Sluice -
For
pressure
flow
conditions,
the
following
basic relation
may be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>HT =  hL + hv<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>HT =  total head needed
to overcome
various
head
losses
to
produce
discharge;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>hL =  the cumulative
losses of the system in terms
of velocity
head;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>hv ==  velocity
head at the sluice exit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For a free discharging
sluice  Hr  shall be measured
from the reservoir
water surface
to the centre of the sluice
at
the
exit.
I~f the
outflowing
jet is supported
on a downstream
floor the head shall be measured
to the
point of greatest
contraction
and if the sluice
is submerged
at the
exit
then the head shall be measured
to the tail water level.
The losses shall
consist
of trashrock
losses, entrance
losses,
friction
losses,
gate
or valve
losses, bend losses,
expansion
and contraction
losses.
They
may
be ex-
pressed
in terms of velocity
head.
The above equation
may be re-written
in a simplified
form as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

or

in the
streambed,
the regulating

may
be
either
partly

For
the
unsubmerged
part of the gate opening
the discharge
shall
be
calculated
according
to 3.1.2.1.
However,
for the submerged
part of the gate open-
ing discharge
shall be calculated
by the following
relation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Q=
C.A. 1/ 2gH<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Q = discharge

<<PARAGRAPH>>ing,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A =  area of the submerged

<<PARAGRAPH>>H =  difference
between

and downstrem
water levels,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C = coefficient
of
discharge
for
submerged
orifice
or
tube
flow.
( Its value generally
varies between
0.62 to 0.81).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3  For
calculating
the
size of the
sluice and
plotting
the water
surface
profile
maximum
losses
should
be
considered.
However,
minimum
losses
shall be considered
for the design of the energy
dissipa-
tion arrangements
for the flow through
sluices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Shape
of Sluices -
Generally
rectangular
gates
are
preferred.
Therefore,
the shape of sluices is also normally
kept rectangular.
Generally
the height
of the sluice is kept as 1.5 times the width.
However,
circular
shapes
may
also
be provided
when small diameter
openings
( less than
one metre ) are required
to be regulated
by valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Entry
Transitions
-
The efficient
functioning
of a sluice depends
to a great extent
on the design
of its entry
transitions.
TO
obtain
the
best inlet
efficiency,
the shape of the entrance
should
simulate
that of a
jet discharging
into air.
A bell mouth
entrance
which
conforms
to or
slightly
encroaches
upon the free jet profile will provide
the best entrance
shape.
Elliptical
entrances
have been found to be suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1
For
a rectangular
or square
sluice the entrance
transition
may
be defined
by the following
equation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X2
_I
__
02
+
( o.&q5
= l<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where  D  is the vertical
height
of the sluice ( downstream
of the entrance
curve ) for
top and bottom
curves and the horizontal
width of the sluice
( downstream
of the entrance
curve ) for the side curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1s : 11485 - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
For
_a rectangular
entrance
with
bottom
placed
even
with
upstream
floor, the side curves at the entrance
may
be
defined
by
the
above
equation.
However,
the top contraction
curve may be given by
the following
equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>02
+
YZ
(0.67  D )2 = '<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X2<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where  D  is the vertical
height of the sluice
downstream
of the entrance
transition.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3
For
a circular
entrance
the
entry
transition
is given
by
the
following
equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>( O*5x;
)Z +
YZ
(0’15D)z
=
1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where  D  is the diameter
of the sluice downstream
of the entrance
transi-
tion.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Exit of the Sluice -
The exit of the sluice
shall
be tangential
to
either
the
downstream
face of the spillway/non-overflow
section or the
bucket or it may be upturned
( see Fig. 2 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1  In order to ensure the pressure
flow
conditions
throughout
the
length
of the
sluice
and
to avoid negative
pressures
the section
of
the
sluice should be constricted
at the
exit so
as to give
reduced
cross-
sectional
area commensurate
with the increase
in the velocity
of flow.
A
constriction
of 10 to 15 percent
in ilow area is generally
found
adequate
by effecting
constriction
in the roof profile only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2
When the exit of the sluices is not drowned,
the top profile of the
sluices
is given
a small
turn
of about
1.0 to 1.5 metres normal
to the
downstream
face of the spillway/non-overflow
section.
aeration
of the sluice ( see Fig. 2 ).
This helps in the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3
In
case
of
an
upturned
exit,
the shape and dimensions
of the
profile may be best worked
out on the basis of the model
studies.
It has
to be used with
caution
in spillway/non-overflow
sections
because
the
flow from
the sluice may damage
the energy
dissipation
arrangements
of
the spillway
or the downstream
face of the spillway/non-overflow
section,
if it falls over them.
Alternatively,
a jet
disperser
of suitable
shape,
based on model studies may be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.4
In case the sluices
are located
in
a spillway
section,
then
no
separate
energy
dissipation
arrangements
are necessary.
However,
if
they
are
provided
in
a non-overflow
section,
then
separate
energy
dissrpation
arrangements
may have to be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5  Control
Devices
-
The flow through
sluices is controlled
by either
gates or valves.
Generally,
two sets ~of gates,
that
is, emergency
and
service
gates
are
provided.
In case of construction
sluices,
the flow is
generally
uncontrolled
and only stoplogs are
provided
for
the
eventual
plugging
of the sluices.
Where
the construction
sluices
are
required
to
be
closed
under
flowing
water,
provision
of emergency
gates may be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.1
The control
( service
)  gates shall be located
as far
upstream
as
possible.
The
operation
and
servicing
may
be
done from operation
galleries/chambers
in the dam
(see
Fig.
3 ).
In
order
to repair
the
gates without
emptying
the reservoir
should they become inoperative,
the
usual practice
is to install a guard
or emergency
gate further
upstream
in
the sluices.
These
emergency
gates may be placed
either at the entrance
or inside the sluice and operated
from galleries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

when the sluice have to be located
at high levels near
the
crest
in
the
spillway
section,
where
it is not possible
to provide
a
gallery
for gates
operation,
the
sluices
may
also
be
located
in thick
spillway
piers
in which
the gates are operated
from the top of pier ( see

In case of high heads
( more than 30 m ) gate controls
may
also
be located
near the downstream
end of the sluice to minimize
possibilities
of cavitation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.4
For
better
slot
hydraulics,
the
gate slots should be as small as
practicable
and adequately
streamlined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6 Air
Vents -
Air
vents
of
suitable
size should
be provided
down-
stream
of the control
gates to supply air and thereby
avoid
or minimize
cavitation
damages.
The
air
demand
for calculating
the size of air vent
may be calculated
from the following
formulae:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) For hydraulic
jump
formation
in the conduit<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fi = 0.006 6 ( FI,
-
1  )l*J<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii) For spray flow<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>p = 0.20 F,,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iii) For free flow<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>p = 0.09  Fl,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>p = air-demand
ratio
volume
flow rate of air
-

<<PARAGRAPH>>Fl,
= Froude
number
at Vena contracta<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>=
cc 1/ g he<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>VlC -  Velocity
of flow at the vena contracta<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>dl, = Depth
of flow at the vena contracta<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g = Acceleration
due to gravity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
size of air vents as determined
above assume that the maximum
air demand
occurs
at a gate opening
of 80 percent
fully
open
and
the
maximum
air
velocity
in
the
vent
does not exceed 50 m/s.
Air vent
passages
should use generous
bend radi and gradual
transitions
to avoid
losses
and
particularly
excessive
noise.
The
air vent intakes
should be
so located
that they are inaccessible
to the public and should be protected
by grills.
The
intake
entrance
average
velocity
should not exceed
10 m/s.
The
air vent exit portal should be designed
to ensure spread
of air across
the full width of the
conduit.
The
air
vent
should
terminate
into
a
plenum
located
in the conduit
roof and immediately
downstream
of the
gate.
The
plenum
should extend
across the full width of the conduit
and
should
be vaned so that the air flow is evenly
distributed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.1
The size of the air vent should
be such
that
the
pressure
drop
downstream
of the gate does not normally
exceed
2 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.2
Hydraulic
jump
formation
in
the
sluice
should
normally
be
avoided.
When
unavoidable,
sufficient
clearance
shall
be
provided
above the jump
profile to avoid choked
jump
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.3
Normally
a sluice
located
in
a spillway
section
should
not
operate
simultaneously
with
the spillway.
However,
if it is obligatory<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_15>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 11485 - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to run the sluice in conjunction
with the spillway,
proper
aeration
should
be ensured
at the exit either by running
the sluice
partially
full
or
by
providing
a suitable
air-vent
at the exit of the sluice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.4
Sometimes
a steel liner may also be provided
in the sluices near
the gates to avoid cavitation
damages.
In case of control
being
located
at
the
exit
end,
the entire length of sluice shall be provided
with steel
liner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7  Made1 Studies -
Hydraulic
model
studies
are desirable
to test the
efficacy
of the hydraulic
design
of the
sluice
and
to verify
the
air-
demand.
They
should
be
done
for
the
pre-determined
minimum
reservoir
elevation
at which
the sluice is designed
to pass the required
discharge
and also for higher
reservoir
elevations
under
the
gate
open-
ing necessary
to pass the same discharge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
