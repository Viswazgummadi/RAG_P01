<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
Chemical Standards Sectional Committee had been apprcved by the Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was originally published in 1963 and revised in 1973.
The present revision
has been
undertaken to update the standard incorporating
latest analytical techniques developed in this field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A small percentage of water in certain
liquids including
volatile
liquids can be conveniently
measured using Karl Fischer method.
This method
is increasingly
used in various
chemical
standards prepared by BIS.
Therefore, this standard is intended
to assist the various
technical
committees of BIS preparing chemical standards in avoiding unnecessary variations in the details of
the method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision, the method involving visual detection of end point has been deleted in view of the
problems encountered during the end point detection
of colour
change.
Wide range of electro-
metric Karl Fischer titrators and Karl Fischer reagents including non-pyridene
based Karl Fischer
reagents are now available and therefore, reference to non-pyridine
based Karl Fischer reagents
is
given.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value,
observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules
for rounding off numerical values (  revised 1’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Committee responsible for the preparation of the standard is given in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This Indian
Standard
describes
the Karl Fischer
method
for determination
of free water or water of
crystallization
or moisture
in solid or liquid chemical
products,
both organic and inorganic.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-According
to second equation one molecule of iodine
should be equivalent
to one molecule of water, in practice this
stoiciometric
ratio is not attained and the Karl Fischer reagent has
to be standardized
against a known mass of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.1
The method is not applicable
to all the organic
and inorganic
chemical products. The limitalions
are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>oxidizing
agents,
such
as
chromates,
dichromates,
cupric and ferric salts, and higher
oxides and peroxides;
reducing agents, such as sulphides, thiosulphates
and stannous
salts;
compounds
which
may
for1n water
with
components
of Karl Fischer reagent, namely,
basiczincoxide,
saltsofweakoxyacids,alkali
carbonates
and bicarbonates,
and borates;
and
organic compounds,
such as quinines, ascorbic
acid,
peroxy
compounds,
active
carbonyl
compounds,
nitrogen
compounds
containing
amino
or hydrozo
nitrogen,
and
sulphur
compounds
where sulphur is not bonded with
oxygen.
In some cases the method can be
employed
with
minor
modification
before
operating
the final titration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 QUALITY
OF REAGENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless specified otherwise, pure chemicals and distilled

<<PARAGRAPH>>3 PRINCIPLE
OF THE METHOD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Pyridine<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The determination
of water is based on the reaction of
water while oxidizing
R-sulphite
anion to R-sulphate
by iodine. The reactionofsulphur
dioxide with alcohol
(methanol)
producing
a mono-alkyl
ester
of lhe
sulphurous
acid is a basic requirement
for the Karl
Fischer reaction.
The mono-alkyl
ester of sulphurous
acid in turn reacts with water in presence of iodine and
amine to form stable salts as per following equations
:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shall not contain more than 0.05 percent of water. If
the reagent contains
more than this quantity of water,
dry it by distillation,
rejecting
the first portion
of
distillate which will cbcp1itain the water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Sample Solvent<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Either methanol
or a mixture
containing
4 parts of
methanol and 1 part of pyridine (by volume) or (preferably
for determination
with compounds
containing
carbonyl
groups) a mixture containing 4 parts of 2-methoxyethanol
and 1 part of pyridine
(by volume).
In special cases,
other solvents
may be recommended,
for example,
acetic acid, pyridine or a mixture containing
1 part of

are

These

<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 Sulphur Dioxide<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7 Karl Fischer Reagent<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Place  670  ml of methanol
or 2-methoxyethanol
in a
previously
dried flask, coloured
brown
or painted
black on the outside, fitted with a ground-glass
stopper
and having a capacity slightly more than 1 litre. Add
about 85 g of iodine.
Stopper the flask and shake it
occasionally
until the iodine is completely
dissolved.
Then add approximately
270 ml of pyridine,
stopper
the flask again and mix thoroughly.
Dissolve 65 g of
sulphur dioxide in this solution, cool to ensure that the
temperature
of the liquid does not exceed 20°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8  Sodium
Tartarate,
Crystalline
(Na,C,H,0,.2H,O)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Sodium tartarate shall be of such quality
that when
dried at 150°C for 3 hours, it gives  out  15.66 -+ 0.5
percent water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-The
reaction being exothermic,
it is necessary to cool
the flask from the beginning
and to maintain it at about OOC, for
example, by immersing
in an ice-bath or in crushed solid carbon
dioxide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9  Water-Methanol
Standard Solution-

<<PARAGRAPH>>Using a microburette
or a pipette, place 1 ml of water
ina dry lOO-ml one-markvolumetric
flask, containing
approximately
50 ml of methanol.
Dilute to the mark
with methanol
and mix. For standardization
of this
solution (see  A-1.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Replace the ground-glass
stopperby
an attachment for
introducing
sulphur
dioxide.
This consists of a cork
with a thermometer
and an inlet glass tube of 6 to 8
mm, reaching
to within
10 mm of the bottom of the
flask, and a small capillary
tube for connecting
to the
atmosphere.
Place the whole assembly
with the ice-
bath on a balance and weigh to the nearest 1 g. Connect
the inlet tube to a siphon of sulphur dioxide by means
of a flexible
connection
and drying tube filled with
anhydrous
aluminium
sodiumsilicate
as desiccant and
gently open the tap  on  the siphon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

100 ml of methanol.

and
mix
(see
the
correspondence

Karl Fischer reagent in 8.2.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adjust the rate of llow of sulphur dioxide so that all the
gas is absorbed without the liquid showing any sign of
rising in the inlet tube. Maintain the equilibriumof
the
balance
by gradually
increasing
the rate and ensure
that the temperature
of the liquid does not rise above
20°C.
Close the tap on the siphon
as soon as the
increase
in mass reaches 6.5 g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

solution and leave for at least 24 hours before using it.
In fact, as a result of imperfectly
understood
reactions
which occur in the fresh reagent the water equivalent
of the reagent decreases rapidly to begin with and then
much slowly. This water equivalent
is between 3.5 and
4.5 mg/ml.  It  shall be determined
daily if methanol has
been
used,
but
may
be done
less frequently
if
2-methoxyethanol
has been used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

While
using

care
should be taken to protect them from absorbing moisture

<<PARAGRAPH>>Any commercial Karl Fischer titrator with electrotietric

will be suitable.
The instrument

the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is possible to prepare the Karl Fischer reagent with
a lower water content by diluting the solution prepared
as described
above with the sample solvent. Store the

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Non-pyridine
based Karl Fischer reagent
Despite the long, successful
use of pyridine based
Karl Fischer reagent for determination
of water, its
constant
use has been questioned
because of the
toxicity
of pyridine,
especially
irritation
of the
respiratory tract, its disagreeable
odourand reagent
instability,
the latterlargelyovercome
by  replacing
methanol by 2-methoxy ethanol (methyl cellosolve).
Non-pyridine
based Karl Fischer reagents
have,
therefore,
been developed
recently.
