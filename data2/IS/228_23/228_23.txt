<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Part 23 ) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the
Methods
of Chemical
Analysis
of Ferrous
Metals
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1S 228, which was first published
in 1952 and subsequently
revised
in 1959, covered
the chemical
analysis
of plain
carbon
and low alloy steels,
alongwith
pig iron and cast iron.
It was revised
again to make it comprehensive
in
respect
of steel analysis
and to exclude
pig iron and cast iron which
were being
covered
in separate
standards.
During
its second
revision
the standard
has been split up in several
parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Determination
of nitrogen
in steel by steam distillation,
has been covered
in IS 228 ( Part 19) and Determination
of
nitrogen

is under preparation
and will be covered
in
a separate
standard
which will form a part of the above
series.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers
the method

SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 UV  Optics<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
( Part 23 ) covers the determination
of
nitrogen
( 0.002
- 1.0 percent
) in steel by optical
emission
spectrometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The UV optic, situated
in a chamber
located
directly
behind
the spark
stand,
is filled
with
nitrogen
at
atmospheric
pressure.
The nitrogen
is circulated
through
the tank and the gas purifier
by a membrane
pump.
The
isolated
gas
system
provides
an
atmosphere
capable of transmitting
wave lengths down
to 140 nm. Alternatively,
any optics in a spectrometer
capable
for measuring
the nitrogen
emission
intensity
may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2
SAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1
The sample
is collected
in a mould
cavity
that
provides
a quickly
chilled
surface
through
rapid
solidification.
It should
be homogeneous
and free
from tlactures and voids. Alternatively sampling probes
may be used to collect
the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2
Typical
sample
sizes are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The most sensitive
line of nitrogen having
wavelength 149 nm lies in the vacuum ultraviolet region.
Any typical iron line is used as the internal standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Diameter
:20-50
mm, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Thickness
: 10-20 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Exposure Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
The sample
is prepared
on an abrasive
belt or
disc grinder, taking extreme care that the sample does
not become
too hot.
It is desirable
to use automatic
polishing
machine
to ensure
consistency
of polish.
The most commonly used abrasives are alumina, silicon
carbide or zirconia
of 60 grit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preflush,
preburn
and integration
period
during
the spark may be followed
as per the instructions
in
the operation
manual
of the manufacturer
of the
instrument.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Environment
Control<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 PRINCIPLE
OF
THE
TEST
METHOD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The optical emission
spectrometer
should be housed
in an air conditioned
room maintained
at a temperature
specified
by the manufacturer
with a relative humidity
of 50 + 5 percent.
The temperature
should
be kept
within + 2°C of the nominal, to reduce the drift in spectral
lines due to temperature
variation.
The room should
be free from vibrations,
dust and oil vapours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A capacitor
discharge
is produced
between
polished
surface of the sample and a conical
shaped electrode.
The discharge
is terminated
at a predetermined
time.
The radiant energy of the nitrogen
line and an internal
standard
line are converted
into electrical
energy by
means of photomultiplier
tubes.
The concentration
of nitrogen in steel is obtained by reference to standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6  Counter Electrode<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4
APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pointed
thoriated
tungsten
electrode
used
as
counter
electrode
may be reshaped,
when necessary.
The electrode
tip is cleaned
with a brush after every
spark.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Spectrometer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any
commercially
available
optical
emission
spectrometer
with a facility
to measure
the nitrogen
emission
intensity
can be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The spark stand, lens or quartz windows are
to be cleaned regularly to minimize the transmission
losses. Frequency of cleaning is to be established  by
individual laboratories depending upon the  volume of
work and the deposits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Argon
Flushing
System<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The system
consists
of high purity argon cylinders,
with argon content
above 99.995 percent,
a two stage
leak proof regulator,
a gas flow meter and connecting
copper/stainless
steel tubing of4-6
mm diameter
and
rare gas purifier to provide inert gas atmosphere
during
sparking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5
CALIBRATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Optimize
the position
of the entrance
window
by
carrying
out profiling
with a high nitrogen
bearing
steel sample,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Select 5 to 10 reference
steel standards
that cover
the required
concentration
range of nitrogen.
Spark<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The argon gas purifier
system
uses heated
titanium, copper oxide and molecular sieves to absorb<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

OF THE
SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>these
samples
and construct
the analytical
curve as
per
instructions
in the
operation
manual
of the
manufacturer
of the instrument.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1
Place
the prepared
sample
on the spark
stand.
Spark the sample
at two different
spots.
If the two
values
differ
more
than
3 standard
deviations
established
for procedure,
then give a third
spark.
Repolish and repeat the sparking
at 2 or 3 spots.
Take
average
of nearly
matching
values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6
STANDARDIZATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1
Standardize
the instrument
as per the operation
manual
of the manufacturer
of the instrument.
The
frequency
of standardization
will depend on the long
term stability
of the instrument.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Spark a standard
sample of known concentration
and make correction
in the unknown
sample result, if
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2
Confirm
that the standardization
is correct
by
analyzing
a standard
sample.
The value should
be
within the allowable
limits of the certified value of the
standards.
If not, repeat
the standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — It is suggested that the standard sample used
for verification
should have similar matrix and nearly
the same nitrogen content as the sample to be analyzed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The standardization
should be repeated if the
argon cylinder has been changed, the spectrometer
is
not in use for very long time or when an unusual drift
is noticed when a standard has been sparked for checking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 PRECISION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The precision of analysis should be within *10 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
