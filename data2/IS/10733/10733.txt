<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 10 November
1983, after the draft finalized by the Rubber
Products Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Petroleum,
Coal and Related Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
The hose is primarily intended for loading and off-loading
of road
and rail tanker
vehicles
carrying
petroleum
and blended
products
having an aromatic
hydrocarbon
content
of approximately
25 percent
( maximum ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard
covers 3 types of hoses.
Type 1 and Type 2 hoses
are designed
for road and rail tanker
services as dry hoses which
are
drained
after each period of service.
Type 3 is a smooth
bore reeling
hose without helical wire reinforcement.
For continuous
service and/or
for products
having higher aromatic
content, the manufacturer
should
be consulted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Tests under
4.4, 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8 may be carried
out on press
cured
test slabs made
from the same mix and vulcanized
to the same
degree or state of cure as that of the finished hose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For
the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requi.rement
of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accor-
dance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Test -
When
tested
according
to
the
method prescribed
in 8.2 of IS : 443-1975*, the bursting
pressure
for
type
lA, type

method of determining
electrical
continuity
is by the use
of a 4.5-V
battery
and 35 V, 0.3A test bulb.
A dimly lighted bulb is sufficient to
indicate satisfactory
continuity.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF FUEL
SOLUBLE MATTER<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-l. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.1 Cut  the sample
into pieces approximately
3 x3 mm and extract
5 g of the cornminuted
sample with 100 ml of a mixture of 30 parts by
volume
of pure toluene
and 70 parts by volume of pure &-octane
in a
glass flask for 96 hours at 40 f
l”C, suitable
precautions
being taken
to prevent loss by evaporation.
Filter the contents, while still hot, into
a hemisphertcal
glass dish of suitable size, washing both the residue in
the flask and the filter
with a further
quantity
of the solvent mixture.
Evaporate
the contents of the dish on a boiling water bath and heat the
residue in a ventilated
air-oven
for 2 hours at 150&3”C.
Carry out a
blank determination
on the solvent
mixture
and correct
the result as
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  If fuel soluble determination
is made on a sample of lining taken from the
hose, buff to remove any adhering reinforcement
fabric before cornminuting.<<HEADING_END>>
