<<HEADING level=1>>Indian Standard<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SPECIFICATION
FOR METRIC SCALES FOR
ARCHITECTURAL
PURPOSES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institu-
tion on 16 November
1959, after
the draft
finalized
by the Optical
and
Mathematical
Instruments
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by
the Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
is one of a series
of Indian
Standards
on metric
scales
being
prepared
by the Institution
in connection
with the changeover
to
the metric
system;
the other
standards
in the series are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  1480-1960
METRIC SCALES FOR GENERAL PURPOSES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1481-1961
METRIC STEEL SCALES FOR ENGINEERS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1482-1960
METRIC SCALES FOR  USE WITH DRAFTING MACHINES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Throughout
this standard,
the term ‘scale
’  has been
used to denote
the ratio
of enlargement
or reduction
to which
the drawings
are
to be
made from these scales.
The
term  ‘  Scale  ’ (  with S in capital
) has been
used to indicate
a strip of material
of suitable
cross-section
with figured
divisions
along
the edge
or edges
so that
dimensions
may
be read
or
transferred
to a drawing
or map.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The
scales specified
in this standard
are based on the reduction
scales
recommended
for general
engineering
purposes
in *IS  :  696-1955
Code
of Practice
for General
Engineering
Drawings.
In
addition,
scales
of
1  :  500
and
1  :  1000,  used mostly
for preparation
of drawings
for cons-
truction
of roads,
bridges
and railways,
have been
included.
A set of
paper
Scales
will,
therefore,
comprise
of six different
pieces
of Scales
with which
architects,
engineers
and surveyors
are mostly
concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
For
the
purpose
of deciding
whether
~a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
the
latest
version
of *IS
: 2-1949
Rules
for Rounding
Off Numerical
Values.
The
number
of significant
places -retained
in the
rounded
off
value
should
be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>0.6  This
standard
is intended
chiefly
to cover
the
technical
provisions
relating
to metric
Scales
used
for architectural
purposes,
and it does
not include
all the necessary
provisions
of a contract.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
covers
the
requirements
for metric
Scales,

varnished
cardboard
or of plastic
material,
used by architects,
engineers
and surveyors.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  SCALE DESIGNATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  This
standard
recognizes
six different
scales,
designated

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The use of the IS1 Certification
Mark is governed
by the provisions
of the Indian Standards
Institution
(  Certification
Marks  )  Act, and the Rules and
Regulations
made thereunder.
Presence
of this mark on products
covered by an
Indian
Standard
conveys the assurance
that they have been produced
to comply
with the requirements
of that standard,
under a well-defined system of inspection,
testing
and quality control during production.
This system,
which is devised and
supervised
by IS1 and operated by the producer,
has the further safeguard
that the
products
as actually
marketed
are continuously
checked by IS1 for conformity
to
the standard.
Details of conditions,
under which a licence for the use of the IS1
Certification
Mark may be granted
to manufacturers
or processors,
may be obtain-
ed from the Indian
Standards
Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
