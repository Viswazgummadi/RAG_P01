<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 22 February
1990, after
the draft finalized by the Dams ( Overflow and Non-overflow ) Sectional
Committee
had been
approved by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A large number of galleries and other openings are provided in practically
all modern
high dams.
The galleries are required for access, grouting, inspection, drainage and for the operation
of gates.
Other major openings include sluices, temporary
diversion
conduits,
river outlets
and penstock
openings.
In addition there are openings for stairwells, shafts, air vents; drainage holes etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To enable the designing of gallery it is necessary to determine the general stress field to which the
opening is subjected and subsequently to analyse the local alteration in it due to the particular shape
of the opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this standard only small openings such as foundation gallery, inspection gallery,
adit to gallery
etc have been considered.
The openings such as sluices, penstocks
and other similar openings
have been excluded from this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied
with the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding of numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number
of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>“Gravity Method of Analysis”, which assumes linear
distribution of vertical stresses on horizontal planes, is
generally used. The method provides a two-dimen-

a number of vertical elements, each of which carries its
load to the foundation without any transfer of the load
to adjacent vertical elements. The shear stress distribu-
tion is parabolic and horizontal stress distribution is
cubic. This method is used to determine, for each
loading combination ( see IS 65 12  :  1984 ), the normal
stresses on horizontal and vertical planes. The details
of the method are given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Concrete is assumed to behave as a linear and
elastic material. Tension upto the values permitted
in IS 6512  :  1984  may be allowed. Gallery rein-
forcement is required if tension exceeds these per-
missible values; and

STRESSES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1  The permissible stresses for reinforcement shall
be taken in accordance with the relevant standards.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10 DESIGN OF REINFORCEMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  The following design procedure will apply to
both concrete and masonry dams. In case of masonry
dams, a portion around an opening which is rein-
forced is .constructed in concrete. The thickness of
concrete around vertical openings like air vents is
generally 300 mm. For other opening, the thickness
varies from 750 mm to 1 500 mm. The design proce-
dure will be identical with that for a concrete dam; the
assumption is that the masonry and concrete behave as
one mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2  The procedure for the design of reinforcement
will be as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Locate the centre of the opening on a cross-section
of the dam;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D/A<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  For  design purposes the normal stress on rhe centerline
parallel to the stress field direction may be considered to be indc-
pendent of  B. For ox 7 0 the  tensile area = 0’149  A. (T” is the
normal stress  perpendicular
to Y-axis. D is the distance from the
boundary
of the opening along the Y-axis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Determine prevalent stress field in the dam sec-
tion at that location in the absence of the opening
( SEC 6.3 )
c) Determine the stress distribution along the plane
considered for design subjected to uniform stress
field arrived at in (b) above ( see 6.4 );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Critical Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The important loads that are to be considered for the
determination of overall stress field are dead load,
reservoir and tail-water loads, earthquake forces, uplift
pressure, earth and silt pressure, ice-pressure, wind
pressure and wave pressure. Designs should be based
on the most adverse combination of probable load
conditions and include those loads having a reasonable
probability of simultaneously occurrence. The gallarics
and other openings in gravity dams shall be designed
for the load combination listed in IS 65 12  :  1984, Load
combination B, C,  E, F  and G, shall, however, be
analysed without uplift.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Details of the reinforcement ( see 10.5 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3 Computation
of Total Tension<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total tension is determined by integrating the area
under tension along a particular section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4 Computation
of Area of Steel Reinforcement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After obtaining the total tension for section under
consideration for the opening, for the critical loading
condition, the area of steel is calculated by dividing the
total tension  (F )  by allowable stress (o,,) that is<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

simplified cases critical loads and sections are indi-

details are shown in Fig. 5.
The reinforcement bars must be straight as  far  as possi-

bars will generally be put up horiiontally above the

bars are necessary at the corners. The spacing of bars<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>between these openings should be more than two times
the width of opening. The average compression on the
unbroken portions of a horizontal section containing
these openings is equal to the total force on this
section, divided by the net area. The distribution of this
stress is unknown. A safe design should result if the
average compression does not exceed the allowable
compressive stress and if reinforcement is provided as
for a single opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>generally should not be less than 15 cm centre to centre
and not greater than 30 cm. The minimum clear cover
shall be 15 cm for the reinforcement. The minimum
diameter of reinforcement bars shall be 16 mm for
main reinforcement and 12 mm for distribution. Other
details of reinforcement must follow IS 456  :  1978.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6  Relaxation in Design Criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any change in the reinforcement around galleries as
computed by the procedure indicated in 10.2 above
can be made if indicated otherwise through the stud-
ies carried out by finite element and/or photoelastic
methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.1  If the clear space between two openings is less
than twice the width of openings, the horizontal rein-
forcement shall be made continuous. Such close spac-
ing should be avoided as far as possible. For high dams,
with high working compressive stresses the widest
practicable spacing of openings should be adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11 SPECIAL CASES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 Opening Close to Surface<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3  Three-Dimensional Openings, Intersections,
etc<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some cases, openings may have to be provided close
to the face of the dam or near the face of a block. In
such cases, the results obtained for normal openings
discussed above are not applicable. Photoelastic method
or finite element method should be used to obtain
stress fields in  such  cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the intersection of two or more openings, the state
of stress is three-dimensional and the two dimensional
procedure described above is not applicable. For a
detailed analysis, three-dimensional
investigations
should be carried out. However, for gallery intersec-.
tion, it should be generally adequate to double the
main reinforcement provided at top and bottom on all
the sides of intersection for a distance equal to the
width of the gallery. A typical arrangement at gallery
intersection is illustrated in Fig. 6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2 Multiple Openings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It  is frequently necessary to provide a number of
separate outlets through a dam. In a series of such
openings in a single horizontal plane, the clear spacing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
