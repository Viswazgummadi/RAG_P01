<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft finalized
by the Fire Safety Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temporary
structures
including large pandals normally erected at fairs,
festivals
and such other
outdoor assembly have not, in general, been subjected
to adequate
regulations
from fire safety
point of view though in certain
regions
certain
minimum
fire precautionary
measures
in the
construction
of such structures
are ensured before giving a licence or permission
for the erection
of such structures.
Therefore
with a view to giving necessary
guidance in regard
to fire protec-
tion measures to be adopted in the erection
of such structures,
it has been felt necessary
to
formulate
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1978,
covering the safety aspects
for temporary
structures
and pandals used by public excluding the temporary
structures
used for private
functions.
Since
then the number of Indian standards
in regard to details of construction,
fire safety and equip-
ment have been formulated.
This revision has therefore,
been prepared
so as to keep
details
of construction
and use of fire fighting
equipment
according
to the latest
standards.
Having
seen the more usage of temporary
structures
for private
functions,
the scope of this standard
has now been enlarged to cover such type of structures
also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The committee
responsible for the preparation
of this standard is given at Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
