FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on
15 May
1970,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Stones
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
The road system in the country
is developing
at a fast rate in order to
meet the needs of expanding
economy.
In view of large scale construction
programme
and
for effecting
economy
in the cost of construction,
soft
aggregates
having
adequate
mechanical
strength
in terms of impact
value
may be made use of in the bases and sub-bases
of road pavements.
As ma-
jority of soft aggregates,
such as laterite,
kankar,
shale, etc, lose their stren-
gth on wetting,
the standard
procedure
[see IS  :  2386 (Part
IV)-1963*
] has
been modified
by the Central
Road Research
Institute,
New Delhi,
so as to
determine
the impact
value of such aggregates
under saturated
condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -This  method of test for aggregate impact value may also be equally applied
to brick aggregates.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In
the
formulation
of this
standard
assistance
has
been
derived
from Road
Research
Monograph
No: 5 issued by Central
Road
Research
Institute,
New Delhi.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In reporting
the results of a test or analysis
made
in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This

OF TEST
SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
The test sample shall consist of aggregate
the whole of which passes a
12*5-mm
IS Sieve and is retained
on a lo-mm
IS Sieve.
The
aggregate
comprising
the
test
sample
shall
be
dried
in an oven
for a period
of
four
hours
till the time,
the weight
becomes
constant
at a temperature
of 105 to 110°C and cooled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The measure
shall be filled about one-third
full with the aggregate
and
tamped
with 25 strokes of the rounded
end of the tamping
rod.
A further
similar
quantity
of aggregate
shall he added
and a further
tamping
of
25 strokes
given.
The
measure
shall
finally
be
filled
to
overflowing,
tamped
25 times
and the surplus aggregate
struck off, using the tamping
rod as a straight-edge.
The net weight of aggregate
in the measure shall be
determined
to the nearest
gram
( weight
A) and this weight of aggregate
shall be used for the duplicate
test on the same material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 This oven-dried
sample is immkrsed
in water for three days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Myet sample
after
the immersion
period
is surface
dried
by suitable
cloth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>‘t. TEST
PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The
impact
machine
shall rest without
wedging
or packing
upon
the level
plate,
block
or floor,
so that it is rigid and the hammer
guide
columns
are vertical.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The
cup shall be fix.ed-&rmly in position on the base of the machine and
the whole of the test sample placed ?n it and compacted
by a single tamping
of 25 strokes of the tamping
rod.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The
hammer
shall
be raised
until
its lower
face
is 380 mm
above
the upper surface
of the aggregate
in the cup, and allowed to fall freely on
to
the
aggregate.
The
test
sample
shall be subjected
to a total of 15
such
bIows
each
being
delivered
at
an
interval
of not less than
one
second.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 The
crushed
aggregate
shall then be removed
from the cup and the
whole of it sieved on the 2*36-mm
IS Sieve and washed with water till no
further
significant
amount
passes in one minute.
The fraction
retained
on
the sieve shall be dried in an oven to the constant
weight at 105 to 110°C
and weighed
to an accuracy
of 0’1 g (weight  B).  The fraction
retained
on the sieve ( weight  B)  shall be subtracted
from the weight of the original
oven-dried
sample ( weight A ). The resultant
weight (weight A -weight
B)
shall represent
the fraction
passing 2*36-mm
IS Sieve ( weight C).
Two tests
shall be nilade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5. CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1’  The ratio of the weights of the fines formed to the total sample in each
test shall be expressed as percentage
of the oven dried, the result
being
recorded to the first decimal place:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Aggregate
impact value = s
x 100<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C= weight of the fines formed, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A = weight of the oven-dried sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. REPORTING
OF RESULTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The mean of the two results shall be reported
as aggregate
impact
value ( wet ) of the tested material.<<HEADING_END>>
