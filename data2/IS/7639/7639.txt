FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 4 April 1975, after the draft finalized
by the Building
Materials
and Components
Sampling
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Asbestos cement products find wide application
in building industry
because of their lightness and ease of handling combined
with adequate
strength.
It is, therefore,
imperative
that due consideration
is given
to the sampling procedures
which would help in proper and objective
evaluation of the quality of these products.
This standard prepared at
the instance of the Asbestos Cement Products Subcommittee,
lays down
the methods for sampling
and inspection of asbestos cement products as
duly evolved on the basis of statistical principles and practical
considera-
tions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 With a view to giving due weightage
LO  international
co-ordination,
this standard has been prepared in line with the IS0
Recommendation,
ISO/R
390-1964
‘Sampling
and inspection
of asbestos cement products’
issued by the International
Organization
for Standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This

SCOPE
1.1  This standard
prescribes the methods for sampling and criteria for
ascertaining
the conformity of asbestos cement products to the relevant
specification.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>of this standard,
the following definitions shall<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For
the purpose
apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>unit of product or material
on which inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Item -
Ultimate
will be performed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Defective
( or l’$on-Conforming )-The
‘  Item ‘, the quality of
which does not meet ;he specified requirements.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5 Sampling
InspFction
-
Inspection in which only a portion of aJot
is inspected with a ylew to making decisions about accepting or rejecting
the lot with respecl to certain characteristics.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4 Lot-A
coll$ction
of items from which a sample is drawn and
inspected to determine its acceptability
( or otherwise ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  -A
lot ghoulcl con&of iltdms of single  type, grade; class? size, ctc, produced
under
relatively’
uniform
rd~n&@ns
of manufacture.
Whereas
11 is not possibh: to
give exact
instrtictio?s
for.  the formation
of lots thal will cover all cases, one or more
of the Sollowine
consldrratlons
may be helpful
in determining
the uniformity
of the
conditiok
of production:
a) Itemd from a  single batch of raw-material;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) Items manufactured
within
a relatively
short  period
(  for example
a single
production
shift );<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c). Iteins manufactured
hy means of similar
moulds
( or patterns
);and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d) Items
produced
under
similar
conditions
of manufacture,
for example
hardening
and mymg,
etc.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>By  selection of homo;neous
lots the system of sampling inspection
employed
will lead to. a better
discrimination
between lots of good
quality and lots of bad quality.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5  Sample  -
Group of items drawn from a lot for inspection.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Inspection by Attributes  -Inspection
iv which an item is classi-
fied as either defective or non-defective.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7 Inspection
by Variables
- Inspection in which quality charac-
teristics of an item are measured on a condinuous scale and expressed
in terms of units of measurement.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8 Double Sampling
Plan-A
type of sampling inspection in which
the inspection of the first sample leads to a decision to accept a lot, to
reject it or to take a second sample and ,the inspection of the second
sample when required, always leads to a decision to accept or reject the
lot.

SAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  From each lot a sample shall be drawn, the size of which is indicated
in Table
1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  ‘Columns 1 to 4 and  col  7  of Table
1  give  the number of items of
product
in the lot and the sample
to be selected
for inspection
by
attributes and by variables.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 From one item of a sample one test piece only shall be cut for a
particular
test, but for different tests the necessary test pieces may be
cut from the same item of the sample.
When the relevant specification
calls for more than one property to betested,
the sample size may have
to be appropriately
multiplied  SO w'io  secure for each test a number of
test pieces equal to the sample size (3.2).
Method and position of cutting
the specimen shall be as given in the relevant specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. INSPECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Each item in the sample shall be tested as specified in the relevant
specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 The
test results shall be evaluated
either through
the method
of
inspection  by, attributes
( 4.4 and 5.1) or through the method of  inspec-
tion  by variables
( 4.5 and 5.2 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The method of inspection
by variables
shall normally be employed
for (a) transverse strength
(b) water absorption and (c) density; and for
all other characteristics
the method of inspection
by attributes
shall be
used. However, by agreement prior to the drawing of the samples ( 3.I),
the method of inspection
by variables
or attributes
may be substituted
for each other for any characteristic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 When
the
method
of inspection
by
attributes
is employed,
the
number of defective items in the sample should be deduced from the test
results and the acceptability
of the inspection lot determined as prescribed
in 5.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 When the method of inspection
by variables
is employed,
the test
results shall be recorded individually
retaining
the order in which they
are obtained
and the acceptability
of the inspection
lot determined as
prescribed in 5.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

LOTS
.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Inspection by Attributes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1  When the number of defective items found in the first sample is
equal to or less than the acceptance
number
a indicated
in co1 5 of
Table 1, the inspection
lot from which the sample was drawn shall be
considered acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2 When the number of defective items found in the sample is equal
to or greater
than the rejection number
I indicated in co1 6 of Table
1,
this may justify rejection of the inspection lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3 When the number
of defective
items found in the first sample
lies between the acceptance
number and the rejection number (co1 5 and
6 of Table
1 ), a second sample of the same size as the first sample
(co1 3 of Table
1 )  shall be drawn and inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4 The second sample shall also be inspected
as indicated
in 3.3
and 4.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5
The number
of defective
items found in the first and in the
second samples shall be combined..<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.6
If the combined
number
of defective
items is equal to or less
than the corresponding
acceptance
number
a (  co1 5 of Table
1 ), the
inspection lot shall be considered acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.7
If the combined number of defective items is equal to or greater
than the corresponding
rejection number Y (  co1  6 of Table
1 ), this may
justify rejection of the inspection lot.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.8 When the relevant
specification
calls for more than one property
to be tested, the second sample taken ( 5.1.3 ) shall only be inspected
in
accordance
with those characteristics
which at the inspection of the first
sample gave defective
items between the acceptance
number a and the
rejection
number r.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Inspection by Variables<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  Divide the readings in the order made into groups of 5, except
when the sample size is 3,4, 5 or 7, in which cases the group size is the
