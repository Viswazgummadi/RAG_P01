<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Wrought Steel Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Metallurgical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first issued in 1955 and subsequently revised in 1963. While reviewing the
standard in the light of experience gained during these years, the Committee decided to revise it to
bring it in line with the present practices being followed internationally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main modification in this revision relates to incorporation of test methods for insulation
resistance test, resistivity, ductility, density, size and shape measurement and tests on insulation
coating. This modification has become necessary in view of the fact that these tests have been
incorporated in all major standards of the world. All the tests are given in details so that many
laboratories in this country can get guidance in installing equipment to carry out these tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, assistance has been derived from the following overseas
standards:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

adequate for this purpose. Although the
current drain in the secondary circuit is quite

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1.1  The test frame shall consist of four
solenoids
(each
having
two
windings)
surrounding the four sides of the square
magnetic circuit, and a mutual inductor to
compensate for air-flux within the solenoids. The
solenoids shall be wound on nonmagnetic,
nonconducting forms of rectangular cross section
appropriate to the specimen mass to be used. The
solenoid shall be mounted so as to be accurately
in the same horizontal plane, and with the centre
line of solenoids on opposite sides of the square,
250±0.3 mm apart. The compensating mutual
inductor may be located in the centre of the space
enclosed by the four solenoids if the axis of the
inductor is made to be perpendicular to the plane
of the solenoid windings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

layer over a winding length of 191 mm or longer

solenoid windings, too, shall be connected in
series so their magnetizing forces will add. The
primary winding may comprise up to three
layers using two or more wires in parallel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>caused by voltage error may be 10 to 20 times as large
as the voltage error. An effort should be made to
maintain the calibration at 0.25 percent (or better) of
the true voltage reading at all scale points from
half-scale to full-scale deflection. Voltage scales should
be such that the instrument is not used at less than
half-scale deflection. Care should also be taken to avoid
errors due to temperature and frequency effects in the
instrument.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1.3  Primary and secondary turns shall be
wound in the same direction, with the starting
end of each winding being at the same corner
junction of one of the four solenoids. This
enables the potential between adjacent primary
and secondary turns to be a minimum through
out the length of the winding, thereby reducing
errors due to electrostatic phenomena.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.3   RMS Voltmeter, V rm s
A true rms-indicating voltmeter shall be
provided for evaluating the form factor of the
voltage induced in the secondary winding and
for evaluating the instrument losses. The
accuracy of the rms voltmeter shall be the same
as that specified for the flux voltmeter. The
resistance of the rms voltmeter shall not be less
than 500 ohms per volt of full-scale indication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1.4  The solenoid windings on the test frame
may be of any number of turns suited to the
instrumentation, mass of specimen, and test
frequency. Windings with a total of 700 turns
are recommended for tests in the frequency
range of 25 through 400 Hz.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.4   Wattmeter<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.4.1   Electrodynamometer wattmeter ,  W<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1.5  The mutual inductance of the air-flux
compensating inductor shall be adjusted to be
the same as that between the test-frame
windings
and
within
one
turn
of
the
compensator secondary. Its windings shall be
connected in series with the corresponding
test-frame windings so that the voltage induced
in the secondary winding of the inductor by the
primary current will completely oppose or
cancel the total voltage induced in the
secondary winding of the test-frame when no
sample is in place in the solenoids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A
reflecting
type
electrodynamometer
wattmeter is desirable for all specimen masses
and necessary for specimens lighter in mass
than about 6 g/mm of strip length (  see  Fig. 1b ).
For specimens weighing more than this, a
direct
indicating
low-power-factor
electrodynamometer
wattmeter
of
highest
available sensitivity may be used. For this later
type of instrument a 5 percent power-factor
type is desirable so that readings will not have
to be taken at less than 25 percent of full-scale
indication. The rated accuracy of measurement
of the wattmeter, at the frequency of test and
for unity power-factor loads, shall not be poorer
than 0.25 percent of full-scale deflection. For
general testing, resistance of the potential
circuit of this instrument should not be less
than 100 ohms per volt full-scale for each
voltage range, and the inductance of the
potential circuit should be such that the
inductive resistance at the test frequency will
not exceed 1 ohm per 1 000 ohms of resistance
of this circuit unless the potential circuit is
compensated for its reactance. If tests are to be
made at 15 kG (1.5 T) on ‘half-and-half’ grain
specimen, the resistance of the wattmeter
potential
coil
circuit
must
not
be
less
than 5 000 ohms for each ohm of inductive
reactance in the potential circuit unless the
instrument is adequately compensated for
errors due to its reactance (  see  Note 1 ). For
tests at inductions up to 10 kG (1.0 T) the
current coils of the wattmeter should not have
a resistance or reactance which exceeds 1 ohm.
For tests at 15 kG (1.5 T) the current coil
resistance
or
reactance
should
not
exceed 0.25 ohms (  see  Note 2 ). For power
frequency testing of high loss material at any
induction or for general testing at high
inductions it is desirable to have the current
coil resistance and reactance as low as 0.1 ohm.
The current rating of the wattmeter coils for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.2   Flux Voltmeter ,  V f
A full wave true average responding type
voltmeter, with scale reading in average volts
multiplied by 1.111, so that its indications will
be identical with those of true rms meter on a
pure sinusoidal voltage, shall be provided for
evaluating the peak value of the test induction.
To produce the estimated accuracy of the test
under this method the full scale meter error
shall not exceed 0.25 percent (  see  Note ).
Meters of 0.5 percent or more error may be used
at reduced accuracy. The resistance of the flux
voltmeter shall not be less than 1 000 ohms per
volt of full-scale indication, and should have a
resistance high enough (3 000 to 10 000 ohms
per volt) to avoid calibration and linearity
errors but not high enough to introduce
electrostatic errors if used with the mutual
inductors as a peak ammeter (  see   9.1.6  ). A
variable resistance, standard-ratio transformer
or other variable scale multiplying device may
be employed to permit the flux voltmeter to be
adjusted to indicate directly in units of flux
density if the combination of basic instrument
and scale multiplying device conforms to the
specification stated above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Inaccuracies in setting the test voltage
produced errors approximately two times as large in the
core loss. The error in exciting current at 15 kG (1.5 T)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the peak value of its primary current. A mutual
inductor used for this purpose must have
reasonably low primary impedance so that its
insertion will not materially affect the primary
circuit
conditions,
and
yet
must
have
sufficiently high mutual inductance to provide a
satisfactorily high voltage to the flux voltmeter
for primary currents corresponding to the
desired range in the magnetizing force  H p . The
secondary impedance of the mutual inductor is
important in relation to the current in this
circuit and should be low if any significant
secondary current is drawn by a low impedance
flux voltmeter. In any case, the addition of the
flux voltmeter should not change the “mutual
inductor secondary terminal” voltage by more
than 0.25 percent. The voltage waveforms are
extremely peaked under normal test conditions
and the flux voltmeter should be capable of
handling the high crest factor. Under sinusoidal
calibration procedures as indicated, the crest
factor capabilities of the meter are not checked,
and thus care should be exercised that the crest
capabilities are adequate. It is important that
the mutual inductor to be located in the test
equipment in such a position that its windings
will not be linked by a.c. leakage flux from other
apparatus. Care should be taken to avoid
locating it so close to any magnetic material or
any conducting material that its calibration and
linearity might be affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1  Failure to observe these limitations may necessitate
correction for phase-angle errors in the indications of
the wattmeter. A variable resistance or other suitable
variable-scale multiplying device may be employed to
permit the wattmeter to indicate directly in watts per
unit mass if the combination of the basic instrument
and multiplier conforms to the specifications stated
above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.6.2   Electronic peak-to-peak ammeter
Even at commercial power frequencies there
can be appreciable error in the measurement of
H  if winding capacitances and inductances and
flux voltmeter errors begin to become important
at some of the higher harmonic frequencies
occasioned by the extremely nonsinusoidal
character of the voltage waveform induced in
the secondary of the mutual inductor by the
nonsinusoidal exciting-current waveform. In
such
cases
the
crest
or
peak-current
measurements may be made with an electronic
voltmeter whose indications are proportional to
the peak-to-peak value of the voltage drop that
results when the exciting current flows through
a low value of standard resistance connected in
series with the primary winding of the
test-frame. This electronic peak-to-peak reading
voltmeter should have a nominal full-scale
accuracy (  see  Note ) of at least 3 percent at the
test frequency and be able to accommodate
voltages
with
a
crest
factor
of
up
to
approximately 5. Care must be exercised that
the standard resistor (usually in the range 0.1
to 1.0 ohm) carrying the exciting current has
adequate current carrying capacity and is
accurate to at least 0.1 percent in value. It must<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

may be such that the peak-reading voltmeter

the
resistor

the

<<HEADING level=3>>10.4 Demagnetization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When measurements of any magnetic property
are to be made at inductions below 10 kG
(1.0 T),
first
demagnetize
the
specimen.
Accomplish this by initially applying a voltage
sufficient to magnetize the specimen to an
induction above the knee of its magnetization
curve (where the exciting current increases
sharply for small increase in induction) and
then decrease the voltage slowly and smoothly
(or in small steps) to a very low induction. After
this demagnetization, make tests immediately
(to obtain a test value within 2 or 3 minutes) for
the desired test points. Make tests at several
values of induction in order of increasing
induction values. Demagnetization may often
be omitted for the test frequency of 50  H z .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10 PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  Prior to testing, check the specimen strip
for length to see that they conform to the
desired length to within 0.8 mm. Also check the
specimen to see that no dented, twisted, or
distorted strip has been included. Strips having
readily noticeable shearing burrs also may be
unsuitable for testing. Weigh the specimen on a
scale or balance capable of determining the
mass within an accuracy of 0.1 percent.
10.2  Divide the test specimen strips into four
groups containing equal numbers of strips
having very closely the same mass, for testing.
Insert the strips (always a multiple of four in
number) into the test-frame solenoids one at a
time, starting with one strip in each of two
opposite solenoids and then inserting a strip
into each of the other two solenoids so that
these later strips completely overlap the former
tap at the four corners (  see  Fig. 4 ). This
completes one layer of strips constituting a
complete flux path with four overlapped joints.
Build up successive layers in the same fashion
until the specimen is completely assembled.
With specimens cut half with and half across
grain, arrange all the parallel or “with grain”
strips in two opposite solenoids and all the
cross-or transverse-grain strips in the other two
opposite solenoids.
10.3  If the specimen strips are reasonably flat
and have a reasonable area of contact at the
corners, a sufficiently low reluctance is usually
obtained without resorting the pressure on the
joints. When the joints are unavoidably poor,
the use of light pressure on the joints, with the
use
of
nonmagnetic
corner
weights
of
about 200 g, is permissible although it may
introduce
some
additional
stresses
in
strain-sensitive materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.5  With the required apparatus connected as
in Fig. 2 and with terminals 1 and 2 connected
to the power source, then with switches  S 2 ,  S 3
and  S 4  closed,  S 5  closed to the test frame size,
and  S 1  and  S 6  open, adjust the voltage of the
power supply to a point where the flux
voltmeter indicates the value of voltage
calculated to give the desired test induction in
accordance with the equation of  11.1 . Because
the action of the air-flux compensator causes a
voltage equal to that which would be induced in
the secondary winding by the air-flux to be
subtracted from that induced by the total flux
in the secondary, the induction calculated from
this voltage will be the intrinsic induction
B i  = (  B   –  µ o H p  ). In most cases the values of
intrinsic induction,  B i , are not sufficiently
different from  B  to require that any distinction
be
made.
Where
µ o H p
is
no
longer
insignificantly small compared to  B i , as at very
high inductions, determine the value of  B  by
adding to  B i  either a measured value of  µ o H p  or
a nominal value known to be reasonably typical
of the class of material being tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6 Core Loss<<HEADING_END>>

voltmeter has been adjusted to the desired<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 649 : 1997<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>value, read the wattmeter. Some users,
particularly
those
having
wattmeters
compensated for their own losses (or burden),
will desire to open switch  S 5  to eliminate the
flux voltmeter burden from the wattmeter
indication others will likely choose to have  S 5
and  S 6  closed when measuring the losses, so
that all instruments may be read at the same
time. In the later case the combined resistance
load of the flux voltmeter, rms voltmeter, and
potential
circuit
of
the
wattmeter
will
constitute the total instrument burden on the
wattmeter. Exercise care so that the combined
current drain of the instruments does not cause
an appreciably large voltage drop in the
secondary circuit resistance of the test-frame.
In such a case the true induction in the
specimen may be appreciably higher than is
apparent from the voltage measured at the
secondary terminals of the test-frame. In any
event, power due to any current drain in the
secondary circuit at the time of reading the
wattmeter must be known so it can be
subtracted from the wattmeter indications to
obtain the net watts due to core loss.
10.7  Obtain
the
specific
coreloss
of
the
specimen in watts per unit mass at a specified
frequency by dividing the net watts by that
portion
of
the
mass
of
the
specimen
constituting the active magnetic flux path
(which is less than the mean geometric path
length) in the specimen. Equations and
instructions for computing the active mass of
the specimen and the specific coreloss are given
in  11.2 .
10.8  Measure the rms value of the secondary
voltage by having both  S 5  and  S 6  closed, and
the voltage adjusted to indicate the correct
value of flux volts. On truly sinusoidal voltage
both voltmeters will indicate the same voltage,
showing that the form factor of the induced
voltage is 1.111. When the voltmeters give
different readings, the ratio of the rms value to
that indicated by the flux voltmeter reveals the
ratio by which the form factor of the induced
voltage deviates from the desired value of
1.111. Determining the induction from the
readings of flux voltmeter assures that the
correct value of peak induction is achieved in
the specimen, and hence that the hysteresis
component of the coreloss is correct even if the
wave form is not strictly sinusoidal; but the
eddy-current component of the coreloss, being
due to current resulting from a non-sinusoidal
voltage induced in the cross section of the strip,
will be in error depending on the deviation of
the induced voltage from the desired sinusoidal
wave shape. This error in the eddy-current
component of loss can be readily corrected by
calculations based on the observed form factor
and
the
approximate
percentage
of
eddy-current loss for the grade of material
being tested if the correction is reasonably
small. The equations involved in determining
this correction is given in  11.3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.9 RMS Exciting Current<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measure the rms exciting current when
required, by having  S 1  and  S 3  closed;  S 2,   S 4,
and  S 6  open; and  S 5  closed to the test-frame
side; then with the ammeter on a suitable scale
range, adjust the voltage to the correct flux
voltmeter for the desired test induction. When
the setting of voltage is correct, open  S 5  and
read the ammeter with no current drain in the
secondary circuit. If  S 5  is kept closed to monitor
the induction during the current reading the
current drain of the flux voltmeter will be
included in the ammeter indication. If exciting
current is to be reported in terms of
ampere-turns
per
unit
path
length,
volt-amperes per unit mass, or permeability
from impedance, calculate the values of these
parameters from the equation given in  11.4 .
10.10 Permeability<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When permeability from peak current is
required, determine the peak value of the
exciting current for a given induction by having
S 3  open to insert the primary of the mutual
inductor,  S 1  and  S 2  closed to protect the
ammeter and wattmeter from the possibility of
excessive currents.  S 4  and  S 6  open to minimize
secondary loading, and  S 5  at first closed to the
test-frame side. Then adjust the voltage to the
current value for the desired induction, at this
point through  S 5  to the mutual inductor side to
observe the corresponding value of flux volts
(  E fm  ) at the secondary of the mutual inductor.
For use in this manner at full accuracy the flux
voltmeter must be such that the restrictions
of  9.1.6.1  are met. Equations involved in the
determination of peak current and  H p  by the
mutual inductor method are given in  11.6 .
10.10.1  Various types of a.c. permeability may
be determined from measurements described in
these methods. It should be understood that

individual values may differ considerably from

standard resistors are used instead of the
mutual
inductor
and
flux
voltmeter
for
determining peak current, follow the same
procedure as for the mutual inductor method
except use switch  S 5  only on the test-frame side
because a separate meter indicates the peak
current value. Equations involved in the
determination of peak current and  H p  by the
peak-reading voltmeter method are given
in  11.6 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The percent error in form factor is given by the
following equation:

assuming (  see  Note 1 ) that:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of Epstein specimens, where the

<<PARAGRAPH>>Obviously,  h  = 100– e  if residual losses are

The value of  h  and  e  in the above equation are
not critical when waveform distortion is low.

<<PARAGRAPH>>For testing of Epstein specimen at 50 Hz and a

simplifies to:

<<HEADING level=3>>11.2 Core Loss Calculation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To obtain the specific core loss of the specimen
in watts per unit mass, it is necessary to
subtract all secondary circuit power included in
the wattmeter indication before dividing by the
active mass of the specimen, so that for a
specific induction and frequency the specific
core loss in watts per kg is as follows:
P c(B ; f)  or  P c/m  = (  W  –  E 2 / R  )/ m 1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1  In determining the form factor error it is assumed that
the hysteresis component of core loss will be independent
of the form factor if the maximum value of induction is at
correct value (as it will be if a flux voltmeter is used to
establish the value of the induction) but that the
eddy-current component of core loss, being the function
of the rms value of the voltage, will be in error for
nonsinusoidal voltages. While it is strictly true that
frequency or form factor separations do not yield true
values for the hysteresis and eddy-current components.
Yet they do separate the core loss into two components,
one which is assumed to vary as the second power of the
form factor and the other which is assumed to be
unaffected by form factor variations. Regardless of the
academic difficulties associated with the characterizing
these components as hysteresis and eddy-current loss, it
is observed that the equation for correcting core loss or
waveform distortion of voltage based on the percentages
of first-power second-power of frequency components of
the core loss does accomplish the desired corrections
under all practical conditions if the form factor is
accurately determined and the distortion not excessive.
2  It is recommended that tests made under conditions
where the percent error in form factor,  F , is greater than 10
percent be considered as likely to be in error by an
excessive amount, and that such conditions be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>15.2 d.c. Power Supply<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preferred source of d.c. current is high
quality linear power supply of either unipolar
or bipolar operation. The power supply must
exhibit high stability and very low ripple in
order to achieve the most accurate results.
Programmable bipolar operational amplifier
power supplies are satisfactory for this type of
testing. Other stable source of d.c. current such
as storage batteries is permitted.
15.3 Main-Current-Control Rheostat,  R 1
When
nonprogrammeable
sources
of

rheostats must be used to control the current.
These rheostats must have sufficient power
rating and heat-dissipating capability to handle
the largest test current without undesirable
changes
in
resistance
and,
therefore,
magnetizing current during conduct of the test.

as

<<HEADING level=3>>This switch should conform to requirements

<<HEADING level=3>>15.8 Integrator,  F<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Due to their superior accuracy, stability and
ease of operation, electronic charge integrators
are the preferred means of measuring magnetic
flux. Integrators utilizing either operational
amplifier
and
capacitor
feedback
(analog
integrator) or pulse counting are permitted.
The accuracy of the integrator must be better
than 1 percent full scale. If analog display
meters are used to read the value of flux, the
measurement should be made on the upper
two-thirds of the scale. Analog integrators must
have drift adjust circuitry and the drift should
not exceed 100 Maxwell-turns (10 –6   Wb turns)
per minute on the most sensitive range. It is
also
desirable
that
the
integrator
have
appropriate scaling circuitry to permit direct
reading of either flux (  ϕ  ) or flux density (B).
Ballistic
galvanometers
or
moving
coil
fluxmeters are allowed provided the 1 percent
full scale accuracy requirement is met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement of the magnetizing current can
be accomplished with either a d.c. ammeter or a
combination of a precision shunt resistor and
d.c. voltmeter. The meters and shunt resistor, if
used, must have an accuracy of atleast 0.25
percent. To improve test accuracy multirange
digital ammeters or voltmeters are preferred.
Autoranging
capability
is
desirable
for
convenience but is not essential for this test
method. If analog meters are used, the ranges
must be such that all test readings are made in
the upper two-thirds of the scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.8.1  By agreement between the parties, a
ballistic galvanometer or charge integrator may
replace the flux meter.<<HEADING_END>>

this should be of periodic time not less than 7
seconds.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>15.6 Reversing Switch,  S 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.1 Calibration of Integrator<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Due to the low resistance nature of the
magnetizing circuit, it is imperative that high
quality switches be used. Changes in switch
resistance upon reversal will cause deviation
from the cyclically magnetized condition which
if excessive will impair test accuracy and
precision. Experience has shown that mercury
switches are the best suited for this application.
Knife
blade
switches
or
mechanical
or
electrically operated contactors can also be
used provided the requirement for uniform and
equal contact resistance can be maintained.
Due to the presence of leakage currents in the
open condition, solid state relays are not
permitted. The difficulties inherent in the use
of main current reversing switches can be
minimized by use of linear power supplies
capable of accepting a remote programming
signal. Such power supplies are permitted
provided that the magnetizing current is equal<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Practical operating experience has shown that
provided a proper warm up period is allowed,
electronic
indicators
require
infrequent
calibration and unlike ballistic galvanometers,
calibration is not an integral part of this test
method. When calibration is required it can be
accomplished with either a mutual inductor or
a volt-second source. Due to their traceability to
the fundamental units of voltage and time,
volt-second sources are the preferred means of
calibration. The accuracy of either the mutual
inductor or volt-second source must be better
than the rated full scale accuracy of the
integrator.
16.2 Calibration of Ballistic Galvanometer<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The galvanometer scale and B-circuit may be
calibrated using current reversals in the

m  =

ρ

<<HEADING level=3>>18 PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.1  In Fig. 5 the d.c. power source supplies
magnetizing current measured by ammeter A.
Rheostats  R 1  and  R 2  and switches  S 1  and  S 2
determine the magnitude and direction of the
current as required by the various operations.
In general, three types of switching operation
are required in ballistic testing. One is reversal
magnetizing-current direction without change
of magnitude as required for establishing a
cyclically magnetized condition and in normal
induction tests. This is accomplished by
throwing switch  S 1  from one side to other. A
second
is
reduction
of
magnitude
of
magnetizing
current
without
change
of
direction. This operation is required to measure
points on the hysteresis loop in the first
quadrant. This is done by opening switch  S 2 .
The third operation combines reversal of
magnetizing current direction with a reduction
in magnitude. This operation is required to
measure points on the hysteresis loop in the
second and third quadrants. Obtain this
reversal and reduction by simultaneously
throwing switch  S 1  from one side to the other
and opening switch  S 2 . Use care to be sure  S 2  is
opened before  S 1  is reclosed for reversal. When
determining the hysteresis loop, switches  S 1
and  S 2  must be operated to traverse the loop in
the
same
direction
between
successive
measurements so as to preserve the cyclically
magnetized state of the test specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The equation can also be written as.
I c  =  ϕ N /(  L m  × 10 5   )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where  ϕ  =  BA  or total magnetic flux,  M x
16.2.1  Using the above equation substitute in
the value of flux density  B , which corresponds
to the desired calibration flux density and the
values of the specimen area turns and mutual
inductance. This gives the value of current
which must be reversed in the mutual inductor.
Set this value of current through the mutual
inductor
and
observe,
the
galvanometer
deflection on current reversal. The value of the
calibrating resistor is then adjusted to make
the galvanometer deflection on current reversal
swing from zero to the desired scale deflection
for the calibrated deflection point. Usually the
scale is calibrated to make the deflections on
reversal equal to the  B  value of calibration or
some simple multiplier of it.
16.3  For
basic
material
evaluation
the
galvanometer shall be calibrated with sufficient
number of current values to provide a
calibration curve which is accurate to 0.1
percent of full scale or 0.2 percent of smallest
scale division. When desired because of non
linearity or other reasons the test deflection
points
may
be
calibrated
independently
without completing a full scale calibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>17 PREPARATION AND ASSEMBLY OF
TEST SPECIMENS
17.1  The test specimen shall be cut from the
sheet selected at random from the batch of
5 tonnes or part thereof to be tested. A
specimen shall have the same width as the
Epstein test specimen. For non-oriented sheets,
one half of pieces shall be cut parallel to and
the other half perpendicular to the direction of
rolling as given in Fig. 1a and 1b. For oriented
sheets the pieces shall be cut parallel to the
direction of rolling as shown in Fig. 1c. The
total number of test pieces taken for this test
shall not be less than 12.
17.2  All the strips shall be cut from a single
sheet and shall be distributed symmetrically
over the entire area of the sheet as far as
practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2  Demagnetize
the
test
specimen
immediately prior to testing. To demagnetize
with
direct
current,
first
establish
a
magnetizing force sufficiently large to cause the
flux density in the specimen to reach a value
greater than the knee of the normal induction
or magnetization curve. Then slowly reduce the
magnetizing
current
to
zero
while
simultaneously operating the reversing switch
at one half second or longer intervals. An
auxiliary circuit using a time delay relay to
effect switch reversal will make this operation
more reproducible and less tedious. When the
test specimen consists of thin strip (less
than 0.001 m
thick)
alternating
current
demagnetization
using
50 Hz
or
lower
frequency and autotransformers can be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>18.3  To
obtain
the
flux
density
(  B  )
corresponding to a specific magnetizing force
(  H  ), establish the proper magnetizing current
using equation 1, cycle the reversing switch
several times to establish the cyclically
magnetized condition, zero the integrator and
execute the proper switching procedure as
found in  18.1 . The value of the flux or flux
density can then be computed from the
integrator reading. Additional test points on
the normal induction curve can be obtained
without demagnetization if they are obtained in
ascending order of  B  or  H . Otherwise it is
necessary to demagnetize prior to additional
testing.
18.4  To

the
magnetizing

corresponding to a specific flux density, a
procedure similar to  18.3  is used with the
exception that the magnetizing current, and

<<HEADING level=3>>19 CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19.1  The mean magnetizing force applied to the
test specimen by the current through the
magnetizing coil is determined from the
equation:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H  =  NI / l 1
... (1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
H  =
magnetizing force, A/m
N  =
number of turns in magnetizing coil  N 1 ,
I
=
current through the magnetizing coil
in A, and
l 1  =
mean magnetic path length in m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.2  The Epstein test frame coils are built
considerably larger than the test specimen
cross sectional area. To avoid the need for
manual air-flux correction a compensating
mutual inductor is built into the test-frame.
This
means
that
the
flux
density
measurements are intrinsic flux density,  B i ,
measurements. To obtain normal flux density,
B , the following equation must be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.5  Electronic integrators do not determine
flux densities directly, rather the change in flux
linkages (N 2__ o) is measured. This result is
converted to changes in flux density by division
by the specimen cross-sectional area  A , and
number of secondary turns,  N 2 . To determine
the actual value of flux density the starting or
reference points must be known. In the case of
normal induction or magnetization curve
measurements, it is customary to zero the
integrator and measure the change in flux
density
for
a
fully
reversed
change
in
magnetizing current. In this instance, the true
value of flux density is one half of the total
change in flux density. For hysteresis loop
determination, the integrator is zeroed at the
point
of
maximum
magnetization.
The
resulting change in flux density is equal to the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B  =  B i  + µ o H

<<PARAGRAPH>>where

<<HEADING level=3>>21 PRECISION AND BIAS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>21.1  The accuracy of determining magnetizing
force  H  is usually dependent on the accuracy of
current measurement, and ability to maintain
identical current after reversal and in the
accuracy of determining magnetic path length.
For the Epstein frame, due to corner joints,
there is some uncertainty as to the true path

the flux density,  B , will be determined within

<<HEADING level=3>>25.8 Hot Plate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hot plate shall be such that the test
specimen can be heated to the temperature of
test with automatic control to maintain the test
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>25.6  Electrical contact with the base metal is
made through two 3 mm diameter twist drills
(preferably carbide tipped) or hardened and
pointed rods. These are vertically mounted and
spring loaded in spiral slotted sleeves to impart
a twist while piercing the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>25.9 Test Head Power Supply<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The instrument may be operated from batteries
or from a voltage regulated d.c. power supply.
For battery operation, either storage or dry cell
types may be used with appropriate control
rheostats for setting voltages during tests.
Commercial power supplies are available for
use with this equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 649 : 1997<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>25.10  The voltage regulated d.c. power supply
should be capable of voltage regulation of
atleast 0.5 percent at 0.5 V during load changes
from zero to 1.0 A and line voltage variations
of ±10 percent. This maintains the voltage
adequately accurate during test and eliminates
the necessity for manual voltage adjustments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>show voltage across the test head. When
connected in this manner the voltmeter load
current will appear as an error current in the
ammeter reading and shall be subtracted from
the ammeter readings. On short circuit the
correct load current is 1.00 A plus the voltmeter
current. To eliminate this correction it is
permissible to offset ammeter to a zero position
when the test head is up (not making contact)
to return the ammeter to a zero reading
with 0.5 V applied between the head and the
test bed plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>25.11 Ammeter<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
zero
to
1.0 A
ammeter
should
be
D’Arsonval type rated for 1 percent or better
accuracy. This provides needed scale resolution
for low and high resistance coatings. A digital
ammeter with zero to 1 A range and with better
accuracy may be used. Digital read out should
have two or three places after the decimal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>27.2  To ensure correct contact button condition,
make a short circuit test occasionally by testing
a bare metal surface. When the short circuit
current is less than 0.99 A, clean the contacts.
The use of solvents for cleaning is preferred to
abrasives because the later can result in
rounded tips with reduced contact areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>25.12 Voltmeter<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When batteries are used the d.c. voltmeter
range would normally be zero to 2.0 V. If a
voltage regulated power supply is used, better
resetability may be obtained by use of a zero
to 0.5 V d.c. voltmeter. To avoid poor agreement
between instruments, the voltmeter should be a
type rated for one percent or better accuracy
and preferably should have a sensitivity of at
least 1 000 Ω /V (The current drawn by the
voltmeter appears as an error in the ammeter
reading.  See   27.1  for the correction). A digital
voltmeter with similar capabilities may also be
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>27.3  The recommended standard pressure for
purpose of comparative tests shall be 2.1 MPa.
Other
pressures,
depending
upon
the
applications, may be agreed upon by the
manufacturer and the purchaser. If more than
one test pressure is to be used, apply the
pressures in ascending order. During testing,
apply the pressures only once, but an applied
pressure may be increased to a higher value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>27.4  If both sides of the specimen are coated do
not use the same area to test both sides.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>25.13 Hot Plate Power Supply<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>27.5  The
recommended
standard
test
temperatures are room temperature or 150°C.
Other temperatures and the sequence of
temperatures depending upon the application
may be agreed upon by the manufacturer and
the purchaser. When tests are made at elevated
temperatures allow sufficient time (usually 30
seconds) to heat the specimen to the specified
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The plate power supply and temperature
controlled equipment should be capable of
automatic temperature control and variable
setting features. It may use thermocouples or
other temperature sensing elements, but must
be able to maintain temperature of the hot
plate within celsius degrees of the set
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>27.6  Place the specimen on the plate beneath
the test head and position it so that all contacts
are within the test area when the test head is
brought in contact with the specimen. Apply
the specified pressure. Adjust the voltage
to 0.50 V and read the ammeter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>26 TEST SPECIMEN<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>26.1  The width and length of a specimen strip
shall be greater than the width and length
respectively of the assembly contacts. The

is 50 mm × 125 mm.
A
minimum

five
specimen strips is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>28 CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>26.2  By mutual agreement, tests may be run on
Epstein test strips. The Epstein specimens may
be less satisfactory than the minimum size
specimen suggested in  26.1  because of the
tilting effect due to burrs, shearing strains and
disturbances in the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>28.1  The
average

is
usually
acceptable
for
evaluating surface insulation. Average the
current readings for each surface for a

<<HEADING level=3>>29 PRECISION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Even with the best practices in design,
instrumentation, maintenance and operation,
the repeatability and reproducibility of the test
method are greatly influenced by the nature of
the surfaces of the test specimens. Hence it is
not considered possible to state meaningful
values for repeatability and reproducibility that
are universally applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>34 PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>34.1  Measure the electrical resistance of the
test specimen using a Kelvin type resistance
bridge
or
potentiometer-ammeter
system
having separate current and potential leads.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SECTION 5 DETERMINATION OF
RESISTIVITY OF MAGNETIC SHEET
AND STRIP<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>34.2  The distance between each potential lead
contact and the corresponding current lead
contact shall be at least twice the width of the
test specimen with the two potential contacts
lying between the current contacts. The
distance between the potential contacts shall be
not less than 120 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>30 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This test method covers determination of the
resistivity of magnetic sheet and strip.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>31 SUMMARY OF METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>34.3  The dimension of each potential contact in
the direction of the length of the specimen shall
be not more than 0.5 percent of the distance
between the potential contacts.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The electrical resistance of 250 mm long test
specimen is measured with a Kelvin type
resistance bridge or potentiometer-ammeter
method. The resistivity is then calculated from
the
resistance
measurement
and
the
dimensions of the specimen, and is known as
the electrical resistivity of the material. This
value is equal to the resistance between
opposite faces of a cube of unit dimensions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>34.4  The contacts to the specimen shall be
located centrally with respect to the specimen’s
width dimension and the current contacts shall
cover more than 80 percent of the width. A
reliable contact shall be made with the
specimen by both the current and potential
leads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>32 APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>32.1  Kelvin type resistance bridge or a d.c.
potentiometer and d-c ammeter providing
resistance
measurements
to
an
accuracy
within 0.5 percent of the accepted true value.
32.2  If a potentiometer is used, a suitable d.c.
source and ammeter are required to establish
and measure the total current in the specimen,
which should be limited to avoid excessive
heating. The required  R  is then the ratio of the
measured potential drop to the measured
current. When the potentiometer is balanced,
no current flows in the potential leads so that
any contact resistance at the potential point is
of no consequence.
32.3  The Kelvin bridge is calibrated to read
directly the resistance between the potential
points without knowledge of the currents in the
specimen. Contact resistance at a potential
points and the resistance of the four leads to
the specimen are not a part of the required  R
and are usually negligible portions of the
corresponding
components
of
the
bridge
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>34.5  Specimen temperature during test should
be about 27 ± 5°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>34.6  To
eliminate
errors
due
to
contact
potential, take two readings, one direct and one
with the current reversed, in close succession.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>34.7  The electrical current in the test specimen
must be limited to avoid over heating but must
be adequate to provide sufficient sensitivity to
show an out-of-balance condition when the
resistance reading is changed to 0.5 percent of
the value recorded. If the current is too low,
sensitivity is low also, and a balance can be
shown for a broad range of resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>35 CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>40 IMMERSION METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>40.1  In arbitration test, the conventional
immersion method must be applied. This
method
is
appropriate
only
when
test

test specimens should be degreased prior to use
in the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>p = RA / l 2

<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>40.2  By means of hydrostatic balance the test
specimen
is
weighed
before
and
after
immersing it in water of known density  ρ w . All
air bubbles should be removed from the surface
of the test specimen. Then the density  ρ m  of the
test specimen is given by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P  =
electrical resistivity of the material in

<<PARAGRAPH>>R  =

<<HEADING level=3>>35.3  The resistivity units in ohm metre shown
in equation (2) can be converted to micro ohm
cm by multiplying the ohm metre figure by 10 8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>micro ohm cm per ohm metre. For example, if
the resistivity of a 1 percent silicon plus
aluminium steel is 0.25 × 10 –6   ohm metre
or 0.25 x 10 –6   × 10 8   micro ohm cm per ohm
metre is equal to 25 micro ohm cm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to obtain comparable results, it is
necessary to test at least five test specimens
and to average the results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>37 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Density values normally used in the calculation
of the magnetic cross-section of the Epstein

(  see  Section 5 ) are those values defined as the
conventional density in product standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>41.1.2  The electrical method is applicable only
to silicon bearing sheet, the total silicon and
aluminium content of which lies between 1 and
5 percent of mass. Aluminium, if present, shall
not be higher than 0.4 percent. This later value
is also the limit for the total of other common
constituents. This method recognizes the fact
that both density and resistivity are functions
of the aluminium and silicon contents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>38 METHODS TO BE USED<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>38.1  The immersion method is a fundamental
method
of
determining
density
but,
in
application, requires that the surfaces of the
test specimen be essentially free of oxide films

<<PARAGRAPH>>55 DETERMINATION OF DUCTILITY OF
ORIENTED ELECTRICAL STEEL SHEET
This method covers determination of the
ductility of grain oriented electrical steel
covered under IS 3024 : 1996 by use of an
apparatus known variously as a thinner’s
brake, hand folder, or an apron brake.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>53 PROCEDURE
53.1  Clamp the specimen tightly in the
stationary jaws in the bend test machine,
Fig. 9, and place in tension by stretching the
spring during clamping.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>56 SUMMARY OF METHOD
A test specimen representing the full width of
grain oriented steel to be tested is bend through
an angle of about 160 degree in a thinner’s
brake. The numbers of breaks, or fractures,
occuring along the bend determines the
ductility class rating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>53.2  Bend the specimen through 90° by use of
the movable arm and jaws, Fig. 10; then bend it
through 180° in the reverse direction. Again
bend the specimen through 180° in the first
direction
and
continually
through
180°
reversals until a crack appears at the bent or
until sudden failure occurs by complete
rupture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>57 SIGNIFICANCE AND USE
57.1  This is a specialized bend test for grain
oriented electrical steel.
57.2  This test is applicable to grain oriented
silicon steel in commercial thickness and
widths up to 910 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>53.3  Each full 180° bend, including the first 90°
bend, shall be counted as one bend in
determining the number of bends withstood by
the specimen.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>58 APPARATUS
58.1  The machine required to perform this test
is known as a thinner’s brake, hand folder, or
an apron brake.
58.2  The brake shall be at least 910 mm wide with
an opening capacity of approximately 0.90 mm.
58.2.1  The nose bar shall have a 0.80 mm
radius.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>54 CALCULATIONS

<<PARAGRAPH>>59 TEST SPECIMEN
59.1  Two specimens are required and they shall
be selected from the same general location as
that of the magnetic test specimen.
59.2  The specimens shall be cut transversely to
the rolling direction and have a length equal to
the sheet or strip width and a minimum
dimension of 76 mm in the direction of rolling.
59.3  The specimens must be free of rust, ripples
and scratches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Class 1
Not more than one break with
length not exceeding 8 mm
Class 2
Not more than two breaks with
total length not exceeding 15 mm
Class 3
Three to eight breaks, all sizes
Class 4
Nine to fifteen breaks, all sizes
Class 5
More than fifteen breaks, all sizes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>61.2  The class ratings shown are based on strip
widths of 610 to 910 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>61.3  When evaluating steel strip narrower than
610 mm, the number of breaks should be
multiplied by the ratio of 610 over the strip
width in mm. This converted number of breaks
will then determine the class rating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>60 PROCEDURE
60.1  The test specimen shall be at room
temperature at the start of the test.
60.2  Insert the test specimen into the brake
and clamp with the direction of rolling
perpendicular to the nose bar and 12 to 38 mm
under the nose bar, thereby allowing the
balance of the specimen width to rest against
the bending bar.
60.3  Bend the specimen around the nose bar at
a uniform rate by rotating the bending bar
through an angle of 160°.
60.4  Remove the specimen from the machine
and without straightening the bend, examine
the outside face of the bend from surface breaks
without magnification.
60.5  Count the breaks and measure for length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>61.4  The class rating assigned to a test lot shall
be the higher numerical class number of the
two specimens.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>62.3 Determination of the Variation from
the Shearing Line
A specimen of a definite length specified is cut
through, parallel to the direction of rolling. The
two parts, neither of which may be reversed,
are weighed in such a way that they lie flat.
The two cut edges are then again placed
together until the smallest possible gap is
present. The greatest remaining distance
between them is measured. The specimen must
be at least 1 000 mm long.
