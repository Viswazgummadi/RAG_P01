<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by the
Soils and
Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by
the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With a view to establish uniform procedures
for determination
of different
characteristics
of soils
and also for facilitating
comparative
studies of the results, an Indian
Standard Methods of Tests
for Soils, IS 2720 has been published
in 41 parts.
This part deals with the method
of test for
determination
of centrifuge
moisture
equivalent
of soils.
The value of the centrifuge
moisture
equivalent
is useful in assessing the relative
permeability
of soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published in 1964.
In this first revision apart
from the general updation,
the amendment
issued has been incorporated
and all the quantities/dimensions
have been
given
in SI units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
IS complied with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test
or analysis,
shall be
rounded off in accordance
with 1s 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A 5 g soil specimen
shall be taken
from
the
thoroughly

the
purpose
of
this
standard,
the
following definition
shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Centrifuge Moisture Equivalent ( CME )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The centrifuge
moisture
equivalent
of a soil is
the amount of moisture,
expressed as a percen-
tage of the mass of the oven-dried
soil, retained
by the soil which has been
first saturated
with
water and then
subjected to a force
equal to
1 000 times the force of gravity for one hour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Weigh the Gooch
crucible
empty and with a
piece of dry filter paper which just covers the
bottom
of the crucible.
Then place the
soil  ,_
specimen in the crucible.
Place
the
crucible
with the soil specimen
in a pan of distilled
water and allow specimen to take up moisture
until completely
saturated,
as indicatid
by the
presence
of free water on the surface of the
specimen.
Then place the crucible in a humi-
difier for at least 12 hours to ensure
uniform
distribution
of
moisture
throughout
the soil
mass.
Pour off all free water
remaining
on
the surface of the sample and place the cruci-
Die in a Babcock trunnion
cup fitted as descri-
bed in 4 (c).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Gooch Crucible -
porcelain,
with per-
forated
bottom.
The
crucible
shall be
about 40 mm in height and the diameter
shall be about
25 mm at the
top
and
about 20 mm at the bottom.
Filler Paper -
circular
piece, just large
enough to cover
the inside bottom
of
the Gooch
crucible.
A Whatman filter
paper

42 or equivalent
is found
suitable.
Trunnion
Cup -
a Babcock
trunnion
cup fitted with a brass cap and
with a
suitable device for supporting the Gooch
crucible
12 mm above the bottom of the
cup in such
a manner
that
the
water
ejected

operation
shall not come in contact with the cruci-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the soil specimen for a period
of
one hour at a speed which,
for the diameter
of
head used, will exert a centrifugal
force 1000
times the
force
of gravity
at the
centre
of
gravity
of the
soil
specimen.
Immediately
after
centrifuging,
weigh the
crucible
and
contents
and record
the mass.
Then oven-dry
the specimen to constant

ture of 105°C to 110°C. Weigh the crucible and
contents
and record the mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
