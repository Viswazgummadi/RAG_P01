<<PARAGRAPH>>NATIONAL FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard which is identical with IS0 4868:1984’Code for the measurement and reporting of
local vibration data of ship structures and equipment’ issued by the International Organization for
Standardization
(ISO) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on the recommendation of
Mechanical
Vibration
and Shock
Sectional Committee and approval of the Light Mechanical
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The text of IS0 Standard has been approved as suitable for publication as Indian Standard without
deviations. In the adopted standard certain conventions are not identical to those used in Indian
Standards. Attention is especially drawn to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Wherever the words ‘International Standard’ appear referring to this standard, they should be
read as ‘Indian Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Comma (J has been used as a decimal marker while in Indian Standards, the current practice is
to use a full point (.) as the decimal marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this adopted standard, reference appears to certain International Standards for which Indian Standards
also exist. The corresponding Indian Standards which are to be substituted in their place are listed

Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>vibration
of the structure or equipment
mounted thereon.
Con-
cern over local vibration
may be caused by  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The term “local vibration”,
as used in the shipbuilding
industry,
applies to the dynamic
response of a structural
element,
an
assembly
of structural
elements,
machinery
or equipment
which vibrates at an amplitude
significantly
greater than that of
the basic hull girder at the location.
This~vibration
may occur at
a frequency
of the hull girder or of a machinery
component.
Typical
examples
include
the
vibration
of
parts
of
the
superstructure,
smokestack,
mast, binnacle,
turbine,
pipe or
deck plate. These local vibrations
generally result from  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the stresses due to the vibration,
for example
in the
structure,
in the equipment
or attachments;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the necessity of maintaining
trouble-free
operation
of a
machine or other equipment
which might be jeopardized
by
the malfunction
or degradation
of components;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the physical
strain on man (habitability
and perform-
ance);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
local flexibility
of supporting
structural
elements;
or,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the vibratory
characteristics
of the
machinery
con-
cerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>dj
the effects of the vibration
on its environment,
such as
adjacent instruments,
machines,
equipment,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this International
Standard,
the term “vibration
severity”
is
used to describe the vibration
conditions
in the ship and, based
on long-established
practice in the industry,
the peak value of
vibration
velocity
has been chosen as the primary quantity
of
measurement:
since,
however,
much
data
have
been
ac-
cumulated
in terms
of vibration
acceleration
and vibration
displacement,
a plotting sheet has been adopted on which data
may easily be plotted using any of these quantities
of measure-
ment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency
range considered
includes propulsion
shaft rota-
tional frequencies,
rotational
frequency
of machines and other
significant
source frequencies,
such as diesel firing,
blade or
vane passage, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International
Standard ,gives general principles of vibration
measurement
on board ships to improve vibration
engineering.
Therefore,
in individual
cases, items to be measured
may be
selected or added to meet the aims of the vibration
measure-
ment of each ship.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope and field of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International
Standard
establishes uniform procedures
for
gathering
and presenting
data on vibrations
of local structural
elements or equipment
in sea-going
merchant
ships. The pro-
cedures,
where applicable,
can also be used for inland ships
and tug boats. Such data are necessary to establish uniformly
the vibration
characteristics
present in various compartments
on board ship and to provide a basis for design predictions,
im-
provements
and comparison
against environmental
vibration
reference
levels or criteria relative to reliability
(of machines),
safety
(of structures)
and habitability.
The data are not in-
tended to apply to the evaluation
of the vibration
of machines
with respect to noise control orto the design of the machine or
equipment
under consideration.
These latter cases will gen-
erally
require
specific
diagnostic
treatment
and
include
a
broader frequency
range and more specialized instrumentation
than is necessary for these general considerations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

hull girder  :  The primary hull structure such as the shell
plating and continuous strength decks contributing to flexural
rigidity of the hull and the static and dynamic behaviour of
which can be described
by a free-free
non-uniform
beam
approximation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2
Preferable
test conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The preferable conditions shall be as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)
the test should be conducted in a depth of water not
less than five times the draught of the ship, with machinery
running under normal conditions, unless otherwise speci-
fied:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
hull girder
vibration
:  That component
of vibration
which exists at any particular transverse plane of the hull so
that there is little or no relative motion between
elements
intersected by the plane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  For exploratory purposes, tests may be carried out at the
quayside if there is no reason to suppose that shallow water will
influence the results.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4
local vibration
:  The dynamic response of a structural
element,
deck,
bulkhead
or piece of equipment
which
is
significantly greater than that of the hull girder at that location.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)
the test should be conducted in a quiet sea (sea state  3
or less);<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c)
the ship should be ballasted to a displacement as close<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>as possible to the operating conditions within the ordinary
ballasting capacity of the vessel. The draught aft should en-
sure full immersion of the propeller;<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5
severity
of vibration
:  The peak value of vibration
(velocity,
acceleration
or displacement)
during periods of
steady-state
vibration,
representative
of maximum repetitive
behaviour, under the conditions defined in 4.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d)
during the free-route
portion of the test, the rudder
angle should be restricted to about two degrees port or star-
board (minimum rudder action is desired);<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>When
using autographic
records, suitable lengths of record
may easily be recognized.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>e)
individual machines may be run in isolation as required
to investigate particular problems.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using electronic methods of recording and analysis, care
shall be taken to use lengths of record, time constants and
averaging times so that a good approximation
to the steady-
state amplitude is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Any divergence from these conditions should be clearly stated
in table 4.<<HEADING_END>>

Stern<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vertical, athwartship and longitudinal measurements as close
as possible to the centreline and the stern, to establish the hull
girder vibration characteristics. The location should be chosen
so that the results are not influenced by local vibration effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement
should preferably be made with an electronic
system which produces a permanent record. The transducers
may generate signals proportional to acceleration; velocity or
displacement. Recording can be made either on magnetic tape,
paper oscillographs, or a combination of both. Use of paper
oscillographs during the tests means that the vibration traces
can be inspected directly and is very helpful in evaluating
existing vibration problems. When displacement
rather than
either velocity or acceleration
is recorded, the desired low-
frequency signals associated with significant vibratory motion
are the major components of a recorded trace. Thus, they are
readily evaluated since they overshadow
possible higher fre-
quency signals with low displacement amplitudes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Vertical, athwartship and longitudinal measurements at a suf-
ficient number of points in the area of local vibration to deter-
mine the relative vibration with respect to the hull girder.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The complete measuring system should be calibrated in the
laboratory prior to the test and it is desirable to check the
calibration of each recording channel before each stage of the
test.<<HEADING_END>>
