<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 20 June 1989, after the draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete Secticnal Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements of low heat Portland cement were earlier covered in IS 269  :  1976 ‘Specification for
ordinary and low heat Portland cement (  third revision )’  which in addition,
covered
the requirements
of ordinary Portland cement.
Since the Sectional
Committee
decided to bifurcate the standard, the
requirements  of low heat Portland cement have now been covered in a separate specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This specification covers the requirements of low heat Portland
cement as was given in IS 269  :  1976
with the various amendments published from time to time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Low heat cement is particularly
suited for making concrete for dams and many other types of water-
retaining structures, bridge abutments, massive retaining walls, piers and slabs, etc. In mass concreting,
there is often considerable
rise in temperature
because of the heat evolved as the cement sets and
hardens, and the slow rate at which it is dissipated from the surface.
The shrinkage which occurs on
subsequent cooling sets up tensile stresses in the concrete
which may result in cracking.
The use of
low heat cement is advantageous
since it evolves less heat than ordinary
Portland cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mass of cement packed in bags and the tolerance requirements for the mass of cement packed in bags
shall be in accordance with the relevant provisions of the  Standards
of Weights and Measures ( Packaged
Commodities
)  Rules,
1977  and B-l.2
( see Annex B for information
).
Any modification
in these
rules in respect of tolerance on mass of cement would apply automatically
to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard contains clause 11.4.1 which gives option to the purchaser and clauses 6.5, 9.2.1 and 9.3
which call for agreement between the purchaser and the supplier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard, considerable assistance has been rendered by the National Council
for Cement and Building Materials, New Delhi as many of the changes are based on the studies carried
out by them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given
in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard
is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.  The number of
significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

2 Alkali aggregate
reactions
have been
noticed
in aggregates
in some parts
of the country.
On large ?n,d
important
,jobs where the concrete
is likely
to
be exposed
to humid atmosphere
or wetting
actlon,
It IS
advisable
that the aggregate
be tested
for alkali aggregate
reaction.
In the
case
of reactive
aggregates,
the
use
of
cement
with
alkali
content
below
0% percent
expressed
as sodium
oxide
( NaaO ). is
recommended.
Where,
however.
such
cements
are
not
available,
use
of Portland
pozzolana
cement
or cement
pozzolanic
admixture
is recommended.
3 The limit of total chloride
content
in cement
for use in plain and other
reinforced
concrete
structures
is
being reviewed.
Till that time, the
limit
may
be
mutually
agreed
to between
the
purchaser
and
the
manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
