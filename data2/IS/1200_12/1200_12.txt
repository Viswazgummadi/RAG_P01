<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Part
XII
) (Thir&
Revision )  was  adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 14 May
1976,
after
the draft
finalized
by the
Civil
Works
Measureqent
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
a
very
important
place in ~planning
and
execution
of
any
civil
engineering
work
from
the
time
of
first
estimates
to final completion
and settlement
of payments
of the project.
The methods
followed
for measurement
are not uniTorm
and consider-
able
differences
exist
between
practices
followed
by one construction
agency
and
another
and
also
between
various
Central
and
State
Government
departments.
While
it is recognized
that each system
of
measurement
has to be specifically
related
to the administrative
and
financial
organizations
within
the department
responsible
for work,
a
unification
of the various
systems
at technical
level has been accepted
as very desirable,
specially
as it permits
a wider circle of operation
for
civil
qgineering
contractors
and
eliminates
ambiguities
and
mis-
understandings
arising
out
of
inadequate
understanding
of
various
systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Among the various civil engineering
items, measurement
of ‘building
had been
first to be taken
up for standardization
and
this
standard,
having
provisions
relating
to all building
works,
was first published
is
1958 and revised in 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the course of usage of this standard
( IS  :  1200-1964*
) by various
construction
agencies
in the countiy,
several clarifications
and
suggestion
for modifications
were received
and as a result
of study,
the Sections,
Committee
decided
that
its scope, besides being applicable
to buildinga
shall be expanded
so as to cover
civil engineering
~works like industrial
and river valley project works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS t 1200 ( Part XII) - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  Since
various
trades
are not related
to one another,
the Committee
decided
that
each
type of trade
as given in IS: 1200-1964’
be issued
separately
as a different
part which
will be helpful
to specific
users in
various
trade>.
This part covering
method
of measurement
of plastering
and pointing
appiicable
to building
as well as civil engineering
works
was, therefore,
issued as a second revision in 1971.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6
In the course of use of this standard
in the past five years based
on
the
suggestions
received,
certain
amendments
were
issued
to
this
standard.
This third revision
also incorporates
all those amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7
For
the purpose
of
deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a
measurement,
shall
be rounded
off
in
accordance
with IS : 2-1960t.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value
should
be the same as that
of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
