FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Second Revision)
was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution on 25 April 1984, after the draft finalized by the
Structural Engineering
Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Structural and Metal Division Council and the Civil Engineering Division
couucil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Steel Economy Programme was initiatedbyIS1
in 1950’s with the
object of achieving economy in the use of structural steel by establishing
rational, efficient and optimum standards for structural steel products and
their use.
IS  :  800-1956
was the first  in  the series of Indian Standards
brought out under this programme.
The revision of this standard was
taken up after the standard was in use .for some time which was published
in 1962 incorporating certain very important changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 IS  :  800 is a basic standard widely used and accepted by engineers,
technical institutions, professional bodies and the industry. The committee
while preparing the second revision has given careful consideration  tb  the
comments received on the standard during its usage. Consideration has also
been given to the developments taking place in the country and abroad;
necessary modifications and additions have therefore been incorporated to
make the standard more useful.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>0.4 In this revision the following major modifications have been effected:
a><<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Besides a general rearrangement
of the clauses, formulae and the
values have been given’in SI units only.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Symbols used in this standard have been aligned to the extent
possible with IS0
3898-1976

<<PAGE_13>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1s t 800 -  1984<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In view of the development and production
of new varieties
of
medium
and high tensile
structural
steels in the country,
the
scope of the Code has been modified permitting the use of any
variety of structural steel provided the relevant
provisions of the
Code are satisfied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>e>
f ><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indian
Standards
are now available
for rivets, bolts and other
fasteners and reference has been made to these standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In view of the fact that the Code specifies a number of grades of
steel with different
yield
strengths, the design parameter,
the
geometrical properties and permissible stresses have been express-
ed to the extent possible in terms of the yield strength
of the
material.
Specific values have also been
given for commonly
used steels.
Recommendations
regarding expansion joints have been added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>g)
h)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Keeping in view the developments
in the design of steel struc-
tures there has been a general revision in the permissible
stress
values for steels and fasteners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>j><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In IS  :  800-1962,
design by plastic theory had been permitted. In
this revision detailed design rules have been included for design
using plastic theory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specific
provisions
relating
to limiting
deflection
have
been
added.
m) Effective
length
of columns
has been dealt with in a greater
detail. For normally
encountered
struts, a table has been given
strictly on the basis of end conditions.
The effective
length of
columns in framed structures and stepped columns in mill build-
ings have been specified on more exact basis.
4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The secant formula for axial compression has been dropped.
In
its place the Merchant
Rankine formula has been specified with
value of a, empirically fixed as 1.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bending stresses -
The method of calculating
the critical stresses
in bending compression  f,,b  has been simplified by expressing the
formulae
in terms
of geometrical
properdes
of the
section.
Merchant
Rankine formula recommended for calculating permis-
sible stresses in axial compression has been used for calculating
permissible
stresses in bending
compression
from the critical
stresses, with value of n, empirically fixed as l-4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>More rigorous analytical procedures than envisaged in this Code
are available and can be made use of for finding effective lengths of com-
pression members in determining
elastic critical loads.
0.5 The original tide of the code namely ‘Code of practice
for use of
structural steel in general building construction  ’  has now been modified as<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the code is applicable to all types of steel structures and not limited to

<<HEADING level=3>>0.6 While preparing this Code, the practices prevailing in the field in the
country have been kept in view. Assistance has also been derived from the
following publications:<<HEADING_END>>

Methods of Design -
The following methods may be employed for
the design of the steel framework:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Simple design,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Semi-rigid design, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Fully rigid design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.4
Simple Design -
This method applies to structures in which the
end connections
between members are such that
they will not develop
restraint moments adversely affecting the members and the structure as a
whole and in consequence the structure may, for the purpose of design, be
assumed to be pin-jointed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.4.1
The method of simple design involves the following
assump-
tions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Beams are simply supported;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All connections of beams, girders or trusses are virtually
flexible
and are proportioned
for the reaction
shears applied at the
appropriate eccentricity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Members
in compression are subjected
to forces applied at the
appropriate
eccentricities
( see 5.3.3
) with the effective
length
given in 5.2; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Members in tension are subjected to longitudinal
forces applied
over the net area of the section, as specified under 3.6.2 and 4.2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.5  Semi-Rigid Design -
This method, as compared with the simple
design method,
permits a reduction
in the maximum bending moment in
beams suitably connected
to their supports, so as to provide a degree of
direction fixity, and in the case of triangulated
frames, it permits account
being taken of the rigidity of the connections and the moment of interaction
of members.
In cases where this method of design is employed, calculations
based on general
or particular experimental evidence shall be made to show
that the stresses in any part of the structureare
not in excess of those laid
down in the code. Stress investigations
may also be done on the finished
structure for assurance that the actual stresses under specific design loads
are not in excess of those laid down in the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.6  Fully Rigid Design -
This method as compared to the methods of
simple and semi-rigid
designs gives the greatest rigidity and economy in<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>25<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_27>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I$: 800-1984<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the weight of steel used when applied in appropriate
cases. The end con-
nections of members of the frame shall have sufficient rigidity to hold the
original angles between
such members and the members they
connect
virtually unchanged.
Unless otherwrse specified, the ‘design shall be based
on theoretical methods of elastic analysis and the calculated
stresses shall
conform to the relevant provisions of this standard.
Alternatively,
it shall
be based on the principles of plastic design as given in Section 9 of the code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>3.4.7
Exfierimentally Based Design -
Where
structure  is  of non-conven-
tional or complex nature, the design may be based on full scale or model
tests subject to the following conditions:
a><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A full scale test of prototype structure may be done. The prototype
shall, be accurately
measured
before
testing to determine
the
dimensional tolerance in all relevant parts of the structure;
the
tolerances then specified on ,the drawing shall be such that
all
successive
structures
shall be in practical
conformity
with the
prototype.
Where the design is based
on failure loads, a load
factor of not less than 2.0 on the loads or load combinations
given
in 3.4.2 shall be used. Loading devices shall be previously
cali-
brated and care shall be exercised to ensure that
no artificial
restraintsiare
applied to the prototype by the loading
systems.
The distribution and duration of forces applied in the test shall
be,representative
of those to which the structure is deemed to be
subjected.
In the case where design is based on the testing of a small scale
model structure, the model shall be constructed with due regard
for the principles of dimensional similarity. The thrusts, moments
and deformations
under working loads shall be determined
by
physical measurements
made when the loadings are applied to
simulate
the conditions
assumed in the design of the actual
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10 Fluctuation
of Stresses<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10.1
Members
subjected to fluctuations of stresses are liable to suffer
from fatigue failure caused by loads much lower than those which would
be necessary
to cause
failure under a single application.
The
fatigue
cracks are caused primarily
due to stress concentrations
introduced
by
constructional
details. Discontinuities
such as bolt or rivet holes, welds and
other local or general
changes in geometrical
form cause such stress con-
centrations from which fatigue cracks may be initiated, and these cracks
may subsequently propagate through the connected or fabricated members.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All details shall, therefore, be designed to avoid, as far as possible,
stress concentrations
likely to result in excessive reduction of the fatigue
strength of members or connections.
Care shall be taken to avoid sudden
changes of shape of a member
or part of a member,
especially in regions
of tensile stress or local secondary
bending.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Except where specificaily stated to the
contrary,
the
permissible
fatigue stresses for any particular
detail are the same for all steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10.2
When subjected to fluctuations of stresses the permissible stresses
shall be the basic stress stipulated
in IS  :  1024-1979 for differentfmrll/fmsr
and for different number of stress cycles
and  classes of constructional
details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following provisions shall also be considered while determining
the permissible stress in members subjected to fluctuations of stress:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While
computing
the value off ml=/  f msx  the effect of wind or
earthquake temperature and secondary stresses shall be ignored
For plain steel in the as-rolled condition
with no gas cut edges
the constructional
detail shall be considered
as Class A of IS  :
1024-1979.
For members of steel with yield stress 280 MPa and over, and
fabricated
or connected
with bolts or rivets the construction
details shall be considered as Class C of IS  :  1024-1979.
For
members
of steels
with
yield
stress
below 280 MPa,
fabricated
or connected
with bolts or rivets the construction
details shall be considered’as Class D of IS  :  1024-1979.
The value off max shall not exceed the permissible tensile or com-
pressive fatigue stress as determined from IS  :  1024-1979.
Where
co-existent
bending
and shear stresses are present,  f mpx  shall
be taken
as the principal
stress at the point under considera-
tion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to Horizontal
Foaces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.11,1  In designing the steel framework of building, l.&visions
shall be
made by adequate
moment
connections
or by a system of bracing to
effectively transmit to the foundations all the horizontal forces, making
due allowance ‘for the stiffening effect of the walls and floors, where appli-
cable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.11.2
When the walls, or walls and floors and/or roof are capable of
effectively transmitting all of the horizontal forces directly to the founda-
tions, the structural framework may be designed without considering the
effect of wind.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.11.3
Wind, and earthquake
forces are, reversible
and therefore
calls
for rigidity in both longitudinal and transverse directions.
To provide for
torsional effects of wind and earthquake
forces bracings in plan should be
provided
and integrally
connected with the longitudinal
and transverse
bracings to impart adequate torsional resistance to the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.11.3.1
In shed type buildings, adequate provisions shall be made
by wind bracings
to transfer the wind or earthquake
loads from trbeir
points of action to the appropriate supporting members.
Where the Gon-
nections to the interior columns are so designed that the wind or earth-
quake loads are not transferred
to the interior
columns, the extlerior
columns shall be designed to resist the total wind or earthquake
loads.
Where the connections to the interior columns are so designed
that the
wind or earthquake effects are traniferred to the interior columns also, both
exterior and interior columns shall be designed on the assumption that the
wind or earthquake load is divided among them in proportion
to their
relative stiffnesses. Columns also should be tested for proper anchorage to
the trusses and other members to withstand the uplifting effect caused by
excessive wind or earthquake pressure from below the roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.11.3.2
Earthquake forces are proportional
to the mass of structural
component and the imposed load.
Therefore
earthquake forces should be
applied at the centre of gravity of all such components of loads and their
transfer to the foundation should be ensured ( see IS : 1893-1975 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

3.11.3.3
In buildings where high-speed travelling cranes are support-
by the structure or where a building or structure is otherwise subj,ected
to vibration
or sway, triangulated
bracing
or especially
rigid
portal
systems shall be provided to reduce the vibration or sway to a suitable
minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.11.4
Foundations -
The  foundations of a building or other structure
shall be so designed as to ensure such rigidity and strength as have been
allowed for in the design of the superstructure, including resistance to all
forces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Overhang of Walls -
Where
a  wall is placed eccentrically upon
the flange of a supporting steel beam, the beam and its connections shall be
designed
for  torsion, unless the beam is encased in solid concrete and
reinforced in combination with an adjoining solid floor slab in such a way
as to prevent the beam deforming torsionally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

least restoring moment and anchorage, shall be not less than the sum of
12 times the maximum
overturning moment due to dead load and 1.4
times the maximum overturning moment due to imposed loads and wind
or earthquake loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.12.1.1
In cases where dead load provides the restoring moment,
only O-9 times the dead load shall be considered.
Restoring moment due
to imposed loads shall be ignored.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.12.1.2
To ensure stability at all times, account shall be taken of
probable variations in dead load during construction, rapair or other tem-
porary measures.
The effect on the load from the deflected or deformed
shape of the structure or of individual elements of the lateral load resisting
systems, may be considered as required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE I -In
complying
with the requirements
of 3.12.1,
it is necessary to
ascertain that the resulting pressures and shear forces to be communicated
by the
foundations to the supporting soil would not cause failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
All individual members
of the structure
which
have been designed
for their dead and imposed loads, wind or earthquake loads to the permissible stresses
stipulated in this code shall be deemed to be adequately

3.14  Expansion
Joints
3.14.1 In view of the large number of factors involved in deciding the
location, spacing and nature of expansion joints, provisions of expansion
joints should be left to the discretion of the designer.
3.14.2 Structures in which marked changes in plan dimensions take
place abruptly shall be provided wi_th expansion joints at the section where
such changes occur. Expansion joints shall be so provided that the neces-
sary movement occurs with a minimum resistance at the joint.  The struc-
ture adjaent to the .joint should preferably be supported on separate
columns but not necessarily on separate foundation.
3.14.3 The details as to the length of a structure where expansion joints
have to be provided may be determined after taking into conrideration
various factors such as temperature, exposure to weather and structural
design, etc. For the purpose of g:,leral guidance the. following pnxisions

E_$ective Length -
Where accurate frame analysis is not done, the
effective length of a compression
member in a given plane may be deter-
mined by the procedure given in Appendix C. However, in most cases the
effective
length
in the given
plane
assessed on the basis of Table 5.2,
would be adequate.
Effective
length as given in Table 5.2 may also be
adopted where columns directly form part of framed structures.

with respect to the axes of the columns, the same conditions
of restraint shall be deemed to apply, provided the connections are carried
across the flange or web of the columns as the case may be, and the web
of the beam
lies within,
or .in direct contact with the column section.
Where

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.2.1
Battens -  Battens shall be designed to carry the bending
moments and shears arising from transverse shear force  ‘V’  of  2.5  percent
of the total axial force on the whole compression member, at any point in
the length of the member,
divided equally between parallel planes of
battens. The main members shall also be checked for the same shear force
-and bending moments as for the battens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Battens shall be of plates, angles, channels, or I-sections and shall be
riveted or welded to the main components so as to resist simultaneously a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>longitudinal shear  VI = g
V.C
and a moment M = - 2N<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>V =  the transverse shear force as defined above;<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C = the distance centre-to-centre of battens, longitudinally;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>.N = the number of parallel‘pianes of battens; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5’ = the minimum transverse distance between the centroids
of the rivet group/welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.2.2
Tie plates -
Tie plates shall be designed by the same method
as battens.
In no case shall a tie plate and its fastenings be incapable of
carrying the forces for which the lacing has been designed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.2.3  Siie -
When plates are used for battens, the end battens and
those at points where the member is stayed in its length shall thave an
effective depth, longitudinally, of not less than the perpendicular distance
between
the centroids of the main members, and intermediate battens
shall have an effective depth of not less than three quarters of this dis-
tance, but in no case shall the effective depth .of any batten be less than
twice the width of one member in the plane of the battens.
The effective
depth of a batten shall be taken as the longitudinal distance between end
rivets or end welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thickness of batten or the tie plates shall be not less than one-
fiftieth of the distance between the innermost connecting
lines of rivets or
welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.2.4 The requirement of size and thickness specified above does
not apply when angles, channels or I-sections are used for battens with
their legs or flanges perpendicular to the main member. However, it should
be ensured that the ends of the compression members are tied to achieve
adequate rigidity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.3.1
In battened compression members not specifically checked for
shear stress and bending moments as specified in 5.8.2.1,
the  spacing of
battens centre-to-centre of end fastenings shall be such that the slenderness
ratio  c A’  of the lesser main component over that distance shall be not greater
than 50 or greater than 0.7 time the slenderness ratio of the member as
a whole, about its X-X ( axis parallel to the battens ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

member
as a whole,
reference may be made to Table
5.2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.3.2 The number of battens shall
be such that the member is
divided into not less than three parts longitudinally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

connections -
Where  tie
or  batten plates  ovt~lap  the
main members, the amount of lap shall be not less than four times the
thickness of the plate. The length of weld connecting each edge of the
batten plate to the member shall, in aggregate, be not less than half the
depth of the batten plate.
At least one-third of the weld shall be placed
at each end of this edge.
The length of weld and depth of batten plate
shall be measured along the longitudinal axis of the main member.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition, the welding shall be returned along the other two edges
of the plates transversely to the axis of the main member for a length not
less than the minimum lap specified above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9  Compkession Members
Composed of Two Components Back-
to-Back<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.1  Compression members composed of two angles, channels, or tees,
back-to-back in contact or separated by a small distance shall be connect-
ed together by riveting, bolting or welding so that the ratio of slenderness
of each member between the connections is not greater than  40 or  greater
than O-6 times the most unfavourable ratio of slenderness of the strut as a
whole, whichever is less ( see also Section 8 -).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.2 In no case shall the ends of the, strut be connected together with
less than two rivets or bolts or their equivalent in welding, and there shall
be  not  less than two additional connections spaced equidistant in the length
of strut.
Where the members are separated back-to-back,
the rivets or
bolts through these connections shall pass through solid washers or pack-
ings, and where the legs of the connected angles or tables of the connected
-tees
are 125 mm wide or over, or where webs of channels are 150 mm
wide or over, not less than two rivets or bolts shall be used in each con-
nection, one on line of each gauge mark.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 800.. 1984<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.3
Where
these connections
are made by welding, solid packings
shall be used to effect the j  jinting
unless the members are sufficiently close
together to permit welding, and the members shall be connected by weld-
ing along both pairs of edges of the main components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.4
The rivets, bolts or welds in these connections
shall be sufficient
to carry the shear force and moments, if any, specified for battened struts,
and in no case shall the rivets or bolts be less than 16 mm diameter for
members up to and including 10 mm thick, 20 mm diameter for members
up to and including 16 mm thick; and 22 mm diameter
for members over
16 mm thick.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.4.1
Compression members connected by such riveting, bolting or
welding shall not be subjected to transverse
loading in a plane perpendi-
cular to the washer-riveted,
bolted or welded surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.5
Where the components
are in contact back-to-back,
the spacing
of the rivets, bolts or intermittent
welds shall not exceed the maximum
spacing for compression members as given in 6.1.4

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4 Elastic Critical &ess -
If an elastic flexural analysis is not carried
out, the elastic critical stressfOb for beams and plate girders with Ir smaller
than 1x shall be calculated using the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Y  =

<<HEADING level=3>>( 0% )’ -<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k1 -
a coefficient to allow for reduction in thickness or breadth of
flanges between points of effective lateral restraint and depends
on #, the ratio of the total area of both flanges at the point of
least bending moment to the corresponding area at the point of
greatest
bending moment
between such points of restraint.
Values of  kl  for different values of # are given in Table 6.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D’p r$ -
as defined in 6.2.2.1.
,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k, -
a coefficient to allow for the inequality of flanges, and depends
on W, the ratio of the moment of inertia ofthe compression
flange alone to that of the sum of the moments of inertia of the
flanges, each calculated about its own axis parallel to the y-y
axis of the girder, at the point of maximum bending moment.
Values of  k,  for different values of o are given in Table 6.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should
preferably
be
proportioned
on  the basis of the moment of inertia of the gross~ cross
section with the neutral axis taken at the centroid of that section, but  it
shall be permissible to use the net moment of inertia.
In arriving at the
maximum flexural stresses, the stresses calculated on the basis of the gross
moment of inertia shall be increased in the ratio of gross area to effective
area of the flange section,
For this purpose the flange sectional
area in
riveted or bolted construction shall be taken to be that of the flange plate,
flange angles and the portion of the web and side plates ( if any  )  between
the flange angles; in welded construction the flange sectional area shall be
taken to be that of the flange plates plus that of the tongue plates ( if any )
up to a limit of eight times their thickness, which shall be not less than
twice the thickness of the web. **<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.7.1.1
The effective sectional area of compression flanges shall be
the gross area with d.eductions for excessive width of plates as specified for
compression members ( see 3.5.2.1
and 3.5.2.2
) and for open holes ( inclu-
ding holes for pins and black bolts ) occurring in a plane perpendicular to
the direction of stress at the section being considered ( see 3.6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

racticable
the centre of resistance of a. connection
shall be on
the line o P action of the load so as to avoid an eccentricity moment on the
connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3.1
However,
where
eccentricity

calculated shear through a packing shall be increased above the number
required by normal calculations
by 2.5 percent for each 2.0 mm thickness
of packing except that, for packings having a thickness of 6 mm or less, no
increase
need be made.
For double shear connections
packed on both
sides, the number of additional rivets or bolts required shall be determined
from the thickness of the thicker packing.
The additional rivets or bolts
should preferably be placed in an extension of the packing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.6.2
Packings in Welded Construction -
Where
a packing is used between
two parts, the packing and the welds connecting it to each part shall be
capable of transmitting the load between the parts.
Where the packing is
too thin to carry the load or permit the provlsion of ade uate
%
welds, the
load shall be transmitted through the welds alone, the we1 s being increas-
ed in size by an amount equal to the thickness of the packing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

maintain correct spacing. Bolts and separators may be used provided that
in beams having a depth of  300  mm or more, not fewer than  2  bolts are
used with each separator.
When loads are required
to be carried from
one beam to the other or are required to be distributed between the beams,
diaphragms
shall be used, designed with sufficient stiffness to distribute
the load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

FABRICATION
AND ERECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1 General
-
Tolerances
for
fabrication
of
steel
structures
shall
conform to IS  :  72 15- 1974. Tolerances
for erection of steel structures shall
conform to the Indian Standard.*
For
general guidance on fabrication
by welding, reference may be made to IS  :  9595-1980.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2 Fabrication
Procedures<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.1
Straightening -
All material
shall be straight and, if necessary,
before being worked shall be straightened
and/or flattened by pressure,
unless required to be of curvilinear form and shall be free from twists.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.2
Clearances -
The erection clearance for cleated ends of members
connecting
steel to steel should preferably be not greater than 2-O mm at
each end.
The
erection clearance
at ends of beams without web cleats
should be not more than 3 mm at each end, but where,
for practical
reasons, greater
clearance
is necessary,
suitably designed seatings should
be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.2.1
Where
black bolts are used, the holes may be made not
more than l-5 mm greater than the diameter of the bolts, unless otherwise
specified by the engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.3
Cutting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.3.1
Cutting may be effected by shearing, cropping or sawing. Gas
cutting by mechanically
controlled torch may be permitted for mild steel
only.
Gas cutting of high tensile steel may also be permitted provided
special care  is' taken  to leave sufficient metal to be removed by machining
so that all metal that has been hardened
by flame is removed.
Hand
flame cutting may be permitted subject to the approval of the inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.3.2
Except where the material is subsequently joined by welding,
no loads shall be transmitted into metal throug,h a gas cut surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.3.3
Shearing,
cropping
and
gas
cutting,
shall
be
clean,
reasonably square, and free from any distortion,
and should the inspector
find  it  necessary, the edges shall be ground afterwards.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.4
Holing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.4.1
Holes
through
more
than one thickness
of material for
members,
such as compound stanchion
and girder flanges shall, where
possible, be drilled after the members are assembled and tightly clamped
or bolted together.
Punching may be permitted before assembly, provided<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Tolerances
for  erection  of steel  structures ( under prepurulion ).<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_110>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>lstmJ=1984<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the holes are punched 3 mm less in diameter than the required size and
reamed
after assembly to the full diameter.
The thickness of material
punched shall be not greater
than
16 mm.
For dynamically
loaded
structures, punching shall be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.4.2
When holes are drilled in one operation
through two or
more separable parts, these parts, when so specified by the engineer,
shall
be separated after drilling and the burrs removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.4.3
Holes in connecting
angles and plates, other than splices,
also in roof members and light framing, may be punched full size through
material not over 12 mm thick, except where required for close tolerance
bolts  or  barrel bolts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.4.4
Matching
holes for rivets
and black bolts shall
register
with each other so that a gauge of 1.5 mm or 2.0 mm ( as the case may be
depending  on  whether
the diameter
of the rivet or bolt is less than or
more than 25 mm ) less in diameter than the diameter of the hole will pass
freely through the assembled members in the direction
at right angle to
such members.
Finished holes shall be not more than 1.5 mm or 2.0 mm
(as the case may be ) in diameter
larger than the diameter
of the rivet
or black bolt passing through
them,
unless otherwise
specified
by the
engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.4.5
Holes
for turned
and
fitted bolts
shall be drilled to a
diameter equal to the nominal diameter of the shank or barrel
subject to
H8 tolerance specified in IS  :  919-1963.
Preferably parts to be connected
with dose tolerance
or barrel bolts shall be firmly held together  by  packing
bolts or clamps and the holes drilled through all the thicknesses at one
operation and subsequently reamed to size.
All holes not drilled through
all thicknesses
at one operation
shall be drilled to a smaller
size and
reamed out after assembly.
Where this is not practicable,
the parts shall
be drilled and reamed separately through hard bushed steel jigs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.4.6
Hole’s for rivets  or  bolts shall not be formed by gas cutting
process.<<HEADING_END>>

EXCHANGE
OF INFORMATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G-161  Before the steelwork design is commenced,
the building designer
should be satisfied that the planning of the building, its dimensions and
other principal factors meet the requirements
of the building owner and
comply with regulations of all authorities
concerned.
Collaboration
of
building designer and steelwork designer shouId begin at the outset  of
the project by joint consideration
of the planning and of such questions
as the stanchion spacing, materials to be used for the construction, and
depth of basement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

brickwork or  masonry,
the question of maintenance
should not arise, but
where steelwork is to be housed in hollow fire protection or is to be unpro-
tected, particularly where the steeIwork is exposed to a corroding agent,
the question of painting or protective treatment of the steelwork should be
given careful consideration
at the con_stn;lction stage, having regard to the
special circumstances
of the case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
