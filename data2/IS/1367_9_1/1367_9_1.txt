<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian

‘Fasteners

issued by the International

on

<<PARAGRAPH>>The second revision
of the standard
[ IS 1367 ( Part 9 ) ] published
in 1979 was based on Draft
International
Standard
ISO/DIS
6157/l
‘Fasteners-Surface
discontinuities-Part
1 Bolts, screws
and studs with thread sizes M5 to M3.9’ issued by ISO. The standard
was covering
the surface
discontinuities
for fasteners
for.general
applications
as well as special applications.
The revision
has been
made to
harmonize
with
the
lnternattonal
Standards
IS0
6157-1 : 1988
and
IS0 6157-3
: 1988 tocover
general applications
as well
as special
applications
separately
in
Section
1 and Section
2 of IS 1367 ( Part 9 ). The following
major changes
have been made
in this revision:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The dents, nicks and gouges located at the first three threads accepting
the
torque values
has been increased
to ‘OOld” Max.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The forging
bursts limitation
has been specified
separately
for width
and depth.
c) The folds at the surface of bolt end has been permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the adopted
standard,
certain
terminology
and.conventions
are not identical
with
those used
in Indian
Standards;
attention
is specially
drawn to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Wherever
the words
‘International
Standard’
appear,
referring
to this standard,
they
should be read as ‘Indian
Standard’.
b) Comma
( , ) has been used as a decimal marker while
in Indian
Standards
the current
practice
is to use point
( . ) as the decimal
marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this adopted
standard,
reference appears to certain
International
Standards
for which
Indian
Standards
also exist.
The corresponding
Indian Standards
which
have been substituted
in their
place are  listed below along with their degree of equivalence
