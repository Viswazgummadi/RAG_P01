<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Earthquake Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Himalayan-Naga Lushai region, Indo-Gangetic Plain, Western India and Kutch and Kathiawar
regions are geologically unstable parts of the country and some devastating earthquakes of the
world have occurred there. A major part of the peninsular India, has also been visited by moderate
earthquakes, but these were relatively few in number and had considerably lesser intensity. It has
been a long felt need to rationalize the earthquake resistant design and construction of structures
taking into account seismic data from studies of the Indian earthquakes, particularly in view of
the heavy construction programme at present all over the country. It is to serve this purpose that
IS 1893 : 1984 ‘Criteria for earthquake resistant design of structures’ was prepared. It lays down
the seismic zones, the basic seismic coefficients and other factors and criteria for various
structures. As an adjunct to IS 1893, IS 4326 ‘Code of practice for earthquake resistant design and
construction of buildings’ was prepared in 1967 and revised in 1976 and in 1993. 1976 version,
contained some recommendations for low strength brick masonary and stone buildings which have
now been covered in greater detail in IS 13828 : 1993 ‘Guidelines for improving earthquake
resistance of low strength masonary building’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Earthquakes damages to buildings in Himachal Pradesh, North Bihar and hill districts of Uttar
Pradesh emphasized the need to formulate this standard to cover guidelines for repair and
strengthening of these buildings from any future earthquakes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for formulating this standard is given in
Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (April 2002). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1  Prior to taking up of the structural
repairs and strengthening measures, it is
necessary
to
conduct
detailed
damage
assessment to determine:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.12 Concrete Grades<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>28 days crushing strength of concrete cubes of
150 mm side, in MPa, for example, for M15

decide whether a structure is amendable
for repair; whether continued occupation
is permitted; to decide the structure as a
whole or a part require demolition, if
considered dangerous;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND
CONCEPTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Non-structural/Architectural Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) if the structure is considered amendable
for
repair
then
detailed
damage
assessment of the individual structural
components
(mapping
of
the
crack
pattern,
distress
location;
crushed
concrete, reinforcement bending/yielding,
etc). Non-destructive testing techniques
could be employed to determine the
residual strength of the members; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  The buildings affected by earthquake may
suffer both non-structural and structural
damages. Non-structural repairs may cover the
damages to civil and electrical items including
the services in the building. Repairs to
non-structural components need to be taken up
after the structural repairs are carried out.
Care should be taken about the connection
details of architectural components to the main
structural components to ensure their stability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) to work out the details of temporary
supporting arrangement of the distressed
members so that they do not undergo
further distress due to gravity loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2  Non-structural
and
architectural
components
get
easily
affected/dislocated
during the earthquake. These repairs involve
one or more of the following:
a) Patching up of defects such as cracks and
fall of plaster;
b) Repairing doors, windows, replacement of
glass panes;
c) Checking
and
repairing
electric
conduits/wiring;
d) Checking and repairing gas pipes, water
pipes and plumbing services;
e) Re-building non-structural walls, smoke
chimneys, parapet walls, etc;
f) Replastering of walls as required;
g) Rearranging disturbed roofing tiles;
h) Relaying cracked flooring at ground level;
and
j) Redecoration — white washing, painting.
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2  After the assessment of the damage of
individual structural elements, appropriate
repair
methods
are
to
be
carried
out
componentwise depending upon the extent of
damage. The repair may consist of the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Removal of portions of cracked masonry
walls and piers and rebuilding them in
richer mortar. Use of non-shrinking
mortar will be preferable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Addition of reinforcing mesh on both faces
of the cracked wall, holding it to the wall
through spikes or bolts and then covering
it, suitably, with cement mortar or
micro-concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Injecting cement or epoxy like material
which is strong in tension, into the cracks
in walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The cracked reinforced cement elements
may be repaired by epoxy grouting and
could be strengthened by epoxy or polymer
mortar
application
like
shotcreting,
jacketting, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The architectural repairs as stated above do not
restore the original structural strength of
structural components in the building and any
attempt
to
carry
out
only
repairs
to
architectural/non-structural
elements<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13935 : 1993<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Seismic Strengthening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most instances, however, the relative cost of
retrofitting to reconstruction cost determines
the decision. As a thumb rule, if the cost of
repair and seismic strengthening is less than
about 50 percent of the reconstruction cost, the
retrofitting is adopted. This may also require
less working time and much less dislocation in
the living style of the population. On the other
hand reconstruction may offer the possibility of
modernization of the habitat and may be
preferred by well-to-do communities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main purpose of the seismic strengthening
is to upgrade the seismic resistance of a
damaged building while repairing so that it
becomes
safer
under
future
earthquake
occurrences. This work may involve some of the
following actions:
a) Increasing the lateral strength in one or
both directions by increasing column and
wall areas or the number of walls and
columns.
b) Giving unity to the structure, by providing
a proper connection between its resisting
elements, in such a way that inertia forces
generated by the vibration of the building
can be transmitted to the members that
have the ability to resist them. Typical
important aspects are the connections
between roofs or floors and walls, between
intersecting walls and between walls and
foundations.
c) Eliminating features that are sources of
weakness or that produce concentration of
stresses in some members. Asymmetrical
plan distribution of resisting members,
abrupt changes of stiffness from one floor
to the other, concentration of large masses
and large openings in walls without a
proper
peripheral
reinforcement
are
examples of defects of this kind.
d) Avoiding the possibility of brittle modes of
failure by proper reinforcement and
connection of resisting members.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2  Cost wise the building construction
including the seismic code provisions in the
first instance, works out the cheaper in terms of
its own safety and that of the occupants.
Retrofitting an existing inadequate building
may involve as much as 4 to 5 times the initial
extra expenditure required on seismic resisting
features. Repair and seismic strengthening of a
damaged building may even be 5 to 10 times as
expensive. It is therefore very much safe as well
as
cost-effective
to
construct
earthquake
resistant buildings at the initial stage itself
according to the relevant seismic IS codes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 SELECTION OF MATERIALS AND
TECHNIQUES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most common materials for repair works of
various types buildings are cement and steel. In
many situations suitable admixture may be
added to cement mortar/cement concrete to
improve
their
properties,
such
as,
non-shrink-age, bond, etc. Steel may be
required in many forms like bolts, rods, angles,
beams, channels, expanded metal and welded
wire fabric. Wood and bamboo are the most
common material for providing temporary
supports and scaffolding, etc, and will be
required in the form of rounds, sleepers,
planks, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Seismic Retrofitting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many existing buildings do not meet the
seismic strength requirements of present
earthquake codes due to original structural
inadequacies and material degradation due to
time or alterations carried out during use over
the years. Their earthquake resistance can be
upgraded to the level of the present day codes
by appropriate seismic retrofitting techniques,
such as mentioned in  4.3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Besides the above, special materials and
techniques are available for best results in the
repair and strengthening operations. These
should be selected appropriately depending on
the nature and cost of the building that is to be
repaired, materials availability and feasibility
and use of available skills, etc. Some special
materials and techniques are described below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Strengthening or Retrofitting  vs.
Reconstruction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1  Replacement of damaged buildings or
existing unsafe buildings by reconstruction is,
generally, avoided due to a number of reasons,
the main ones among them being:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Shotcrete<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shotcrete is cement mortar or cement concrete
(with coarse aggregate size maximum 10 mm)
conveyed through a hose and pneumatically
placed under high velocity on to a prepared
concrete or masonry surface. The force of the jet
impingement on the surface compacts the
shotcrete material and produces a dence
homogeneous mass. Basically there are two<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) higher cost than that of strengthening or
retrofitting,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) preservation of historical architecture,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) maintaining functional social and cultural
environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13935 : 1993<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fine cracks in load bearing members which are
unreinforced like masonry and plain concrete
reduce their resistance very largely. Therefore,
all cracks must be located and marked carefully
and the critical ones fully repaired either by
injecting strong cement or chemical grout or by
providing external bandage. The techniques are
described below along with other restoration
measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>methods of shotcreting; wet mix process and
dry mix process. In the wet mix process, all the
ingredients including water are mixed together
before they enter the delivery hose. In the dry
mix process, the mixture of damp sand and
cement is passed through the delivery hose to
the nozzle where the water is added. The dry
mix process is generally used in the repair of
concrete elements. The bond between the
prepared concrete surface of the damaged
member and the layer of shotcrete is ensured
with the application of suitable epoxy adhesive
formulation. The shear transfer between the
existing and new layer of concrete is ensured
with the provision of shear keys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Repair of Minor and Medium Cracks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the repair of minor and medium cracks
(0.50 mm to 5 mm), the technique to restore the
original tensile strength of the cracked element
is by pressure injection of epoxy. The procedure
is as follows (  see  Fig. 1A ):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Epoxy Resins<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Epoxy resins are excellent binding agents with
high tensile strength. These are chemical
preparations the compositions of which can be
changed as per requirements. The epoxy
components are mixed just prior to application.
Some products are of low viscosity and can be
injected in fine cracks too. The higher viscosity
epoxy resin can be used for surface coating or
filling larger cracks or holes. The epoxy resins
may also be used for gluing steel plates to the
distress members.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘The
external
surfaces
are
cleaned
of
non-structural materials and plastic injection
ports are placed along the surface of the cracks
on both sides of the member and are secured in
place
with
an
epoxy
sealant.
The
centre-to-centre spacing of these ports may be
approximately equal to the thickness of the
element. After the sealant has cured, a low
viscosity epoxy resin is injected into one port at
a time beginning at the lowest part of the crack,
in case it is vertical, or at one end of the crack,
in case it is horizontal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Epoxy Mortar<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For larger void spaces, it is possible to combine
the epoxy resins of either low viscosity or
higher viscosity with sand aggregate to form
epoxy mortar. Epoxy mortar mixture has
higher compressive strength, higher tensile
strength and a lower modulus of elasticity than
cement concrete. The sand aggregate mixed to
form the epoxy mortar increases its modulus of
elasticity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The resin is injected till it is seen flowing from
the opposite sides of the member at the
corresponding port or from the next higher port
on the same side of member. The injection port
should be closed at this stage and injection
equipment moved to the next port and so on.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The smaller the crack higher is the pressure or
more closely spaced should be the ports so as to
obtain complete penetration of the epoxy
material throughout the depth and width of
member. Larger cracks will permit larger port
spacing depending upon width of the member.
This technique is appropriate for all types of
structural elements — beams, columns, walls
and floor units in masonry as well as concrete
structures. In the case of loss of bond between
reinforcing bar and concrete, if the concrete
adjacent to the bar has been pulverised to a
very fine powder (this powder will block the
epoxy from penetrating the region). It should be
cleaned properly by air or water pressure prior
to injection of epoxy.’<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Quick-Setting Cement Mortar<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This material is a non-hydrous magnesium
phosphate cement with two components, that
is, a liquid and a dry powder, which can be
mixed in a manner similar to cement concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 Mechanical Anchors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mechanical type of anchors employ wedging
action to provide anchorage. Some of the
anchors provide both shear and tension
resistance. Such anchors are manufactured to
give sufficient strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, chemical anchors bonded in
drilled holes through polymer adhesives can be
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Repair of Major Cracks and Crushed
Concrete<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 TECHNIQUES TO RESTORE ORIGINAL
STRENGTH<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For cracks wider than about 5 mm or for
regions in which the concrete or masonry has
crushed, a treatment other than injection is
indicated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While considering restoration of structural
strength, it is important to realise that even<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13935 : 1993<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedures may be adopted as follows:
a) The loose material is removed and
replaced with any of the materials
mentioned earlier, that is, expansive
cement mortar quick setting cement (  see
Fig. 1B ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>reinforcement (  see  Fig. 1C ).
c) In
areas
of
very
severe
damage,
replacement of the member or portion of
member can be carried out as discussed
later.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) In the case of damage to walls and floor
diaphragms, steel mesh could be provided
on the outside of the surface and nailed or
bolted to the wall. Then it may be covered
with
plaster
or
micro-concrete
(  see
Fig. 1C ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Where found necessary, additional shear
or flexural reinforcement is provided in
the region of repairs. This reinforcement
could be covered by mortar to give further
strength as well as protection to the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13935 : 1993<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.4  Anchors of roof trusses to supporting
walls should be improved and the roof thrust on
walls should be eliminated.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Fractured Excessively Yielded and
Buckled Reinforcement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of severely damaged reinforced
concrete member it is possible that the
reinforcement would have buckled or elongated
or excessive yielding may have occured. This
element can be repaired by replacing the old
portion of steel with new steel using butt
welding or lap welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figures 2 and 3 illustrate one of the methods
for pitched roofs without trusses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.5  Where the roof or floor consists of
prefabricated units like RC rectangular T or
channel units or wooden poles and joists
carrying brick tiles, integration of such units is
necessary. Timber elements could be connected
to diagonal planks nailed to them and spiked to
an all round wooden frame at the ends.
Reinforced concrete elements may either have
40 mm cast-in-situ-concrete topping with 6 mm
dia bars 150 mm c/c both ways or bounded by a
horizontal cast-in-situ-reinforced concrete ring
beam all round into which the ends of
reinforced concrete elements are embedded.
Fig. 4 shows one such detail.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Splicing by overlapping will be risky. If repair
has to be made without removal of the existing
steel, the best approach would depend upon the
space available in the original member.
Additional stirrup ties are to be added in the
damaged portion before concreting so as to
confine
the
concrete
and
enclose
the
longitudinal bars to prevent their buckling in
future.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some cases, it may be necessary to anchor
additional steel into existing concrete. A
common technique for providing the anchorage
uses the following procedure:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.6  Roofs or floors consisting of steel joists
flat or segmental arches must have horizontal
ties holding the joists horizontally in each arch
span so as to prevent the spreading of joists. If
such ties do not exist, these should be installed
by welding or clamping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘A hole larger than the bar is drilled. The
hole is filled with epoxy expanding cement or
other high strength grouting material. The
bar is pushed into place and held there untill
the grout has set.’<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Inserting New Walls<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5 Fractured Wooden Members and
Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1  Unsymmetrical buildings
which may
produce dangerous torsional effects during
earthquakes the center of masses can be made
coincident with the centre of stiffnesses by
separating parts of buildings thus achieving
individual symmetric units and/or inserting
new vertical resisting elements such as new
masonry or reinforced concrete walls either
internally as shear walls or externally as
buttresses. Insertion of cross wall will be
necessary for providing transverse supports to

schools and dormitories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since wood is an easily workable material, it
will be easy to restore the strength of wooden
members such as beams, columns, struts, and
ties by splicing additional material. The
weathered or rotten wood should first be
removed. Nails wood screws or steel bolts will
be most convenient as connectors. It will be
advisable to use steel straps to cover all such
splices and joints so as to keep them tight and
stiff.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Modification of Roofs or Floors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2  The main problem in such modifications
is the connection of new walls with old walls.
Figures 5, 6 and 7 show three examples of
connection of new walls to existing ones. The
first two cases refer to a T-junction whereas the
third to a corner junction. In all cases the link
to the old walls is performed by means of a
number of keys made in the old walls. Steel is
inserted in them and local concrete infilling is
made. In the second case, however, connection
can be achieved by a number of steel bars
inserted in small length drilled holes filled with
fresh cement-grout which substitute keys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.1  Slates and roofing tiles are brittle and
easily dislodged. Where possible, they should
be replaced with corrugated iron or asbestos
sheeting.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2  False ceilings of brittle material are
dangerous. Non-brittle material, like hessian
cloth, bamboo matting or light ones of foam
substances, may be substituted.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.3  Roof truss frames should be braced by
welding or clamping suitable diagonal bracing
members in the vertical as well as horizontal
planes.<<HEADING_END>>

mixture and the wall elements. Secondly, a
cement water mixture (1 : 1) is grouted at low
pressure (0.1 to 0.25 MPa) in the holes starting
from the lower holes and going up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.0  The lateral strength of buildings can be
improved by increasing the strength and
stiffness of existing individual walls, whether
they are cracked or uncracked, can be achieved.
a) by grouting,
b) by addition of vertical reinforced concrete
coverings on the two sides of the wall, and
c) by prestressing wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, polymeric mortars may be used
for grouting. The increase of shear strength
which can be achieved in this way is
considerable. However, grouting can not be
relied on as far as the improving or making a
new connection between orthogonal walls is
concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.1  Grouting
A number of holes are drilled in the wall (2 to 4
in each square metre) (  see  Fig. 8 ). First water
is injected in order to wash the wall inside, and<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The pressure need for grouting can be
obtained by gravity flow from superelevated containers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>strengthen spandrel beam between two rows of
openings in the case no rigid slab exists.
Opposite parallel walls can be held to internal
cross walls by prestressing bars as illustrated
above the anchoring being done against
horizontal steel channels instead of small steel
plates. The steel channels running from one
cross wall to the other will hold the walls
together and improve the integral box like
action of the walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.0  The overall lateral strength and stability
of bearing wall buildings is very much
improved, if the integral box like action of room
enclosures is ensured. This can be achieved by
(a) use of prestressing (b) providing horizontal
bands. Strength of shear walls is achieved by
providing vertical steel at selected locations as
described in  7.4.1  and  7.4.2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.1  Prestressing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.2  External Binding
The technique of covering the wall with steel
mesh and mortar or microconcrete may be used
only on the outside surface of external walls but
maintaining continuity of steel at the corners.
This would strengthen the walls as well as bind
them together. As a variation and for economy
in the use of materials, the covering may be in
the form of vertical splints located between the
openings and horizontal ‘bandages’ formed over
spandrel walls at suitable number of points
only (  see  Fig. 12 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A horizontal compression state induced by
horizontal tendons can be used to increase the
shear strength of walls. Moreover, this will also
improve, considerably, the connections of
orthogonal walls (  see  Fig. 11 ). The easiest way
of affecting the precompression is to place two
steel rods on the two sides of the wall and
stretching them by turnbuckles. Note that,
good effects can be obtained by slight horizontal
prestressing (about 0.1 MPa) on the vertical
section of the wall. Prestressing is also useful to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13935 : 1993<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.3  Shear Walls
The casing technique could be used for
strengthening reinforced concrete shear walls.
7.8.4  Inadequate section of beams, columns and
walls could be strengthened by adding a layer
of reinforced concrete (outershell) around the
members
with
the
addition
of
new
reinforcements. Also to the existing steel, new
steel reinforcement bars could be welded to
increase the carrying capacity of the members.
In all cases of adding new concrete to the old
concrete, effective bond should be ensured.
Such bond could be created by the application
of suitable epoxy adhesive formulations on the
prepared old concrete surface. In addition to
this, suitable shear connectors in the form of
steel rods placed in predrilled holes in the old
concrete
at
required
spacing
should
be
provided. These rods should also be dipped in
epoxy adhesive formulations before placing in
position.
7.8.5  In all cases of adding new concrete to old
concrete
the
original
surface
should
be
roughened, grooves made in the appropriate
direction for providing shear transfer. The ends
of the additional steel are to be anchored in the
adjacent beams or columns as the case may be.
7.9 Strengthening of Foundations
Strengthening of foundations before or after<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the earthquake is the most involved task since
it may require careful underpinning operations.
Some
alternatives
are
given
below
for
preliminary consideration of the strengthening
scheme:
a) Introducing new load bearing members
including
foundations
to
relieve
the
already
loaded
members.
Jacking
operations may be needed in this process.
b) Improving the drainage of the area to
prevent saturation of foundation soil to
oviate any problems of liquefaction which
may occur because of poor drainage.
c) Providing apron around the building to
prevent soaking of foundation directly and
draining off the water.
d) Adding strong elements in the form of
reinforced concrete strips attached to the
existing foundation part of the building.
These will also bind the various wall
footings and may be provided on both
sides of the wall (  see  Fig. 17 ) or only one
side of it. In any case, the reinforced
concrete strips and the wall have to be
linked by a number of keys inserted into
the existing footing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — To avoid disturbance to the integrity of the
existing wall during the foundation strengthening
process proper investigation and design is called for.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
