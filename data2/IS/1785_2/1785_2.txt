FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part II ) ( First Revision
) was adopted
by
?he Indian
Standards
Institution
on
14 March
1983,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the Joint
Sectional
Committee
for Concrete
Reinforcement
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
This standard
was first published
as 1785-1961
to cover
the
require-
ments
of plain
hard-drawn
steel
wire for prestressed
concrete.
This
standard
was subsequently
revised
in 1966 and issued
in two
parts;
the
first
part
was .a
revision
of the 1961 version
of the standard
covering
requirements
of stress-relieved
wire and
the
second
part
covered
the
requirements
of
cold-drawn
plain
high
tensile
wire
in
‘as-drawn’
condition
used for prestressed
concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
The
wire
conforming
to
IS  :  1785
( Part
I )-1983
demands
straightening
and stress-relieving
operations,
whereas
the wires
covered
in this
standard
need
not be stress-relieved
and is not, intended
to pay
out straight
from the coil. The ‘as-drawn’
wire supplied
to the user may
be tensioned
subsequently
at the time of use by passing it through
smaller
dies or milling
rollers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This
revision
( Part II ) has been formulated
with a view to modify-
ing the earlier
requirements
in the light
of experience
gained
in using
this .standard
by
both
manufacturers
and
users.
This
revision
incor-
porates
a number
of modifications
such
as including
3 mm
diameter
wire
in place
of 3’15 mm
diameter
wire ‘and change
in the provision
relating
to stress corrosion.
In addition,
this revision
adopts
SI units for
specifying
the various
physical
requirements
and
references
to various
other
Indian
Standards
have been updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1785 ( Part II ) - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailin@
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
c’alculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a test
or
analysis,
shall
be rounded
off
in
accordance
with
IS : 2-1960*.
The
number
of
significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off
value
should
be the same
as that
of the
specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

radius
specified in Table
