FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 26 October 1970, after the draft finalized by the Construction Piant and
Machinery Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineer-
ing Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Proper and eflicient mixing of concrete is an important factor affecting
the quality of concrete and the progress of concrete operations.
Thorough
mixing of the concrete ingredients would depend to a large extent on the
efficiency of mixer.
Batch type concrete mixer which  b one  of the most
common type of mixers has been  covered  by IS  :  1791-1968* and IS :4-634
1968t.
Hand-operated concrete mixer  may  be used with advantage as an
efficient substitute for platform n$xing on small building works and on
construction jobs where small quantity of concrete is required at a place,
such as pedestal foundations for pipe lines and minor repairs in concrete.
This equipment has considerably improved performance compare,d to hand
mixing on platform.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 This standard covering hand-operated
concrete mixers has been
prepared mainly with the following objectives:
a) To guide the purchasers in obtaining machine with some minimum
guaranteed performance,
.
b) To help the manufacturers and purchasers by laying down working
limits for Capacity and other features of machine, and
c) To aid in production by limiting the number of standard sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether  a  particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS : Z-1960$.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1-P  This standard lays down requirements regarding materials, construc-
tion, capacity and performance

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Free-Fall M&r
(Dnk
Type )-A
free-fall mixer having a drum
with series  of blades fitted ixiternally, which rotates about a horizontal
or inclined axis. The mixing action is achieved by causing each part of the
mix to be lifted in turn as the drum rotates and at a certain point in
each revolution allowing it to be dropped or directed towards the bottom of
the drum where it combines with other parts of the mix in continuously
changing sequence to form a homogeneous mix.
The
revolution  of
mixing drum is achieved by rotating the handle which in turn rotates the
mixing drum by a s&able gear arrangement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.1  Free-Fall Barrow Ti@ing
Mixer-
The free-fall mixer in which the
drum  rotates about an inclined axis-s The drum is mounted on a wheel
barrow which can be tilted forward to discharge the mixed concrete From

opening, when the drum is tilted to the highest position at w&h
it will
effectively discharge its batch.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6  Loadhg
Point -The
loading point is used  to establish the loading
height above the datum ground level and is that point to which the
material shall be raised in order to commence charging the mixer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7 Nominal
Batch Capacity-The
volume in cubic metre of  mixed
concrete which can be  held and mixed satisfkctoriiy in one hatch.<<HEADING_END>>
