<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution on 20 January
1983, after the draft finalized by the Flooring
and
Plastering
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 It is realized
that terms
in common
use by all concerned
with
plastering
and
rendering
appear
in a number
of Indian
Standard
specilkations,
codes of practice, and it has been considered
preferable for
all definitions
to be put together in one publication.
This glossary has,
therefore, been prepared
which would be handy for day to day use and
assist the reader of technical literature to understand
the meaning
of the
terms used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard, due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition
to relating it to the practices in the field
in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
