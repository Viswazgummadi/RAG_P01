<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the
draft
finalized
by the
Housing
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
DiviGon
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerable
shortage
of houses in the country,
which is also increasing
continuously,
has led to increasing
stress being laid in the development
programmes
of central
and
state
governments,
on facilitating
speedy
and economical
cnnstruction
of houses.
Problem
of
housing
being
greatest
amongst
the lower income
groups, both rural and urban,
the enormous
stress is being laid on housing
for these target groups.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This calls for development
and
standardization
of new
building
materials
and
construrtion
techniques
which are simple and economical,
commensurate
with
structural
and
hygeinic
safety
and ~durability,
in
order to ensure speedy and rronorr&-al
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
is one of the series of standards
on new materials
and techniques
of roof/floor
constructinn
which when implementrd
will result  in substantial
savings
in materials
and ctjsf  of  construction,
in addition
to achirving
speedy construction.
The other standards
being
published
in the
series
are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Specification
for prefabricated
brick pane1 and
partially
precast
concrete
joist
for
flooring
and
roofing,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Code of practice
for design and construction
of roofs and floors with prefabricated
brick panel,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Specification

channel
unit for roofing and flooring,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Code of practice

with

channel
units,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Code of practice
for design and construction
of floor and roof
with reinforced
concrete
planks and
joists,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Specification
for precast L-panel
units for roofing,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Code of practice
for design and construction
of roof with L-panel
units, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Code of practice
for construction
of walls using prec.ast concrete
stone masonry
blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Precast
reinforced
concrete
planks are partially
precast rectangular
slab
elements
which are supported
over
partially
precast
RCC joists side by side. These
are joined
together
and
also to the joist
by pouring
iwsitu
concrete
over the haunches
provided
in the planks and the gaps between
the planks over the joists.
Monoli-
thic action
of the slab elements
is ensured
by leaving
stirrups
projecting
out
of joists
and
providing
reinforcement
across the joists over haunched
portion
of planks,
tying
them
together
and
pouring
in-situ
concrete
over it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Roofs
and floor made with precast
RC
planks
are
found
econoniical
as compared
to conventional
RC
slabs mainly
due to the following
reasons:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Components
used for construction
being precast,
shuttering
is eliminated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Quality
can be controlled
better in precast
elements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Moderate
size components
are used thereby
eliminating
need for mechanical
handling
and erection
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Prefabrication
leads to substantial
reduction
in time required
for construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerable
assistance
has been rendered
in
the
preparation
of
this
standard
by the Central
Building
Research
Institute,
Roorkee,
who has developed
this technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Committee
responsible
for the
formulation
of this standard
is given in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of drcidine:
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final
value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS 2 : 1960
‘Rules
fnr rounding
off
numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number
of significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in~this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Annex
A,
if the deflection
after
24 h of the removal
of the imposed
load is at least
75 percent
of the

24~h, the units shall be deemed
to have passed the
test. If the deflection
recovery
is less than 75 per-
cent
the
lot

shall
be
rejected,
If
the
maximum
deflection

<<PARAGRAPH>>concrete
or steel.
Alternatively,
uniform
load can
be
applied
by
hydraulic

through
a self
reacting
frame and a set of beam to distribute
the
load.
The
load shall be retained
for 24 h. After
recording
deflection
at the end of this period,
the
load shall be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The precast
reinforced
concrete
planks
shall be
tested at an age of 28 days
after
in-situ
concrete
has been laid in the haunch
portion
as mentioned
in A-3. Precast joists
shall be
tested at an age of
28 to 33 days after casting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.1
The
RC
plank
which
has
passed
the
deflection
recovery
test shall be
subjected
further
to failure
load
test.
Loading
shall be done uni-
formly
through
loading
blocks
or
through
hydraulic
jacks
and a set of beams to distribute
the load.
If loading
is done
through
blocks to
sufficient
gap shall be provided
between
adjacent
tiers of blocks
to ensure
that
they
do not touch
each other even at the
final
stages of loading,
to
prevent
transfer
of
load
to supports
of
units
through
arch action.
Loading
shall be preferably
done from
an
independent
scaffold
as a safety
precaution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

TEST OF
-REINFORCED
CONCRETE
PLANK<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1
One
unit
selected
at random
out
of the
units which have satisfied
shape and dimensional
requirements
shall
be
subjected
to
deflection
recovery
test,
The precast
units
shall be simply
supported
with a bearing
of 50 mm over brickwall
finished
level and smooth
with cement mortar
1  :  4
as shown
in Fig. 5. The
haunches
around
the
plank shall be filled
with Ml5
concrete
using 10
mm and
down
graded
aggregate.
The
haunch
concrete
shall be water cured for 14 days.
Design
dead
load
other
than
due
to self weight of the
unit shall
be
applied
uniformly
over
the
unit
through
loading
blocks or by other means.
A dial
gauge having least count
of
0.02 mm or less and
a range of 50 mm or
more shall be
fixed at mid-
span of the units. The dial gauge shall be adjusted
to indicate
zero  Y  eading
under self
weight
of the
units and applied dead load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.2
The
loading
shall
continue
till the plank
fails. If no failure occurs by
crushing
or breaking
of the unit, the load causing
a defIection
equal to
1 in 60 of clear span of the unit
shall
be
consi-
dered
as the
failure
load.
To
check
that
the
limiting
deflection
is not exceeded,
a steel marker
shall be fixed below the unit at midspan,
leaving
a gap of 1 in 60 of clear
span
before
the
start of
the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-4.3
Load Test for RC Joist<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  test shall be done
similar
to the
test for RC
planks, except
that instead
of uniform
load, point
loads shall be applied
at middle
third
points and
the
bearing
of the
joist
at
each
ends shall be
100 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
