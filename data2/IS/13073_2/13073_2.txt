<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the-Hydraulic
Structures Instrumentation Sectional Committee, had been approved by the Water Resources DivisionCouncil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements of relative horizontal displacements of points in the interior of a dam provide the fastest, simplest
and direct method of watching the structural behaviour of the damMeasurements
of structural deformation over
a considerable period of time (several years) furnishes information regarding the general-elastic behaviour of the
entire structure and foundation and provide a means for determining the elastic shape of the deflected structure
which will permit distinction of load and thermal deflection components and with precise alignment data, provide
for estimating the amount of translation or sliding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deflection cycles of remarkable uniformity in amplitude and period become clearly evident from the initiation of
observations if any deviation is apparent. Study of this deviation helps in detecting development of distress
conditions in structure or foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depending upon the amount and type of related and supporting information available, observations of crest
collimation movable target can be used for ascertaining the elastic and inelastic physical properties of the concrete
or masonry and foundation rocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Relative displacements are measured by means of collimators and by the use of plumb lines with pendulums-placed
inside a shaft in the dam. The displacement of the wire is measured normal to and parallel to dam axis in straight
gravity dams.(radial and tangential direction in case of arch dams) with respect to fixed points in the shaft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Though the measurement of displacement by pendulums is restricted to significant individual points or change of
direction of significant lines, pendulums are the foremost instruments for the observation of behaviour of dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this type of observation of displacement measuring device, a line of sight is established across the dam with a
theodolite on one bank and a fixed target on the opposite bank. Movable target stations are fixed on the crest of the
damin this line of sight. The observations are made at both theodolite and-movable target stations by keeping the
line of sight remaining fixed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been prepared in two parts  :  IS 13073 ( Part 1 )  :  1991 ‘Code of practice for installation,
maintenance and observation of displacement measuring devices in concrete and masonry dams  :  Part 1 Deflection
measurement using plumb lines’, and Part 2 covers measurement by means of collimators’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For choice and location of instruments in masonry and concrete dams, reference is invited to IS 7436 ( Part 2 )  :  1997
‘Guide for types of measurement for structures in river valley projects and criteria for choice and location of
measuring instruments  :  Part 2 Concrete and masonry dams (  first revision )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised)‘.  The number of significant places retained in the
rcunded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>of a particular forced centering device, a steel plate
having necessary grooves for convenient fixing of
different types of theodolites can also be used. Suitable
protective covers with locking arrangements ( similar
to those shown in Fig. 1 ) should also be provided on
top of the pillar. For safety of the pillar, alround fencing
should be recommended.
2  PRINCIPLE AND CONSTRUCTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard ( Part 2 ) lays down the details for the
installation, maintenance and observation of crest
collimation
movable target for measurement
of
horizontal movement of points on the crest of concrete
or masonry dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.2
Fixed Target Station<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A line of sight should be established across the dam
with a theodolite on one bank and a fixed target on
the opposite bank. In this line of sight, movable target
stations should be fixed on the crest of the dam. The
observations should be made at both theodolite and
movable target stations. The line of sight remains fixed.
The movable target should be moved and brought to
the line of sight with the aid of a rotating screw. The
position of the mobile target should be read by means
of a micrometer attachment on the mobile target.
Difference of the observed value of the mobile target
position from the initial reading gives the displacement
at the crest of the dam. The displacement should be
measured normal to dam axis in straight gravity dams
and radial in case of arch dams with respect to fixed
line of sight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On the opposite bank and in the line of sight a fixed
target station should be provided. The fixed target
may either be fixed type or mounting type as given
in  3.2.2.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.2.1
Fixed type target<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A stainless steel rod of diameter 25 mm and length
not less than 150 mm should be used for this purpose.
A hole should be drilled in the rock and this bull’s
eye type target should be cement grouted as shown
in Fig. 2. At outer face two concentric circles should
be engraved. The centre circle and the outer ring should
be painted white and the middle ring should be painted
black.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.2.2
Mounting type target
3  EQUIPMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A needle type target made of brass as shown in
(Fig. 3 ) should be used as a fixed target for establishing
the line of sight. In this case the needle target should
be fixed on top of a concrete pillar in a similar way as
explained in 3.2.1. Suitable groove at the centre of
the forced centering plate should be provided for fixing
the needle target. Care should be taken to ensure that
the same needle target is always used and the position
is not changed. A shade made out of M.S. plate and
painted black as shown in Fig. 4 may be fixed on the
rear side of the needle target for sharp pointing of the
target from theodolite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The various components that constitute the fixed
line of sight and equipment
for observation
of
displacement at crest of the dam are as under.<<HEADING_END>>

Theodolite Station<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thedolite station should be constructed with reinforced
cement concrete (see Fig. 1). The vertical reinforcement
of the pillar should be fixed below the ground level
for futity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On top of the pillar, forced centering device suitable
Mounting
type targets
supplied
by theodolite
for fixing the theodolite should be embedded. The
manufacturers may also be used as fixed targets. This
forced centering device vary with the theodolite and
target should have white and black wedges on its

<<PARAGRAPH>>of the dam should be finalized. For straight gravity
dam, the points on the dam may~lie in a straght line,
so that with one theodolite station and one fixed target
station, the displacement of all the points may be
observed ( see Fig. 6 ). For arch dam one theodolite
station and one fixed target station are essentially
required for one mobile target station ( see Fig. 7 ).
When mobile target stations are located on top of a
dam block,
in which pendulums
are installed,
observations on the collimation may be correlated to
the observation on the dam pendulums.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Mobile Target<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mobile target as shown in Fig.5 should be fixed on
top of a base during observation. The base for taking
this mobile target should be embedded on top of dam
crest in the line of sight. The base is fixed at a lower
level than the road level and should be covered with
suitable M.S. Plate with nuts and bolts or with suitable
locking arrangements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5  OBSERVATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 The observations are taken in the following steps:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Theodolite should be set on the fixed centering
device ofthe station. The same theodolite should
be set up over the station at all times as far as
possible. The relative position of the footscrews
on the trivet should be kept constant. The
instrument should be levelled very accurately.
A sighting should be made to the fixed target<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) A mobile target should be fixed on top of the
mobile target station. The face of the mobile
target should be fixed so that it is perpendicular
to the line of sight. This may be done by
bringing the rotating drums as shown in
Fig. 8 (on top of which the mobile target has
been fixed ) to a fixed bearing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Weekly observations should be made during the first
filling of the reservoir after which fortnightly schedule
of reading may be adopted. More frequency schedule
of reading may be adopted when rate of reservoir rise
is fast. At least one reading should be obtained for
the highest and the lowest reservoir levels attained
every year.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

right should be taken and averaged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The face of the theodolite should be changed,
fixed target may be sighted and then the mobile
target, should be brought into coincidence
with the line of sight by moving the mobile
target from apparent left. The mobile target
should be moved and then brought to line
of sight. Four readings should be taken and

<<PARAGRAPH>>Magnitude of dam displacement at crest level should
be obtained
by subtracting
the initial reading.
Displacement values so computed should be plotted
to show the deflected shape of dam at crest level.
Continuous plots of deflection at various observation
times, with corresponding reservoir level against time
should be maintained for watching the deflection trend
and behaviour of the dam. This should also be correlated
with the observation on the dam pendulums.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
