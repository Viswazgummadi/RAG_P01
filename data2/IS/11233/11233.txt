<<HEADING level=3>>@FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 20 February
1985, after the draft finalized
by the Foundation
Engi-
neering Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Radar antenna, microwave and TV towers are widely used for the
communication
system in Defence,
Posts and Telegraph
Department,
Railways and for TV stations.
The foundation
required
for these types
of towers have to be designed
based on several
known and assumed
factors. Based on the experience gained so far, this standard on the subject
has been formulated so that it will help various organizations
to standard-
ize the design procedures and assumed factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960’.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should
be the  same  as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE

<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1 The location map showing the layout
of the existing towers and
structures with the general topography
of the area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2 The geometrical
details
of the tower like height and details of
antenna and its/their sizes configuration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3 The resulting forces acting at the base of the tower like downward
loads, uplift forces, the horizontal

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.5 A detailed geotechnical report depicting clearly the sub-soil profile,
the physical and strength properties of the various strata,
etc., the sub-soil
profile
to a depth
of
10 m or
to a depth equal to twice the width
of the tower foundation
at the founding level or
any
other
information
required
for
the design. Information
on the ground
water table and
its seasonal variations, aggressive characteristics
of sub-soil and surround-
ings should be available.
The soil test report should indicate the bore log
with classification of soil, standard
penetration
test values in full depth,
dynamic core penetration
test value up to at least
10 m depth

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.8 In case of rocky subgrades, it should be ensured
that rocky strata
is of sufficient thickness and not just a sheet rock under laid by compres-
sible or poor soil strata.
In such cases the data like compressive

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Settlements<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.1  For the allowable settlements for these structures,
the following
guidelines may be considered:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The allowable total settlement
should be restricted as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Radar antenna towers-12
mm;
2) Microwave towers with dish type antenna-16
mm; and
3) Towers and towers with yagi type antenna-50
mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The maximum
allowable
differential
settlement
should
be
restricted
to 6 mm for radar
antenna towers, 20 mm for
TV
towers and 12 mm for microwave towers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) In case of foundations
resting partially on rock and partially
on
soil, the allowable
differential
settlements
should be restricted
to as per (b) above.
There
is likelihood
of large differential
settlements and
large variations
in estimation
of settlements.
In such situations, the
foundation
portion in compressible
soil
should be taken to a base
on which settlement
is comparable
to that on rocky
portion,
using even concrete
piles
of end
bearing type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The possible
differential
settlement
due to eccentric
loading
should also be evaluated during the analysis.
e) While deciding the allowable settlement,
the seasonal
variation
of water table should be duly taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  TYPES OF FOUNDATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The following types of foundations
can be considered
as alternatives:
a) Isolated footings under each leg of the tower;
b) A combined raft foundation
( with or without beams );
c) Annular or ring foundation,
specially for
circular
section
RCC
towers;
d) Pile foundations;
e) Rock anchors in case of towers resting on rocks;
f) Combination
of (a) with (d) or (e) above; and
g) Shell foundations,
specially for circular section RCC towers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1 Depending upon the relative magnitude of upward or downward
vertical loads, lateral load and
overturning
moments,
footings
in soil

<<HEADING level=3>>5. GENERAL DESIGN CRITERIA<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.0 Design Loads and Fumes -
The following loads and forces should be
used for design of tower foundations:
a) Downward
load;
b) Uplift load;
c) Horizontal thrust ( base shear ); and
d) Overturning moments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.0.1 Inclined loads should be split into lateral/shear
and vertical
loads
at the top of footings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  Design Criteria for Various Types of Design Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  Uplift loads and horizontal
thrusts ( stabiiity considerations
).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.1 In tall self-supporting
type of towers ( M/W and TV ), and
often in short towers ( radar antenna ) uplift load becomes an important
governing criteria for selection and design of type of foundations
due
to
structure
and foundation
stability.
General consideration
and criteria are
given in from 5.1.1.12 to 5.1.1.14.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.2 The uplift loads are assumed
to be counteracted
in case of
shallow foundations
by the weight of the footing plus the weight of an
inverted frustum of a pyramid of earth,
on the footing
inclined at an angle of up to 30” with the vertical.
pad, with sides<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.3 A footing with an under-cut generally develops uplift resistance
that is higher than that of an identical footing without
an under-cut
(see
Fig. 1 ) for which reason
reduced
factors
of safety ( see 5.4.1 ) can be
adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.4 A 30’ cone shall be taken for an average firm cohesive material
while a 20” cone shall be taken for non-cohesive materials, such as sand and
gravelly soils. Interpolation
can be done for in between soil classifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.5 Alternative footing designs with or without
under-cut
should
be provided where field investigations have not been made to determine
feasibility of undercutting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.6 In enlarged footings without an under-cut
where individual
footing is not provided under each leg and where a combination
of uplift
loads with lateral loads
occurs,
the suitability should be checked by the
following criteria:
a) The resultant of forces acting
vertically
and laterally
should
act
at a point in its base at a distance of onesixth
of its width from
the toes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The weight of the footing acting at the centre of the base;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Mainly that part of the cone which stands over the heel causes a
stabilizing
moment.
However, for design purposes,
this may be
taken
equal to half the total weight of the cone of earth acting
over the base.
It should be assumed
to act through
the tip of
the heel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.7 The uplift forces in case of pile foundation
should be counter-
acted by the uplift resistance of piles and weight of pile caps and the earth-
cone above it with factors of safety as in 5.4.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.8 The horizontal
forces,
in case of shallow foundations
are
resisted by passive soil pressure on the edges of the footings
and the drag
resistance
with soil at the base of footing
with factors of
safety as
in 5.4.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.9 In case of pile foundations
the horizontal load capacity of all
piles with passive earth pressure of footings ( pile caps ) should
be equal
to horizontal base shear multiplied by factor of safety as in 5.4.1,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.10
A  footing on rock, for uplift and horizontal
loads, may be
considered to develop strength by the dead load of the concrete
and the
least of (a) strength of all the bars anchored under the footing ( the pull
out bond resistance of anchor bars grouted
or embedded
in concrete in
drilled holes ) or (b) the pull out resistance ( frictional resistance of concrete
in anchor holes with rock ) of all the rock anchors in the footing area. The
factors of safety as in 5.4.1 should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.11 In case of good soils where the size of footing designed on
downward
load considerations
is considerably
smaller than the size of
footing required with uplift criterion, short under-reamed
piles
of 3’5 m
length under the footing be provided to achieve additional uplift resistance,
instead of increasing
the size of footing. Economy considerations
should,
however, govern the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.12 If a basement is provided, active earth pressure on the walls
should be considered.
The passive resistance of the soil on the basement
wall during earthquake
and horizontal
forces should
be neglected while
analyzing the stability of the foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.13 When shallow foundations
are adopted, tension should not be
allowed on the edges of the foundation
under horizontal
forces.
In cases
of pile foundation,
however, uplift resistance
of the piles, and in case of
rock anchors the pull-out resistance of the anchor should be three times
the tension.
In all the other cases the dead weight of the footing ( cap in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_11>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 11233 - 1985<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cases of piles ) and the earth
fill above the footing
of pile cap in
accordance with 5.1.1.1 should
be considered
for balancing
the tension
providing factor of safety as in 5.4.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.14 All the isolated/individual
footings should be inter-connected
at ground level or below, by beams inter-connecting
columns/stems, to be
designed for a maximum
differential
settlement
in addition
to the other
design considerations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2 Downward loads and overturning
moments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2.1 For downward force, the shallow foundations are to be designed
such that the pressure on sub-grade at any point does not exceed the safe
bearing capacity.
In case of pressure
variation caused by moments due to
lateral
( horizontal
forces ) on tower,
permissible
increase
in bearing
pressure should be in accordance with 5.5.3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2.2
The pile foundations
system should be so designed that load
shared by a pile does not exceed its safe load carrying
capacity
in vertical
( downward as well uplift ) as well as horizontal
direction.
Group action
for number of piles more than 2 should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2.3 Combination
of shallow fovndations
and
pile foundations
should ensure that differential
settlement of tower legs is within permis-
sible limits as in 3.3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Criteria for selection of type of foundation
and its design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1 Amongst other
consideration,
the
safe bearing capacity
and
settlement
characteristics
of soil should govern
the selection of the type
foundation.
Amongst
various
alternatives, cost economics should be the
decisive factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 The raft foundations
may become good choice if basements are
provided in case of high towers or if the soils are weak with low settlement
values.
The raft should be sufficiently
stiff to withstand
the differentia1
settlement and also the flexural vibrations cause due to wind/earthquake.
It is generally
preferable to go in for beam type raft system.
The
raft
design may be as per IS  :  2950 ( Part 1 )-1981*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3 The isolated
footings may become a good choice in case of lattice
towers resting on good soils with medium
to high bearing capacity
and
when tower legs are spaced far apart.
should be as per IS  :  1080-1980t.

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4  For KCC towers of circular
shape, the ring type or annular
or shell
type
of foundations
can
be adopted.
The
design
of annular
ring type
foundation
should
follow IS  :  11089-1984*
and that of shell
type founda-
tion should
follow IS : 9456-1980t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5
The
combination
of isolated
footings
and pile foundations
should
be used with utmost
caution
due to greater
chances
of high
and
unantici-
pated differential
settlements
between
legs.
In case the footings
under
the
same tower
structure
happen
to rest
such that some of them are in soil
and while others
on rock, then due consideration
should
be given for ditt‘e-
re’ntial settlement
and the structural
safety.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.6 Bored piles with enlarged
bases usually
provide
an economical
type
of footing
in many soils where under-reaming
is possible.
In expansive
type
of soils
such
as black
cotton
soils,
they
have
to be carried
down to a
depth of 3’5 m below
the cut-off
level
in deep
layers
of these
soils
to
counteract
the effect of upthrust
due to swelling
pressure
introduced
in the
soil.
Normal
type of independent
spread
footing
carried
down to shallo\\
depth will not be suitable
in such soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.7
Different
types of piles can be used
depending
upon
the location
and sub-soil
characteristics
in case of heavy
uplift
forces
and
moments
multiple
under-reamed
piles or anchors
may
be used.
In case of loose to
medium

soils bored compaction
under-reamed
piles may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.10.1 The safe loads given in IS  :  2911 ( Part 3 ) - 1980* for under-
reamed piles apply to both,
medium
compact sandy soils and clayey soils
of medium consistency. For dense sandy ( N>30 ) and stiff clayey ( N>8 )
soils the loads may be increased by 25 percent.
However,
the values of
lateral thrust should not be increased unless stability of top soil ( strata to
a depth of about three times the stem diameter ) is ascertained.
On the
other hand a 25 percent
reduction
should be made in case of loose
sandy ( NC 10 ) and soft clayey ( NC4 ) soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
For determining
the
average
‘N’ values ( the standard
penetration
test
values ) a weighted average shall be taken and correction
for fineness
under  water
table shall be applied where applicable.
5.2.10.2
In case of piles resting on rock bearing the component should
be obtained by multiplying the safe capacity of rock with the bearing area
of pile stem plus the bearing provided by the under-ream portion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Footing on Rock -- A rock footing, the uplift
and
horizontal
loads,
may be considered to develop strength by the dead load of the concrete
and the strength of bar anchorage
( the pull-out
value of anchor
bars
grouted in drill holes or the failure strength of rock engaged by bars >.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1 The depth of embedment
of the bars below the bottom
of the
footing should not be less than the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D=45  d<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D=the
minimum depth of embedment in mm; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d  =diameter
of anchor bar in mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2 The spacing of embedded bars should normally be one-half of the
normal depth of embedment as given in 5.3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.3 The size of the bar should be governed by the criterion
that com-
bined stressed do not exceed the permissible limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Factor of Safety and Permissible Stresses<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.1 While calculating the stability
of the foundations,
the factor of
safety 2’0 should be provided at every stage.
However,
in case of found-
ations with an under-cut, the factor of safety of 1’25 may be adopted while<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the uplift resistance.
A factor
of safety of 3 should
be
provided
for safe uplift
resistance
in case of piles and rock pull out
anchors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.2 If the foundations
are resting on saturated non-cohesive strata, no
increase in the allowable
bearing
pressure should be considered
for the
stability analysis under eccentric loadings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5;4.3 The permissible stresses in concrete and reinforcement
should be
as given in IS  :  456-1978’.
For the other
materials, the relevant
Indian
Standards should be followed.
Under
earthquake
forces,
the permissible
stress in all the materials can be exceeded up to a limit of 33 percent ( see
IS  :  1893-1975t). However, the influence of fatigue under vibration
gene-
rated forces during winds and earthquakes may also be considered
suit-
ably, while selecting permissible stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Bearing  Capacity and Other Sub-soil Parameters<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.1  The safe bearing
capacity
should
be determined
in- accordance
with provisions in IS  :  6403-19813 and permissible
total
and differential
settlements as in 3.3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.2
Except when towers are constructed
on hillocks,
the
sub-soil
saturation
effect  due to flooding should be considered while recommending
safe bearing capacity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3 No increase in allowable bearing pressure on soil or on piles shall
be considered under wind or earthquake
forces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.1 The permissible bearing pressures arrived at as in 5.5.1 may
be exceeded at the edge of the footings
by 25 percent when variation in
intensity of the reaction caused by the transmission
of moments
to the
footing is taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.4 Rock anchor pull-out
tests should be carried
out on 75 mm dia
and 1 000 mm deep drilled holes, in case of hard rocks, on at least 3 holes,
in determining average value of rock anchor strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
