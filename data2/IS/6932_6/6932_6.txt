<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Part VI ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 22 March
1973,
after the draft finalized by the Building Limes
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Hitherto,
methods
of tests for assessing
qualitative
requirements
of
building
limes were included
in IS  :  712-1964.
For facilitating
the use of
these tests it has been decided to print these tests as different parts of a separate
Indian Standard.
This part covers determination
of volume yield of quick-
lime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this
standard,
if the final value, observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded off, it
shall be done in accordance

<<HEADING level=3>>3. DETERMINATION
ON VOLUME YIELD OF QUICKLIME<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Apparatus -The
Southard
viscosimeter
( Fig. 1 ) shall be used for
adjusting the consistency
of the putty and a vessel of the shape and dimensions
shown in Fig. 2 shall be used for the determination
of the volume yield.
The
Southard
viscosimeter
consists of a vertical metal cylinder 50 mm in internal
diameter
equipped
with a tight-fitting
metal piston having a working stroke
of 65 mm measured
from the upper open end of the cylinder.
The piston
can be raised, without rotation,
by a coarse-thread
screw having 2 threads/
cm passing through a nut at the lower closed end of the cylinder and engaging<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_4>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 6932 ( Part VI ) - 1973<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the piston on the lower side of the latter.
In operation,
the piston  is  lowered
to the bottom
of its stroke,
the cylinder
is filled carefully
with the putty
avoiding
the inclusion
of air bubbles,
and the putty is struck off smooth at
the top.
The piston is then raised streadily by rotating
the screw at the rate
of one turn per second
for 10 seconds,
thus ejecting
the contents
of the
cylinder
vertically
upwards.
The degree to which the ejected
cylinder
of
putty has slumped
is then determined
by measuring
its present height by
means of a metal bridge or similar device.
For this purpose it is convenient
to provide
the top of the cylinder
with an extended
external
horizontal
flange with a plane surface on which the bridge may be applied.
The lime
putty vessel used for determining
the volume yield consists of a tinned iron
cylindrical
pot 63 f
1 mm in diameter
with a volume
of 250 ml with
soldered joints and a reinforced
rim of brass,
the upper
edge being
made
plane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Preparation
of Sample for  Test-Sufficient
lime putty for the deter-
mination of volume yield shall be prepared after conducting
the test described
in 2.4 of IS : 6932 ( Part III )-1973*
and
the ends of the filter cloth
shall
be folded together
to form a bag and tied.
This shall be suspended by cord
above the vessel to allow the lime putty to drain.
The bag shall be pressed
by hand with moderate
pressure to accelerate
the process.
The consistency
of the putty adjusted
to a standard
value such that a slump of 1.3 cm is
obtained when tested in the Southard
viscosimeter
described
under 3.1.
The
consistency
of the putty shall be adjusted by trial by adding
or subtracting
water and  ‘  knocking
up  ’  thoroughly;
mixing
and working
the material
before each trial, and repeating
until the required
slump  is  obtained
with a
permissible
deviation
of not more than 0.2 cm from the standard
slump of
l-3 cm.
The viscosimeter
shall be washed after each examination.
A small
mixer of the type given in IS  :  1625-1971t
shall be used for the’ knocking
up  ’
of the material before each determination,
the material
being passed through
twice.
When the putty contains more water it shall be removed by placing
the putty for a short period on a clean absorbent
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Procedure
-
The volume yield of the lime putty
shall be determined
from the density of a portion
of the putty when adjusted
to the standard
consistency
in the manner
described
under 3.2.
The density of the putty
shall be determined
by weighing
a known volume of putty, using the density
vessel shown in Fig. 2, care being taken to eliminate
air bubbles.
Where  no
isothermal slaking temperature
has been specified by the vendor, the duplicate
slakings shall be carried out at 50 and 100°C and after the determination
of
volume yields on duplicate
samples of putty, that putty which exhibits
the
higher volume yield shall be chosen for the purpose of recording.
The other
sample of putty shall be discarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
