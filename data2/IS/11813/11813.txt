<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 15 October
1986, after the draft finalized by the Chemical Methods of
Test Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Textile Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The soiling of textile fabrics is one of the most difficult problems
asso-
ciated with their use. Cotton
and cellulosic fabrics do not pose a severe
problem of soiling because of their high moisture
regain.
Nevertheless,
the resin finished cellulosic fabrics and fabrics rich in synthetic
fibres pose
a severe problem
of soiling during their usage.
The soiling of fabrics is
due to: ( a ) interfacial attraction or Van der Wall forces, ( b ) electrostatic
attraction,
( c ) mechanical forces, and ( d ) hydrophobicity
of the fibres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The soil is mainly of two types, namely, dry or particulate soil and oily
or greasy soil.
The former which includes particles of dust, sand, earth,
soot, metallic oxides and carbon with tarry substances may be hydrophilic
( metallic oxides ) or hydrophobic ( carbon ) in nature.
The latter includes
glycerides, long chain fatty acids and alcohols,
lubricating
oil, etc, which
are mostly hydrophobic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This Indian Standard
prescribes
a method
for determination
of soil
resistance and soil release efficiency of finished textile fabrics and garments
for both types of soil as mentioned above.
soils may be present on the fabric.
In normal use, both
types of
It is, therefore,
advisable to test the
fabric for both types of soil before use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For evluation of soil resistance and soil release efficiency of the fabric,
synthetic soils are used for soiling purpose.
Ferric oxide and carbon black
in fine powder form are employed as particulate soil whereas used lubricat-
ing oil SAE 40 is employed as oily soil.
In the absence of a standard used
lubricating oil, it is recommended to use a standard
oil and add to it 10
percent
of carbon black particles
of standard mesh size of 20 to 25 nm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The latter is hydrocarbon
based and is similar to natural soiling encounter-
ed in actual usage as it contains carbon particles dispersed in oil phase.
The properties of these soils are given in Table 1 ( see 5.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the
result of a test, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with
IS  :  Z-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard prescribes a method for determining soil resistance
and
soil release efficiency of finished textile fabrics and garments.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The method can also be used to assess the relative
washing efficiency
of surfactant auxiliaries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. PRINCIPLE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 A specimen of the fabric under test is soiled with synthetic soil, wash-
ed under prescribed
conditions
and dried.
Simultaneously,
a control
specimen and a control washed specimen are taken from the fabric under
test.
The soil resistance
and soil release efficiency of the fabric is deter-
mined as described in 7.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. SAMPLING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Lot - The quantity of one definite type and quality
of a fabric or
garment
delivered
to a buyer against one despatch note shall constitute a
lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Sample shall be drawn so as to be representative
of the lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Sample drawn in compliance
with the material
specifications
or as
agreed to between
the buyer and the seller to evaluate soil resistance and
soil release efficiency of the textile fabric in the lot shall be held to be
representative
of the lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 An accelerator consisting of a rotor capable of rotating at 1 600 rpm.
The rotor consists of motor to which a shaft is attached.

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2.1 Take the other two test specimens
( see 6.2 ) and weigh each
of them nearest to one mg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2.2 Calculate the amount of ‘used lubricating
oil’ ( see 5.1 ) 45
percent on the mass of the test specimens and convert it into ml taking into
account the density of the oil ( see Table 1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2.3 Pour exactly half of the calculated amount on each test speci-
men with the help of a gas micrometer syringe and place them on each arm
of the rotor of the accelerator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2.4 Secure tightly the door of the chamber,
switch on the motor
and maintain its speed at 1 600 rpm for three minutes.
Take out the
uniformly soiled test specimens and keep them aside for spectrophotometric
measurement and washing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2.5 The uniformly soiled test specimens shall not have maximum
reflectance variation of more than f5 percent.
In case, the test specimens
as soiled in 7.1.2.4 do not meet this requirement, two fresh test specimens
shall be cut from the sample and treated
as given in 7.1.2.1 to  7.1.2.4
till they meet the requirement given in 7.1.2.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2.6 Repeat the procedure given in  7.1.2.1  to  7.1.2.5 for the remain-
ing two test specimens ( see 6.2 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  1 -
The chamber should be cleaned in between two successive soiling opera-
tions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
Alternatively
the sample is fixed on an embroidery
ring and secured
tight.
The exact amount of soil is poured in the middle of the sample
and allowed
to wick for 16 to 20 hours.
Each sample is processed similarly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Washing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1 Wash two of the control specimens ( see 6.2 ) and four soiled test
specimens, two each as obtained in 7.1.1.5 and 7.1.2.5 in a launderometer
in separate baths each containing
3.5 g/l of a non-ionic
detergent
(see
5.2 ) and lg/l carboxymethyl
cellulose ( see 5.3 ) at 50°C for 30 minutes at
a liquor ratio of 1  :  50.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  The specimens should be fully exposed to the wash
liquor
from both
the
sides.<<HEADING_END>>
