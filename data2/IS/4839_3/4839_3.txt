RVD 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This  Indian Standard (Second
Revision)
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized
by the Irrigation
Canals and Canal Linings Sectional Committee
had been approved by the
River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard ( Part 3 ) gives necessary guidance regarding the maintenance
of a canal for the assistance
of engineers m field. However, it is not possible to cover all types .of contingencies
in this standard and
the discretion
of the Engineer-in-charge
would be required
in such cases. Part 1 and Part 2 of this
standard covers the maintenance
of unlined and lined canals respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard ( Part 3 ) was first published in 1969 and revised in 1979. This second revision
has been
taken
up to incorporate
certain
changes found
necessary
in the standard
in the light of comments
received from the users..The
salient changes
that have been incorporated
in this revision are listed
below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Slight improvements
have been made under maintenance
of canals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) In lined canals closure after a period of 3-4 years have been recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Register to be maintained to evaluate working of outlets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value,
observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
( revised)‘.
The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should
be provided.
Protection
by
launching apron should be provided
only in a
length so as~to cover maximum scour in a slope
of 2  :  1. Dumping of boulders/brick
bats should
not be above bed level. Embankments
should be
protecting
by pitching
on the side slope with
bricks/stones.
Bricks/stones
left out protruding
in a staggered fashion will be helpful in dissipa-
tion of energy.
However,
if this provision
does
not improve the situation, the cause should be
investigated
and
suitable
energy

device provided downstream
of the canal struc-
tures.
Scour
charts
showing
the depth
and
extent
of scour
should
be maintained
for all
major
canal
structures
where
this
tendency
persists.
The
charts
should
be replotted
and
revised at least once a year after
the annual
closure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
( Part 3 ) covers
maintenance
of
canal structures,
drains,
outlets,
jungle
clear-
ance, plantation
and regulation
of canals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

1981 Code of practice for design of cross drain-
age works: Part 2 Specific requirements,
Section
3 Canal syphons’ is a necessary
adjunct to this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 CANAL STRUCTURES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 All masonry works should be inspected
and
soundings
taken
in the
vicinity
and
repairs
carried out during the closure period. A register
of masonry
works for main canals
should be
maintamed
and updated from time to time when
improvements
are affected.
It is proposed that
in addition to the register
the drawmgs
of all
.
the masonry
structures
are
maintained
on
tracing-cloth
and remodelling
or repairs,
etc,
carried
out from
time to time, are marked in
different colours and note to this effect is given
on the tracing cloth itself, so that
the relevant
case and the document
could he linked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 OUTLETS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 All outlets should be regularly
checked and
set right, if found defective,
in accordance
with
the detailed instructions
issued by the depart-
ment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Outlet pipes should not be left lying about
the canal. They should be carried to the nearest
inspection
house as soon as change in outlet has
taken place and pipes are found
surplus. They
should be stacked neatly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1 All masonry
structures
should
be main-
tained
through
proper
repairs
in a sound
condition.
Any damage noticed in these works
should
be speedily
rectified.
Care
should be
taken to -ensure proper curing of repair work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Water courses should have culverts/siphons
wherever needed and should be properly
main-
tained to avoid wastage of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 No grass should
be allowed
to grow near
the parapets
or wings of canal structure
which
should be kept scrupulously
neat and tidy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 Register should be maintained
and head of
wa,ter ( H ) of each
outlet i. e. the~difference
between
the water
level in the canal and the
centre
line of the outlet
at its exit end, when
the canal is running at full supply
level
should
be measured
every month.
It will be of great
help for ensuring that the outlets
draw their
authorised
share
of canal water.
The outlets
should be so fixed that these draw their propor-
tionate share of supplies/silt
when compared
to
the supply in the parent
channel.
The working
of the outlets can be evalauted from the register
and these can be adjusted
suitably
during the
month of April and October.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Metalling

so as to ensure
that the canal bank is, not encroached
upon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Mechanical
gates should be oiled, greased
and
kept
in perfect
working
order.
Exposed
surfaces should be kept properly
painted to pre-
vent
rusting
and date of painting marked on
them. Exposed surfaces which have been recent-
ly painted should be periodically
examined
and
any
patches
of rust found should be removed
and surface painted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.7 Any slipped pitching,
etc, of the drain cross
section should be made good patticularly
before
monsoon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 JUNGLE CLEARANCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 All vegetative
growth on canal banks should
be cleared-from
1.5 m beyond the outer edge of
the road on the inspection
bank and 3 m beyond
the shade line on the other bank. Where the full
supply level of the canal is more than one metre
above the ground level jungle clearance
should
be done from toe to toe of the outer
slopes of
the banks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1 The lifting gear should be properly
lubri-
cated to keep it in an easy operating
condition
and
to
prevent
rusting
and all lifting
gears
should be properly
lubricated
once a month.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2 The gates’and their embedded parts should
be inspected
during
closure.
They
should be
repaired,
painted and lubricated,
wherever nece-
ssary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 All vegetative
growth on distributaries
and
minors should be cleared from toe to toe of the
outer slopes of the banks.
Shrubs,
iarge grass
such as  Kans, Jhunds  and small trees,
espe-
cially
Dhak  should
be dug out by the roots.
Stumps of trees that have been standing
should
be cut down to at least below the ground.
Ant
hills shall he dug out and levelled off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3 Gates, etc, should be periodically
operated
to the extent possible to see that
these
are in
proper upkeep.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 PlankslKarrieslNeedles
at
regular
heads
should be kept in good condition.
These should
.be painted/coal
tarred once a year to -keep them
in good condttion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 All vegetative
growth on escapes and drains
should be cleared from the outer
edge of the
riding
bank
to the
inner edge of the opposite
bank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1 Planks/Karries/Needles
should
always be
kept near the works for which they are needed.
They
should
be stacked
on edge of masonry
walls built in shade if possible, and occasionally
turned
upside
down to prevent
their getting
warped or destroyed
by white ants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 The surroundings
of~chainage stones should
be kept
clear
of jungle,
grass or
any other
rubbish
to enable them to be seen from a dis-
tance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6  DRAINS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The inspection
bank should be maintained
in good condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-7.5 Grass and jungle should never be allowed to
grow on masonry works; it should be dug out by
the roots,
and the masonry
then pointed
or
plastered.
Grass growing against masonry work
should not be scrapped off. as the masonry may
get damaged in the process. No trees, tall grass,
nor jungle of any kind should be allowed within
10 m of a masonry work.
No big trees such as
Pipal,
Gular, Pilkhan,
and  Bargad
should
be
allowed to grow within 25 m of an important
masonry work, as the roots of these trees may
extend up to the-joints and damage the masonry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Silt cleared from the bed of a drain should
be used to fill up holes and ruts on the inspec-
tion bank. This silt should not be thrown up in
heaps in such a way as to interfere
with the
ingress of drainage. The silt should also not be
disposed off on the inner slopes of the drain to
safeguard
against its re-entrance
into the drains
during rains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>,6.3 Toe
drain
should
be provided
according
to IS 7784 ( Part 2Sec 3 )  :  1981. Toe drain pro-
vided
to intercept
seepage
water
should
be
cleared of weeds before the sowing of the crop
in that region, to keep down the spring level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6 Slime and moss, which often coat
masonry
should
be carefully
scrapped
off, care being
taken not to injure the mortar or plaster
in do-
ing so.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 Trees should not be allowed to grow on the
inner slopes of drains. The
dead branches
and
rubbish that may have accumulated
in the drains
should be cleared before the monsoon breaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7 When a tree is to be felled, a hollow should
be dug round
the
base, and
the trunk
cut
through as low down as possible,
the hollow
should be then filled up to cover the root.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Bunds
should not be permitted
in drains
and should be removed if found existing
before
monsoon
breaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.1 Shade line trees should not be felled with-
out special sanction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

than to undertake
the nursing of small seedlings
in the shade line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.2 Pruning of trees, if done at all, should not
be carried out with axes.
The
branch
should
first be sawn about half through, on the under-
side and then completely
through
from the top,
so that the bank may not be torn off. It should
be done preferably
in February just before the
sap begins to rise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.8 All large
roots
found
in the plantations
should be taken out during the rains and burnt
into charcoal when dry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.9 All newly planted trees and also those which
are less than 2 m in height
should be properly
protected
by suitable tree guards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-8 PLANTATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Acquired
land width
of canal
should
be
demarcated
by planting suitable species of trees
at suitable intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.9.1
The
old tree
guards
should be repaired
properly
where
necessary
and all grass, jungle
and large grass such as KANS weeded out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Sowing seed or plantation
should commence
in June and be finished
by the middle of the
month; so as to get the full benefit of the rains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.10 Small trees
should
be all erect and not
reclining
sideways.
Where
necessary,
a prop
should be used for the purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3 In low ground
liable to flooding,
seeds
should be sown on ridges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 The roots
of seedlings
should not be cut
nor broken when transplanting.
They should be
dug out with a good ball of earth adhering
and
so carried to the new site. If grown in pots like
eucalyptus, the rootsare
sure to be -pot-bound.
In such cases the pot should
be carried to the
new site and the seedling roots bare of earth
and straightened
down into the holes dug for
them.
This greatly
facilitates
their subsequent
growth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.11 Newly planted
trees
should
be watered
regularly
but not
in excess
and the top soil
loosened soon after watering. Established plants
which have only been less than two years on the
shade line require to be given similar treatment
though not so often.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.12 Large trees are well able to look after their
own nourishment.
A good heavy
watering of 5
or 6 bucketfulls
about once a month only in the
very hot weather is about
all that
is necessary
for trees of medium
growth;
and even so the
very big and established
trees do not even need
this attention<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5 The parasitic plants such as AMARBEL and
BANDA should be removed, carried to an open
space
and burnt.
If the tree
is
completely
covered
-by the parasite,
it is recommended
to
cut it down and burn the parasitic
plant at
once.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>812.1 Watering of trees should be given in ring
trenches made away from the trunk. As the tree
grows the trench should be taken
further
away
from the tree, so as to lie over the root
cleve-
lopment where the water is required
as shown
in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.6 Branches and twigs overhanging
a bank or
roadway should be sawn or looped off sufficient-
ly to give a clear headway of 4 m above the road
or bank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.13 All trees
should,
however,
be carefully
watched and any bad effect noticed
should be
immediately
attended
to.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.7 Young plants should not be put out in the
shade
line until they have attained a height of
.at least l-25 m. It is better to lose a few plants<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9 REGULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 No  leakage should be permitted
through
the
heads of canals that have been closed, as a little
water
dribbling
down a canal
promotes
the
growth of grass and weeds in the bed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2  When a canal is first opened after clearances
a low supply should be run, for a few hours and
the gauge then
gradually
raised
according
to
requirements.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.5 No regulator
should be planked
up higher
than is necessary for regulation,
or kept planked
up after the necessity no longer exists.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.1  The gates at the cross regulators
should
be lowered
only after
the parent channel
has
been run for sometime.
The
lowering
of gates
should be to the~extent
necessary to
create the
designed pond level. The down stream
of the
parent channel should not be kept dry with full
pond
level upstream
of the regulator
unless
conditions
require the same and the structure is
designed for it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If there is no structure
in a considerably
long reach, the full supply level should be mark-
ed on profile walls specially constructed
for this.
