Sectional Committee, CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by. the Bureau of Indian Standards on
21 December 1989, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Apart from the requirements regarding design, materials, process of manufacture,
dimensions,
&ape. workmanship, finish, etc, acceptability of a product is determined by the results of various
tests to evaluate the properties stipulated in the relevant specitlcations.
This standard lays down
the procedure for testing of reinforced concrete as well as prestressed concrete po!es for street
lighting, overhead electric power transmission, traction and telecommunication
lines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the test specified in this standard, inspection of the process of manufacture and the
quality of the finished poles and other tests for the quality control of materials during manufacture,
shall becarried out in accordance with the requirements of relevant specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard war first published in 1966. In this revision, the test for torsional strength has been
deleted since this test is not considered necessary for poles.
In addition,
the length of straight
rope
required
to apply the load on the pole has been modified and the provision regard-
ing tlxing of the pole in conformity with the type of f+ndation
to be used has been deleted.
The
figure illustrating the testing arrangement has also been modified in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the committee responsible for the preparation of this standard is given in
Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
covers
methods of test
for
concrete
poles
for
street
lighting,
overhead
electrical power transmission,
traction, telephone
and telegraph lines, to evaluate
the properties
stipulated in the relevant speciEcations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pole may be tested in either
horizontal
or
vertical
position.
If tested
in the horizontal
position,
prpvision
shall be made by suitable
supports
to compensate
for the
overhanging
mass of the pole.
For this purpose,
the over-
hanging portion of the pole may be supported
on a movable trolley
or si-milar device.
The
frictional
resistance
of the supporting
devices
should be separately
determined
and deducted
from
the
Enal
load
applied
on
the
pole
( see 6.2.5 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2  INSPECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The materials to be used, processes of manu-
facture,

otherwise
specified
in the relevant
specification
or agreed to between the manufac-
turer
and the purchaser,
the purchaser
or his
representative
shall have, at all reasonable times,
free access to the place of manufacture
of the
poles For the purpose
of examining,
sampling
and testing the materials and for inspecting the
process of manufacture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Test Equipment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  A schematic drawing of the test equipment
and full layout for conducting
tests is shown in
Fig. 1. The butt
of the pole shall be rigidly
clamped by concrete cribs or similar rigid device9
in such a manner
that
the- clamped
len’gtl
of the pole shall be equal to the minimum
depttl,
of planting specified
in the relevant
standards:
The crib shall check all longitudinal
and roti
tional motions of the clamped
portion
of the
pole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4’ GENERAL PRECAUTIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Unless otherwise
specified
in the relevant
speciEcation for the pole being tested,
tests on
poles shall not be carried out earlier than 28 days
after the date of manufacture
for poles manufac-
tured from 33 grade ordinary
Portland
cement,
Portland
pozzolana
cement
or
Portland
slag
cement
and not earlier
than
14 days after the
date
of manufacture
for
poles
manufactured
from rapid-hardening
Portland
cement
and 43
grade and 53 grade ordinary
Portland
cement.
The test specimens shall not have been exposed
to a temperature
below 4°C for 24 hours
imme-
.  diately preceding the test and shall be free from
all visible moisture.
The specimens
shall be
inspected and any specimen
with visible
flaws
shall be discarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.1 The
pole
shall
be fixed
in the
crib
longitudinally
from butt to its ground
line  and
then it shall be secured firmly in place,
Wooden
saddles
with concave surfaces and other
pack-
ings shall be placed around the pole
to prevent
injury to the butt section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2 To minimize vertical movement at the point
of load application
and to reduce
the stress*
due to dead mass of the pole, a suitable
number
of frictionless
supports
in the form
of trolIies
shalI be provided
between
the ground line and
the point of applicatioii
of the load.
Support
shall be such that
any friction
associated
with
the deflection bf pole under load. shall not be a
significant
portion
of tthe
measured
load
on
the pole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 If any test specimen
fails because of mecha-
nical reasons, such as, failure of testing
equip-
ment or improper
specimen preparation,
it shall
be discarded and other specimen taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3  Loading
The load shall be applied
at a point
stipulated
in the relevant
Indian
Sandard
by means of a
suitable device, such as, a wire rope  t  and win&
placed in a direction
normal to the direction
of,
the length. of the pole so that
the minimum
length of the straight rope under pull is not less
than the
length
of the pole.

or
other load measuring devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>device is set sufficiently far away from
the pole
to make the angle between the initial and final
positions
of pulling line small,
the
error
in
assuming that the pull is always perpendicular
to
the original direction
of the pole axis will be
negligible.
The pulling line shaII be kept level
between the pulling device position and the point
where load.is applied to the pole. The load shall
be applied at a constant rate of 4 percent of the
specified test load per minute and in accordance
with 6.3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.6  De$ection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The deflection of the pole and the load applied
shall be measured
simultaneously
at different
stages of loading to provide at least five *sets of
readings.
The measurement
of deflection of the
load point
shall be made in a direction
per-
pendicular to the unloaded
position of the pole
axis.
The
arrangement
for
measuring
the
deflections is shown in Fig. 1. The measurements
shall be made correct
to the nearest
5 mm by
the use of a measuring scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.4  Pulling Line<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pulling line shall be secured around the pole
at the load point.
Load measuring device shall
be placed in a way so as to accurately
measure
the tension in the yufling line, the other
end of
which is attached to the loading equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A datum
line shall be established
from which
the movement of the ground line, if any,
shall
be measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.5  Load Measurement
6.3 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6-3.1 Load
shall
be
applied
as
mentioned
in 6.2.3 and shall be steadily and gradually in-
creased to the design value of the transverse load
at first crack. The deflection at this load shall be
measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dynamometer
or any other
satisfactory
method
of load measurement
capable of measuring
load
to the accuracy of 50 N may be adopted.
The
dynamometer
or other
load measuring
device
shall be calibrated
at’ regular
intervals.
The
load measuring
device
shall be supported
in
such a way that it should record
only the load
applied to the pole and th.,t no damage is caused
to the instrument
if the i.ole suddenly breaks
under test. The fricticaal resistance of supporting
devices and the rope line pulleys shall be sepa-
rately
determined
and
necessary
corrections<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deflection
at any other test load shall be med-
sured
according
to the
requirement
of
the
relevant specification for the pole being tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The load
shall then be reduced
to zero and
increased
gradually to a load equal to the first
