<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
(  First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Environmental
Protection
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Calcium is a major constituent
of various types of rock.
It is one the most common constituents pre-
sent in natural waters ranging from zero to several hundred
milligrams
per litre depending
on the
source and treatment
of the water.
Calcium is a cause for hardness
in water and incrustation in
boilers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard supersedes
33 of IS 3025  :  1964 ‘Methods of sampling and test ( physical and chemi-
cal ) for water used in industry’ and 5 of IS 2488 ( Part V > : 1976 ‘Methods of sampling and test for
industrial effluents, Part V’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard, considerable assistance has been derived from Standard Methods
for the Examination
of Water and Wastewater;
published by the American Public Health Association,
Washington, USA, 16th edition, 1985.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analy-sis, shall be rounded off in
accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised ).
The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE
5.2 Interference<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under
conditions
of this test,
the
folIowing
concentrations
of ions cause no interference
with
the calcium
determination
:  Copper,
2  mg,‘~;
ferrous
iron, 20 mg!  1;  ferric iron,
20 mgil;
manganese,
IO mg/l;
zinc, 5 mg,il; lead, 5 mg/l;
aluminium,
5 mg,il and tin 5 mg/J.
Orthophos-
phate precipitates
calcium at the pH of the test.
Strontium and barium give a positive interference
and alkalinity in excess of 300 mgil may cause an
indistinct end point in hard waters.
The following
Indian
Standards
are necessary
adjuncts to this standard  :

<<HEADING level=3>>This  standard prescribes following three
methods

of calcium:<<HEADING_END>>

Any of the following indicators shall be used.

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.4.1  Mureside  (ammorlilirn  purpurate  ) indicator
solutiorz<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This indicator changes from pink to purple at the
end point.
An indicator solution can be prepared
by dissolving
150 mg of the dye in IUu g of
absolute
ethylene glycol.
Water solutions of the
dye are not stable for longer than a day.
A
ground mixture
of the dye powder and sodium
chloride
provides a stable form of the indicator.
It is prepared by mixing 200 mg of murexide with
100 g of solid sodium chloride
and grinding the
mixture
to 300 to 425 microns.
The titration
should be performed
immediately
after the addi-
tion of the indicator
because it is unstable under
alkaline conditions.
End
point
recognition
is
facilitated
by the preparation
of colour compa-
rison

<<PARAGRAPH>>5 EDTA TITRIMETRIC
nlETHOD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Principle<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In a solution containing both calcium and magne-
sium, calcium
can be determined
directly
with
EDTA ( ethylenediamine
tetra-acetic
acid or its
salts ) when the pH is made su,%ciently high ( 12
to 13 ) so that
the magnesium
is largely
preci-
pitated as the hydroxide and an indicator is used
which combines, only with calcium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_4>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Is 3025(Rut40):1991<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>hydroxide solution, 0.2 g of solid indicator mixture
(or
1 to 2 drops if a solution
is used ), and
sufficient standard
EDTA
titrant
( O-05 to 0’10
ml ) to produce an unchanging &our.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.1  Pretreatment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mix the sample and transfer a suitable
volume
( 5u to
1OO ml ) to a beaker.
Add 5 ml of
concentrated
nitric acid and evaporate
on a hot
plate at a slow boil to the lowest volume possible
( about
15 to 20 ml ) before
precipitation
or
salting occurs.
Add 5 ml of concentrated
nitric
acid, cover with a watch glass and heat to obtain
a gentle refluxing
action.
Continue heating and
adding concentrated
nitric acid as necessary until
digestion is complete as showa by a light-coloured
clear solution.
Do not let sample dry during
digestion.
Add 1 to 2 ml of concentrated
nitric
acid and warm slightly to dissolve
any remaining
residue.
Wash down beaker
walls and watch
glass with
water and then filter,
if necessary.
Transfer the filtrate to a lOO-ml volumetric flask.
Cool, dilute to mark and mix thoroughly.
Take
a portion of this solution for the determination
of
calcium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.4.2  Patton and Reeder’s in&ator solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This ‘indicator solution permits the direct titration
of calcium
in the presence
of magnesium.
It
produces a sharp colour
change from wine red to
pure blue at the end point.
It is prepared
by
mixing  I g  of Patton
and Reeder’s  (  Eriochrome
Blue Black R ) reagent
with
IO0 g of .sodium
sulphate or potassium sulphate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.5 Standard  EDTA Solution -
0’01 M.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dissolve 3’75 g of disodium ethylenediamine
tetra-
acetate,
dihydrate in water and make up to 1 000
ml in a volumetric
flask.
Standardise
this with
standard
zinc solution.
Pipette
out 25 ml of
standard zinc solution
in a 250-ml conical flask.
Adjust the pH to approximately
10 with buffer
solution.
Dilute to about
100 ml and add 3 to 4
drops of Eriochrome
Black T indicator solution.
This will give red colour.
Titrate
with 0’01 M
EDTA solution to a clear blue end point free from
violet tinge. This solution will be slightly stronger
than O.(,l M, dilute the solution to exactly 0’01 M
by adding calculated amount of water and recheck
the strength
by titrating
25 ml of standard
zinc
solution by exactly the same manner as mentioned
above.
This should consume
exactly 25’0 ml of
standard EDTA solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.2  Sample Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of the high pH used in this procedure,
the titration
should be performed
immediately
after the addition of the alkali and indicator.
Use
50 ml of sample or a smaller portion
diluted to
50 ml so that the calcium content is about 5 to
10 mg.
Analyse
hard
waters
with alkalinity
higher than 300 mg/l
CaCCa by taking a smaller
aliquot and diluting to 50 ml, or by neutralization
of the alkalinity with acid, boiling for one minute
and cooling before’beginning
the titration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively,
calcium solution
may be used for
standardization
of EDTA
subject to the availa-
bility of certifed calcium carbonate
according to
the method given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>55.3 Add 2’0 ml of sodium hydroxide
solution
or a volume
sufficient to produce a pH of 12 to
13. Stir.
Add 0’1 to 0’2 g of the indicator
murexide-sodium
chloride
mixture
selected
( or
1 to 2 drops if a solution is used ).
Alternatively,
approximately
1 g  of the mixture of Patton
and
Reeder’s
reagent and sodium sulphate
or potas-
sium sulphate may be used.
Add EDTA titratit
slowly with continuous stirring to the proper end
point.
Check the end point by sdding
I  to 2
drops of titrant
in excess to make certain that no
further colour change occurs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

METHOD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 This method is applicable
to the analysis of
dissolved calcium in raw and drinking water and
can be used for water having a calcium content
upto5c,mg,l.
A smaller volume
may be used
for samples containing higher concentrations.
In
general
nitrous
oxide,‘acetylene
flame should be
used if the composition
of the sample is complex
or unknown
especially for samples witn a high
content
of dissolved
matter,
or which contain
phosphate, sulphate, aluminium or silica.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
If the  concentration  of  calcium in  the  sample
is above 50 mg/l for air/acetylene
flame or 20 mg/l for
nitrous oxide/acetylene
flame, then appropriately
smaller
volume of the sample shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.2  Blank Test

Upon

This eliminates
the digestion period which is otherwise
required.
The solution must remain clear until boiling is
