FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian Standard
( Part IV ) ( Third Revision ) was adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 26 August
1976, after
the draft
finalized by the Civil Works Measurement
Sectional
Committee had been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
a very important
place
in planning
and
execution of any civil engineering
work from the time of first estimates
to final completion and settlement of payments for the project.
Methods
followed for measurement
are not uniform and considerable
differences
exist between practices followed by one construction
agency and another
and also between
various Central
and State Government
departments.
While
it is recognized
that
each
system
of measuiement
has to be
specifically
related
to the administrative
and financial
organizations.
within the department
responsible for work, a unification
of, the various
systems at technical
level has been accepted as very desirable,
specially
as it permits a wider circle of operation for civil en.gineering contractors
and
eliminates
ambiguities
and
misunderstandings
arising
out
of
inadequate understanding
of various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Among the various civil engineering
items, measurement
of building
was first to be taken up for standardization
and this standard
having
provisions relating
to all building works, was first published in 1958 a nd
was revised in 1964 and 1970.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the course
of usage
df this standard
by various
construction.
agencies
in
the
country,
several
clarifications
and
suggestions
for
‘modifications
were received
and
as a result
of study,  *  the Sectional
Committee
decided
that its scope, besides being applicable
to buildings
should be expanded so as to cover civil engineering
works like industrial
and river valley project. works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1200 (  Part IV )-1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  Since various trades are not related
to one another,
the Sectional
Committee
decided that method of measurement
for each trade as given
in IS  :  1200-1964*
be issued separately as a different
part, which will be
helpful to specific users in various trades.
This part covering method of
measurement
of stone masonry
applicable
to buildings
as well as civil
-engineering
works was, therefore, issued as a second revision in 1970.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 In the course of use of this standard in the past five years, based on
suggestions received, certain amendments
were issued to this standard by
the Sectional
Committee and the third revision has been prepared so as to
incorporate
such amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>,0.7 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the results of a measurement,
shall be rounded off in accord-
ance
with IS  :  2-1960t.
The number
of significant
places ‘retained
in
rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
