<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
standard
(Part 51) (First Revision)
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by Water Environment
Protection
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Chemical
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alkalinity
of water is its acid neutralizing
capacity.
It is the sum of all the titratable
bases. Alkalinity
is significant
in many uses and treatments
of natural water and wastewater.
The alkalinity
of many surface water is primarily
a function
of carbonate,
bicarbonate
and hydroxide
content.
It is taken as an indicator
of the concentration
of
these constituents.
Alkalinity
measurements
are used in the interpretation
and control
of water and wastewater
treatment
processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The technical
committee
responsible
for formulation
of IS 3025:1964
‘Methods
of sampling
and test (physical
and chemical)
for water used in industry’
had decided
to revise the standard
and publish
it in separate
parts.
This standard
supersedes
44 of IS 3025:1964
and is one among
the different
parts
being
published
under
IS 3025 series of standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerable

has been derived
from the following

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of this standard,
the definitions
given
in IS 7022 (Part
1) and 7022 (Part 2) shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1  Electrometric
Titrator<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Use any commercialpH
meter or electrically
operated
titrator
that uses a glass electrode
and maybe
read to
0.05 pH unit. Standardize
and calibrate
according
to
manufacturer’s
instructions.
Pay special
attention
to
temperature
compensation
and
electrode
care,
if
automatic
temperature
compensation
is not provided,
titrate at 25 + 5°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 GENERAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbonate,
bicarbonate
and hydroxide
contribute
to
the alkalinity
of water. When the total alkalinity
of a
water is due almost entirely
to hydroxides,
carbonates
or bicarbonates,
and the total dissolved
solids is not
greater
than 500 mgll, the carbonate
and bicarbonate
concentrations
as CaC03
may be calculated
from the
sample pH and total alkalinity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2  Titration
Vessel<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For conventional
sized electrodes,
use a 200 ml, tall-
form Berzelius
beaker without a spout. Fit beaker with
a stopper having three holes, to accommodate
the two
electrodes
and the burette.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

These

by the following
scheme,
where  P is,  phenolphthalein
alkalinity
and  T
is total alkalinity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9 CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  Calculate
phenolphthalein
alkalinity
by using the
volume
of acid used for phenolphthalein

the total

by
using
the
volume
of acid
used
for
bromocrcsol
green
end
point
or titrate
potentio-
mctrically
to pH 4.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 Select
the smaller
value
of  P  or  (T–P).
Then
,
carbonate
alkalinity
equals
twice
the smaller
value.
When
the smaller
value
is  P,  the balance
(T–2P)
is
bicarbonate.
When
the smaller
value
is  (T–P)
the
balance
(2P–T,I is hydroxide.
All results are expressed
as CaCOJ. The mathematical
conversion
of the results
is shown
in Table
1 (A modification
of Table
1 is
desirable
when  P is  greater
than  T).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 The results obtained
from the phenolphthalein
and
total alkalinity
determinations
offer a means
for the
calculation
of carbonate
and bicarbonate,
concen-
trations
as CaCO1.
The method
ascribes
the entire
alkalinity
to bicarbonate,
carbonate
and hydroxide
and
it assumes
the absence
of other (weak)
inorganic
or
organic
acids,
such as silicic,
phosphoric
and boric
acids.
It further
presupposes
the incompatibility
of
hydroxide
and bicarbonate
alkalinities.
Because
the
calculations
are made
on a stoichiometric
basis,
ion
concentrations
in the strictest sense are not represented
in the results,
which
may differ
significantly
from
actual concentrations
especially
at pH greater than 10.
