<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part VIII ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 22 March 1973, after the draft finalized by the Building Limes

Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Hitherto, methods of tests for assessing qualitative requirements of build-
ing limes were included in IS: 712-1964.
For facilitating the use of these
tests it has been decided to print these tests as different parts of a separate
Indian Standard.

<<HEADING level=3>>3.  TEST FOR  WORKABILlTY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Apparatna<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.1  The apparatus shall consist of a standard flow table and a truncated
conical metallic mould.
( Se6 Fig. 1 )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1d.l
The standard flow table ( SCG Fig. 1 ) shall consist essentially
of a horizontal smooth table top made of mild steel, ground and polished
on the surface.
The table top shall be 30 cm in diameter and 3 mm thick
mounted on a vertical shaft, which  can be  raised and then allowed to fall
freely by a cam, the fall being exactly 12.5 mm.
A cast iron rim 25 mm
square in cross-section and 300 mm external diameter shall be securely fixed
under the edge of the table top with 6 rivets spaced symmetrically apart.
Three circles having diameters of 70, 110 and 190 mm respectively shall be
engraved on the surface of the table and concentric with it.
The engraved
lines shall be filled with wax polished flush with the surface of the metal.
The length of fall shall be as de&red by a shoulder on the shaft coming in
contact with the top of the cast iron to steel body of the instrument, the
contact being, therefore, metal to metal.
The total mass of the moving part
( table top, loading rim, sh&, etc) flee to fall, shall be approximately 7 kg.
The mass of the body, with cam shaft and cam handle, etc shall be approxi-
mately 19 kg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.2
The flow table shall stand unattached in the centre of a brick,
stone or concrete pier at least 35 cm square, built on a firm foundation, and
upon which the base of the table shall stand firmly without any trace of
rocking or chattering.
The height of the pier shall be 80 cm and its top
shall consist of 5 cm thick sand-cement mortar ( 3  :  1 )
with its surface
finished smooth with a steel trowel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.3
The mould for preparing the test specimen shall consist of a
truncated conical mould of sheet metal with internal diameter of 40 cm at
its narrower end, an internal diameter of 65 cm at its wider end and 9-O cm
in height.
Its inside and the ends shall be smooth.
In addition, the ends
shall be plane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Preparation
of  Sample<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>33.1  In case of quicklime the putty shall be prepared in accordance with
3.2 of IS : 6932 ( Part VI ) - 1973*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2  In the case of hydrated lime, the lime putty shall be prepared by
thoroughly mixing the hydrated lime with an equal mass of clean water at a
temperature of 27 f 2’C, 24 hours before the subsequent operations.
A
convenient quantity of hydrated lime ,to be taken for this purpose shall be
500 g.
At the expiry of 24 hours the soaked material shall be thoroughly<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

A mixer of the type
given in IS  :  1625.1971*
shall be used for the  ‘  knocking up ‘, the material
being passed twice through this mixer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3
The specimen of material for testing shall be prepared by filling the
metallic motild specified under 3.1.13
such that no air bubbles or voids are
retained inside.
Before each test the mould shall be rinsed out with clean
water, allowed to’drain and shaken to remove superfluous water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4 The  lime putty prepared in accordance with 3.2.1 or 3.2.2, shall be
adjusted to standard plastering consistency, which shall be that indicated
by an average spread of the lower part of the lime putty to 11-O cm with a
permissible deviation of not more than O-1 cm, when subjected to one bump
on the standard flow table.
When first tested if-the consistency is too stiff,
more water shall be added, and if too wet, a small portion of the water shall
be withdrawn by placing the material for a short period on a clean absorbent
surface.
The test for workability shall then be carried out immediately as
described in 3.4:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Temperature for Testing -
The  temperature of the material under
test and of the flow table and immediate surroundings shah be maintained
at 27 f 2°C during the test.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1 The shaft and shoulder of the standard flow table shall be carefully
wiped clean and the shaft oiled with a few drops of thin mineral oil.
The
top of the table shah be clean and completely dry.
The cone of material
prepared in accordance with 3.2.3 shall be applied to the centre of the table
with the aid of the mould and the mould carefully withdrawn.
No substan-
tial amount of the material under test shall remain adhering to the interior
of the mould after removal.
Otherwise the test shall be invalidated and shall
be repeated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2 The handle of the flow table shall be turned steadily and evenly
at the rate of approximately one turn 2er second, without jerking or lingering
at any point in a revolution.
The average spread of the material shall be
determined by measuring three diameters at approximately 60” apart and
taking the average.
the material.
Care shall be taken to avoid any undue exposure of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5  Evaluation -
The  ,workability shall be estimated by noting the number
of bumps required to attain an average spread to 190 mm, the material
having
been
already
adjusted to #andard
consistency as indicated
under 3.2.4 by the spread after one bump to 110 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
