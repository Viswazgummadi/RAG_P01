FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part
XXX
) ( First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 October
1980, after
the draft
finalized
by the Soil and Rock
Mechanics
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The laboratory
vane shear test for the measurement
of shear strength
of cohesive
soils is useful for soils of low shear strength
of less than
about
O-5 kgf/cms.
This
test gives the undrained
strength
of the soil and the
undisturbed
and remoulded
strengths
obtained
are used for evaluating
the
sensitivity
of the soil.
This standard
was first published
in the year
1968.
This
revision
has been
prepared
to incorporate
revised
shape
of vane
found useful for this test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting
the result of a test of analysis
made
in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be.done
in accordance
with IS : Z-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
( Part
XXX
) covers
the
procedure
of conducting
laboratory
vane
shear
test
on
cohesive
soils of low shear
strength
for
determining
their undrained
shear strength.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Vane -
The vane shall consist
of four blades
each fixed at 90” to the
adjacent
blades
as illustrated
in Fig. 1. The
vane
should
not deform
under
the maximum
torque
for which
it is designed.

<<PARAGRAPH>>edge of the vanq blades shall be sharpened
having
an included
angle
of
90°.
The vane blades shall be welded
together
suitably to a central
rod,
the maximum
diameter
of which
should preferably
not exceed
2°5 mm in
the portion
of the rod which
goes into the specimen
during
the test.
The
vane should
be properly
treated to prevent
rusting and
corrosion.

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The apparatus
may be either
of the hand-operated
type or motorized.
Provisions
should be made in the apparatus
for the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fixing
of vane
and
shaft
to the apparatus
in such
a way that
the vane
can be lowered
gradually
and vertically
into the

specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fixing
the tube containing
the soil specimen
to the

of the
equipment
for which it should have suitable hole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Arrangement
for
lowering
the
vane
into
the
soil specimen
( contained
in  the tube fixed to the base ) gradually
and vertically
and for holding
the vane
properly
and securely
in the lowered
position.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Arrangement
for rotating
the vane steadily
at a rate
of approxi-
;;tellnL/60

the
rotation
of

<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A torque

<<PARAGRAPH>>A
set

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A typical form of the hand operated
apparatus
is shown in Fig 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The specimen
in the tube should be at least 37.5 mm in diameter
and
75 mm long.
Mount
the specimen
container
with the specimen
on the
base of the vane
shear
apparatus
and fix it securely
to the base.
If the
specimen
container
is closed
at one end it should
be provided
at the
bottom
with a hole of about 1 mm diameter.
Lower the shear vanes into the
specimen
to their full length
gradually
with minimum
disturbance
of the
soil specimen
so that the top of the vane is at least 10 mm below the top
of the specimen.
Note the readings
of the
strain
and torque
indicators.
Rotate
the vane at a uniform
rate approximately
0.1 “/s by suitably
operat-
ing the torque
applicator
handle
until the specimen
fails.
Note the final
reading
of the torque
indicator.
Torque
readings
and the corresponding
strain readings
may also be noted at desired
intervals
of time
as the test
proceeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Just after the determination
of the maximum
torque rotate
the vane
rapidly
through
a minimum
of ten revolutions.
The remoulded
strength
should
then
be
determined
within
1 minute
after
completion
of- the
revolution,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4. COMPUTATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  For vane testing instruments
that do not read
the torque
directly,
a
calibration
curve
to convert
the readings
to cm.kgf
of torque
shall
be
provided.
These
calibration
curves shall be checked
periodically.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Calculate
the shear strength
of the soil using the following
formula
:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S=shear
strength
in kgf/cms,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>T=torque
in cm.kgf.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  1 -
This formula
is based on the following
assumptions:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Shearing
strengths
in the horizontal
and vertical
directions
are the
same;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) At the peak value,
shear strength
is equally
mobilized
at the end
surface as well as at the centre;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The shear surface
is cylindrical
and has a diameter
equal
to the
diameter
of the vane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 2 -
It is important
that the dimensions
of the vane are checked periodi-
cally
to ensure that the vane is not distorted
or worn.<<HEADING_END>>
