F O R E W O R D<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part I) (First Revision) was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 20 November 1978, after the draft
finalized by the Alloy Steels and Special Steels Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Structural and Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Schedules for wrought steels for general engineering purposes
(IS : 1570-1961) was first published in 1961. On the basis of the
experience gained in the production and use of steels, the Sectional
Committee has decided to revise the standard and issue it in parts.
The other parts of the standard are as follows: *<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part II
Carbon steels<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part III
Carbon and carbon manganese free cutting
steels<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Part V

<<PARAGRAPH>>Part VI
Tool steels<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  The following major modifications have been made in this revision:
a) Steel designations have been modified in accordance with
IS : 1762 (Part I)-1974†. However, for the sake of easy
identification old designations are also given within brackets.
b) Grades St 39, St 44, St 47, St 52, St 58 and St 66 given in
IS : 1570-1961 have been deleted as the tensile ranges covered by
these grades are already available in grades St 37, St 42, St 50,
St 55 and St 63. A new grade St 70 has been added to cover the
values of tensile between St 63 and St 78.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1570 (Part I) - 1978<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Each grade of steel has been sub-divided into two sub-grades, one
with a low yield to tensile ratio and the other with a high yield to
tensile ratio. These ratios have been fixed after consulting the
relevant Indian Standards and ISO Recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  This schedule does not give limits for sulphur and phosphorus.
These have to be specified in the detailed specifications. The standard
ranges for sulphur and phosphorus and the method for designating
steel according to its sulphur and phosphorus content, steel making
practice and method of deoxidation is detailed in Appendix A for
information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  Although both yield and tensile values have been specified in
Table 1, the yield value should be ignored if the specification is evolved
on the basis of tensile strength. Similarly the tensile strength should
be ignored if the specification is based on yield stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.6  This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (January 1981).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This schedule (Part I) is applicable to carbon and low alloy steels
which are put into service in the hot-rolled, normalized or annealed
condition in the form of plates, sections, bars, forgings and tubes, when
the main criterion in the selection and inspection of the steel is either
the tensile strength or the yield stress which is used as a basis for
design. This schedule is not intended to be used as a standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF THE
SCHEDULE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  While preparing Indian Standards, or revising the existing
standards, steels listed in this schedule shall be selected. The<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1570 (Part I) - 1978<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>specification of mechanical properties different from those given in
this schedule should not be made unless special conditions of service
render this essential. In that event, full reasons for the proposed
departure from the steels specified in this schedule shall be submitted
to the Alloy Steels and Special Steels Sectional Committee, SMDC 19,
and its approval obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  In the case of steels belonging to this schedule it is not usual to
specify a detailed chemical composition, but the quality of the material
is controlled, where necessary, by specifying the maximum permissible
percentage of sulphur and phosphorus. Since different levels of
sulphur and phosphorus are required according to the severity of the
conditions in service, limits for these elements are not included in the
schedule, but should be specified in a specification at levels
appropriate to the method of steel production, conditions of service,
etc. Where necessary, the type of steel, for example, killed, semi-killed,
etc, should be included in the standard. In the case of killed and
semi-killed variety of steel, it would be necessary to specify the silicon
content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Where special factors, such as weldability, are involved, it may be
desirable to include a maximum limit on the carbon content in the
specification. In some structural steels, copper content is found to be
beneficial for increasing resistance to corrosion and, in such cases, this
should be specified in the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  In addition to the tensile and yield stress, values for the specified
minimum percentage elongation, corresponding to the standard tensile
ranges, are given in Table 1. These elongation values are based on a
gauge length of 5.65
which is now internationally accepted. If test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pieces of other than 5.65
gauge length are used, elongation
conversions may be obtained from IS : 3803-1974*. For tensile tests on
tubes, the specified percentage elongation should be based on the
formula of 950 divided by the actual tensile strength when using a
gauge length equivalent to 5.65
or of 1 100 divided by the actual<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>NEW SYSTEM OF DESIGNATION OF STEELS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-0. GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-0.1  The new system of designation of steel is based on the draft ISO
proposal submitted by India to ISO/TC 17 ‘Steel’ for formulation of an
international standard. Details of the new designation system are
given in IS : 1762 (Part I)-1974*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-1. STEELS DESIGNATED ON THE BASIS OF MECHANICAL
PROPERTIES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.1  These steels are carbon and low alloy steels where the main
criterion in the selection and inspection of steel is the tensile strength
or yield stress. In such cases, provided the specified mechanical
properties are attained it is not usual to specify a detailed chemical
composition but the quality of the material is designated, where
necessary, by specifying certain quality levels. Steels listed in this
Schedule, Part I fall in this category.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The designation of these steels consists of the following in the order
given:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Symbol ‘Fe’ or ‘FeE’ depending on whether the steel has been
specified on the basis of minimum tensile strength or yield
strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Figure indicating the minimum tensile strength or yield stress in
N/mm 2 . If no minimum tensile strength or yield stress is
guaranteed, the figure shall be 00.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
