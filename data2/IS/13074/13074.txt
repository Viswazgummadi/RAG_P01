<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This  Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Flooring,
Wall Finishing
and Roofing
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
has been formulated
with a view to provide guidance for preparation
of base, for
laying and maintenance
of bitumen mastic flooring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
shall be read in conjunction
with IS 13026  :  1990 ‘Specification
for bitumen mastic
for flooring for industries handling
LPG and other
light
hydrocarbon
products’,
IS 8374  :  1977
‘Specification
for bitumen
mastic,
antistatic
and electrically
coducting grade’ and IS 1196  :  1978
‘Code of practice for laying bitumen mastic flooring’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the purpose
of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised
)‘.  The number
of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
lays
down the procedure
for
laying
bitumen
mastic
flooring
for industries
handling
LPG  and
other
light
hydrocarbon
products.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 Laying<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.1  Transport of Molten Material<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The molten mastic shall be carried in flat mortar
pans.
The pans are sprinkled
with lime stone
dust, to prevent sticking
of mastic.
Grease or
oil shall not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The
Indian
Standard
IS
13026  :  1990
‘Specification

is a necessary
adjunct
to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.2  Spreading<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 DESIGN CONSlDERATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen mastic should
be laid in bays in one or
more
layer.
The
specified
thickness
be
maintained
by
suitable
hand
tools,
gauges,
straight edges, band levels, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Bitumen
mastic is jointless
and impervious
to the transmission
of moisture.
In designing
the bitumen
mastic
flooring
for hydrocarbon
services,
consideration
shall be given to the
anticipated
service
conditions
as specified
in
IS 13026 : 1990.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2.1 The bubbles formed during laying should
be punctured
and the area rectified while mastic
is hot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2.2 Multi-layer
work
should
be treated
in
same manner as that of single-layer,
care being
taken to arrange
that the joints
in successive
layers are staggered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 THICKNESS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The total thickness
to which bitumen mastic
should be laid shall be 20 mm to 25 mm or as
mutually agreed upon by both parties depending
on actual conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.2.3  Protection
of  the  surface<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The laid surface shall be protected
from damage
due to movement
of heavy
load, spillage of oils,
etc.
Bitumen mastic surface should not be used
for preparation
of cement
concrete
mixes
or
mortars.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 MATERIAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Bitumen mastic shall conform to the require-
ments given in IS 13026  :  1990.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The bitumen mastic may be delivered
to the
site in the molten state and immediately
laid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.2.4  Opening to tra@c<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mastic flooring
should
not be opened to
traffic
until the material
has cooled
down to
ambient
temperature
of
the
surrounding
atmosphere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 EQUIPMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 The equipment
shall
consist
to bitumen
boiler,
a mechanically
agitated
mastic
cooker
and other accessories.
The equipment
shall be
used near the site, so as to prevent cooling of
the molten material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 REPAIRS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Damaged
area shall be cut rectangular
and
replaced with new mastic. Blow lamp techniques
to remove damaged layer are preferred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9 MAINTENANCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  The bitumen
mastic
flooring
