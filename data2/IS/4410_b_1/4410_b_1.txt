<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part
XI/SW
1 ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 24 February
1972, after the draft finalized
by the
Terminology
Relating
to River
Valley
Projects
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.
0.2 A number
of Indian
Standards
has been
published
covering
various
aspects of river valley projects
and a large number
of similar
standards
is
in the process
of formulation.
These
standards
include
technical
terms,
the precise definitions
of which
are required
to avoid
ambiguity
in their
interpretation.
To acllirvc
this, the Institution
is bringing
out  ‘  Indian
Standard
Glossary
of terms
relating
to river valley

which is being published
in parts.

The other parts of this standard
so far<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Part XI covers the important
field of hydrology
which
is a separate
science
by itself.
In view of the vastness of the subject,
it is proposed
to
cover
the subject
in different
sections.
Section
1  covers general
terms.
Other
sections in the series will be the following:
Section
2
Precipitation
and run off
Section
3
Infiltration
and water
losses
Section
4
Hydrographs
Section
5

Section
6

Section
7
Discharge

Section
8
Quality
of waters
0.4 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in
different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in
this country.
This has been met by deriving
assistance
from the following
publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
