<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard (Part VII) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 22 March 1973, after the draft finalized by the Building Limes
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Hitherto,
methods of tests for. assessing qualitative requirements of.
building limes were included in IS  :  712-19f54.
For facilitating the use of
these tests it has been decided to print these tests as different parts of a
separate Indian Standard.
This part covers determination of compressive
and transverse strengths of building limes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this
standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it
shall be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960+.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.1
Six
test specimens each 2.5 cm square in cross-section and
l@O cm in length shall be prepared using the standard lime and mortar
specified under 3.1.
The mould used shall be an individual or gang-mould
of bronze or other suitable non-corrodible metal, and of internal dimensions
2.5 cm square and 10.0 cm long, the inner surface of the mould shall be
carefully machined to a tolerance off
0.002 cm and the mould shall be so
constructed that the specimens can be removed without the mould being
tapped.
The mould shall be well greased with petroleum jelly before use,
and shall rest on a well-greased non-corrodible plate during the filling
operations.
The mould shall be filled by hand, the mortar being pressed
in with the thumb, lightly tamped, and then smoothed off with two or three
strokes of palette knife.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.2
The filled mould together with its base plate and covered on
the top with a similar plate shall be stored for a period of 28 days undisturbed
in a suitable container in an atmosphere of at least 90 percent RH and at a
temperature of 27 f 2°C.
A record shall be made of the temperature of
storage on at least 24 days of the 28 days period.
The maximum and
minimum temperatures shall be read from time to time, in order to check any
possible wide variations of temperature that may have occurred whilst the
apparatus was not under direct observation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

They shall be then removed and tested
The specimens to be tested shall rest
symmetrically on their sides on two parallel metal rollers 4 cm in diameter
and spaced at 80 cm centres.
The load shall be applied through a third
parallel roller of the same size at a point midway between the other two.
No packing shall be used between the rollers and the specimen.
The load
shall be applied streadily and uniformly, starting from zero, and increased
at a rate of 15 kg/r&

The modulus of rupture of the specimen is obtained by the
formula:
t=kP
.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where  t is  the modulus of rupture,  P  is the total load and  k  is a factor.
The
value -of  k  .is equal to O-768 when the modulus of rupture is expressed in
kg/cma,  P  in kg and the dimensions of the specimen in cm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.3.2
The average of the 6 test specimens shall be taken as the modulus
of rupture of the mortar and the result shall be expressed in kg/cma.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Compressive Strength<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1  Preparation of Test Specimens -
Twelve cubes with side 5.0 cm shall
be prepared from standard lime-sand mortar specified under 3.1 using
bronze or other non-corrodible metallic moulds which shall be so designed as
to prevent spreading during moulding.
The inner surface of the moulds
shall be carefully machined
to a tolerance
of f 0.002 cm and the
moulds shall be so constructed that the specimens can be removed without
tapping them.
The moulds shall be filled by hand, the mortar being pressed
in with the thumb, lightly tamped, smoothed off with two or three strokes
of the trowel or palette knife stored undisturbed in a suitable container for a
period of 72 hours in an atmosphere of at least 90 percent RH and at a
temperature
of 27 & 2°C.
After the expiry of this period the specimens
shall be taken out of the moulds and placed in the air in the laboratory
for 4 days.
When 7 days old, the specimens shall be immersed in clean
water and left there until just prior to testing for its strength in the testing
machine.
The water shall be renewed every 3 days and maintained at a
temperature
of 27 f 2°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
Procedure -After
7  days of storage in water ( and in the case of
Class B limes, under moist sand ) 6 of the cubes shall be taken out of water,
wiped surface-dry and tested for compressive strength in a compression testing
machine.
This gives the strength at 14 days.
Those faces of the cube
specimens which when moulded were in contact with the sides of the mould
shall be placed in contact with the surface through which load is applied.
There shall be no packing between the cube and steel platens of the testing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

One of the platens shall be carried on the ball and shall be self
adjusting.
The load shall be steadily and uniformly applied, starting from
zero increasing
at the rate of 15 kg/min.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2.1
The remaining 6 test specimens shall be taken out after 21 days
and similarly tested thus determining the compressive strength at 28 days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.3
Evaluation and Rebort of Test Results -
The crushing load divided
by the area over which the load is applied denotes the compressive strength
of the mortar.<<HEADING_END>>

The average strength of the six specimens shall be taken as the
compressive strength of the mortar and the result expressed in kg/cm:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
