INSTALLATION AND OBSERVATION OF
BASEPLATES FOR MEASUREMENT OF
FOUNDATION SETTLEMENT IN
EMBANKMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on  16 September 1976,  after  the draft finalized by the Hydraulic Structures
Instrumentation
Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.
0.2 Foundation
settlement
( baseplate ) apparatus
are installed on the
foundation under dams and embankments to permit measurements of verti-
cal settlement
of the foundation
during construction
and later during
operation.
This type of apparatus generally is used where the height of
the dam or embankment
is relatively low and whece the foundation
is
unconsolidated
sand, silt, or clay material.
This installation is similar to
the cross arm installation for measurement of internal vertical movement in
earth dams ( sbs IS  :  7500-1973” )
For the choice and location of instru-
ments  in earth dams reference may be made to IS  :  7436 ( Part I)-1973t.
An electrical probe with PVC casing pipe as described in IS  :  7500.1973*
may also be used for the baseplate installation.
The pipe system installed
fir the  baseplate system can be usefully utilized for measurement
of the
water level, if any, at that point.
0.3 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international coordination among the standards and practices prevailing in
different countries in addition to relating it to the practices prevailing in
this field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
For the  purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of  a  test,  shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS  :  2-19603.
The number  of  significant  places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard gives the details of the installation and observation of
baseplate apparatus for observing foundation
settlement
of dams
and
embankments resting on soil strata.
For the purpose of this standard the
word embankment includes earth and rock-fill dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. EQUIPMWT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 conm~~sl0f~InstaRatioss<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1 The  foundation settlement apparatus consists of a baseplate placed
on the foundation excavation
line and a vertical column of steel pipes
( seu Fig. 1 ). The apparatus comprises a base section of 50-mm steel pipe,
a erossarm
measuring
unit ( baseplate ), and anchor crossarm and an
extension of 50-mm pipes to the surface of the embankment.
2.1.2  Bass Section -The
base section is made of two pieces of  50-mm
pipe, one 600 mm long and one 1500 mm long, joined by a pipe coupling.
A p&orated
latchin
these two sections 0 5!
plate ( w Fig. 2 ) is inserted into the coupling between
pipes.
2.143  Basc~iate -
The baseplate is a modified crossarm with two 300  x
375 mm  steel plates welded to the base of a 75-mm channel section.
The
base-plate
unit is bolted and welded to a 40-mm
between lengths of 50 mm pipe in the system.
P
ipe which telescopes
Sett ement readings are
taken only on the baseplate
measuring
point which is the bottom of the
4O-mm pipe.
2.1.4
A&or  Crossam  -At
1 150 mm above the elevation of the baseplate,
an anchor crossarm  is  placed to prevent the vertical pipe column from
sliding down on the ba
late.
The anchor crossarm is a 1000 mm length
of 75-mm channel, bolte
“x and welded to a 1500 mm length of 50-mm pipe.
2.1.5
&tension Pipe -
To complete the installation, 1500 mm lengths of
50-mm pipe are joined by pipe couplings to extend the column of pipes to
the surface of the embankment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Each pipe section shall be placed in a

The operation of all heavy equipment should be prohi-
bited in the immediate vicinity of the installation when sections of the
apparatus are being placed.
Jf, for some reason, the upper surface of the
embankment in the vicinity of the installation is to be reworked before an
additional extension pipe is placed,
the installation shall be flaged or
marked so that it will not be damaged or displaced by earth moving
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4 Installation
in  Rockdee. Soils<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>$4.1
Bascplafs ( Fig. 5B ) -
The  centre of installation should be located
anda trench excavated up to foundation excavation
line.
The baseplate
unit should be placed and aligned over the base extension.
A pipe cover
should be placed on top of the 4O;mm pipe and the joints of the 40-mm
pipe with the base extension pipe at bottom and with the pipe cover at top
should be fitted with oakum and wrapped with burlap.
The trench and
the hole should,be backfilled with embankment material to the level of the
oakum joint at top.
The original elevation of the baseplate should be
noted by lowering the torpedo in the pipe by removing the temporary
pipe cover as described in 4.1 and the pipe cover replaced.
The backfilling
should then be continued up to 1000 mm above the level of the baseplate.
Embankment placement should then be continued.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2  Extetuh
pips and Anchor Crossann ( Fig. 5C ) -The
centre of the
installation should be located and a trench excavated up to the level of the
anchor crossarm.
A hole should be bored from the bottom of the trench
so as to locate the
ipe cover placed in operation described in 3.4.1.
The
pipe cover should
e removed and the 50-mm pipe with anchor crossarm
B
placed and aligned.
The hole should then be backfilled to 400 mm below
bottom of trench.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3
E&n&m of pipr  to Tipof Embankment -
The operations are similar
to those described in 3.4.2 except that no’trench is required to be excavated
as  no  crossarms are installed at higher levels,
However crossarms may be
installed at higher elevations so that it becomes a combined foundation
settlement and vertical movement device.
At the surf&e of the embank-
ment, rocky material should be placed
around the pipe extension and
concrete placed above so as to afford fixity to the installation ( see Fig. 5D ).
At’ the top of the last 50 mm ‘pipe a plug should be fitted to a 50-mm
coupling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

around the pipe should be continued
till it reaches a level 150 mm above
the pipe cover, leaving a depression around the pipe cover ( SM Fig. 6B ).
After the anchor crossarm unit is thus installed, the protective pipe cover
should
be removed
and the vertical alignment
of the system should be
checked by lowering a plumb bob.
If a deviation from vertical
alignment
is found,
an attempt
should
be made immediately
to correct the error.
If it is impracticable
to correct the error, succeeding
pipe sections should
be placed vertically and the offset from the true vertical alignment recorded.
Succeeding extension pipes should’be placed similarly by using 50-mm pipe
couplings ( SM Fig. 6C ) till the surface of the embankment
is reached.
At
the surface of the embankment,
rocky soil should be placed around the
pipe extension and concrete should be placed above so as to afford fmity to
the installation
( see Fig. 6D ).
At the top of the last 50-mm pipe a plug
should be fitted to a 50-mm coupling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Settlement readings shall be taken on the baseplate measuring
point
which i4 the bottom of the 40 mm pipe by means of the measuring torpedo
shown in Fig.. 3.
The elevation of the measuring point of the baseplate is
determined
by lowering the torpedo through the reading scale and into the
ipe
lp
system by means of the steel tape.
Pawls on the torpedo engage the
ower end of the 40 mm pipe (the measuring
point),. and upon reaching
the bottom of the installation and striking the latching plate, they latch in
a closed position to enable the torpedo to be withdrawn from the system.
When readings are made, the reading scale is attached to the top section of
the pipe
levehng
rejecting
from the existing installation.
The elevation
of the
p ate on top of the reading scale shall be established from a perma-
P
