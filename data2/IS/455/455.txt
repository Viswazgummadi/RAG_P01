<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Fourth
Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian Standards
on
30 October 1989, after the draft finalized by the Cement .and Concrete Sectional Committee
had been
approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Portland slag cement is obtained by mixing, Portland
cement clinker, gypsum and granulated slag in
suitable proportions
and grinding
the mixture to get a thorough and intimate mix between the consti-
tuents.
It may  also be  manufactured
by separately
grinding
Portland
cement
clinker, gypsum and
granulated
slag and then mixing them intimately..
The resultant
product
is a cement which has
physical
properties
similar to those of ordinary
Portland
cement.
In addition, it has low heat of
hydration and  is  relatively better resistant to soils and water containing excessive amounts of sulphater
of alkali metals. alumina and iron, as well- as to acidic waters, and can, therefore,
be ‘used for marine
works with advantage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manufacture
of Portland slag cement has been developed
primarily to utilize blastfumace slag, a
waste product from blastfurnaces.
The  development
of manufacture
of this type of cement
will
considerably
increase the total output of cement production
in the country and will, in addition, pro-
vide a profitable use for an otherwise waste product.
The slags obtained from other types of furnaces,
but having identical properties as those of granulated
blastfumace
slag conforming to this standard,
may also be used for manufacture
of Portland slag cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in  lb53  and subsequently revised in 1962,1967 and 1976. This fourth
revision incorporates
the modifications required as a result of experience gained with the use of this
specification and to bring the standard
in line with tlse present practices followed in the production
and testing of cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since publication of the third revision of this standard, large number of amendments have been issued
from time to time in order to modify various
requirements
based on the experience gained with the
use of the standard and the requirements
of the users and also keeping in view the raw materials and
fuel available in the country for manufacture
of cement.
The important
amendments include incorpo-
rating a value of 28 day compressive
strength,
increasing
the requirement regarding loss on ignition
from 4’0 to 5’0, increasing
the insoluble
residue content
from 2’5 to 4 percent, making
aumdave
soundness test compulsory,
incorpoiating
a provision for retest in respect of autoclave soundness
test
after aeration of the cement, incorporating
a clause on false set of cement and permitting
packaging
of cement in 25 kg bags.
In view of these large number
of amendments,
the Sectiolral Committee
decided to bring out the fourth revision of the standard
incorporating
all these amendments so as to
make it more convenient for the users.
The desirable requirements of granulated slag suitable for the
manufacture
of Portland slag cement have been deleted from this revision and reference has been made
to IS 12089  :  1987 ‘Specification for granulated slag for the manufacture
of Portland slag cement’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard contains
clauses 5.1 and 11.4.1 which permit the purchaser to use his option and clauses
6.5,9.2.1 and 9.3 which call for agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard considerable assistance has been rendered by National Corncil for
Cement and Building Materials, New Delhi as many of these modifications are based on studies carried
out by them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the committee responsible for the formulation
of this standard is given in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mass of cement packed in bags and the tolerance requirements shall be in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the  Standards of Weights and Measures ( Packaged Commodities  ) Rules, 1977 and,B-1.2
( see Annex B for information
).
Any modification
in these rules in respect of tolerance on mass of
cement would apply automatically
to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard
is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  r&vised )‘.
The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
