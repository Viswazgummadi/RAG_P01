FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
( Part I ) ( Second Revision ) was adopted by
the Indian Standards
Institution
on 25 November
1979,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee had been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard .was first published in 1962 and subsequently
revised in
1967.
The second revision is being published
under
the modified
title
‘Specification
for concrete
masonry
units  :
Part I Hollow
and solid
concrete
blocks’.
It is proposed
to bring
out Part
II
and Part III
subseq:,c rtly;
Part
11
covering
lightweight
concrete
masonry
units
( revision of IS  :  3590-1966*
) and Part III
covering
aerated
concrete
masonry units ( revision of IS  :  5482-1969t
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 This
standard
incorporates
significant
modifications
especially
with regard to the classification
of the blocks
and physical
requirements
such as dimensions,
compressive
strength
values, water absorption and
drying shrinkage.
Also in this version, apart from covering hollow blocks
of open cavity type, hollow blocks of closed cavity type-have-been covered.
Another distinct feature in this revision is that concrete masonry
units of
load bearing and non-load bearing category have been separately
treated
to the extent possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Concrete masonry, already extensively used in building
construction
abroad,
is likely
to make
very
considerable
headway
in this country
because of the many advantages,
such as durability,
strength
and struc-
tural stability, fire resistance,
insulation,
and sound absorption it possesses..
Concrete masonry constructron
is also economical
because of the following
aspects:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) The units are relatively
large and true in size and shape.
This
/
insures rapid construction
so that more wall is laid per man-hour
than in other types of wall canstruction;<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2185 ( Part I ) - 1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) -Fewer joints result in considerable
saving in mortar as compared
to normal
masonry
construction,
and also in increasing
the
strength of the wall; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The true plane surfaces obtained obviate necessity
of plaster
for
unimportant
buildings
situated
in low rainfall areas; even when
plaster is used for any reason, the quantity required
for satisfac-
tory coverage is significantly
small.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 Concrete masonry has an attractive
appearance
and is readily
adaptable
to any style of architecture.
It lends itself to a wide variety of
surface
finishes
for both
exterior
and interior
walls.
It may also be
finished with cement plaster, gauged withlime
or a plasticizer.
Concrete
masonry units provide a strong
mechanical
key,
uniting
the concrete
masonry backing and the plaster finish in a strong permanent bond.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Concrete masonry units are used for both load-bearing
and non-load
bearing
walls,
for partitions
and panel walls, as backing for other types
of facing material,
for piers, pilasters and columns,
for
retaining
walls,
garden
walls,
chimneys
and fire places,
as fillers in concrete joist floor
construction,
and as shuttering for beams, columns and lintels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 The hollow ( open and closed cavity ) and solid
concrete
masonry
units covered by this standard are made  with  normal weight aggregates
and are known as normal weight units.
The hollow load-bearing
concrete
block of the standard 400  X  200  x  200 mm size will weigh between
17
and 26 kg when made
with normal
weight aggregate.
Normal
weight
units are made with such aggregates as sand, gravel, crushed stones and
air-cooled
slag.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of ‘significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
( Part I )
covers
the
following
concrete

which
are
used in the construction
of load-bearing
and
partition walls:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Hollow ( open and closed cavity ) load bearing

concrete masonry units may be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) accelerating,
water-reducing
conforming to IS  :  9103-1979$,
and
air-entraining
admixtures<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) colouring pigments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where no Indian Standards
apply, the additives qr admixtures
shall
be shown,by test or experience,
to be not detrimental
to the durability of
the concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Mix<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  The concrete mix used for blocks shall
not be richer
than
one
part by volume
of cement to 6 parts by volume of combined aggregates
before mixing.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2 In
case
of hand-moulded
block
where
compaction
is done
inanually,
concrete
mix
should
be
sufficiently
donsistent
to enable
demoulding immediately
after casting. The consistency of the mix should
be such that it may cohere when compressed
in the hand without
free
water
being
visible.
Too little water causes the mix to be friable, while
too much
water
causes
difficulty
in the immediate withdrawal of the
mould.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.13  In case of machine-moulded
blocks,
the web markings on the
units as they come from the machine give a good indication as to whether
the proper consistency of concrete
has been used.
In addition
to the
grading of the aggregate and the quantity of cement, the amount of water
required f8r mix will depend to an extent
on the type of machine
on
which blocks are produced.
It is possible to judge the proper consistency
by squeezing a handful of concrete
mixture.
When
traces
of moisture
show on’ the outside of the squeezed mass it is usually considered to be
suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Mixing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1  Concrete shall normally be mixed in a mechanical mixer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1.1
Mixing shall be continued until there is a uniform distribution
of the materials, and the mass is uniform in colour and consistency.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.t.2
When hand mixing is permitted by the engineer-in-charge,
ir
shall be carried out on a water-tight platform and’care shall be faken to
ensure that mixing is continued until the mass is uniform in colour and
consistency.
Ten percent extra cement may be added when hand-mixing
is resorted to.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Placing
and Compaction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1 In the case of manual compaction,
the mixture
shall be placed
into the mould in layers of about 50 to 75 mm and each layer thoroughly
tamped with suitable tampers until the whole mould is filled up and
struck off level with a trowel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2
In the case of mechanical compaction,
the mould shall be filled
up to overflow, vibrated or mechanically tamped and struck off level.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-6.3.3 After demoulding the blocks shall be protected
until they are
sufficiently hardened to permit handling without damage.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Curing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6,4.1
The blocks hardened in accordance
with 6.3.3 shall then be cured
in a curing water tank or in a curing yard ( see Note ), and shall be kept
continuously moist for at least 14 days.
When the blocks are cured in an
immersion tank, the water of the tank shall be changed at least every
4 days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The curing yard is a paved yard subdivided by shallow drains in 4 to 5 m
square platforms which are provided with water fountains in the centre.
The blocks
are
stacked
on the platforms around the fountains, which work continuously.
The
fountains are connected
to an elevated water storage tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.2  Steam curing of blocks hardened in accordance with 6.3.3 may be
adopted instead of methods
speafied in 6.4.1, provided the requirements
of pressure or non-pressure steam curing are fulfilled.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Drying
-
After curing
the blocks
shall be dried
for a period
of
4 weeks before being used on the work.
They shall be stacked with voids
horizontal to facilitate
through passage of air. The blocks shall be allowed
to complete their initial shrinkage before they are laid in a wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  SURFACE
TEXTURE
AND
FINISH<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Concrete masonry units can bc given
a variety
of surface
textures
ranging
from a very fine
close texture to a coarse open texture by the
proper selection, grading, and proportioning
of aggregates at the time
of
manufacture.
Textures
may
also be developed by treating the face of
the units while
still
green
by wire brushing
or
combing,
by slightly
eroding
the surface
by playing
a fine spray of water upon it, and by
splitting ( split block ).
Colour may be introduced by incorporating
non-
fading mineral pigments in the facing concrete, or by applying a coloured
cement grout or paint to the face of the units soon after they are removed
from the moulds.
Selected coloured aggregates may also be used in the
facing and exposed by washing with water or dilute hydrochloric
acid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Well made concrete
masonry
may not require
plaster
in case of
unimportant
buildings in low rainfall areas; two or three coats of a cement
paint being sufficient to render it resistant to rain water.
If, however,
it
is intended to plaster concrete masonry, the block shall have a sufficiently
rough
surface
to
afford
a good key to the plaster.
Waterproofing
admixtures may be used for preparing the plaster.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-2.1 Measuring Apparatus -
A measuring apparatus shall be used
which incorporates a micrometre
gauge or a suitable dial gauge reading
accurately
to 0’002 5 mm.
This gauge shall be rigidly mounted in a
measuring frame and have a recessed end which may be located upon a
5-mm diameter ball or other reference point cemented on the specimen.
The other end of the frame shall have a similar recessed seating which
may be located
upon the other ball or reference point in the specimen.
An Invar steel rod of ‘suitable length with 5-mm diameter hemispherical
ends or with 5-mm iliameter
steel balls mounted on the ends, shall be
used as a standard of length against which readings of the gauge may be
checked,
thus enabling
corrections
to be made for any change in the
dimensions
of the apparatus between successive measurements of a test
specimen.
The apparatus shall preferably
be adjusted for specimens of
different lengths and Invar rod of lengths near to those of the specimens
to be tested shall be available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E~2.2 Drying
Oven -
The drying oven shall comply with the following
requirements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) It shall have an internal
volume equivalent
to not less than
8 litres per specimen, with a minimum total volume of 50 litres.
b) It shall be reasonably
air-tight and shall be provided with a fan
to keep the air circulating
effectively during the drying of the
specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) It shall be capable
of maintaining
a constant temperature of
50 f
1°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The relative humidity
ofthe
air in the oven shall be controlled
at approximately
17 percent by means of saturated
calcium
chloride solution.
Suitable dishes or trays containing this solu-
tion shall be
P
rovided
to give an exposed
area of solution not
less than 10 cm for each litre of volume of the oven.
The dishes
or trays shall contain
sufficient solid calcium
chloride to show

the surface
of the steel balls shall.be
wiped clean. of cement,
and dried and coated with
lubricating
grease to
prevent corrosion.
The specimens shall then be completely
immersed in
water for 4 days, the temperature
being maintained
at 27 f
2°C at least
for the last 4 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E-4. PROCEDURE
FOR TESTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-4.1  Immediately
after
removal
of the specimens
from the water, the
grease shall be wiped from the steel balls and the length of each specimen
measured
to an accuracy of 0’002 5 mm by the apparatus described
in D-2.1.
This shall be taken as the original wet measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE - The  instrument
reading required
is not the absolute length of the speci-
men but the difference
in length
between
the specimens
and an Invar
rod of
approximately the same length.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-4.2 The  specimens shall then be dried for at least 44 hours in an oven
of the type described in E-2.2, at the specified temperature
and humidity.
The specimens shall
then
be removed
from the oven and cooled for at
least
4 hours
in a desiccator
.containing
solid calcium
chloride or a
saturated
solution
of calcium
chloride.
Each
specimen
shall then be
measured as described in E-4.1, at a temperature
of 27 f
2°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-4.3
The cycle of drying, cooling and measuring shall be repeated until
constant length is attained, that is when
the difference
between
conse-
cutive
readings
separated
by a period
of drying
of at least 44 hours
followed
by cooling
for at least 4 hours,
is less than 0’005 mm for a
15 cm specimen
and  pro ruta  for a larger specimen.
The
final reading
shall be taken as the dry measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-4.4
During the above drying process
further wet specimen shall not be
placed~in the same oven and there shall be free access of air to all surfaces
of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E4.5
After
the dry measurement
has been
taken,
the length ~of the
specimen shall
be measured,
adjacent
to the steel balls, to the nearest
mrllimetre
and this shall be taken as the ‘dry length’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-5. CALCULATION
OF RESULTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-5.1
The ‘drying shrinkage’ shall be calculated for each specimen as the
difference between the ‘original wet measurement’
and the ‘dry measure-
ment’ expressed as a percentage of the ‘dry length’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>F-l.1
The
specimens
which
have
previously
been
used for the drying
shrinkage
test ( see Appendix  E )  shall after
the completion
of~that test,
be immersed
in water for 4 days, the
temperature
being
maintained

shall be determined
as the
difference
betiveen
the dry
and wet lengths
and expressed
as a
percentage
of the dry length for each specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-l.2
Should the
value
obtained
with
any one of the three
specimens
tested be greater
than the limit specified in 8.7, the test shall be repeated

which
-were
set aside.
In repeating
the
moisture
movement
test,
the
drying
shrinkage
