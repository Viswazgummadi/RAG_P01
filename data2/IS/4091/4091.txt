<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( First Revision)
was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on IQ August 1979, after the draft finalized by the
Foundation
Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2 Transmission line towers and poles are subjected to large horizontal
forces at the top,.thereby
causing overturning and/or uplifting of founda-
tion.
The design of foundations.for such structures involves special problems
and this standard has been prepared with a view to providing guidance to
the designer.
Often well foundations are used in river beds for which IS  :
39551967” may bc referred.
This standard was first published in 1967.
The revision has been done to bring in line with latest practice.
0.3 In the formulation of this standard due weightage leas been given to
international co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition  to  relating  it  to the practices in this field in
the country.
0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular reyuircment of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS  :
2-19607. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value
should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the design and construction
of concrete founda-

<<HEADING level=3>>5. GENERAL DESIGN CRITERIA<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General Design Criteria for Footings in Soils<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  Normally the following load(s) are given at the ground levels:
a) Downward load,
b) Uplift load,
c) Horizontal thrust, and
d) Overturning moments.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2 Inclined loads shall be split up into vertical and lateral loads at the
top of footings ( lateral load is also sometimes called a shear ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3 The uplift loads are assumed to be resisted by the weight if the
footing plus the weight of an inverted frustum of a pyramid of earth on the
footing pad with sides inclined at an angle of up to 30” with the vertical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3.1 A footing with an under-cut generally develops uplift resistance
of two to three times that of an identical footing without an under-cut (see
Fig. IA., Fig. IB and Fig. IC ).
However, for design putpose,’ the 2O”and
30” cone assumption shall be taken with a factor of safety of 1.00 for under-
cut footing, and 1.5 for footings without an under-cut.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3.2 A 30” cone shall be taken for an average firm cohesive material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3.3 A 20” cone shall be taken for non-cohesive materials, ruch as
sand and gravelly soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3.4 For footings below water table, submerged weight of the soil
shall be taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4 Alternative
footing
designs with or without under-cut should be
provided where field investigations have not been made to detcrminc the
feasibility of under-cutting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5 In enlarged footings without an under-cut where individual footing
is not provided under each leg and where a combination
of uplift loads
with lateral loads occurs, the suitability should be checked by the following
criteria:
a) The resultant of forces acting vertically and laterally should act
at a point in its base at a distance of one.sixth of its width from
the toes;
b) The weight of the footing acting at the centre of the base; and
c) Mainly that part of the cone which stands over the heel causes
a stabilidng
moment.
However, for design purposes, this may
be taken equal to half the total weight of the cone of earth acting
ovet the base.
It shall be assumed to act through the tip of the
heel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.6  Depending upon the relative magnitude of upward or downward
vertical loads, lateral load and overturning moment, footings in soil shall
be as classified in Table 1 according to their suitability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>51.7 Bored piles with enlarged bases usually provide an economical type
of footing in many soils where under-reaming is possible.
In expansive type
of soils such as black cotton soils, they have to be carried down to a depth
of 3.5 m in deep layers of these soils to counteract the effect of upthrust due
to swelling pressure introduced ‘in the soil. Normal type of independent
spread footing carried down to shallow depths will not be suitable in such
soils,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.8 Different types of piles can be used depending upon the location
and in case of heavy uplift forces and moments multiple under-reamed piles
or anchors may be used.
In case of loose to medium sandy Soils bored com-
paction under-reamed piles may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.9 The piles in uplift should be designed by the usual considerations
of the friction on stem and bearings on the annular projections.
A factor
of safety of 3 may be applied for safe uplift.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.10 The load carrying capacity of an under-reamed pile may bc deter-
mined from a load test as given in IS  :  2911 (Part
IV) - 1979*.
In the absence of actual tests, the safe loads allowed on piles under-reamed to
2.5 times the shaft diameter may be taken as given in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.10.1 The safe loads given in Table 2 apply to both medium com-
pact sandy soils and clayey soils of medium consistency.
For dense sandy
( N> 30 ) and stiff clayey ( N> 8 ) soils the loads may be increased by 25
percent.
However, the values of lateral thrust should not be increased
unless stability of top soil ( strata to a depth of about three times the stem
diameter ) is, ascertained.
On the other hand a 25 percent reduction should
be made in case of loose sandy ( N( 10 ) and soft clayey ( N94 ) soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.10.2  Load carrying capacity from soil properties
a) In case of clayey soils the ultimate load bearing capacity of an
under-reamed pile may be worked out from the following cxprcs-
sion:
Qll =  AP .Nc. C’p +  Aa NC C’a + C’a A’, + a Cs  .4#<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

These operations shall con-
form to IS  :  3764-1966$, and IS  :  4081-196711.
5.7.5 In case the footings under the same tower structure happen to rest
such that’some of them are in soil and the rest on rock then the consideration
shall be given for differential settlement and the structural safety.
5.7.6 In case of deviations in the alignment of the Iine, modifications
should be made in the design of foundations for towers.

<<PARAGRAPH>>7. POLES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 The foundation for poles is provided by a certain length of the pole
buried into the ground.
The bearing capacity in compression
is mainly
derived by the skin friction on the surface of the poles and to a smaller
extent by the base area.
Under the action of wind the lateral loading in-
troduces moments and lateral thrust ‘on the foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Depth of embedment of the pole for the purpose of foundation should
not bc less than one-sixth of the total length of the pole above ground level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
