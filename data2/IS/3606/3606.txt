<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft final-
ized by the Farm Implements and Machinery Sectional Committee had been approved by the Food and Agricul-
ture Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The disc harrow is a tillage implement used for the preparation of seed beds. The disc harrows drawn by animals
usually have six or eight discs fixed in two gangs each gang having three or four discs. The gangs are mounted
on a rigid frame on which a seat for the operator is provided. Often, these harrows have transport wheels to
facilitate their movement from one place to other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was originally issued in 1966 covering the general provisions of disc harrow and some specific
dimensions only for single action disc harrows. With the increase in use and manufacture of double action disc
harrows (offset type) and with the publication of Specification for agricultural tillage discs it was revised in 1972.
The revision of this standard has been taken up again to incorporate the requirements of plain spool which were
earlier covered in IS 7256  :  1974. With the publication of this standard IS 7256  :  1974 will be withdrawn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard assistance has been taken from ASAE S.290 ‘Determining the cutting width
and the designated weight of disc harrows’ issued by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers, USA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The trade and manufacturing practices prevailing in the country have also been kept in view while preparing this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS
2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised >‘.  The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standards listed in Annex A contain
provisions
which, through reference in this text,
constitute provision of this standard. At the time of
publication, the editions indicated were valid. All
standards are subject to revision and parties to agree-
ments based on this standard are encouraged to
investigate the possibility of applying the most
recent editions of the standards indicated there.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
