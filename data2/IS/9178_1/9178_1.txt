STORAGE OF BULK MATERIALS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>PART I
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND
ASSESSMENT OF LOADS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0 .
F O R E W O R D<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part I) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 15 May 1979, after the draft finalized by the Structural
Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved by the Structural
and Metals Division Council and the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Bins are known as silos if they have circular or polygonal shape in
plan. When square or rectangular in plan they are known as bunkers.
In this standard a bin shall mean both silo and bunker unless
otherwise stated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  The functions of bins as storage structures are very important in
power stations, fertilizer complexes, steel plants, cement plants and
similar industries for efficient storage and use of bulk material both in
granular and powdery form. On the agricultural front bins are used to
store food grains for ensuring their supply all through the year. Bulk
storage of materials in bins has certain advantages over other forms of
storage. Therefore an Indian Standard on this subject has been a long
felt need and this standard is aimed at giving the necessary guidance
in the analysis and design of steel bins for storing, various materials of
different characteristics and flow properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  Bins have been designed on the basis of Janssen’s Theory (with
modifications to the original). From experimental investigations and a
study of the performance of the existing bins it has been noticed that
the pressure distribution is influenced by the size and shape of the
material to be stored (that is granular or powdery), moisture and
temperature, bulk density, which in turn is affected by storage and
flow characteristics. Besides there is an increase in the imposed loads
during filling and emptying, the latter being more predominant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  For reasons mentioned above in the bins designed by conventional
methods, materials do not easily flow due to arching and piping. This
required frequent poking — manually, pneumatically, with steams or
by other mechanical means. With research data available, this
problem has been successfully solved by adopting mass flow or funnel<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9178 (Part I) - 1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>flow bins where the shape of the bin hopper and size of the openings
are based on the flow properties of the stored material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6  In order to deal with the subject in an effective manner this
standard has been prepared in three parts namely:
Part I General requirements and assessment of loads
Part II Design criteria
Part III Bins designed for mass flow and funnel flow
0.7  This standard keeps in view the practices being followed in the
country and elsewhere in this field. Assistance has also been derived
from the following publications:

<<HEADING level=3>>6. ASSESSMENT OF BIN LOADS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General  — There are three types of loads caused by a stored
material in a bin structure (  see  Fig. 2 ) :<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Horizontal load due to horizontal pressure (  P h  ) acting on the
side walls.
b) Vertical load due to vertical pressure (  P v  ) acting on the
cross-sectional area of the bin filling.
c) Friction wall load due to frictional wall pressure (  P w  )
introduced into the side walls due to wall friction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  For the purpose of computing bin loads the pressure ratio of
horizontal to vertical pressure may be assumed as given in Table 3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2  In this standard, Janssen’s theory has been used for the assessment
of bin loads and the values of  λ ,  δ  and  W  are assumed to be constant along
the bin height. The theory has been suitably modified wherever
necessary and with this the structural adequacy and safety are ensured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

from
Tables 2 and 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2  Homogenization  — In the case of homogenizing bin, the filling
consists of powdery materials which is circulated by compressed air for
mixing purposes. During homogenization of powdery materials the
lateral and vertical pressures depend upon the volume of the empty
space available in the upper portion of the bin. This may be kept about
40 percent of the total volume of the bin. The lateral and vertical
pressures shall be calculated using the following expression and
should not be less than pressure evaluated as in  6.2.1 :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3  Rapid Filling  — During rapid filling-material being filled at a
rate higher than the minimum filling speed-up to a certain height  Z n
from the top layer, the upper stored material flows like a fluid. The
following expression may be used for computing the governing lateral
pressures during rapid filling of a silo with a filling speed  v :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Rapid filling (  P h  ) = 0.8  W .  Z n
where<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Z n  = (  v  –  v o  )  t ;
v  = actual filling speed, m/h;
v o  = the minimum filling speed,  m / h ; and
t  = time laps of one hour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3.1  Application of the formula given in  6.3.3  is only for materials
filled at a rate more than the minimum filling speed for different
materials. For speeds lesser than the minimum filling speed, the
pressures in  6.2  shall apply. However, when the filling speed exceeds
the minimum filling speed, a check should be made for the maximum
pressure due to rapid filling from the greater values arrived at
according to the formula given in  6.3.3  and the values given in  6.3.1 ,
6.3.2 ,  6.3.4  and  6.6 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.4  Pneumatic Emptying  — During pneumatic emptying air under
pressure is blown inside the bin through a number of small holes located
in the bin walls near the bin bottom. This causes fluidization of the
material in the lower portion of the bin and gives rise to higher values
of  P h  and  P v  (both being equal). The lateral pressures during pneumatic
emptying shall be calculated using the pressure scheme shown in Fig. 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 Fermentation Bins  — In the fermentation bins the properties of
the material differ from the properties of granular and powdery
materials. The pressure varies with the content of water in the material
and stage of fermentation process. The loads shall be as given in Table 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1  All fermentation bins shall have clearly visible and permanent
mark indicating the class if silage is to be stored. In addition, class 1
and 2 bins shall be marked to indicate that the bins may only be filled
to halfway mark with silage which is one class wetter. There shall be
an outlet to prevent the liquid from standing higher than 1 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.6 Effects Causing Increase in Bin Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6.1  Arching of Stored Material  — Some stored materials are
susceptible to arching action across the bin walls. Frequent collapse of
such arches give rise to increased vertical pressures. The vertical
pressure on the bottom of the bin storing such materials shall be
assumed as twice the pressure,  P v , calculated as per  6.2.1.1  and
6.2.1.2  subject to a maximum of  WZ . However, this increased pressure
need not be considered when the bin is so designed to eliminate
arching.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6.2  Eccentric Emptying  — Eccentric emptying of a bin gives rise to
increased horizontal loads, non-uniformly distributed over the
periphery and extending over the full height of the bin. Eccentric
outlets in bins shall be avoided as far as possible, and, where they have
to be provided to meet functional requirements, due consideration
shall be given in design to the increased pressure experienced by the
walls. Unless determined by investigation the increased pressure may
be calculated as given in  6.6.2.1 . This increased pressure shall be
considered, for the purpose of design, to be acting both on the wall
nearer to the outlet as well as on the wall on the opposite side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6.2.1  The additional pressure  P h ’ shall be considered to act for the
full height of the bin and is obtained from the following formula:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P h ' =  P hi  –  P h<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P hi  = Pressure obtained on the wall of the bin imagined to be
enlarged in plan so as to make the eccentric opening
concentric, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P h =  Horizontal pressure on the wall due to stored material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P hi  and  P h  shall be obtained in conformity with  6.2.1 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6.2.2  The enlarged shape of the bin which is required for the purpose
of computation of the pressure  P hi  shall be obtained as shown in Fig. 6.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6.2.3  The effect of eccentric outlets may be ignored in design if the
eccentricity is less than  d /6 or the height of the bin is not greater
than 2  d .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6.3  Aeration of Stored Material  — When bins are provided with
equipment for ventilating the bin filling at rest, a distinction shall be
made between bins for granular material and bins for powdery material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6.3.1  When the material is granular an increase in the horizontal
pressure is to be expected. Therefore, the horizontal pressure  P h , as
calculated from  6.2.1.1 , for filling is to be increased by the inlet
pressure of the air over the portion of the height of the bin in which the
air inlets are located. From the level of the highest inlet upwards, this
increase in pressure may be tapered off uniformly down to zero at the
top of the bin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6.3.2  For powdery materials the investigations made so far do not
indicate any significant increases in load when ventilating.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6.3.3  Bins for storage of powdery materials are often equipped with
devices for pneumatic emptying and these bring about a loosening of
the bin filling in the region of the outlet. In this case also, no significant
increases in load due to the air supply have so far been detected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7 Effects Causing Decrease in the Bin Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.7.1  Bin Bottom  — In view of the load reducing effect of the bin
bottom, the horizontal pressure during emptying may be reduced up to
a height 1.2  d  or 0.75  h  whichever is smaller from the bin bottom. This
may be considered as varying linearly from the emptying pressure at
this height to the filling pressure at the bin bottom (  see also  Fig. 3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.7.2  Special Unloading Devices  — If a bin is fitted with an unloading
device which allows only the topmost material at any time to be
with-drawn (while the layers below remain at rest) there is no need to
take into account the excess pressure during emptying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. FLOW CORRECTING DEVICES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  Flow correcting devices are provided to ensure free and continuous
flow and to reduce or eliminate the excess pressure during emptying.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  Insert type of flow correcting device is usually used in existing
installations with hoppers from which funnel flow takes place and
which needs to be converted into a mass flow hopper or to reduce
tendency to form stable arches or pipes. Flow-corrective inserts help to
increase the live storage capacity and to reduce segregation problems
in bins having hoppers with funnel flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1  Insert type of flow correcting device may be used to correct two
types of flow problems. A large insert is placed (  see  Fig. 7A ) near the
transition between the bin and hopper to cause mass flow in the vertical
bin position. A small insert is placed (  see  Fig. 7B ) near the hopper
outlet to eliminate piping (rat-holing) and arching of bulk solids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2  The influence of the insert on the flow of materials and on the
structural stability of the bin wall should be considered while
designing the bins. The performance of the inserts and their influence
on the material flow depend on the stored material and the geometry
of the bin and hopper and should be experimentally investigated. The
support of the insert should not obstruct the flow but at the same time
should not fail under the loads that are applied to it. As a guide the
diameter  S  of the insert bottom shall not be less than three times the
annular width S’ (  see  Fig. 8 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.3  The material remaining in the bin for a period of time may result
in the formation of arches in the region of insert, and may require to be
vibrated to initiate the flow. The insert should, therefore, be so
designed as to ensure all round flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3  Poking devices may be incorporated in the bins for ensuring proper
flow. Poking may be manual, pneumatic with steam or using any
suitable mechanical means like vibrators.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-1.  The purpose of providing material handling facilities in bins is to
make the necessary arrangement for filling and emptying the
material. This has influence in both layout and design of bunkers in
that the loading and unloading arrangements have to be considered in
the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main equipments used for filling/emptying the bins are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Belt conveyor
b) Bucket elevator
c) Screw conveyor
d) Pneumatic elevator (pumping)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.  Many of the equipment mentioned above require to be supported
over the bunker with a suitable opening on the cover of the bunker.
The additional load thus transmitted to the bunker or its supporting
beams should be considered for design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.  Bins should be provided with bunker columns for proper
discharging of the materials. The arrangement may include the simple
devices like cast iron box with sliding doors operated by hand, by
bell-crank levers or by power or rotary valves or discharge gates or by
pneumatic methods. The load of the column and the arrangement of its
connection should be considered while designing bunkers and their
supporting frame.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
