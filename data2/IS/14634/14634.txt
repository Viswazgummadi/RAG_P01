<<PARAGRAPH>>Soil Quality and Improvement
Sectional Committee,
FAD 27<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Soil Quality
and Improvement
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Food and Agriculture
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The microbial
denizens
of soil play an important role in nutrient mobilization.
The nitrogen fixing blue-green
algae  (BGA) which commonly
occur in moist waterlogged
fields form an important
component
of the soil
micro-organisms
and have been held responsible
for the spontaneous
fertility
of rice soils.
Waterlogged
conditions,
high humidity and temperature
and diffused light under the crop canopy in paddy fields favour their
proliferation.
However, algalization
effect may vary depending on the region, rate of growth, stress compatibility
and sporulating
capacity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>BGA grow well in neutral to alkaline soils having pH range 6.5 to 8.5. They may also be grown in acidic soils
after proper liming.
The BGA inoculation
increases the availability
of nitrogen in the soil. They add organic
matter through the oxygen, liberating
process of photosynthesis
and their polysaccharidic
sheath binds the soil
particles.
These activities improve the physical and chemical properties of the soil which is reflected in the form
of reduced compaction
and oxidizable matter content. The hormone like substances excreted by the algae, enable
the crop plants to utilize more of the applied nutrients.
They show pronounced
supplementation
effect at lower
levels of fertilizer nitrogen.
Use of BGA may add 15 to 25 kg nitrogen/hectare/season.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The strains of BGA have to be selected on the basis of their stress compatibility,
growth and nitrogen fixing
capacity
response
to temperature.
Strains suitable for defined habitats and requirements
can be developed
through screening
of the natural populations.
Studies conducted under different agroclimatic
conditions
have
shown, That forms like  Aulosiru, Culofhrix, Scytonemu  and  Tolypothrix are  better suited for upland and rainfed
paddies.
Perpetually
waterlogged
rice crop responds
better
to inoculation
by  Anabaena,
Nostoc,
Cylina’rospermum  and  Hapalosiphon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A need was, therefore, felt to formulate Indian Standard on the subject stipulating code of practice for preparation
and application
of blue-green
algae as biofertilizer
in soils for the benefit of processers
and the users of the
product.
In preparation
of this standard considerable
assistance has been derived from the National Facility for
Blue-green
Algal Collections,
Indian Agricultural
Research Institute, New Delhi.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :
1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values  (revised)‘.
The  number of significant
places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

2.3.1.3  Fe-EDTA Stock Solution<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dissolve 26.1 g of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid
(disodium salt) in 268 ml of 1N potassium hydroxide
(56 g/l w/v) solution.
Make up the volume to 1 litre.
Aerate
the solution
overnight
to produce
stable
complex marked by the development
of dark brown
colour.
Make up the volume again to one litre. Gne
ml of this stock solution in 11 gives 5 ppm of iron.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Culture Maintenance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The selected algal strains will be maintaind
on agar
slants containing
appropriate
media in unialgal state.
The often used strains are maintained
in liquid media
also, for immediate
use in the process of inoculum
scale up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  Scaling Up of the Inoculum
Cool daylight,
40 watts fluorescent
tube lamps are
used to provide a light intensity of about 2 500 lux and
the temperature
is maintained
at about 30°C. Cultures
on agar slants
are more conveniently
maintained
in
15 ml capacity, backelite screw cap with rubber liner,
culture tubes.
Mother cultures in these culture tubes
are maintained
in the stock culture room at about
500 lux light intensity
and 20°C temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inoculation
of the raceways is done by using the scaled
up culture of the algae grown under growth room
conditions.
The ratio between
the volume
to be
inoculated
and the inoculum
should
be 10: 1. The
required amount of the inoculum
is produced
as per
the following flow chart:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Slant culture<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Culture Medium
Conical flasks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Aspirator bottles<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since
the nitrogen
fixing
blue-green
algae
are
photolithotrophs
and use the nitrogen
from the air,
simple inorganic medium without any nitrogen source
is employed
for maintaining
and growing
their
cultures. While the laboratories may develop different
suitable
media,
generally
the following
medium
is
used for purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Natural, transparent
glass carboys<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The culture in the carboys is allowed to grow under
controlled
conditions
mentioned
earlier
at 2.2 for
about 20 days or till it attains the optical density (OD)
of 0.6 at 550 nm. This culture is used to inoculate the
raceways.
Upto the aspirator bot,tle stage, the cultures<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_4>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 14634 : 1999<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>dried flakes are powdered to 200 mesh. This makes a
very good quality inoculum and 0.5 to 1 .O kg of this is
sufficient to inoculate one acre area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>are grown
in sterilized
medium
under
aseptic
conditions.
At the carboy stage, boiled water is used
for preparing
the medium.
All the cultures
under
laboratory conditions
are maintained
in unialgal stage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inoculum
so prepared
has the colony
forming
units cfu value of about 10 000/g of the inoculum
and
does not show any appreciable
loss in the cfu even
after storage for 2 years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 PROCESS
OPTIMIZATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Raceways<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Large scale multiplication
of the selected algae is done
in raceways lodged in a covered space. Each alga is
grown separately.
A raceway
is a shallow pond of
about 35 cm depth with round corners. The length can
be varied depending
upon the availability
of land but
the width should not be more than 3 m. The pond is
divided by a central wall, leaving
1 m space at either
ends.
In one of the channels
so formed is fitted a
paddle
wheel of appropriate
size, energized
by an
electric motor. This is used to agitate the culture in the
raceway so that it races through the channels.
This
ensures unifrom distribution
of the nutrients and light
through the culture and does not allow settling of the
algal biomass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5  Quality of the Inoculum<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality of the algal inoculum may be quantified
in
terms of colony forming units (cfu).
An ideal algal
inoculum
should have a cfu value of at least 10 000.
Shelf life of the inoculum shall also be declared by the
manufacturers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4  FIELD APPLICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The recommended
method of application
of the
algal inoculum
is broadcasting
on standing
water,
about 3-4 days after transplantation.
The following
care shall be taken during application
of BGA:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since the size of the inoculum
is too small to
ensure uniform distribution
over an area of one
acre, the inoculum can be mixed with clean and
sieved soil and then broadcasted.
Chemical fertilizers and algal inoculum should
not be mixed and applied separately.
After the application
of the algal inoculum,
the
field should be kept waterlogged
for about.
Heavily fertilized
rice fields generally
show
profuse growth of green algae which act as
weeds and also reduce tillering
in the rice
plants.
These can be differentiated
from the
blue-green
algae by their grass green colour
and fibrous nature.
The green algae turn dark
violet when treated with iodine but the blue-
green algae remain
unaffected.
The green
algae can be removed manually and burried in
a pit and if their growth is intense,
copper
sulphate @ 4.0 kg/ha may be used which will
selectively
kill the green algae.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lodging of raceways in a covered space ensures round
the year production
and provides protection
against
contamination
and attack
by the parasites
and
predators.
It also accelerates
the algal growth and
enables complete control on the growth conditions and
harvesting
of the culture at the desired growth stage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Growing Algae in the Raceways<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iv)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally,
in the raceways,
the nutrients
are used at
half the recommended
strength.
The culture
is
allowed to grow till it attains the optical density of
I .O to  1.5  at 550 nm. After this, daily harvesting of the
algal culture
is done by filtering
1110 of the total
volume of the culture in the raceway.
The culture is
filtered through cheese cloth and the filtrate is drained
back into the raceway.
The growth rate of the alga is
regularly monitored
as it tends to slow down with the
depletion
of the nutrients.
Whenever
needed,
appropriate
quantities
of the nutrients are added to the
raceway.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
