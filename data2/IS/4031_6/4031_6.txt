0.1  This Indian Standard (Part 6) (First
Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards on 10 March 1988, after the draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.
0.2  Standard methods of testing cement are
essential adjunct to the cement specifications.
This standard in different parts lays down the
procedure for the tests to evaluate the physical
properties of different types of hydraulic
cements.
The
procedure
for
conducting
chemical tests of hydraulic cement is covered in
IS : 4032-1985*.
0.3  Originally all the tests to evaluate the
physical properties of hydraulic cements were
covered in one standard but for facilitating the
use of this standard and future revisions, it has
been decided to print the different tests as
different parts of the standard and, accordingly
this revised standard has been brought out in
thirteen parts. This will also facilitate updating
of individual tests. Further, since publication of
the original standard in 1968, a number of
standards
covering
the
requirements
of
different equipment used for testing of cement,
a brief description of which was also covered in
the standard, had been published. In this<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>revision, therefore, reference is given to
different instrument specifications deleting the
description of the instruments, as it has been
recognized that reproducible and repeatable
test results can be obtained only with standard
testing equipment capable of giving desired
level of accuracy. This part covers the method
for determining the compressive strength of
hydraulic cement other than masonry cement
which is covered in Part 7 of this standard. The
criteria for accepting compressive strength
values has been incorporated and the use of
single graded sand has been deleted in this
revision.
0.4  This edition 2.3 incorporates Amendment
No. 1 (March 1993), Amendment No. 2 (March
2002) and Amendment No. 3 (Feburary 2003).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as
the result of incorporation of the amendments.
0.5  For the purpose of deciding whether a
particular requirement of this standard is
complied with, the final value, observed or
calculated, expressing the result of a test or
analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant
places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

cement and standard sand. Mix it dry with a
trowel for one minute and then with water
until the mixture is of uniform colour. The

6.2 Moulding Specimens
6.2.1  In assembling the moulds ready for use,
cover the joints between the halves of the
mould with a thin film of petroleum jelly and
apply a similar coating of petroleum jelly
between the contact surfaces of the bottom of
the mould and its base plate in order to ensure
that no water escapes during vibration. Treat
the interior faces of the mould with a thin
coating of mould oil.
6.2.2  Place the assembled mould on the table of
the vibration machine and hold it firmly in
position by means of a suitable clamp. Attach a
hopper of suitable size and shape securely at
the top of the mould to facilitate filling and this
hopper shall not be removed until the
completion of the vibration period.
6.2.3  Immediately after mixing the mortar in
accordance with  6.1 , place the mortar in the
cube mould and prod with the rod specified
in  5.2 . The mortar shall be prodded 20 times in
about 8 s to ensure elimination of entrained air
and honey-combing. Place the remaining
quantity of mortar in the hopper of the cube
mould and prod again as specified for the first
layer and then compact the mortar by
vibration.

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4  The period of vibration shall be two
minutes at the specified speed of 12 000 ± 400
vibration per minute.
6.2.5  At the end of vibration, remove the mould
together with the base plate from the machine
and finish the top surface of the cube in the
mould by smoothing the surface with the blade

completion of vibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1  The cubes shall be tested on their sides
without any packing between the cube and the
steel plattens of the testing machine. One of the
plattens shall be carried on a base and shall be
self-adjusting, and the load shall be steadily
and uniformly applied, starting from zero at a
rate of 35 N/mm 2 /min.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Curing Specimens  — Keep the filled
moulds in moist closet or moist room for 24 ± 1
hours after completion of vibration. At the end
of that period, remove them from the moulds
and immediately submerge in clean fresh water
and keep there until taken out just prior to
breaking. The water in which the cubes are
submerged shall be renewed every 7 days and
shall be maintained at a temperature of
27 ± 2°C. After they have been taken out and
until they are broken, the cubes shall not be
allowed to become dry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  The measured compressive strength of the
cubes shall be calculated by dividing the
maximum load applied to the cubes during the
test by the cross-sectional area, calculated from
the mean dimensions of the section and shall be
expressed to the nearest 0.5 N/mm 2 . In
determining the compressive strength, do not
consider specimens that are manifestly faulty,
or that give strengths differing by more than 10
percent from the average value of all the test
specimens. After discarding specimens or
strength values, if less than two strength
values are left for determining the compressive
strength at any given period, a retest shall be
made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. TESTING<<HEADING_END>>
