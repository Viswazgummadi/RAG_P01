<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard~was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Hydraulic
Structures Instrumentation
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Water Resources Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The vibrations may be measured as displacement, velocity or acceleration with the help of displacement gauges,
velocity pick-ups and accelerometers respectively. Displacement measurements require a stable reference structure
close to the vibrating structure and it may be many a times impracticable to have one especially for hydraulic
structures. Velocity pick-ups suffer from poor response to high frequency vibrations and are bulky for certain
applications. The accelerometers hence are the most preferred. They are proven in respect of versatility, ruggedness,
accuracy and dynamic response. Accelerometers
employ piezoelectric
elements, force balance techniques or
strain gauge based elements. Therefore, the signal conditioners suitable for the particular type of accelerometers
have to be provided. As regards data recording and data analysis a computerized signal analyzer with sufficient
disk storage capacity completely replaces the earlier techniques of recording on multi-channel instrumentation
tape recorders and analyzing on a tunable band pass filter type frequency analyzers. Battery operated signal
analyzers are common now-a-days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers requirements of the accelerometers,
signal conditioning and signal  processing
equipment
for the application of vibration studies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement ofthis standard is complied with, the final  value,
observed or calculated expressing the result of test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2  :  1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised)‘.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>CODE OF PRACTICE FOR INSTALLATION,
MAINTENANCE
AND OBSERVATION
OF THE
INSTRUMENTS
FOR VIBRATION
STUDIES OTHER
THAN EARTHQUAKES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The charge output of accelerometer
is independent
of cable length however the voltage output depends
upon the cable length.Therefore,
the charge output
is preferred and hence the amplifier associated with
piezoelectric
accelerometer
is invariably a charge
amplifier.
Accelerometer sensitivity is generally of
the order of 10 pcfmfs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vibration studies are conducted on hydraulic machines
viz. pumps, hydro-turbines,
on civil structures viz.
dams, divide walls, bridges, power houses, foundations
and on other parts viz. gates, penstocks, trash-racks,
etc. This standard recommends a versatile combination
of the instruments
essential
for observation
of
vibrations arising from sources other than earthquake
that is flow induced and operations of the machine.
It further covers the details on installation
of
accelerometers
and procedure for observations
of
the vibration with the help of associated instrumentation
containing signal conditioner and signal processor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.2.2
Frequency response<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  frequency response is defined as the variation
of accelerometer signal with reference to frequency
of a sinusoidal vibration.
The accelerometer
signal
is fairly constant over the desired frequency range.
The natural resonance frequency of an accelerometer
corresponds with natural frequency of the seismic
mass. Up to a frequency
of 1/5th  of  the natural
resonance frequency the variation in accelerometer
signal is generally within 6 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 INSTRUMENTATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1
Accelerometers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.1  Constructional Details<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On the lower end of the frequency
spectrum rather
than accelerometer the charge amplifier’s frequency
response becomes the limiting factor. The phase
response is one of the significant characteristics
in
respect of transient and shock performance
of the
accelerometer. The upper frequency limitation should
be minimum of 1000 Hz and beyond.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are number of technologies
which have
produced accelerometers,
however the technology
employing piezoelectric material develops an electrical
charge when subjected to dynamic stresses. In a
piezoefectric
accelerometer,
a heavy mass (seismic
mass) preloaded by a shift spring, rests on the stack
of piezoelectric discs. When the assembly is subjected
to vibration the mass exerts a dynamic force on the
disc which develops a variable charge proportional
to force and hence to acceleration.
Figure 1 shows
constructional details of an accelerometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.2.3
Dynamic range<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The dynamic range is the range of magnitudes of
accelerations over which the accelerometer
output
is directly proportional to the acceleration amplitude
applied. The lower magnitude
is limited by the
mounting, cable length, environmental
conditions
and amplifier noise level. The higher magnitude for
continuous accelerations
is much higher than the
accelerations encountered in practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.2  Performance Characteristics<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.2.1
Sensitivity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A piezoelectric accelerometer is electrically analogous
to a capacitor shunted by a high resistance and also
a voltage source or a charge source. The piezoelectric
accelerometer thus has two sensitivities viz. charge
sensitivity
and voltage sensitivity.
The voltage
sensitivity
is expressed
as mv/m/s and charge
sensitivity as pc/m/s. These two are related by,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.2.4  Sensitivity of accelerometers to unwanted
parameters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  accelerometers are also sensitive to many other
unwanted physical parameters viz. temperature, sound,
strain at the base surface, magnetism and transverse
accelerations.
These sensitivities
cause error in
measurements. The acceptable sensitivities on these
accounts are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

low pass-high pass filters
runs, integrators
and
peak detectors, etc. These circuits are built around
operational amplifiers. The frequency response and
gains of amplifier, choice of acceleration, velocity
and displacement
are switch selectable.
Signal
conditioner is provided with meter indication for RMS,
peak values and is~powered through line supply or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency response of the signal conditioner is
adjusted by means of the low pass and high pass
filter9 associated with the amplifier. The low frequency
cut off at &nimtim 0.2 Hz and high frequency cut-off
at mi$mum 1 000 Hz or beyond is required for the
applications. The fi!ter ro,ll off, ofthe order of minimum
12 db/octave is required for sufficient re_jection of
unwanted frequencies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2.3  Integration<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>phenomenon would be random in nature to assess,
its measurement needs to be carried out and measure-
ment data analysed on line. The earlier vibration
measuring equipment contained an electronic tunable
band pass filter and frequency spectrum strip chart
recorder connected to the accelerometer and the signal
conditioner. The signal conditioner with meter indica-
tion still prevails owing to suitability for routine
monitoring applications. However, the electronic band
bass filter and frequency spectrum recorder have now
been replaced by computerised
signal processor
equipment. This standard elaborates only the signal
processor, being relevant today.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The output
of preamplifier
corresponding
to
acceleration
is integrated
to produce
output
corresponding to velocity which when integrated in
turn produces output corresponding to displacement.
These integrators are, in fact, a pair of-20 db/octave
cut-off low pass filters so that they produce outputs
exactly corresponding to velocity and displacement.
These filters are built around operational amplifier
as active filter for good accuracies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2.4
Meter indication<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The signal conditioner
should be provided with
panel meter indication of the vibration parameters
for on-line monitoring and would also be helpful
for setting up of instruments for experiments involving
analyzers. The meter indication is both RMS and peak
value selectable. The crest factor for RMS detector
should be less than 3 and the time constant for the
RMS as well as peak detector should be in the range
of I to 10 seconds :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.2
Configurational
Details<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The signal processor
is an microcomputer
based
equipment. It essentially consists of analog input
section, CPU, CRT display, floppy drives and output
section and~keys to perform various functions under
microprocessor control. The microcomputer with the
help of stored programmes and functional keys controls
the operation of the equipment besides conducting
the signal processing. A multi-channel inputs two or
four channel versions with multiple~display is required
for the application. Figure 3 shows schematic of a
signal processor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2.5
Dynamic
range<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The amplifier gain should be switch selectable, each
setting corresponding to combination of range and
sensitivity. The dynamic range would be most affected
by noise level at the low end for the maximum sensitivity.
A dynamic range of the order of minimum 50 dB would
be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The recorder should have a filter for cancellation
of electrical noise which is common  in most  power
plants and at blasting sites. The recorder should have
RS-232 port for data transfer.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The inputs are direct coupled
so that the lowest
frequency in the measured vibrations not be limited.
The input impedance of the order of mega ohms or
greater and frequency response beyond 1 000 Hz is
required for the applications. The input section needs
to contain an antialiasing filter with facility for selection
of cut off frequency with keys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should be presented on a plotter or printer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 POINTS OF VIBRATION MEASUREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The vibration measurements are not always possible
on the most pertinent parts viz. runner bhdes or wicket
gates of a hydro-turbine,
bearings in rotating -parts
or flapper of a valve, etc. Therefore, bearing housing,
valve body, etc, are considered measurement points.
For measurement of gate vibrations and penstock
vibrations, the accelerometers
are installed directly
on them for example, on a centrally placed girder of
the gate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.3.2
Analysis functions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For vibrations measurement on bridges, bridge piers,
power houses, divide walls, etc, the points selected
are generally at the centre of the walls, centre of girders,
unsupported ends, etc, regardless of response of the
structure to periodic or random stimuli. However, an
approximate estimate of the response of the structure
helps in deciding the points of measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>manufacturers always provide them with a threaded
hole at the base and accessories such as mounting
studs or mounting magnets with matching threaded
protrusions at the top. For installations on metallic
object mounting with the help of magnets would
suffice. The vibrations in two (X, Y) or three directions
(X, Y. Z) at point are to be measured either with a
three directional accelerometer or by threading three
unidirectional accelerometers
on a mild steel cube
welded to the part.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.3
Water-Proofing
of a Mounting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case the point selected is underwater or is likely
to be subjected to splashes of water, the accelerometer
mounting
needs to be made waterproof
with a
waterproof
housing onto it, through which the
connecting cables are taken out. Figure 5 shows a
recommended arrangement for the purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Equipment Locations and Cable Layouts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The signal conditioner/amplifier,

Measurement Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The vibrations change according to various conditions
to which the test part is subjected, for example gate

condition the signal validity may be checked as
mentioned in 5.2 for the procedure for instrument

<<PARAGRAPH>>The accelerometer

should be checkedeven on site. This should be carried
out by reciprocity method for accelerometer using
a standard accelerometer, miniature vibration source
and sensitivity comparator, and for charge amplifier
by charge simulation
method using a calibrator
producing known charge and a digital voltmeter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A portable signal processor conducts on-line analysis.
However, the record time selection should be limited.
The frequency range, the frequency resolution and
record length are interrelated as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Having completed the installation of accelerometers
and having made electrical
connections
of the
equipment
before
data collection,
a thorough
instrument check is very essential. Considering the
sources of vibrations, these
would be repetitive
in nature and signal validity checks could be easily
carried out during this phase. The following require
special attention:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

machines, load, etc, and date and time of experiment.
In case of simultaneous measurements on a number
