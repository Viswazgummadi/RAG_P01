FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 27 September
1983,
after
the draft finalized
by the
Electrical
Measuring
Equipment
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved by the Electrotechnical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
covers
the requirements
of dc bridges
and their
auxiliary
equipment
used
in the
measurement
of resistance.
This
standard
has been formulated in the light of the modern practices in the
manufacture
of bridges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the preparation
of this standard considerable
assistance has been
derived
from
IEC
Publication
564 ( 1977 ) ‘DC bridges for measuring
resistance’ issued by the International
Electrotechnical
Commission.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS : 2-1960*.
The number of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value
shauld
be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard specifies the requirements
of dc bridges for measuring
resistance from 0.1 to 100 000 Ohms.
It also applies to auxiliary equip-
ment which is a built-in part of the bridge.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 This
standard
does not apply
to bridge
comparators
nor to self-
balancing
bridges nor to those which
emply
graduations
on the null
detector
to obtain
a part
of the indicated
value,
nor to external
auxiliary equipment used with the bridge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
A bridge comparator
is a device
intended
to compare
two resistors, for
example, a two arm adjustable ratio set.<<HEADING_END>>

DC Bridge
for
Measuring
Resistance
( Hereinafter
Designated
Bridge
) -
The
assembly
of
at
least
three
resistance
arms
which,
together
with
a test resistor,
forms
a bridge
network;
a source of direct
current
and a null detector
are
also
required
for
its
operation:
these
may
or
may
not be
built
in.
At
balance,
there
exists
a calculable
relationship
between
the resistance
values of the resistors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NATE -
A dc bridge for measuring
resistance
may be intended
to measure two-
terminal
or four-teminal
resistors
each
with or without
a leakage
current screen
( circuit ); it will be termed
accordingly
a two-terminal
bridge
or a four-terminal
bridge with or without provision
for a leakage current screen ( circuit
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Test
Resistor
-

resistor
whose
resistance
value
is to be
measured.<<HEADING_END>>

current-potential
terminal
at each end.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Four-Terminal
Resistor<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.1 Current
Terminal
-
A resistor
having
two terminals
at each
end for current
carrying
circuit.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.2
Potential  Terminal
-
A resistor
having
two
terminals
for con-
nection

The value of the resistance
is defined as the quotient
of the potential
difference
between
the two potential
terminals
to the current
entering
and leaving
the current
terminals,
provided
that
no
current
is
drawnfrom
the
potential
terminals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5  Resistor
with Leakage
Current
Screen ( Circuit
) -
A resistor
having
a leakage
current
screen
(  circuit
) connected
to a separate
terminal,
which
is often called
the ‘guard
terminal’.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
A resistor
with leakage current screen ( circuit
) may bc represented
as a
delta network consisting
of an equivalent
value of resistance
connected
between
each
pair
of terminals.
Of these
three
resistances,
the resistance
between the two main
terminals
is the main equivalent
resistance
which is intended
to be measured.
The
other two resistances
of the delta network are usually insulation
( leakage ) resistances
which, for very high values of the main equivalent
resistance,
may
be of the same
order
to smaIIer
than
it.
The
main, equivalent
resistance
may appear either as a
two-terminal
resistor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

quantities
are
shown in Table
2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2
Before

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4
The test shall be carried
out in succession
for both polarities

source.
If
the
difference
between
the
results
of the
two
measurements
does not exceed
20 percent
of the value
corresponding
to
the
class
index,
it is considered
as negligible.
When
the difference
exceeds
this
amount,
the
error
shall
be taken as equal to the mean of
the errors
obtained
for each of the two polarities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  The test resistor should not be a source of emf or, if it is a source of emf,
this should be allowed for in determining the error of the bridge.

to the case or to earth
shall
not
produce
a variation
exceeding
10 percent
of the permissible
limits of intrinsic
error.
For this
test,
the case, if it is conductive,
shall be connected
to earth,
If the case
is made
of insulating
material,
the bridge
shall be placed
on a conduc-
tive plate which
shall be connected
to earth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.2
If there are limitations
on earthing,
the manufacturer
shall state
