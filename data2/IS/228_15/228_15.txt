<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
Standards,
after
the
( Part 15 ) ( Second
Revision
) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
draft
finalized
by the Methods
of Chemical Analysis of Ferrous
Metals
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 228, which was first published in 1952 and subsequently
revised in 1959, covered
the chemical
analysis of plain carbon and low alloy steels. along with pig iron and cast
iron.
It was revised
again to make it comprehensive
in respect of stee1 analysis
and
to exclude
pig iron
and
cast
iron which were being covered in separate standards.
During its second revision the standard
has
been split up in several parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers the method for determination
of copper
by thiosulphate-iodide
method.
The
other parts of this series are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and continue
to boil for
5-10 minutes
or until
the

settle
rapidly.
Filter,
and
wash
the

solution.
Place
the

all carbon
is destroyed.
Cool,

to the
crucible,
warm gently
and pour upon
the contents

beaker
and
the
contents
