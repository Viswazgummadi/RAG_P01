or rectified
spirit.
Add 1’5 ml of standard
sodium
hydroxide
solution
or a quantity
sufficient
to ensure
that
the colour
of the solution
corresponds
to pH 5.2 and then dilute
to 100 ml with water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2.5
Test
solution
-
Add
0.4 ml of standard
hydrochloric
acid
and 0.4 ml of methyl
red
indicator
to 100 ml of
water.
The
colour
of the
solution
should
be pink.
Boil
the solution
for some time in an Erlenmeyer
flask which
has been previously
tested
in accordance
with
the test
given in  A-3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3. Testing
of Erlenmeyer
Flask<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1  Boil
the test solution
in Erlenmeyer
flask (see
A-2.2.5
)  and while
boiling
transfer
to the
Erlenmeyer
flask to be tested.
Place the flask quickly
in a bath of boiling
water so that the level
of
the solution
contained
in it is below the level of the water
in the bath.
Continue
boiling
for one
hour and at the end of this period
observe the colour
of the solution.
Reject the flask if any change
of colour
of the test solution
has taken place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1.1
Erlenmeyer
flasks which
have once passed the test ( see A-3.1 ) may fail
to do so after
prolonged
storage.
In such
a case, they should
be washed
with
a 5 percent
(w/v)
solution
of
glacial
acetic acid followed
by a wash with water until
free from acid before
use,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-4.
Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.1  Crush the two glass
bottles
selected
for this test ( see A-l.2
), such
that the crushed
glass
completely
passes through
600 pm IS Sieve but fails
to pass through
425 pm IS Sieve.
Spread
the
crushed
glass on a glazed
paper
and pass a magnet
over them to remove
any particles
of iron
which
may have been introduced
during
crushing.
Weigh
accurately
5 g of the crushed
glass,
wash free from dust by repeated
washing
with ethyl alcohol
or rectified
spirit
and dry at 100 f 2°C.
Transfer
the clean,
dry crushed
glass to the Erlenmeyer
flask ( see A-3.1 ) and treat with
100 ml of
a fresh
portion
of the boiling
test solution.
Place the flask
quickly
in a bath of
boiling
water
so that
the
level
of the solution
contained
in it is below
the level
of the water
in the bath.
Continue
boiling
for 30 minutes.
Titrate
the solution
without
filtering
to the original
pink colour
with standard
hydrochloric
acid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.1.1
The glass bottles
shall
be taken to have satisfied
the test
if not more than
3 ml 0’01 N
hydrochloric
acid are required
for the titration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.1  Fill the bottle with water in order to give in more stability
and place it on its base on the flat
plate
having
a pillar
bolted
to it at right
angles.
Adjust
the ‘V’ block
mounted
on the pillar
in such a manner that it is in contact
with
the outer
diameter
of the bottle
at about
the middle,
Adjust
the
dial
indicator
fitted
to the pillar
so that
its measuring
point
comes in contact
with
the outer edge of the neck of the bottle.
Rotate the bottle,
keeping
the body always
in contact
with
the ‘V’ block, Note down the maximum
deflection
on the indicator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first
issued
in 1957 and was reaffirmed
in 1978.
This
revision
gives the
requirements
for distilled
water bottles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the present
standard,
the nominal
size of the bottle
has been specified
as 750 ml in place
of 560 ml as this size of bottle
is commonly
used.
Also  the requirements
pertaining
to capacity
at filling
level,
brimful
capacity
and the mass of the bottles
has been incorporated
in the standard.
The 1957 version
of the standard
had felt the need of inclusion
of bursting
pressure
test and this
question
was discussed
in detail
and it was felt
by the committee
responsible
for preparing
this
standard
that there was no need of specifying
the internal
pressure
resistance
test.
The verticality
test and thermal
shock test have
been laid
down
in this
version
of the standard.
The sampling
clause
has been deleted
from the revision
as it is planned
to prepare
a separate
Indian
Standard
on
sampling
criteria
for glass
containers
and a reference
will
be made of this
standard
when
available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
does not cater for the bottles
for medicinal
purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
