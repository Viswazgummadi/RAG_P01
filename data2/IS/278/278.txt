unwrapping eight turns round its own diameter without fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12. Marking  — Every reel of barbed wire shall be marked legibly with the name of the
manufacture, the type of barbed wire, the diameters of the line and point wires, barb spacing and

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1  All the reels selected according to  A-1.2  shall be examined for wire diameter, distance
between barbs, length of barbs and freedom from defects. If all the reels are found satisfactory for
each of the above characteristics the lot shall be considered conforming to the requirements of
these characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2  When the lot is found satisfactory in  A-2.1 , one test specimen each from every selected reel
shall be taken and subjected to tensile test (  see   11.1  ), zinc coating test (  see   11.2  ) and ductility
test (  see   11.3  ). The lot shall be declared conforming to the requirements of these characteristics if
all the test specimens satisfy the relevant requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.3  When so desired by the purchaser one sample for the chemical analysis shall be drawn. The
lot shall be declared conforming to the requirements when the test results satisfy the relevant
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.4  The lot shall be declared conforming to the requirements of this specification if it is found

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first issued as a tentative standard in 1951 and revised in 1962. The main
modifications made in the second revision of the standard were:
a) restriction of the size of point wire to 2 mm diameter,
b) revision of table of tensile properties,
c) rationalization of the galvanization requirements for line and point wire, and
d) reduction in the number of types of galvanized steel barbed wire from four to two.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The experience gained during the last few years in the implementation of this standard has
necessitated the third revision of the specification. The size designations 1, 2, 3 and 4 as laid down
in 1969 issue of the standard now conform to size designations 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The main
modifications made in third revision are:
a) Two additional sizes have been added,
b) The zinc coating requirements have been thoroughly revised, and
c) The various values have been given in SI units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Amendment No. 3 (October 1992) and Amendment No. 4 (August 1993). Side bar indicates
