<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Farm Implements and Machinery Sectional Committee had been approved by the Food and
Agriculture Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Animal drawn cultivators are manufactured and used in large numbers in the country. Though they are primarily
meant for intercultivation operations but are being used for seed bed preparation and for sowing with seeding
attachment also. The cultivators manufactured in the country vary considerably in dimensions and other
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1965 and was revised in 1979 to incorporates the relevant provision of
IS 3350: 1965 ‘Three tined cultivation with seeding attachments, animal drawn’. It has been decided to revise
the standard again and further enlarging the scope to cover the requirement of IS 6023  :  1970 ‘Reversible
shovels’; IS 6451  :  1972 ‘Sweep’; IS 7361  :  1974 ‘Tines for animal drawn cultivators’;
IS 9218  :  1979
‘Triangular shovels for animal-drawn cultivators’; and IS 92 19  :  1993 ‘Seeding attachment for animal drawn
cultivators  (first revision )‘.  This standard therefore supersedes these standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The figures included in this standard are meant for illustration only and should not be considered as suggestive
of any standard design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘. The  number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
