<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee, CED 53<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been formulated to fulfill the need for a specification for non-asbestos fibre
cement flat sheets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation of this standard, due weightage has also been given to the international
coordination among the standards and practices in different countries in addition to relating it to
the practices in the field in this country. For this, assistance has been derived from the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 8336 : 1993 Fibre-cement flat sheets. International Organization for Standardization.
ISO 390
: 1993 Products in fibre-reinforced cement — Sampling and inspection. International
Organization for Standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given at
Annex K.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.2 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (May 2002) and Amendment No. 2 (June 2003).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is compiled with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2 REFERENCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standards listed in Annex A
contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of this standard.
At the time of publication, the editions
indicated were valid. All standards are subject
to revision, and parties to agreements based on
this standard are encouraged to investigate the
possibility of applying the most recent editions
of the standards indicated in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — If sheets of Type B are used in external
applications where they are directly exposed to the
weather but are protected (for example, coating or
impregnation), the weather resistance of the product is
determined
by
the
quality
of
the
protection.
Specification of this protection and methods for control
and test are outside the scope of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  The sheets are further classified into five
categories according to their modulus of
rupture as given in Table 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 GENERAL COMPOSITION<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>METHOD FOR TESTING DIMENSIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-1 APPARATUS
The apparatus shall include the following
items:
a) Smooth, flat and rigid inspection surface
of production quality and of dimensions
appropriate to the dimensions of the
sheets.
Two metal rules shall be fixed at right
angles along adjacent edges of the
inspection surface. The straightness of
each metal rule shall be at least 0.3 mm/m
and the right angle shall be accurate to at
least
0.1
percent
(less
than
1 mm
deviation from normal per metre of
length) or 0.001 rad.
Alternatively, a portable square may be
used.
The
same
requirements
for
straightness and angularity shall apply.
b) Suitable metal rulers, capable of being
read to 0.5 mm.
c) Dial gauge, reading at least to 0.05 mm,
with flat parallel metal jaws, between
10 mm and 15 mm in diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>between extreme values. Assess the results
against the tolerance given in  5.1.3 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — If the face texture does not allow a sufficiently
accurate measurement of the thickness, the thickness of
face-textured products is determined from volume
measurement by water displacement where the test
piece has been saturated before measurement. The
thickness is given by the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V
l   b
-------<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e  =<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e  is average thickness of the test piece in mm,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V  is volume determined by water displacement in mm 3 ,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b  is specimen width in mm, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l  is specimen length in mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternative methods for determination of the
average thickness of textured specimens may
be used provided they can be proven, on
average, to yield a thickness measurement
within ±2 percent of that determined from
volume measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-4 MEASUREMENT OF STRAIGHTNESS
OF EDGES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2 MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH AND
WIDTH
For
each
dimension,
carry
out
three
measurements, that is, one in the middle and
one at approximately 50 mm from either end.
Avoid taking the measurement over a local
deformation which could be considered as a
visual defect. Smooth any rough areas. Take
each reading to the nearest 0.5 mm. Report the
individual results. Assess the results against
the tolerances given in  5.1.3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Apply each edge to the relevant arm of the
square. Measure to the nearest 0.5 mm by
means of a steel rule, the greatest separation
between the edge of the sheet and the arm of
the square. Report the results. Assess each
result against the tolerance given in  5.1.4.1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-5 MEASUREMENT OF OUT OF
SQUARENESS OF EDGES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Place each of the four corners of the sheet in
succession between the arms of the square
keeping the large side against the large arm
and the other side in contact with small arm. In
this position, measure the distance of the apex
of the corner from the small arm of the square.
Report each result. Assess the results against
the tolerance given in  5.1.4.2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3 MEASUREMENT OF THICKNESS
Carry out three measurements across the
width at one end of the smooth or textured
sheet (with the dial gauge) as indicated in
Fig. 1. Take each reading to an accuracy of
0.05 mm.

the
individual
results.

<<HEADING level=3>>C-1.6 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Arrange the test piece with the underside
against the supports and load the test piece
along its centreline by means of the loading
bar. Load the specimen such that breakage
occurs within 10 to 30s. A constant rate of
deflection is preferred; where this facility is not
available a regular rate of loading is acceptable.
Measure the thickness at two points for smooth
specimens
and
four
points
for
textural
specimens along the section of breakage as
indicated in Fig. 4.
For square specimens, re-assemble the broken
pieces. Submit the re-assembled test specimens
to a second bending test with the line of load
application at right angles to that of the first
test. Measure the thickness of the test piece at
two points for smooth sheets or four points for
textured sheets along the new section of
breakage as indicated in Fig. 4.
Where rectangular test specimens are used, the
strengths in the two directions are obtained by
testing each of the appropriate specimens
(  see  Fig. 4 ).
