FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian

had been approved
by
the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Rubber

and 4-conductor
stranded flexible
cords are used for connecting
highly accurate measuring
instruments
embedded

to
suitable
terminal boards located in the galleries of the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 A large
portion
of the cord

in the concrete or ,mortar
in the dam
and hence
rugged
construction,
positive
imperviousness

are of paramount
importance.
The usually
severe conditions
to which
this cord
is subjected
include
ambient air and ccmcrete temperatures of
50”C or so, excessively
damp locations,
alkaIine reaction
of concrete
and
rough treatment during installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the field,
in
order
to
add
additional
length
of
cable
to that
already attached to the instrument
for joining
it to the terminal boards

it is necessary
to splice. the

to
the
embedment
of
the
instruments

<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  There
are three methods
for cable splicing
for cable extension
to the
terminal
boxes, namely:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Vulcanized
rubber
splice,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Rubber
sleeve covering,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Self-bonding
tape.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1
Vulcanized Rubber Splice -
The
following
steps shall
be followed
in the procedure
-for vulcanizing
cable splices:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The cable sheath
for 80 mm from the cable end shall be removed
and joint
made ,of the individual
pair
of conductors
staggered
by 25 mm
lengths
( Fig. 1A ) so that the finished
splices do not
lap;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) ‘Ten millimetres
of rubber
insulations
from each
conductor
shall
be cut, while taking
care not to damage
the conductor;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The individual
conductors
shall be twisted
and conductors
of the
same,
colours
put
into
a
copper
sleeve
and
then
soldered
( Fig. IB and
1.C );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The
surface
of copper
sleeve
and
insulation
shall
be wiped by
using
benzene
absorbed
clean cloth and unvulcanized
repair
tape
wound
on it ( Fig. 1D );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) On completion
of conductor
splicing,
the ends
of
insulations
are
marked
on the cable and unvulcanized
tape
tightly
wound
along
the
whole
jointing
portion.
In
this
case,
in
order
to
obtain
a strong
adhesion,
the surface
of sheath,
on which
un-
,vulcanized
tough
rubber
tape is to be wound
shall be roughened
for length
of about
40 mm
by use of file  or  knife,
and
poly-
chloroprene
rubber
paste shall be applied
( Fig. 1E );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) After
drying,
the splice
shall
be wrapped
with
unvulcanized
tough rubber
tape,
carrying
the tape
up onto the sheath,
at least
two layers
half-lapped
( see Fig. 1F );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Wrapping
on the splice
shall
be completed
with
vulcanizing
tough
rubber
tape,
and
all projections
shall
be cut off with a
knife just
before
completion
of the final layer;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11) Continue
until
the splice
is built
up to the size of the mould
of
the vulcanizer;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j) Silicone
oil or soapwater
shall be applied
on the inside
surface
of
metal
mould
of the vulcanizer.
The vulcanizer
shall  be connec-
ted and energized
according
to the manufacturers’
instructions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:l0334- 1982<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the indication
of the vulcanizer
has, reached
100°C ( pre-
heating point ), vulcanizer shall be opened and the splice put in
the metal mould;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>m><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While energizing, the mould shall be gradually
tightened until it
is uniformly fastened; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The temperature
shall be raised to 140-160%
and kept at that
level for about 30 min.
Then energizing
shall be stopped and
after
the temperature
comes down  to  about 12O”C, the metal
mould
shall
be opened and the splice shall be taken out and
excess rubber trimmed off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.2  Rubber Sleeve Covering -
The following steps shall be followed:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4  Cable shall be removed and cable ends shall be joined in accord-
ance with the procedure indicated.
in 3.2.1(a),
through 3.2.1(c).
Insulating
sleeves
shall
be
provided
over
copper
sleeves
( Fig. 2A and 2B );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  The jointed
conductors
shall be enclosed
in a rubber
sleeve or
plastic pipe having open gap, by passing the conductors through
the open gap.
The rubber sleeve shall be wound on two grooves
fixed one on each side of the splice ( Fig. 2C ).
Voids between
the rubber
sleeve and jointed
conductors
shall be filled with
cable compound;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Finally,
the splicing portion shall be wound with adhesive vinyl-
chloride tape ( Fig. 2D).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3  Self-Bonding
Tape -
The self-bonding
tape is made from synthe-
tic resin and rubber, which is a good electric insulator and is particularly
durable
against
watering
and aging.
The
following
steps
shall
be
followed:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Sheath of the cable attached to the instrument shall be removed
and conductors spliced in accordance
with the procedure
given
in 3.2.1(a);
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Cover
with self-bonding
tape.
After jointing
the
conductors
each of the conductors shall be wrapped with the tape extending
it 30 to 40 mm on each
side of the splice of individual
con-
ductors.
In order to obtain a strong
adhesion,
the surface
of
the sheath
on which self-bonding
tape is to be wound shall
be roughened for a length of about 30 mm by the use of pumice,
file or knife.
The
conductors
shall then be assembled
in a bench
and
wrapped with the tape extending
to make a smooth rounded
cross-section.

AND CONDUITS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 In  estimating
the length
of the cable
to be added,
a suitable
route
between
the point
of embedment
of the instrument
and
the
terminal
station
in the gallery
shall be selected
by a study
of the drawing.
In
selecting
the route,
due consideration
shall
be given to the construction
procedures
involved
in placing
the concrete
where
the instrument
is to
be embedded
and to possible obstructions
along the chosen route.
After
the selected
route has been verified,
the length
of cable required
shall be
estimated,
and
a small
amount,
usually
10%
or 1’5 m, whichever
is
larger,
shall be added to allow for extra
length
required
due to normal
variation
from the selected
route.
Length
of cable
should
be limited
to
75 m as far as possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
In genera!,
cables
run
within
conduits
in masonry
and
concrete,
both
in horizontal
and
vertical
directions.
Separate
conduit
should be
used
for each
individual
lift.
The
conduit
may be of
any material
which
will not
collapse
i,n
fresh
concrete,
such
as galvanized
iron,
or
rigid
PVC.
The
size of
the conduit
may
be chosen
by
drawing
circles
to
represent
the
diameter
of
the
cables.
In
order to allow
for
pulling
friction,
provide
for
one and
a
half
times
the
number
of
cables
where
the
conduit
is
of short
length
and
up
to
twice
the
number
of
circles,
as there
are cables where the runs are long or
there
are
many
bends.
Circumscribe
these
circles
with a larger
one
to find the inside diameter
of the conduit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1

diameter
shall be worked out on percentage
basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3
For diameters and thicknesses of conduits see IS  :  1653-1972*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Where a group of cables is to be run horizontally in a lift, they may
be taped together at intervals and laid on the top of the next to last layer
of concrete in the lift, covered
with pads of fresh concrete throughout
their length, and placement
of the final concrete
lift layer allowed  b  to
proceed in the normal
manner.
Leads of single or pairs of cables may
be ‘walked into’ the concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 Cables of instruments located above terminal reading station are run
in downward
conduit from lift
containing
instrument
with
separate
conduits
serving
each
individual
lift.
Each
cable shall be threaded
individually
into the conduit,
SO  that each cable will be
required
to
support
only
its own weight.
At the entrance
of the cables into the
conduit, suitable protection,
such as padding
with burlap,
should
be
provided
around each cable and in the interstices between the cables to
prevent sharp bends and to prevent the entrance
of concrete
and grout
into the conduit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 Cable leads shall be run upward
when the instruments
are located
below terminal reading station, without conduit from the lift in the case
of concrete
dam and within
conduits
in the case of masonry dam,
Reinforcing
bar shall be embedded
in the concrete
of successive lift for
providing support for cables.
The cables shall be tied to the reinforcing
bars, at short intervals before placing each lift and the remainder
of the
cable coiled and hung clear of the fresh concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6 In the general case where a number of cables from widely separa-
ted points are collected
at one central
point
and run downward
in
conduit,
the cable
may
be run in two steps.
A collecting
box or
concrete form is erected around the grouped conduits, so that the lift is
left about 450 mm below the conduits.
During
the placement
of the
concrete in which the meters are embedded, the cables should be brought
horizontally
to the collection point and then
coiled and hung out of the
fresh concrete.
As soon as the concrete has set sufficiently to bear traffic,
the cable
coils shall be taken down the conduit to the terminal
boards.
The advantage
is that it is much easier to sort and run cables when they
are not muddled with fresh concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7 If the cable leads are to cross contraction
joints in the structure,
a
slack cable recess should be provided
at the crossing point.
This may
consist of a wooden box block out, forming a recess into which the cable<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

RESISTANCE
MEASUREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Prior to embedment
of instruments
in
the
newly
placed
concrete,
each instrument
shall be thoroughly
checked
for meter resistance
as also
for lead
resistance
and
these
shall
be entered
in the  pro  forma
given
in
Appendix
A.
The
resistance
ratios
before
splicing
and after
splicing
shall
also be recorded
in the  pro forma  meant for recording
pre-embed-
ment tests.
The pre-embedment
tests quite often prove
valuable
during
the analysis
of data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
