<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
covers requirements
regarding
spacing of buildings
to provide adequate safety
against exposure hazard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  MAXIMUM
HEIGHT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Every building
should be restricted
in its
height above the ground
level and the number of
storeys,
depending
upon
its occupancy and the
type of construction.
The maximum permissible
height for any combination
of occupancy
and
types of construction
should necessarily be related
to the width of street fronting
the building or.
floor area ratio ( see 4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The  construction
and spacing
of buildings
with
due
regard
to their
classification
( see
IS  :  1641-1988* ) are the major
factors
to be
considered which otherwise may lead to a serious
conflagration
intensely
built-up
areas.
Thus
exposure
hazard expressed the danger or risk of
spread of fire through
the open air in a building
on fire to another building situated in the vicinity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The precautions
taken by
keeping proper
spacing of the building
prevent spread of fire by
direct
contact
of flames and hot gases emitted
from
the burning
building
or by radiated heat
and flying brands.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The comparative
floor area ratios for diffe-
rent occupancies
and types of construction
are
given in Table 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Each portion
of a building, which is sepa-
rated by one or more continuous
fire resisting
walls, having a fire resistance of not less than 4 h,
extending from the foundation to 1 m above the
roof at all points,
may be considered
to be a
separate building for the calculation of maximum
permissible height and floor area, provided
open-
ings, if any, in the
separating
wall, are also,
protected by fire assemblies of 4 h.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
