FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian
Standard
( Part 1 ) ( Third
Revision
) which
is identical
with ISO 8992:1986
‘Fasteners
—
General
requirements
for bolts,
screws,
studs
and nuts’
issued
by the International
Organization
for
Standardization
( ISO ) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on the recommendation
of the
Bolts,
Nuts and Fasteners
Accessories
Sectional
Committee
and approval
of the Basic and Production
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
was
originally
published
in 1961
and
subsequently
revised
in 1967
and
1980.
This
revision
of the standard
has been
taken
up to align
it with
ISO 8992
: 1986
by adoption
under
dual
numbering
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While
specific
requirements
of fasteners
are covered
in the rest of the parts,
this part
is intended
to
provide
an instruction
to different
parts
of the standard
and cover
requirements
which
are general
‘in
nature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The text
of ISO Standard
has been
approved
as suitable
for publication
as Indian
Standard
without
deviations.
Certain
terminology
and conventions
are, however,
not identical
to those
used in the Indian
Standards.
Attention
is drawn
especially
to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Wherever
the words
‘International
Standard’
appear
referring
to this standard,
they should
be
read as ‘Indian
Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Comma
( , ) has been used as a decimal
marker
while
in Indian Standards,
the current
practice
is to use a point
( . ) as
the decimal
marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this adopted
standard,
reference
appears
to certain
International
Standards
for which
Indian Standards
also
exist.
The
corresponding
Indian
Standards
which
are to be substituted
in their
place
are listed
below
along
with their
degree
of equivalence
for the editions
indicated:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
