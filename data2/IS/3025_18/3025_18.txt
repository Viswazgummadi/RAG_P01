<<PARAGRAPH>>( First Revision )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(Incorporating Amendment No. 1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope  — Prescribes a gravimetric method for the determination of volatile and fixed portions of
total, filterable and non-filterable residues. The method is applicable to all types of water and waste
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. Terminology<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Total Fixed Residue  — The dish with residue after completion of test for total residue is heated in
a muffle furnace at 550°C for 1 hour. Total fixed and volatile residue are calculated from loss in mass,
on ignition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  Filterable Fixed Residue  — The dish with residue after completion of test for filterable residue is
heated in a muffle furnace at 550°C for 1 hour. Filterable fixed and volatile residue are calculated
from loss of mass, on ignition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Non-filterable Fixed Residue  — The filter with residue after completion of test for non-filterable
residue is heated in a muffle furnace at 550°C for 1 hour. Non-filterable fixed and volatile residue are
calculated from loss in mass after ignition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The test is subject to many errors due to loss of water of crystallization, loss of volatile matter
prior to combustion, incomplete oxidation of certain complex organics and decomposition of mineral
salts during combustion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  The results should not be considered as accurate measure of organic carbon in the sample.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  An important source of error in the determination is failure to obtain a representative sample.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Evaporating Dish  — 90 mm, 100 ml capacity made of platinum, porcelain, silica or borosilicate
glass. Platinum is suitable for all tests; porcelain, silica and glass may be used for samples with a
p H value less than 9.0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Steam-Bath<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Drying Oven —  With thermostatic control for maintaining temperature up to 180 ± 2°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Desiccator  — Provided with a colour indicating desiccant.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Muffle Furnace  — Capable of operation at 550°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6  Analytical Balance —  Of 200 g capacity and capable of weighing to nearest 0.1 mg.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. Sample Preservation and Handling  — Preservation is not practical. Refrigeration or chilling
to 4°C is recommended.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Heat the clean evaporating dish to 550°C for 1 hour. Cool, desiccate, weigh and store in desiccator
until ready for use.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Select volume of the sample which has residue between 25 and 250 mg, preferably between 100
and 200 mg. This volume may be estimated from values of specific conductance. To obtain a
measurable residue, successive aliquots of sample may be added to the sample dish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Pipette this volume in a weighed evaporating dish on steam-bath. Evaporation may also be
performed in a drying oven. The temperature shall be lowered to approximately 98°C to prevent
boiling and splattering of the sample. After complete evaporation of water from the residue,
transfer the dish to an oven at 103-105°C or 179-181°C and dry to constant mass, that is, till the
difference in the successive weighings is less than 0.5 mg. Drying for a long duration (usually 1 to
2 hours) is done to elliminate necessity of checking for constant mass. The time for drying to
constant mass with a given type of sample when a number of samples of nearly same type are to be
analysed, has to be determined by trial.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Weigh the dish as soon as it has cooled avoiding residue to stay for long time as some residues
are hygroscopic and may absorb water from desiccant that is absolutely dry.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5  After weighing, ignite the dish in a muffle furnace at 550°C for 1 hour. After ignition, allow the
vessel to partially cool in air and transfer to desiccator, cool and weigh.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The volatile and fixed components in the residue may be determined igniting the sample at
550°C. The determination is useful in the control of waste water plant operation because it offers a
rough approximation of the amount of organic matter present in the solid fraction of waste water,
activated sludge, industrial wastes, or bottom sediments. Since the results may also reflect loss of
water of crystallization, loss of volatile organic matter before combustion, incomplete oxidation of
certain complex organics, and decomposition of mineral salts during combustion, it may not yield
an accurate measure of organic carbon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method supersedes  9  of IS : 2488 (Part 5)-1976 ‘Methods of sampling and test for industrial
effluents, Part 5’ and  11  of IS : 3025-1964 ‘Methods of sampling and test (physical and chemical)
