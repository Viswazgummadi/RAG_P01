Terminology\n2.1Total Fixed Residue \u2014 The dish with residue after completion of test for total residue is heated in\na muffle furnace at 550\u00b0C for 1 hour. Total fixed and volatile residue are calculated from loss in mass,\non ignition.\n2.2Filterable Fixed Residue \u2014 The dish with residue after completion of test for filterable residue is\nheated in a muffle furnace at 550\u00b0C for 1 hour. Filterable fixed and volatile residue are calculated\nfrom loss of mass, on ignition.\n2.3Non-filterable Fixed Residue \u2014 The filter with residue after completion of test for non-filterable\nresidue is heated in a muffle furnace at 550\u00b0C for 1 hour. Non-filterable fixed and volatile residue are\ncalculated from loss in mass after ignition.\n3. Limitations\n3.1The test is subject to many errors due to loss of water of crystallization, loss of volatile matter\nprior to combustion, incomplete oxidation of certain complex organics and decomposition of mineral\nsalts during combustion.\n3.2The results should not be considered as accurate measure of organic carbon in the sample.\n3.3An important source of error in the determination is failure to obtain a representative sample.\n4. Apparatus\n4.1Evaporating Dish \u2014 90mm, 100ml capacity made of platinum, porcelain, silica or borosilicate\nglass. Platinum is suitable for all tests; porcelain, silica and glass may be used for samples with a\npHvalue less than 9.0.\n4.2Steam-Bath\n4.3Drying Oven \u2014 With thermostatic control for maintaining temperature up to 180 \u00b1 2\u00b0C.\n4.4Desiccator \u2014 Provided with a colour indicating desiccant.\n4.5Muffle Furnace \u2014 Capable of operation at 550\u00b0C.\n4.6Analytical Balance \u2014 Of 200g capacity and capable of weighing to nearest 0.1mg.\n5.Sample Preservation and Handling \u2014 Preservation is not practical. Refrigeration or chilling\nto 4\u00b0C is recommended.\n6. Procedure\n6.1Heat the clean evaporating dish to 550\u00b0C for 1 hour.
