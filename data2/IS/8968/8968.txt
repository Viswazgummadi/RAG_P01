FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
30 November
1978,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the
Farm Drainage
Tiles
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Agricultural
and Food Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Different types of concrete pipes have been in use in this country for
water mains, sewers, culverts and in irrigation.
IS  :  458-1971*
covers
concrete pipes. Use of concrete pipes has also been recently increased for
drainage of sub-surface water in farms.
A need has, therefore,
been felt
to formulate requirements
for such pipes also known as ‘tiles’ which are
intended for farm drainage
purposes.
This standard has been prepared
to  cover these tiles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the preparation
of this standard, assistance
has been derived from
Indian Hume CO Limited,
Bombay.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded off in
accordance
with IS  :  Z-1960t.
Th e number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the requirements
and method of test for concrete
tiles with open joints used for farm drainage purposes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  MATERIAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Cement -  The
cement
used for the
manufacture
of tiles shall
conform to IS  :  269-1976:
or IS  :  455-1976s
or IS  :  1489-197611.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Aggregates
-
The
aggregates
used
for the
manufacture
of tiles
shall conform
to IS  :  383-1970*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -The
grading requirements
as given in IS  : 383-1970*
shall be waived
in
case tiles meet the physical requirements
( see 6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Admixtures
and Blends
-
If required
by the purchaser,
suitable
admixtures
and blends may be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  CLASSIFICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  For
the
purpose
of this standard,
the concrete
tiles based
on their
physical
properties
( see  6.1 ) shall be of following
three classes:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Light-duty
tiles,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Medium-duty
tiles, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Heavy-duty
tiles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  DIMENSIONS
AND TOLERANCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The
size  (  internal
diameter
) of the tiles of each
class shall
be 80,
100, 125, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1
Permissible
variation
in diameter
for tiles up to and
including
150  mm
shall be 15
mm  and for sizes more than 150mm
shall be &6 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The length
of the tiles shall be 300 to 450 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1  Permissible
variation
in length
from
the specified
length
shall
be f
1 percent.
However,
the length
shall
be not less and not more
than the values specified
under 4.2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The
thickness
of the
tiles
shall
be such
that
tiles
shall
meet
the
physical
requirements
( see 6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1
Permissible
variation
in specified
thickness
for tiles up to and
including
25 mm thickness
shall be & 1’5 mmand
above25
mm thickness
shall be f
2 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The tile wall thickness shall be measured as the average
of 12 wall thick_
ness measurements
made  at the  top,  centre and bottom locations  on each of the four
quarter segments that usually
result when a tile is tested for crushing
strength
test
( SET  A-l ).
If a tile breaks in such a manner
that a satisfactory
quarter
segment
is
not obtained
then the 12 wall thickness
measurements
shall be made on the broken
pieces that best represent
the top, centre
and bottom
on the four
circumferential
locations
of the tiles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
