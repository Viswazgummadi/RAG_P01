0.5  This standard takes due account of the
information collected from authoritative sources
such as the Directorate of Storage and Inspection,
Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and Civil
Supplies Departments of various States which are
custodians of food grain stored on behalf of the
Government. Information has also been collected<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Owing to paucity of proper food grain
storage structures, the Government and trade
organizations
store
food
grain,
in
an
emergency, in any building which they can
easily
acquire.
Such
emergencies
have
frequently arisen in various parts of the
country during the last decade, particularly
because of the sudden heavy arrivals of food
grain at places where it was not possible to
construct storage structures at short notice.
Furthermore, even if construction of storage
structures was possible, it was not undertaken
for the simple reason that they might not have
permanent utility. Since structures, thus
acquired, are not essentially built for the
storage of food grain, they lack in many
essential requirements for such storage, due to
which the food grain stored in them is liable to
suffer heavy losses. It is, therefore, obvious that
in all acquired storage structures, which are
not originally constructed for such purpose but
utilized for it, either temporarily or on a long
term basis, certain measures should be adopted
in order that the desired level of proper
conditions both in respect of the surroundings
of such structures as well as in their
constructional features may be maintained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  With
a
view
to
assisting
in
the
improvement of existing defective food grain
storage structures, the preparation of this
standard code was taken up at the instance of
the Government of India. It is hoped that by
observing the various practices detailed in this
code, the losses to stored food grain will be
minimized to a large extent, which will finally
result in not only saving to the storage
organizations concerned but also in increasing
the food grain supply of the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  In addition to this aspect of improvement of
existing defective food grain storage structures,
the food grain itself has, during handling in
transit or storage, to be looked after carefully
and in a scientific manner. Likewise, the
structures in which food grain is stored have to
be of a desired standard. The Bureau of Indian
Standards has brought out a series of
standards for handling in transit and storage of
food grain and also for the construction of food
grain storage structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_3>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 609 - 1955<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>from various trade agencies associated with the
storage of food grain.
0.6  In this standard, particular attention has
been paid to the fact that while suggesting
methods for improvement of existing defective
food grain storage structures, it is not either
possible or economically feasible to re-build
entirely the whole or part of the storage
structure. The various practices given in this
standard are, therefore, only of such a nature
as could be easily adopted without bringing
about any radical change in the storage
structure itself. Nevertheless, it is considered
that the changes suggested herein, would be
adequate to provide sufficient protection to the
stored food grain from ravages by insects,
dampness or moisture and rats. It may also be
mentioned that the intention in prescribing the
various
practices
for
improvement
and
maintenance of each part of the storage
structure is to serve as a guide in the selection
of such of the practices as may be applicable to
the storage structure under consideration.
0.6.1  For easy reference, a classified index is
provided at the end of this standard giving
relevant clause references pertaining to the
various practices embodied in this standard for
safeguarding the various parts of the storage
structure against the ingress of insects, rats,
dampness or moisture and birds.
0.7  It may be added that this is the first
co-operative attempt in India for the formulation
of this standard, as well as other standards
mentioned above, in the field of food grain
storage. With the growing popularity of modern
methods, it may be necessary to revise this as
well as other standards in the series in the light
of the experience and technique that may become
available hereafter. The Indian Standards
Institution will welcome any suggestions or
comments as a result of such experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.8  In this standard, it has been assumed that
the work of improvement of the defective food
grain storage structure, which will mainly be of
the nature of repairs, cleaning, levelling of
ground, etc, would be done according to the
prevailing codes and, therefore, the various
engineering practices connected with such work
have not been given. However, wherever it has
been considered desirable to elaborate any such
practices, care has been taken to include such
elaboration in this standard.

<<HEADING level=3>>METHOD FOR TREATMENT OF RAT BURROWS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1. MATERIAL
A-1.1  There are a number of products marketed
under different proprietary names which on
exposure to atmosphere liberate hydrocyanic
acid gas. These products are sealed in air-tight
containers. Any one of these proprietary
products could be utilized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2. PRECAUTIONS FOR HANDLING
THE MATERIAL
A-2.1  Hydrocyanic acid gas is an extremely
dangerous poison and so also the material evolving
it. The material shall, therefore, be handled only by
skilled hands. Anybody who is not trained or is not
confident in handling the material shall not<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 609 - 1955<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>wind may interfere with smooth handling of the
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>attempt to do so. The material shall not be touched
with bare hands nor allowed to spill anywhere.
When the material is not in use, the lid of the
container shall be kept tightly closed and the edges
of lid sealed with plasticine. The lid of the
container shall never be opened inside a building.
When not in use, the container shall be kept under
lock and key in the custody of a responsible person.
After the use of the material, the hands, spoons and
any
other
article
which
may
have
been
contaminated
with
the
material
shall
be
thoroughly washed and dried. If any article of food
is suspected of having been contaminated with the
material, the article shall be buried under the
supervision of a responsible person.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1  Thoroughly wash hands and completely
dry them. Take a clean dry piece of cloth and tie
it round the face so as to cover the nostrils and
the mouth but not the eyes. Place the container
containing the material (  see   A-1  ), two table
spoons and sufficient quantity of freshly
prepared mud near the opening of the rat
burrow on its leeward side. Sit near the
opening of the rat burrow with the face turned
towards the windward side. Open the lid of the
container, quickly take out a table-spoonful of
the material, close the lid of the tin, introduce
the powder taken in the spoon into the rat
burrow and close the opening of the rat burrow
with mud and then plug with a piece of hard
stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3. PROCEDURE
A-3.0  Choose a fairly breezy day for the
operation. Still days are dangerous and too much<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>METHODS FOR DISINFESTATION OF VACANT FGSS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>material on the surface is uniform. During the
process of dusting of a bag storage structure,
keep all the openings such as doors, windows,
ventilators, etc, closed, while in case of a bulk
storage structure, manhole may be kept open
for permitting light.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-0. GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-0.1  Disinfestation of vacant FGSS may be
done by any one of the three methods, namely
dusting, smoking or fumigation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-0.1.1  Dusting can be done of any FGSS,
smoking only of those FGSS which can be made
reasonably air-tight, while fumigation of only
those which can be made perfectly air-tight.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-1.4 Precautions  — The operators shall
wash and dry their hands, neck and other parts
of the body likely to be exposed when wearing
the over all and the mask, prior to starting the
procedure for dusting (  see   B-l.3  ) as well as
after it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-0.2  During any one of these three operations,
no spectator shall be allowed inside the FGSS.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-1. DUSTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2. SMOKING
B-2.1 Material  — A suitable formulation of
BHC which on ignition gives out smoke charged
with BHC fumes, may be used. (A number of
such formulations are available in the market
and contain instructions for their dosage,
method of ignition, etc).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-1.1 Material  — BHC dust containing 0.65
percent gamma isomer (  see  IS : 561-1955 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.2 Equipment
B-1.2.1  Duster  — According to the area to be
dusted, a hand bellow duster, a rotary dust
blower or a power duster may be used.
B-l.2.2  Dust
Respirator ,
Mask
and
an
Overall —  Each operator shall be provided with
a suitable dust respirator, a mask to protect his
eyes from the dust and an overall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.2 Procedure  — Close all the openings of the
FGSS leaving one open for the operator to come
out. Paste strips of gummed paper on, or mud
plaster, all the points in the openings from which
smoke is likely to escape. Ascertain that barring
the one opening left open for the operator to walk
out, the FGSS has been made reasonably, air-tight.
Take the requisite quantity of the material
(  see  B-2.1   ) and put it on a piece of galvanized steel
sheet. Place this steel sheet together with the
material in the centre of the FGSS. Ignite
the material. Wait and ascertain that the material
has been well-ignited so that it would not later
remain half-burnt, and also that the smoke has
started to evolve in copious quantities. After
ascertaining these points, leave the FGSS through<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-1.3 Procedure  — Calculate the quantity
of the material required to be dusted at the rate
of 25 g per 100 cm 2  surface area of the floor,
walls and the ceiling and weigh out this
quantity. Charge the chamber of the duster
according to its capacity from time to time with
quantities taken out of the weighed material
and work the duster in a manner so that its
nozzle is at a reasonable distance from the
surface to be dusted and the deposit of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 609 - 1955<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the one opening left for the purpose. Close and lock
the opening and then mud plaster the chinks in
this opening also, ensuring that the smoke may not
escape from any point in the structure. Keep the
FGSS closed till the following morning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the FGSS from which vapours of the fumigant
are likely to escape. Calculate the quantity of the
fumigant required for the inside space of the
FGSS at the rate of 325 g per 1 m 3 . Take out this
calculated quantity in suitable number of
buckets. Give one bucket to each operator and
ask the operators to quickly throw the fumigant
on
the
floor,
all
the
operators
working
simultaneously. After all the quantity of the
fumigant has been thrown on the floor, the
operators shall immediately leave the FGSS
through the one opening left open for this
purpose. Close and lock this opening.  Before
locking the opening, ensure that no operator has
been left inside the FGSS . Mud plaster all the
possible points of leakage of fumigant vapours in
this opening. Put danger labels on the structure
at various points with the following minimum
cautionary words:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3. FUMIGATION
B-3.1 Fumigant  — EDCT (  see  *IS : 634 ).
B-3.2 Equipment
B-3.2.1  Gas Mask  (  Canister Respirator  ) —
Each operator shall be provided with a suitable
gas mask. A gas mask of the type given below is
considered suitable:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A face-piece covering the eyes, nose and mouth,
connected to a canister containing absorbent
material for the vapours of EDCT, by means of
a flexible non-kinking breathing tube and
arranged with valves so that all air inhaled by
the wearer passes through the canister and the
exhausted air passes direct to the surrounding
atmosphere through a non-return valve. The
canister containing the absorbent material
should have a warning indicating the number
of hours for which it could be used effectively in
an atmosphere charged with EDCT vapour.
B-3.2.2  Buckets  — sufficient number depending
upon the quantity of the fumigant to be used
(  see   B-3.4  ).
B-3.3 Precautions  — Fumigation shall be done
under the supervision of an experienced and
responsible person and the operators shall be
well trained. The operators shall wear gas masks
when handling the fumigant (  see  B-3.1  ).
B-3.4 Procedure  — Close all the openings of the
FGSS, leaving one open for the operators to come
out. Paste strips of gummed paper on, or mud
plaster, all the points in the openings and in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>“DANGER — UNDER FUMIGATION”
Ascertain after an hour that no fumigant
vapour leaks from any of the points in the
FGSS. (If there is leakage from a point, odour
like that of chloroform would be perceptible
there.) Seal such points with strips of gummed
paper or mud plaster. Keep the structure closed
for at least 48 hours. After the expiry of this
period, unlock the opening by which the
operators had left the FGSS after spreading the
fumigant, and push or pull it wide open and
run away to a distance not less than 15 m from
the opening. Keep it open for at least 4 hours.
During this 4 hours’ period maintain a watch so
that nobody is allowed to come within a radius
of 15 m from the opening. After the expiry of
these 4 hours, let two operators (wearing gas
masks) enter the FGSS. They should then open
all the other openings. The operators should
then leave the FGSS. Keep the FGSS open for a
period of another 6 hours. Do not allow any
person to enter the FGSS during these 6 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
