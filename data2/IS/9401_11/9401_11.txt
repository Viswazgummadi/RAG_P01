<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement
of Work
of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee, RVD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 11) (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Measurement
of Work of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee
had been approved by the
River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In measurement
of works relating to river valley projects a large diversity of methods exist according to local
practices. The lack of uniformity
creates complications
regarding measurements
and payments.
This standard
is, therefore, being formulated
in different parts, covering each type of works separately. This part is intended
to provide a uniform basis for measuring
the work done in respect of diaphragm walls in river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1990. With the experience
gained by its usage and by the revision
and
updation of related standards, it was necessary to revise the standard so as to bring it in line with current field
practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of measurements
made in accordance
with this standard, if the final value, observed or
calculated,
is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (revised)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
