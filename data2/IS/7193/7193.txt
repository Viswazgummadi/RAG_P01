Committee,

<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft finalized by the Water-Proofing
and Damp-Proofing
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Glass fibre bitumen felts are suitable for use for water-proofing
and damp-proofing
in buildings
and other situations
where penetration
of moisture
is to be stopped.
This standard
specifies the
requirements
for glass fibre base bitumen feIts.
It is an adjunct to IS 1322  :  1993 Specification
for bitumen felts for water-proofing
and damp-proofing
(fourth
revision ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is the first revision of the standard.
In this standard
testing
methods
to ascertain the physi-
cal properties
of glass fibre tissue have been added.
All references
have also been updated to take
care of latest revision of the referred
standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given to international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating it to
the practices
in the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard
is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test
or analysis,
shall be
rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value
should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

On releasing
the pendulum,
the centre tongue of the specimen
is subjected

<<HEADING level=3>>C-4.2.1  With a template,
cut

the specimen itI the clamps with the bottom edge
carefully set against the stops.
Make the initial

Depress the pendulum
stop quickly as far
as it will go to release
the pendulum.
Hold
down the stop until after the tear is completed
and catch the pendulum
on the return
swing
without disturbing the position of the painter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-5.2  Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The apparatus

across
the mat, and means of measuring the volume of
