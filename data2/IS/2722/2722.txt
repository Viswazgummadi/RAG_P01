FOREWORL,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Insti-
tution on 20 June
1964,
after the draft finalized
by the Construction
Plant
and Machinery
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Building
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 \\‘eighbatching
is essential to achieve accurate
proportioning
of  materials
for concrete
by effecting
good control
in the measurement
of sand,
coarse
aggregate
and cement
as it overcomes
the variation
in density
due to bulk-,
ing of materials.
Weighbatching
is considered
a normal
practice
these
days for the production
of controlled
quality
concrete.
Weighbatching
may
be done either by devices fitted integrally
with the mixing equipment
or by
independent
units.
In the absence
of integral
weighing
dcyices,
which are
not very common
in this country
at present,
portable
swing weighbatchers
can be usefully employed
for weighbatching
of materials
and can be used
even on small single mixer jobs.
This standard
is intended
to deal with  the
essential
features of this type of weighbatcher
to serve as guidance
to  both
manufacturirs
and purchasers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for
the
preparation
of
this
standard
has taken
into consideration
the views of producers,
consumers
and technologists
and has related
the standard
to the manufacturing
and
trade
practices
followed in the country
in this field.
Due weightage
has
also been given to the need for international
co-ordination
among standards
prevailing
in different
countries
of the world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This
standard
is one of a series of
Indian
Standard
specifications
covering
machinery
for manufacture
of concrete.
