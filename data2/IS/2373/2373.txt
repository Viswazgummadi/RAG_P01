<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Third

was
adopted
by the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
27
I:cb~uary
1981,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Sanitary
Appliances
and
Water
Fittings
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
was first
published
in i9G3 and
the
first
and
second
revisions
were
issued
in 1968 and
1973 respectively.
.A third
revision
of
the standard
has been
taken
up to review
the
standard
and
incorporate
changes
found
necessary
in
the
light
of
comlnents
received
from
manufacturers
and
users
during
the
course
of
implementation
of
the
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
In this revision,
minimum

clauses
4.6.1,4.6.2,
4.12 and 6.2 which
permit

expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with

<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Classification
of Tests  -Tests
shall be classified into three groups,
namely (a) proudction routine tests, (b) type tests, and (c) acceptance
tests.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.1  Productio,l Routine Tests -.  These
tests are carried
out on each
and every
meter to check the requirements
which are likely
to vary
during production (see 8.3 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2
Type Tests -
These tests are carried out to prove conformity to
the requirements
of the relevant
specification.
These
are intended to
check the generai quality and design of a given type of meter (see 8.4 ).
Once a  meter has undergone type tests, any major or essential alterations,
which the manufacturer
intends to make, shall be reported to the testing
authority and further type tests shall be carried out in accordance with
the procedure laid down in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.3  Acceptance Tests -
Tests carried out on samples selected from A lot
for the purposes of acceptance of the lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Samples
for  Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1 Type  Tests -
Two meters in the case of 50 mm size and one meter
in the case of 80 mm size and above shall be sent along with 4 copies of
the manufacturer’s
detailed
specification
together
with figures for the
loss of head and accuracy
curves to the recognized testing authority for
the purpose of type test.
The samples shall be picked up at random
from stock or routine factory production.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

routine tests outlined in 8.3,
the type tests shall comprise
those given in 8.4.1 and 8.4.2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.1  Construction -
The
nleter shall
be dismantled
completely
to its
component
parts
and checked
for conformity
with regard
to dimensions
and tolerances
with this standard;
in the case of meters
of 50 mm size,
only one meter
need be dismantled.
A study of the details of assembly
shall be made on matters,
such as case of assembly,
absence of riveted
or
turned
over
parts,
forced
fitting
and liability
of.parts
to break during
dismantling
and assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.2
Flow Test -The

( both the meters
in the case of 50 mm
size ) shall then be subjected
to the flow test to measure
the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(see 5.3.1  )  and recommended
capacity
at intermediate
