<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part VII ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 23 February 1981, after the draft finalized by the Illuminating
Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved by the Electrotechnical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This part ( Part VII ) of the code is brought out so as to provide guide
lines to the public lighting authorities for preparations
of lighting installa-
tion scheme for Group ‘F’ roads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard (Part
VII  )  has been prepared in pursuance of 0.4 of
IS:1944 (Parts I and II)-1970*. Revision of IS: 1944 (Parts I and II)-1970*
is also under the consideration
of the Committee and it is intended that
Part I of the revised IS  :  1944 should cover general principles and subsequent
parts should deal with the requirements
for various groups of roads as per
the standard classification.
This standard will, therefore, after the revision
of IS  :  1944  (  Parts I and II )-1970* is completed, have the following parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This part of the code deals with functions,
appearance
and design
requirements of Group F road lighting.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 It includes special requirements for road lighting for roads in vicinity
of aerodromes, railways, docks and navigable waterways, additional to the
general requirements of other parts of the code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 For the purpose of this code, terms provided in IS: 1944 (Parts I and

IN THE VICINITY OF AERODROME<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 General Requirements<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1 Where a proposed
road lighting scheme is within 5 km of the
boundary of an aerodrome it is essential that appropriate aviation authority
is consulted regarding any restrictions and precautions to be observed that
may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2  The aviation authority may have a specific interest in the pattern
of the layout, the mounting height, the colour and intensity, distribution
of
light emitted above the horizontal
so that lighting installation
does not
present the danger to the air navigation.
The following points should,
therefore, be kept in view while designing lighting scheme in the vicinity of
the aerodromes:
a) The light provided in the vicinity of an aerodrome shall be properly
screened so as to avoid any glare which may otherwise endanger
safety of an aircraft arriving and departing from an aerodrome.

pilots.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. ROAD LIGHTING
IN VICINITY
OF RAILWAYS,
DOCKS
AND
NAVIGABLE
WATERWAYS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Itroduction
-  The lighting for roads in the vicinity of railways, docks
and navigable waterways because of the coiour of the light source may
interfere with the proper recognition of signal system.
It is essential that
this is avoided, but local conditions vary so widely that it is not possible
to lay down any rigid code applicable to ail circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The .foiiowing requirements
are likely to apply in all places where
roads are so located that their lighting installation may affect the operation
of railways, docks and navigable waterways.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1  Consultations -
It  is essential that prior consuitatiofi
is made with
the appropriate
authorities
regarding any special provision that may be
necessary.
These provisions
should be met in a way that is mutually
acceptable so that they may be incorporated
at the design stage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2  Colour -  Where any form of Iroad lighting is employed there is a
risk of confusio? with signal light.
This may necessiate careful selection of
light source,
siting of iuminaires
or the use of appropriate
screened
luminaire at certain points and heights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3 G/are  and Masking -
the road may fail in line with
The position of individual light source on
signal lights and even when fairly remote
may mask them or make them difficult to recognize or hamper the vision
because of glare.
If these cannot
be avoided by re-siting, it may be
necessary to employ screening to obviate the interference even though the
coiour of the light source is not objectionable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4  Screening -  In ail cases. where screening of a light source
i.z
required this should preferably be achieved by means of properly
designed
iuminaires and not by addition of unsightly screens to normal iuminaire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.5  Siting -  If the road is bordered by water (lake river 0; canal) and
if the lighting is single sided, it is recommended that the columns be sited if
possible, on the waterside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
