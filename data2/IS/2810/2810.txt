Rayleigh
Wave -
Dispersive surface wave in which element has
retrograding
elliptic orbit with one major vertical and one minor horizon-
tal component both in plane of propagation velocity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>VR  = velocity of Rayleigh wave = a vt with 0.910 < a < 0.995
for 0.25 < v < 0.50<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a = angle of obliquity,

<<PARAGRAPH>>at  = propagation velocity of transverse waves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Rejected
( or Refracted)
Wave -
Components
of wave
incident
upon second medium
and reflected
into first medium (or refracted into
second medium ).<<HEADING_END>>

Shear Wave (Rotational  Equivoluminal  )  -
Wave in which medium
changes shape without change of volume (shear plane wave in isotropic
medium is transverse wave ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.78.5
Transverse
Wave -
Wave in which the direction
of displacement
of element of medium is parallel to wave front.
The propagation velocity
vt is calculated
as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
G  =  shear modulus,
p = mass density,
v = Pois.9on’s ratio,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E = Young’s
modulus, and
p =  Lame’s  constant.<<HEADING_END>>
