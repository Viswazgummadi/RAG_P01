FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Part 10 ) ( Third
Revision
) which
is identical
with ISO
6157-2:1995
‘Fasteners
— Surface
discontinuities
— Part 2: Nuts’ issued
by the International
organization
for Standardization
( ISO ) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on the recommendation
of the Bolts,
Nuts and
Fasteners
Accessories
Sectional
Committee
and approval
of the Basic
and
Production
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The concerned
Technical
Committee
has reviewed
the Scope
of this particular
standard
and decided
that application
of this standard
may be extended
to ‘Product
Grade
C’ products
also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
was originally
published
in 1961 and subsequently
revised
in 1967 and 1979. The
last
revision
was
based
on lSO/DIS
61 57/11-1979.
Consequent
upon
revision
of IS 6157-2
the Sectional
Committee
decided
to revise
this
standard
aligning
with
ISO 6157-2:1995
by adoption
under
dual
numbering
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The text
of ISO Standard
has been
approved
as suitable
for publication
as Indian
Standard
without
deviations.
Certain
terminology
and conventions
are, however,
not identical
to those
used in the Indian
Standards.
Attention
is drawn
especially
to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wherever
the words
‘International
Standard’
appear
referring
to this standard,
they should
be
read as ‘Indian
Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Comma
( , ) has been used as a decimal
marker
while in Indian Standards,
the current
practice
is to use a point
( . ) as the decimal
marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this
adopted
standard,
reference
appears
to certain
International
Standards
for
which
Indian
Standards
also exist. The corresponding
Indian
Standards
which
are to be substituted
in their
places
are listed

Cracks<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A crack is a clean (crystalline)
fracture
passing
through
or across the grain boundaries
and may possibly
follow
inclusions
of foreign
elements.
Cracks
are normally
caused
by overstressing
the
metal
during
forging
or other
forming
operations,
or during
heat treatment,
or may have been present
in the raw material<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where
parts are subjected
to significant
reheating,
cracks are usually discolored
by scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
