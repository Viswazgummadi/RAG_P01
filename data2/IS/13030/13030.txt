<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This Indian Standard was adopted
by the  Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Rock
Mechanics Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The presence of pores in fabric of a rock material decreases its strength and increases its deformability.
A
small volume fraction of pores can produce an appreciable mechanical effect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Information on the porous nature of rock materials is frequently
omitted from petrological descriptions but
is required if these descriptions
are to be used as a guide
to mechanical
performance. Sand stones and
carbonate rocks in particular
occur with a wide range of porosities and hence of mechanical character;
igneous rocks that have been weakened by weathering processes also have typically high porosities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Most rocks have similar grain densities and therefore have porosity
and dry density values that are highly
correlated. A low density rock is usually highly porous.
It is often sufficient, therefore, to quote values for
porosity alone but a  complete
description requires .values for both porosity and density.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Different
methods of determination of density and porobity described in the standard are suitable for
different types of rocks and sample, While method
using saturation and caliper technique and using satu-
ration and buoyancy technique are suitable for regular and irregular shape of sample respectively of those
rocks which do not appreciably swell or disintegrate when immersed in water, the method using mercury
displacement
and grain specific gravity technique is suitable for irregular shape of such rock which are
liable to swell or disintegrate when immersed in water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These methods are based on the suggested method of International Society of Rock Mechanics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the results of a test or analysis made
in accordance
with this standard, if the final value,
observed or calculated, is to be rounded
off, it shall be done
in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for
rounding off numerical values (  rsvised )‘-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the shape and
size of lumps suiting the capabilities

volume measuring apparatus. The minimum
size of each
lump should preferably
be
either
such that
its mass exceeds 50 g or
such that its minimum dimension is at least
10 times the maximum
grain size,
which-
ever is the greater.
Specimen and swelling

to retain water content to within 1 percent
of its in  situ  value prior to testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>It is preferable
to use self-indicating
silica
gel as the desiccant.
Metallic
mercury
is a toxic
material
and
should be handled
with considerable
care.
It is principally
absorbed via the respira-
tory tract as elemental mercury vapour but
there is also some absorption through the
gastro-intestinal
tract. Spillages are difficult
toclean up completely owing to the propen-
sity of the substance,
if left, to divide into
miniscue
globules
which
can
generate
unacceptably high levels of mercury vapour
in the atmosphere of a room. Tests should
be carried out in fume cupboard to avoid
accumulation
of vapour, and mercury spil-
lages should be liberally
sprinkled
with
powdered sulphur which takes up the metal-
lic
mercury
to
form
the
less volatile
sulphide.
The density
of some non-reactive
liquids
may vary appreciably.
It is essential that
a consistent
source of liquid
is used for
each test and that volumes are adjusted in
the constant temperature bath.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
