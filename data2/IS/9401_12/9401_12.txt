<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement
of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee,
RVD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Part
12 ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized
by the Measurement
of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had been
approved
by the River Valley Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In measurement
of works of river projects
a large diversity of methods
exist at present
according
to local
practices.
This lack of uniformity
creates complications
regarding measurements
and
payments.
Keeping in view the large amount of financial outlay involved in river
valley
projects
and also the fact that the authorities
responsible for completing
these projects, are of the state
level or national level, it is felt that a suitable
methodology
is needed
for adopting
uniform
practices
towards
the measurement
of works so that
the scope of complications
and misinter-
pretation
of items of work is reduced, as far as possible.
This standard is intended
to provide
a
uniform
basis for measuring
the work done in respect of topographical
surveys for river valley
projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied with
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical values (  revised )‘.
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
