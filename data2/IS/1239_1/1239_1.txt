<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian Standard
( Part 1 ) ( Fifth Revision
) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
on  ’20  Aprill
990,
after
the draft
finalized
by the
Steel Tubes,
Pipes,
and
Fittings
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1958 and subsequently
revised in 1964, 1968, 1973 and 1979
respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision,
the following
main modifications
have been made:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

current
test
as a
part
of
non-destructive
testing
has
been
introduced
in
this
specification
as an
alternate
to
hydraulic
test
based
on
the international
practice
and
experience
gained
in
the
country.
Other
methods
of
non-destructive
testing
may
be
considered
for inclusion
in lhe specification , as and
when sufficient experience
is gained in
the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requirements
of sockets nave been deleted
from this Indian Standard
and are being covered
suitably
through
amendment
No. 2 to IS 1239 ( Part 2 ) :1982.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reference
has been given to IS 10748:1984
for manufacture
of steel tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where
the use of tubes is not controlled
by bvelaws or regulations,
a reference
should be made
to the code of practice
relating
to the particular’
application’:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this country,
the regulations
governing
the use of tubes for conveying
steam are laid down
in the Indian
Boiler Regulations
published
by the Central
Boilers Board.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While formulating
this standard,
due consideration
has been given to the trade practices
followed
in the country
in this field.
Due consideration
has also been given to international
coordination
among
the standards
prevailing
in different
countries.
Assistance has
been
derived
from
the
following
publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

However,
in
the case of ‘light’
tubes,
the application

modified
by permitting
the outside diameter
of
the
tubes
to
be
within
the
limits
shown
in
CO1 2
and

of
Table

Where
the
tube
approaches
the lower limit of outside diameter,
some incomplete
thr,eads (perfect
“at root
and
imperfect
at the crest ) may
be expected
from
and beyond
the gauge
plane.
Such incomplete
threads
shall not
be
regarded
as justification
for rejection
of the tubes.
Also,
the  minimum

of threads
in
‘light:

adjusted
to produce
in a consistent

a
clearly
identifiable
signal
from

and
the

needed; if the review indicates that changes are needed, it is taken up for revision. Users of Indian Standards
should ascertain that they are in possession of the latest amendments or edition by referring to the latest issue
of ‘BIS Catalogue’ and ‘Standards : Monthly Additions’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
