FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Part
XVII
) was adopted by the
Indian
Standards Institution
on 31 March
1977, after the draft finalized by the
Terminology
Relating
to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee
had
been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  A ilumber of Indian
Standards
have already been printed covering
various aspects of river valley projects and a large number of standards are
in the process of formulation.
These standards include technical terms, the
precise definitions of which are required to avoid ambiguity in their inter-
pretation.
To achieve this end, the Institution is bringing out this glossary
of terms relating
to river valley
projects
( IS  :  4410 ) which is being
published in parts.
The other parts of this standard so far published are
given on P 10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3  Part XVII
covers the important field of water requirements of crops.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination among the standards and practices prevailing in
different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country.
