FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
( First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 24 January
1980, after the draft
finalized
by the
Flooring
and Plastering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard
was first published
in 1959.
The
present
revision
has
been taken up with a view to keeping
abreast
with the experience
gained
while applying
the provisions
of the earlier
version
and also to bringing
in
further
additions
and modifications
in the light of comments
received
from
manufacturers
and users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
The sizes specified
in the standard
are the existing
metric
sizes
which form the bulk of current
production
in the country.
The concept
of
adopting
dimensionally
co-ordinated
sizes
is being
excluded
from
this
revision,
however
it is intended
to incorporate
them
if the opportunity
occurs dur’ng
future
revisions
of the standard.
The permissible
wear of tiles
have been ‘ncreased
based on actual
observations
and consequently
a larger
1
thickness
ofwearing
layer has been permitted.
A method
to measure
the
thickness
of the wearing
layer has also been
introduced.
The
method
of
test for abrasion
resistance
has been
modified
by which
the tiles may be
abraded
in all possible
directions.
Additional
physical
tests like flatness,
perpendicularity
and
straightness
hasbeen
specified
which
might
help in
improving
the quality.
The
requirements
of abrasion
powder
has been
modified
to suit the indigenous
manufacturers.
Fresh
sampling
plan has
been
introduced
from
which
plans
can
be
selected
for
inspection
by
attributes
and
for inspection
by count of defects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and
practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this  country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  The colour and texture of the wearing layer shall be uniform through-
out its thickness.
No appreciable
difference
in the appearance
of the
tiles, from the point of view of colour of aggregate, its type and its distri-
bution  on  the surface of the wearing layer shall be present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -When
indenting
for plain
cement
and plain
coloured
tiles, the
purchaser
should
specify
the colour
by the code number of the appropriate
or
nearest matching
colour given in IS  :  1650-1973’.
It should be noted that due to the
nature of the product,
the range of colours for flooring tiles is limited
and the tiles
may not be produced
to match
all the colours specified in IS  :  1650-1973*.
Pur-
chasers are recommended
to consult the manufacturers
while selecting the colours of
tiles which they wish to procure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
2 -Exact
matching of the shade of the colour may not be always possible
in actual manufacture.
There may be some variations
in colour in different batches
due to variations
in the basic colour of raw materialsr
_<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 When indenting for terrazo tile, the purchaser shall state the size of
chips to be used in the wearing layer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -^ Iwis recommended
that the purchaser should consult
the design cards
of the mar&facturers
while specifying the size of chips.
It is hardly possible to cover
the colour for terrazo tiles in a comprehensive
chart since numerous colour composi-
tions are possible.
‘Ihe colour patterns
will not only vary with the colour used but
also with the sizes of chips and their distribution,
and its choice is left to the mutual
agreement
between the purchaser
and the supplier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.0 The tests on tile shall not be carried out earlier than 28 days from
the c te of manufacture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

-
When tested in accordance
with the procedure

The grinding
path of the disc of the abrasion
testing
machine
( see  F-2 )  shall be evenly
strewn
with 20 g.of the abrasive
powder.
The
specimen
shall then be fixed in the holdin, u device with the surface
to be
ground
facing
the disc, and
loaded
at the centre
with
300 N ( 30 kgf).
The grinding
disc shall then be put in motion
at a speed of 30 rev/min
and
the abrasive
powder
is continuously
fed back
on to the grinding
path
so
that it remains
uniformly
distributed
in a track corresponding
to the width
of the test piece.
After
every
22 revolutions,
the disc shall
be stopped,
the abraded
tile powder
and
the remainder
of the abrasive
powder
shall
be removed
from the disc, and fresh abrasive
powder
in quantities
of 20 g
applied
each
time.
After
every
22 revolutions
the specimen
shall
be
turned
about
the vertical
axis through
an angle
of 90’ in the clockwise
direction
and it should
be repeated
9 times
thereby
giving
total
number
of revolutions
of 220.
The
disc, the abrasive
powder
and
the specimen
shall be kept dry throughout
the duration
of the test.
After
the abrasion
is over, the specimen
shall
be reweighed
to the nearest
0.1 g.
It shall
then
be placed

that the tile has chipped off at any of the points of measurement,
that measurement
should be discarded
