<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(Part
XX)
was adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards Institution
on 21 February
1983, after the draft finalized
by
the Terminology
Relating
to River Valley Projects Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number of Indian Standards
have already been published covering
various
aspects
of river
valley
projects and a large number of similar
standards
are in the process of formulation.
These standards
include
technical
terms, the precise definitions of which are required
to avoid
ambiguity
in their interpretation.
To achieve
this end, the Committee
is bringing out this standard.
