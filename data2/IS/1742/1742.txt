FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 The Indian
Standard
( Second
Revision
) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 November
1983,
after the draft
finalized
by
the Water
Supply and Sanitation
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard,
published
in 1960 and subsequently
revised in 1972 was
intended
to bring
out a long felt uniformity
in the variety
of drainage
practices
followed by various
Municipal
Corporation,
Municipalities
and
other
bodies
in the country
in efficient
drainage
of surface
and
subsoil
water and sewage from buildings
to public sewers.
It is being
revised
to
incorporate
improvements
found necessary
in the light of the usage of the
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This code of practice
represents
a standard
of good przctice and, there-
fore, takes the form of recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-lC,60*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4. DESIGN CONSIDERATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Aim -
In designing
a drainage
system for individual
building(s),
the
aim shall be to provide a system of self-cleansing
conduits
for the convey-
ance of soil, waste, surface
or sub-surface
waters,
and for the removal
of
such wastes speedily and efficiently
to a sewer or other
outlet without
risk
of nuisance
and hazard to health.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1742 - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1  To achieve this aim, a drainage
system
shall satisfy the following
requirements:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4
b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rapid
and efficient
removal
of liquid wastes without leakage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prevention
of access of foul gases to the building
and provision
for their escape from the system;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4

<<PARAGRAPH>>Adequate
and easy access for cleaning
and clearing
obstructions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prevention  of  undue  external

and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Avoidance
of air
locks,
siphonage,
proneness.-
to
obstruction,
deposit and damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
realization
of an economical
drainage
system
is aided
by
_
compact
grouping
of fitments
in both
horizontal
and vertical
directions.
This implies that if care is taken
and ingenuity
brought
into play when
designing the original building
or buildings
to be drainage,
it is possible
to group
the sanitary
fittings
and other
equipment
requiring
drainage,
both in vertical and horizontal
planes
as to simplify
the drainage
system
and make it most economical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Preliminary
Data for Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.  General -
Before
the drainage
system for a building
or group of
buildings is designed
and constructed,
accurate
information
regarding
the
site conditions
is essential.
This information
may vary with
the individual
scheme but shall, in general,
be covered by the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Site plan -
A plan
of the site
to scale

Survey
Datum
indicating
the position
and lowest
floor
level of the proposed buildings,

fall, location
of wells, underground
sumps
and
other
drinking
water sources.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Detailed plans -
Plans
and
sections
of the
proposed
buildings

<<PARAGRAPH>>The
nature
of the sewage
to
be
carried.
While
dealing
with
sewage from domestic premises

problems
under
this head may not arise;
however,
note shall
be
taken
of any
possibiiity
of trade effluents
being

shall be obtained
as to the

excavated.
Subsoil
conditions
govern
the choice

of flood levels shal!
be ascertained,
as also the depth of the water

to all
sewer connections,
unless it is known to be considerably

In the case of deep manholes
this information

always be ascertained
in the case of a deep manhole.
Where
work of any magnitude
is to be undertaken,
trial pits or boreholes
shall be put at intervals along the line of proposed sewer
or drain
and the data therefrom
tabulated
together
with any information
available from previous works carried out in the vicinity.
In general,
the information
derived from trial pits is more
reliable

information
derived from a few trial pits at carefully
chosen points
may be supplemented
by that obtained
from a number
of inter-
mediate

<<HEADING level=3>>4.6.1  Gradients<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1.1
The
discharge
of water
through
a domestie
drain
is inter-
mittent and limited in quantity
and, therefore,
small accumulations
of solid
matter
are liable
to form
in the drains
between
the building
and
the
public
sewer.
There
is usually
a gradual
shifting
of these
deposits as
discharges
take
place.
Gradients
shall
be
sufficient
to prevent
these
temporary
building
up and blocking
the drains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1.2
Normaliy,
the sewer shall be designed
for discharging
three
times the dry-weather
flow flowing half-full
with a minimum
self-cleansing
velocity of 0.75 m/s.
The approximate
gradients
which give this
velocity
for the sizes of pipes likely to be used in building
drainage
and the corres-
ponding discharges
when flowing half-full
are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1.3
In cases, where
it is practically
not possible
to conform
to
the
ruling
gradients,
a flatter
gradient
may be used but the minimum
velocity in such cases shall on no account
be less than 0.61 m/s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Where gradients are restricted,
the practice
of using pipes of larger
diameter than is required by the normal flow in order to justify
laying
at a flatter
gradient does not result in increasing the velocity of flow but reduces
the depth of
flow and for this reason is to be deprecated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1.4  On
the
other
hand,
it is undesirable
to employ
gradients
giving a velocity of flow greater
than 2.4
m/s.
Where
it is unavoidable,
cast-iron
pipes shall
be used.
The
approximate
gradients
which give a
velocity
of 2.4

sizes of pipes and the corresponding

going pipe and the top edge shall be suitably
rounded
off.
The
branch
channel shall also be similarly constructed
with respect to the benching but
at their junction
with the main channel an appropriate
fall suitably rounded
off in the direction
of flow in the main channel shall be given.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

These rungs may be set
staggered in two vertical
runs which may be 380 mm apart
horizontally.
The top rung shall be 450 mm below the manhole cover and the lowest not
more than 300 mm above the benching.
The size of manhole
cover shall
be such that,there
shall be a clear opening of at least 500 mm in diameter
for manholes
exceeding
0.9 m in depth.

Drainage<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.11.1  General -
Subsoil
water
is that portion
of the rainfall which
is
absorbed
into
the
ground
and
the drainage
of subsoil water
may be
necessary
for the following
reasons:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
To increase
the stability
of the surface;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) To avoid surface flooding;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) To

or
to avoid
causing
dampness
in the
building,
especially
in the cellars;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) To reduce the humidity
in the immediate

and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) To increase

of soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.11.2
Deph of Water Table -
The
standing
level of the subsoil water
will vary with the season,
the amount
of rainfall
and the proximity
and
level of drainage
channels.
Information
shall be obtained
regarding
this
level
by
means
of boreholes
or trial
pits preferably
the
latter.
It
is
desirable
though
not
always
practicable
to
ascertain
the
level of the

water
over a considerable
period
so as to enable
the seasonal
variation
to be recorded
and
in particular
the high

Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3.1  For
pipes
other
than
cast
iron -
Glazed/stoneware
and
concrete
pipes shall be subjected
to a test pressure of at least 1.5 m head
of water
at the highest
point
of the section
under
test.
The
tolerance
figure of two litres per centimetre
of diameter
per kilometre
may be allowed
during a period of ten minutes.
The
test shall be carried
out by suitably
plugging
the low end of drain
and the ends of connections,
if any, and
Wing the system with water. A kuncklebend
shall temporarily
be jointed
in
at the top end and a sufficient length of the vertical
pipe jointed
to it so. as
to provide the required
test head
or the top end may be plugged with a
connection
to a hose ending in a funnel which
could be raised or lowered
till the
required
head
is obtained
and
fixed
suitably
for
observation.
Subsidence
of the test water
may be due to one or more of the following
causes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Absorption
by pipes and joints,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Sweating
of pipes or joints,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Leakage
at joints
or from defective pipes, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Trapped
air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Allowance
shall be made
for (a) by adding
water until absorption
has ceased
after which
the test proper
should
commence.
Any leakage
will be visible and the defective
part of the work should be cut out and
made good.
A slight amount
of sweating
which is uniform
may be over-
looked,
but
excessive
sweating
from
a particular
pipe or joint
shall be
watched for and taken as indicating
a defect to be made good.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to prevent
their
being
forced out of the pipe during
the
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Tests for Straightness and Obstruction -
The
following
tests shall be
carried
out:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) by inserting
at the high end of the sewer or drain
a smooth ball
of a diameter
13 mm less than the pipe bore.
In the absence
of
obstruction,
such as yarn or mortar
projecting
through
the joints,
the ball should roll down the invert of the pipe and emerge
at the
lower end; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) by means
of a mirror
at one end of the line and lamp
at the
other.
If the pipeline
is straight,
the full circle of light may be
observed.
If the pipeline
is not straight,
this will be apparent.
The mirror will also indicate
obstruction
in the barrel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
