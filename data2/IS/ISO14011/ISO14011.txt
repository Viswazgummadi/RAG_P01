<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard which is identical with IS0 14011 : 1996 ‘Guidelines for environmental
auditing-Audit
procedures-Auditing
of environmental
management systems’, issued by the International
Organization
for
Standardization
(ISO), was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on the recommendations
of Water
Environmental
Protection Sectional Committee (CHD 12) and approved by the Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard has been prepared by Technical Committee lSO/TC 207 Environmental Management.
The text of the IS0 Standard
has been approved
as suitable for publication
