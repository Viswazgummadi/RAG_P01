FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part I ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 20 November
1967, after the draft finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engi-
neering
Division
Council,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This part deals with the method
for comparison
of the bond resistance
of different
types of reinforcing
bars with concrete
by pull-out
test.
The
l3eanl  Te.sts  for determining
the bond properties
of reinforcing
bars will be
covered subsequently
in separate
parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 ‘I’his method
of test is intended
to provide
a standardized
procedure
for
comparison
of bond
characteristics
between
concrete
and different
types of
steel reinforcing
bars.
Such determinations
may be made for any purpose,
from routine
acceptance
tests to research
testing,
in so far as applicable
to a
particular
project.
The method
is offered as one workable
procedure,
to be
employed
either in its entirety
or with modifications
to meet specific condi-
tions.
The method
may also be used with some suitable
modifications,
if
necessary,
for comparing
different
concrete
mixes for their bond characteris-
tics with steel reinforcing
bars.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1
It should,
however,
not be assumed
that the averagi
bond
stresses
calculated
from the results of such
tests have
any
direct
relation
to the
permissible
bond
stress given in Table
VI of IS  :  456-1964*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The bond strength,
or the measure of the effectiveness
of the grip between
concrete
and
steel,
has no standard
quantitat.ive
definition,
In pull-out
tests on plain
bars,
the
maximum
load
generally
rcpresenrs
the
bond
strength
that can be developed
between
the concrete
and steel.
With plain
bars the maximum
load is not very different
from the load at the first visible
slip, but in the case of the deformed
bar, the maximum
load may correspond
to a large slip which
may not in fact be obtained
in practice
before other
types of failure
occur.
It is preferable,
therefore,
when comparing
plain
and deformed
bars to determine
not only the maximum
load but also the
load at arbitrary
amounts
of slip and
also
plot
the
complete
load-slip<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2770 ( Part I ) - 1967<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>curves for the plain and deformed
bars under
comparison.
One such basis
of comparison
is the load at a relative
movement
( slip ) between
steel and
concrete
of 0,025 mm at the free end of the bar in a pull-out
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 The Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of this standard
has taken
into consideration
the Views of producers,
consumers
and tech-
nologists,
and
has related
the standard
to the manufacturing
and
tradr
practices
followed
in the country
in this field.
Due weightage
has also
been
given
to the need
for international
co-ordination
among
standards
prevailing
in
different
countries
of the
world.
These
considerations
led the Sectional
Committee
to derive assistance
from the published
docu-
ments of the following
organizations:
American
Society for Testing
and Materials
British Standards
Institution
Standards
Association
of Australia<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 This

the surface shall be struck off with a trowel
and covered
with damp
burlap
to  prevent
evaporation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
If concrete of very dry consistency
is used, the recommended

be used.
Internal
vibration
by means of a laboratory
type,
low-amplitude,
high-frequency
vibrator
is preferable.
The
concrete
shall
be placed
in the moulds
in two layers
of equal
thickness
and
each layer
shall
be vibrated
until
the concrete
is compacted.
Care shall be taken not to vibrate
the concrete
excessively,
unless this factor
is being investigated
in the tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Number
of Specimens
-
At  least
three specimens
of the deformed
bar
submitted
for test and three
comparative
specimens
of plain
bars of the
same effective cross-sectional
area as the deformed
bars under
test, shall be
prepared
and tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  Preparing Specimens
for Testing -
Top surface of the cube, which
is  the bearing
surface in the pull-out
test, shall be capped
with a thin layer
of neat cement
paste at least 24 h prior to testing,
or a thin layer of high-
strength
gypsum
plaster
shall be applied
at least 2.h prior
to testing
( see
Note  ) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - The  recommended
procedure
for capping
specimrns’is
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Align
the reinforcing
bar in the bond specimens
vertically
by use of a carprntcr’s
Icvcl.
In
this
case,
placing
the
specimens
on the base of mould
vertically
cast
snrcitncns
will facilitate
use of shims generally
required
to align bars.
Oil the 20 mm
ririllcd
steel plate
used in the pull-out
operation
and use as the capping
plate.
After
a sufficient
quantity
of capping
material
has been
placed
on the specimrn,
slip the
20 mm drilled
plate over the reinfurcing
bar and press firmly on the capping
material
lmtil
it extrudes
at all edges of the plate.
Level the drilled
plate with a carpenter‘s
level.
Removal
of the material
that
extrudes
through
the drilled
hole in the plate
before
it hardens
will aid in removing
the plate without
damage
to the cap.
UnIcss
machined
moulds
are
used
for specimens
containing
horizontally
cast bars,
it is
recommrnclrd
that they also be capped.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  TEST PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The
test specimen
shall be mounted
in a suitable
testing
machine
in
such a mhnncr
that the bar is pulled axially from the cube.
The end of the
bar at which
the pull
is  applied
shall be that which
projects
from the top
fact of the cube as cast.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1
In assembling
the testing
apparatus
on the specimen
the distance
b~~twccn the face of the concrete
and the point
on the loaded
end of the
reinforcing
bar at jvhich
the device
for measuring
slip is attached,
shall
be carefully
measured
so that the elongation
of the bar over this distance
may hc calculated
and deducted
from the measured
slip.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The load shall be applied
to the reinforcing
bar at a rate not greatcl
than
2 250 kg/mm,
or at no-load
speed of the testing
machine
head of not
greater
than
I.25
mm/min,
depending
on the type
of testing
machine
used and the means
provided
for ascertaining
or controlling
speeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The movement
between
the reinforcing
bar and the concrete
cube,
as
indicated
by the dial micrometers
shall be read at a sufficient
number
of
intervals
throughout
the test to provide
at least
15 readings
by the time<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  2770 ( Part I ) - 1967<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a  slip of 0.25 mm has occurred
at the loaded end of the bar.
The dial micro-
meters shall be read at the loaded and unloaded
ends and reading
recorded
to an cstimatcd
0.1 of the least division of the dial.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1
The loading shall be continued
and readings of movements
recorded
at appropriate
intervals
until:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the yield point of the reinforcing
bars has been reached,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I)) the enclosing
concrete
has failed
( the type of failure
shall be
noted ), or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) a minimum
slippage
of 2.5 mm has occurred
at the loaded
end.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.1
The maximum
load for each type of failure shall be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4
For the purpose of comparison
the bond resistance
of deformed bars and
plain bars,
tile comparison
of bond strengths
shall be made on the basis
of the avcragc
bond strcsscs calculated
from the loads at a measured
slip of
(PO25 mm at free end.
It is recommended
that
when comparing
plain
and deformed
bars,
the complete
load-ship curves
of both
should also be
plotted.
The following
details shall be recorded:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The load at a slip of 0.025
mm at the free end, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The load at a slip of 0.25 mm at the free end.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  CALCULATION
OF BOND
STRESS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The slip at the loaded end of the bar shall be cahulated
as the average
of the readings
of the two dial gauges,
corrected
for the elongation
of the
reinforcing
bar in the distance
between
the bearing
surface of the concrete
block and point on the reinforcin g bar at which the measuring
device was
attached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-Theoretically,
a similar correction
is required for the compression of the
concrete between the bearing surface and the point at which the yake holding the
dials is attached,
if the apparatus illustrated in Fig. 1 is used.
This movement, how-
ever, is usually very small and may be neglected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 For the purpose
of this test, the average
bond stress shall be the value
obtained
for each
specimen,
by dividing
the
applied
load
at
the
slip
specified, by the surface area of the embedded
length
of the bar; and then
taking the average value for the group of each type of bar in the test series.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1
For deformed
bars, the surface shall be calculated
from the nominal
size of the deformed
bar as specified in the relevant
standard
specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -As
per IS  :  1139-1966*,
the no&nal
size of a deformed bar is equivalent to
the diameter
or side of a plain bar having the same weight per metre run as the
deformed bar.<<HEADING_END>>
