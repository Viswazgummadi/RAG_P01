<<HEADING level=1>>( First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution on 17 December
1979, after
the draft finalixed
by the Stones Sectional
Committee
had been
approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The laterites occur in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Kerala,
Tamil
Nadu,
Maharashtra,
Karnataka,
Assam,
Goa,
Meghalaya
and Orissa and is
mainly used as building blocks for construction of masonry in building.
The term laterite stone has been applied generally
to a group of rocks,
which occur as surficial blankets.
It is the residual weathering produrts
of certain rocks containing silicates, such as basalt, granite and slate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The physical properties of this stone vary cosiderably from place to
place.
Freshly quarried
laterite is soft and porous but when exposed to
atmospheric
conditions it hardens and makes
a very tough
material.
Therefore,
it is always desirable
that these stones should be quarried
sufficiently ahead of use.
But the laterke
stone of certain
minimum
requirements
in strength,
etc, is only suitable
for masonry construction
and therefore,
a careful selection in the procurement
of this stone is
necessary
before
use.
This
standard
has therefore
been
formulated
to provide a guidance for the selection of such stone for the purpose.
This standard was first published in 1966.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in
accordance with IS  :  2-19GO*.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this stadard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The stone blocks shall be without any soft veins, cracks,
cavities,
flaws
and similar imperfections.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The blocks shall be exposed preferably
for a period
of three
months
before
being
used
in the
construction
of masonry
to ensure
adequate
stabilization
However,
exposure
to rains should be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  DIMENSIONS

( see 2 ), dimensions ( see 3 ), workmanship ( see 5 ).
Any block failing in any one or more of the above requirements
shall be
considered to be defective.
A lot shall be considered
as conforming

these requirements
if the number of defectives obtained is not more than
the permissible number of defectives given in co1 3 of Table 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 The

shall be tested for physical
properties.
For this purpose a sub-sample
of size as given in co1 4 of
Table 3 shall be selected at random.
These blocks shall be first tested
for compressive
strength
and then for water
absorption
and specific
gravity.
A lot shall be considered
to have satisfied the requirement
of
physical
properties
if none of the blocks tested for these requirements
fails in any of these tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
