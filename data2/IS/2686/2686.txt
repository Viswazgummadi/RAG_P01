FOREWORD
‘*<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
(First
Revision)
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 September
1977, after the draft finalized
by
the Building
Limes Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Cinder,
which
is available
in
plenty
as a waste
product
from
locomotives,
thermal
power
houses,
etc,
and
possessing
pozzolanic
properties
may  be advantageously
utilized
as a building
material.
Its
pozzolanic
properties
make
it particularly
suitable
as an aggregate
for
lime concrete.
Its light-weight
makes it fit for the manufacture
of precast
blocks.
However,
for satisfactory
US,  the quality
of cinderneeds
control
with regard
to chemical
composition,
soundness,
etc, and this standard
is
intended
to provide
guidance
in this respect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
This
standard
was
published
in 1964.
The
revision
has been
prepared
so as’to
keep in line with the latest
British
Standard
on this
subject.
The principal
modifications
made are in regard
to the provision
of grading
and also deleting
the requirement
of soundness
test which
is
not considered
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 It is considered
that in view of the varying
conditions
of production
of cinder
aggregate,
grading
requirements
are difficult
to be specified.
However,
average
grading
requirements
have
been
given
and
it
is
expected
that
users
may
further
crush
these
so
as
to
suit
their
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test,
shall
be rounded
cff in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

PREPARATION
OF SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.1
A quantity
of approximately
1 g of the sample
prepared
as
specified in C-2 shall be accurately
weighed and transferred to a 400-ml
conical beaker.
To this shall be added 50 ml of 2 N hydrochloric
acid,
and the solution shall then be heated to boiling point, boiled for 3 minutes,
filtered and the residue washed with hot distilled
water.
The residue
shall be discarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1 ‘?o  the filtrate
add a little filter paper pulp.
Heat the filtrate
almost
to boiling
point and make alkaline
to methyl
red indicator
by means of ammonia and simmer for half a minute.
Filter the precipitate
under gentle suction through a filter paper of medium porosity, wash once
with hot distilled
water and set aside the filtrate.
Transfer
the filter
paper  and precipitate
to a 250-ml beaker and redissolve the precipitate
in 5 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric
acid to which has been added 70 ml
hot distilled
water.
Bring
the solution
nearly
to the
boiling
and
reprecipitate
by making it alkaline to methyl red indicator with ammonia.
Filter
and wash the precipitate
as before.
Combine
the filtrates
and
reject the precipitate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2686 - 1977<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2. Boil until the combined filtrates and washings are reduced to about
200 ml, make acid with 1 ml concentrated
hydrochloric
acid and add to
the hot solution 10 ml of cold barium
chloride
solution from a pipette
held so that the liquid falls into the middle of the hot solution while this
is  rotated or shaken.
Maintain
just below boiling point for 30 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  With the excess of barium
chloride
used and under the conditions
of
precipitation,
complete
recovery of the barium sulphate can be achieved by filtering
after 30 minutes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.3
Filtei-  the  precipitate
through:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) an ashless close tkxtured double acid washed paper, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) a filter pad, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) an asbestos pad or a filter crucible dried at 105 f 5°C to constant
mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Macerate
filter paper clippings of approximately
100 mm*
or
ashless
paper  tablets with distilled water.
Form a pad about 5 mm thick on a porcelain
cone or Witt plate in a 75-mm filter funnel taking care to avoid trapping
air bubbles
beneath
the plate.
Tamp
the pad lightly with a glass rod and wash with water
before use.
When removing the barium sulphate precipitate
for ignition, place the
pad on one half of a 125-mm filter paper and use the other half to wipe the funnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.4
Wash
with distilled water until free from chloride.
After filtration
either by method
(a) or (b), fold the wet filter paper and contents  into
a
previously
ignited and weighed silica capsule, stand this on a silica
plate and place both in the mdffle furnace at 800°C.
Heat for 15  minutes,
remove
the capsule,  ~001  in a desiccator
and weigh.
After filtration
by
method
(.c) dry the crucible
and precipitate
at 105 f 5°C to constant
mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
Ignition of the wet paper and contents gives more accurate
results than
drying before ignition.
1.0~s b) shock heating is prevented by the use of the silica
plate.<<HEADING_END>>

AND PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.1  Approximately
1 g of the sample
prepared
as specified
in C-2
shall be accurately
weighed in a previously ignited and weighed shallow
silica dish.
It shall then be placed in a muffle furnace and maintained
at 775 f 25°C for 2 hours.
During the first 10 minutes the dish should
be covered with a suitable crucible lid.
After 2 hours the dish shall be
removed, allowed to cool in a desiccator and reweighed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2. EVALUATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>METHOD
OF SAMPLING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-l.  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-l.1  It is essential that the sample should represent as nearly as possible
the proportions of coarse and fine material
in the consignment;
as it is
in the latter that the more deleterious constituents are likely to be present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G-I.2
If the material to be sampled is in heaps, delivered
at the same
time and from the same source, it may be regarded
as one consignment
and a sample drawn from approximately
one out of three heaps shall
suffice. Heaps of material from different sources, or delivered at different
times from the same source shall be sampled and tested separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G-I.3
The size of the initial sample drawn will vary with the size of the
consignment.
From a consignment
of 5 to 10 tonnes an initial sample
of 15 to 20 kg will suffice, while from a consignment
of 50 tonnes or
more an initial sample of 45 to 90 kg is advisable.
For consignments
of
intermediate
weight, the size of sample should be proportionate.
In order
to ensure that a representative
sample is obtained, the procedure as given
in C-2 shall adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2686 -  1977<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-2. SAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G-2.1  The surface material shall be removed down the side of the heap
along a strip of about 30 cm width from top to bottom.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>02.2
Starting at the bottom, samples shall be taken by means of large
shovels ( scoop like ) at 60 cm intervals up to the top of the heap. These
shall be put aside for the initial
sample.
twice on different sides  of  the heap.
The process shall be repeated<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.3 Very large lumps, if present in the composition
of the sample,
shall be broken up, if necessary,
and a representative
portion taken for
the sample.
This combined
sample shall be thoroughly
mixed with a
shovel and spread out into a flat heap.
The heap shall be marked into
four equal parts with the shovel and alternate
quarters
shall be taken,
repeating this process, if necessary,
so that a sample of 10 to 15 kg is
obtained.
The sample thus obtained shall then be crushed until it passes
through 6’3-mm
IS Sieve.
The material thus passing through this sieve
shall again be mixed and the quartering
process shall be repeated
until a
sample weighing approximately
2 kg is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This 2 kg sample shall be ground to pass 850-micron
IS Sieve and
when it has all passed through the sieve, it shall be again mixed and
quartered
down to a final sample of about 25 to 45 g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.4 This final sample shall then be ground until it completely
passes
150-micron
IS Sieve. Drying of the sample, if necessary, for this purpose
shall be done over a steam-bath.
If machine grinding is used, care shall
be taken that it does not reduce the mass to an excessive fineness.
The
sample so obtained shaI1 be subjected to the desired tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
