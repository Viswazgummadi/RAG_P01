<<PARAGRAPH>>CAISSONS,

<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
(Part IV ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 15 February
1979, after the draft finalized by the Corrosion
Protection
Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Structural
and
Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The increasing
activity of the navy and the mercantile
shipping has
led to the expansion of harbour installations like dockgates, caissons, piers,
jetties,
etc.
Steel used in such structures are subjected to severe corrosive
environment
and requires
protection
to supplement
the existing paint
systems.
With
proper
cathodic
protection
systems, such structures are
expected to have much longer life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
dockgates
which
open
and close the entry to dry
docks
are
usually made of steel and require
cathodic protection
only on external
surfaces.
Caissons are buoyant steel structures for closing the entrace of wet
basins, dry docks and locks and are built with buoyancy chambers
and
ballast
tanks
containing
water which
may be adjusted
for sinking or
floating
as required.
The design of the cathodic
protection
sysem is,
therefore,
provided
on the basis of:
(a) internal
area under cotmplete
immersion,
(b) external
area, and (c) inter tidal area.
Similarly jetties
and
piers
which
remain
under
sea or river water require
cathodic
protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
( Part
IV ) deals with the requirements
of cathodic
protection
of dockgates, caissons, piers and jetties
using galvanic type of
anodes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2  This standard should be read in conjunction
with IS  :  8062 ( Part I )-
1976* and IS:
8062 ( Part III )-1977t.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  CHOICE
OF CATHODIC
PROTECTION
METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Of the two methods,
namely, the galvanic and the impressed current
system, the galvanic method is preferable to the impressed current system
for such structures.
The caisson requires additional protection by galvanic
anodes of the inside tanks/chambers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  APPLICATION
OF GALVANIC
ANODE
SYSTEM<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Anode
Material
-The
galvanic
anode material
may be made of
alloys based on magnesium,
zinc or aluminium.
The
aluminium
alloy
anode is preferable to other types of anodes for cathodic protection in view
of cost, indigenous availability
and ease of fabrication.
This may be used
in various’ sizes and shapes depending on the requirement
so as to deliver
adequate protective current to the specific structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Design
and Installation
of Anodes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1  Galvanic anodes shall be provided with steel inserts suitable for
welding orfitting
by means of studs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2
With weld-on type anodes, the projecting steel insert ends shall be
welded to the structures to be protected cathodically.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3 For studs-on type anodes, studs shall be securely welded to the
steel plates.
Nuts are used to lock the anodes.
Tack welding of the nut
to the insert is desirable.
The cavity around the stud and the nut should
be filled with putty.
The studs used should be made of mild steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.4
Adequate safety precautions
for hot-work shall be taken prior to
welding  of anodes or studs on such structures.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.23
Protective
coatings
may preferably
be applied to the structures
only after fitting of anodes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 8062 ( Part IV ) - 1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.6  Protection of Anodes During Painting -
Anodes shall be suitably
masked during painting of the structures and in no case, anode surface
shall be painted.
If any paint/coating material is found to adhere to the
anode surface, it shall be cleaned by any suitable solvent or scraped off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Mass of Anode Material<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1  The
mass of anode material required
to cathodically
protect
a
water-front
structure
from corrosion
depends
on:
(a) current
density
required per unit area of wetted surface which shall take into account
areas
remaining
permanently
immersed
and
alternately/periodically
immersed,
(b) current capacity
of the anode, and (c) period for which
cathodic protection is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2 Knowing
the current capacity
of the anode in terms of ampere
year per unit mass, the total mass of anode which is necessary for such struc-
tures may be calculated for the immersed area for one year or its multiple
till the lifting out of the structure
for maintenance/repair.
Normally,
cathodic protection is required to be provided for a period of 3-4 years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Namber and Distribution
of Anodes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1  The number of anodes depends upon the mass and dimension of
individual anodes as well as ease of handling.
The following factors also
influence the number of anodes, namely:
(a) quality and condition of paint
coating,
(b) ‘area under full immersion,
and (c) area subjected
to inter-
mittent
immersion.
Dilution
of sea water by fresh water due to heavy
rains? etc,
may cause wide fluctuation
in the requirement
of current
density.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2 The
distribution
of anodes
depends upon
the
complexity
of
structure and efforts shall be made to position the anodes in such a way
that all parts of the structure receives the required
amount
of average
current
density.
Usually,
a distance
of 3-5 m between the anodes is
considered adequate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  CURRENT
DENSITY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The
current
density
required
to protect
the wetted area of such
structures
is a variable
quantity
and may range between
10 mA and
50 mA per square metre of painted surface to be protected.
This depends
also upon the:
(a) condition of the paint applied,
(b) salinity of water,
and (c) temperature.
It should be recognized that a paint coating may
deteriorate
with time
and the structure
woul&be
in need for greater
amount of cathodic current progressively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5. LOCATION
OF ANODES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Anodes shall not be fitted in a chamber of a caisson ( internal )  at a
height greater than 27/M metre, where  M is  the gross mass ( kg ) of  the
anode including inserts, the height being measured from the  base of the
particular chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Location of anodes for external surfaces shall be selected in such a way
that adequate protection is obtained over the whole surface.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  RENEWAL
OF ANODES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Galvanic anodes shall be replaced when wastage has occurred
to the
extent of about 70 percent of the total mass of the anode.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  PROTECTIVE
COATING
SCHEDULE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  The bitumen or bitumen based compositions may be  used as a satis-
factory protective
coating system for static water front structures.
The
following compositions are recommended for this purpose:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)  Bitumen Solution -
3  coats conforming to IS  :  158-1968*,
or<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)  Hot Melting
Bitumen Enamel -
1 coat over a priming coat
con-
forming to IS  :  158-1968*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Other heavy duty paint coatings may be used provided due attention
is paid to the surface preparation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  STRUCTURE-TO-ELECTROLYTE
POTENTIAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  When the external surfaces of the structures are satisfactorily protected,
the structure/water
potential
shall remain
within the range shown in
Table 3 of IS  :  8062 ( Part I )-1976t.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.  PRECAUTIONARY
MEASURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1  Potential
measurements
should be made with reference electrodes
located in water in close proximity to the structure to be protected,
to
minimize IR drops.<<HEADING_END>>
