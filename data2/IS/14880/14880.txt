<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Transport
Tractors and Trailers Sectional Committee had been approved by the Transport Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>[n order to achieve harmony with the international practices this Indian Standard is based on 1S0 12357:1999
‘Commercial road vehicles — Drawbar couplings and eyes for rigid drawbars — Strength tests’ published by
International Organization for Standardization (1S0).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)’. The number of significant placed retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard  specifies the test conditions and strength
requirements to be met by drawbar couplings and the
corresponding drawbar eyes for rigid drawbars, which
are provided for use with centre-axle trailers with a
maximum towing mass C exceeding 3.5 tonnes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7 The test loads may be applied by means of special
slack-free devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 DETERMINATION
OF  ‘De’  AND ‘V’ VALUES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The  ‘De’ value is a comparative value determined
by calculation of the longitudinal
forces occurring
between
the towing
vehicle
and the trailer.
It is
expressed in kilonewtons,
and calculated from the
following equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2  TERMS AND DEFINITIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Foi  ‘he purposes
of this standard,
the following
dehnitions shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 ‘Y Value — Mass imposed vertically
on the
coupling under static conditions by the centre-axle
trailer loaded to its may .num design total mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>T. C
D, = g—
T+-C<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Centre-Axle
Trailer — Towed vehicle equipped
with  a towing device which cannot move vertically
(in relation to the trailer), and in which the axle(s)
is (are) positioned close to the centre of gravity of the
vehicle (when uniformly loaded) such that only a small
static vertical load, not exceeding 10 percent of the
load corresponding to the maximum  design total mass
of the trailer
or load of 10 kN (whichever
is the
smaller), is transmitted to the drawing vehicle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>T
is the maximum design total mass, in tonnes,
of the towing vehicle, including ‘S’(see 2.1),
to which the drawbar
coupling
is to be
attached;
C
is the mass, in tonnes, transmitted
to the
ground by the axle or axles of the centre-axle
trailer loaded to its maximum design total
mass; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 GENERAL TEST REQUIREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g
is the acceleration due to gravity:
g = 9.81  In/S2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The test shall be carried out with drawbar couplings
and drawbar eyes having corresponding
functional
dimensions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The ‘V’ value is a comparative value determined
by calculation of the vertical forces occurring between
the towing vehicle and the trailer. It is expressed in
kilonewtons,
and calculated
from the following
equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The strength tests described in this standard are
static and dynamic tests to be performed on a test bed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 The fixing arrangements for the drawbar coupling
and the drawbar
eye on the test bed shall be the
same as for its attachment to the vehicle, and shall
be in accordance
with the manufacturer’s
fitting
instructions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>V=a.  &.C<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>L2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Drawbar couplings and drawbar eyes can be tested
separately or together.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a
is an equivalent vertical acceleration in the
coupling point, depending
on the type of
suspension on the rear axle(s) of the towing
vehicle, including a constant factor:
a = 1.8 mhz of vehicles with air suspension
(or
systems
with
equivalent
damping
characteristics),
a =  2.4 rn/s2 for vehicles with other types of
suspension systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 Preferably,
couplings
should be tested in the
original condition as designed for road use. At the
discretion of the manufacturer and in agreement with
the test laboratory,
flexible
components
may be
neutralized if this is necessary for the test procedure
and if there is no concern about unrealistic influence
on the test result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

ground by the axle or axles of the centre-axle<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
