FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
(Part
IV ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution on 8 February
1980, after the draft finalized by the
Ports and Harbours Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard pertaining
to water front structures is being issued in
the following parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part I
Monoliths
Part II
Caissons
Part III
Sheet Piles
Part IV Cellular Sheet Pile Structures<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Cellular sheet pile structures are commonly used both on land and as
water-front
structures such as retaining
walls, cofferdams,
docks, locks,
breakwaters,
piers, etc.
There are many types of cellular
structures like
circular, diaphragm,
clover-leaf,
modified circular
and separate
circular.
This standard ( Part IV ) covers circular and diaphragm types, which are
generally used in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test,
shall
be rounded
off
in
accordance
with
IS : z-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9527 ( Part IV ) -  1980<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
( Part
IV ) covers
the
design
and
construction
of
cellular sheet pile structures
of circular
and diaphragm
types which are
constructed with straight web steel sheet piles as the perimeter
sheet with
soil fill inside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. DESCRIPTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Circular
Type -
Each cell can be constructed
independently
and
forms a stable unit by itself.
Hence this type provides high safety during
construction and high structural stability.
But the wall width is limited
by interlock
tension of the steel sheet piling.
Circular
type cell is the
most commonly preferred one as each cell forms a stable unit and failures
if any are localized into a cell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Diaphragm
Type -
In this type wall width can be enlarged without
increasing the interlock tension of the steel sheet piling.
Unlike circular
type, each cell is not independent
and failure of one cell affects the others.
This type is sensitive to differential
filling in adjacent cells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. MATERIAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Steel Sheet Piles
-
Only straight
web steel sheet piles conforming
to ISPS 100 F of IS  :  ‘2314-1963*
are suitable for this type of construction.
Other sections, namely, Z or U type, are not suitable.
It is recommended
that steel should contain 0.2 to 0.35 percent copper for imparting corrosion
resistance to sea water.
3.2 Soil Fill -
Freely
draining
non-cohesive
soil fill is generally
used.
Fine sand which may flow out with seepage water, is avoided.
Other type
of soils may be used with caution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Paint -
One coat of primer shall be applied on the clean surfaces of
steel piles.
These should, then, be painted with at least
two coats of
special marine paint before pitching and driving ( see IS  :  1419-19597
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  LAYOUT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Circular
Type<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  Circular cell construction
requires accurate
pitching
and driving
to ensure closing of a cell with the required
number of standard
piles.
Cell diameter,
spacing, connecting arc radius, number of piles, etc, may be
adopted from Table
1 read with Fig. 1.
A plan may be drawn with the
dimensions
so obtained
and minor
adjustments
made in geometry,
if
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

sheet piles is about 3 m in radius,
but
construction
can be expedited
by making the radius larger than 3 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The number of sheet piles required to form a cell is always even because of the shape of the joint.
If an odd number of sheet piles is required, one speci:rl-shaped
pile shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

DETAILS OF LAYOUT OF DIAPHRAGM TYPE SHEET PILE CELL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Where one side of cell head is dewatered, water saturation
line could
be assumed to take a slope of 1  :  2 for common free draining fill and 1  :  1
for specially designed fill materials.
Dry bulk density of soil fill is assumed
above this saturation line for computation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Cellular structures shall be designed as gravity structures resting and
not embedded on a founding stratum.
Penetration
of sheet piles through
common soils up to founding stratum is possible, but not through very stiff
clays, boulder
clay or weathered
rock which,
however,
are suitable as
founding strata.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.1
Cellular structures founded in clays should be examined
for slip
circle failure and also checked for effects of consolidation of the clay.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 The effect of scour on the founding level of the structure should be
taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 The
effect
of exit gradients
in sandy materials
and other special
materials used as fill inside the cells should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7 The stability of the structure during construction
should also be taken
care of.
The heavy live load or dead loads may be transferred
to found-
ing strata through piles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8 It would often become necessary to transfer live or dead load through
load-bearing
piles to founding stratum where such structures are to be used
as wharves or dockwalls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  -Bulkheads
founded
on hard

<<HEADING level=3>>7.  CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  It  should be necessary
to use a template
as shown
in Fig. 3 to pitch
the piles.
The height
of template
should be about one-third
the length
of
piles to be pitched.
A tensioned
rope
is put outside
to keep the
piles
conforming
to the ring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>FIG. 3
TYPICAL TEMPLATE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_13>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS: 9527 ( Part IV ) - 1980<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  The first pile should be put very accurately
ensuring
plumb
in both
planes and driven
a few metres only.
Subsequent
piles should be pitched
on either side.
Clutching
is done according
to instructions.
The
piles are
pitched
with alternative
faces appearing
on either side,
After
pitching
7
to 8 piles, next one is driven
again to some extent
taking
into account
the
corrections.
Ring
should thus be completed
before driving
down to design
level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3  ‘  Tee  ’  piles should not be put till the ring is completed.
These
should
be pitched
after the closure of ring when the ordinary
piles are withdrawn
and  ‘  Tee  ’  piles are inserted
in their places.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 Piles
are
best
driven
by
wire
suspended
double
acting
hammers
operated
by steam,
compressed
air or diesel combustion.
For sandy soils,
vibrating
hammers
are very efficient.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5
Cellular
structures
are provided
with a RCC
or steel ring
on top and
at least alternate
piles are bolted
to it. This helps in retention
of shape on
deflection.
Welding
of piles to each other on top for a distance
of about
30 cm helps in rigidity
of cell and helps in its stability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6
Where
used
as permanent
structure,
sheet
piles in tidal
zone are
recommended
to
be
encased
in
concrete
or
provided
with
cathodic
protection
against
corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7 Main
cells
should
be filled
first
and
then
the
area
enclosed
by
connecting
arcs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8
Cellular
structures
can be straight
or form an arc to cover an opening.
Where
there is change
of direction,
it should be ensured
that  ‘  Tee  ’  piles
are not closer than one-twelfth
of the circumference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  DEVIATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  Closing
of cells
may
be
permitted
with
one
additional
or
less
pile from the design number
by using a special
closure pile since only even
number
of piles give proper
clutch joint.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2
Verticality
of Piles -
Deviation
in verticality
to the extent that the
cell diameter
does not vary
more
than
1.5 percent
at any point
may
be
permitted.<<HEADING_END>>
