<<HEADING level=3>>CODE OF PRACTICE FOR
FIELD INSTRUMENTATION OF SWELLING
PRESSURE IN EXPANSIVE SOILS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 30 November
1985, after the draft
finalized
by the Foundation
Engineering
Sectional
Committee,
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Most of the swelling
pressure
measurements
on
black cotton soils
have been made on remoulded
specimens
with values ranging
between
0’2 and 1’1 N/mm2 depending upon the soil characteristics,
compaction
condition
and the manner
and method of conducting
the test. These
values are, however,
of little
relevance
in evaluating
the behaviour of
foundation
in region ground.
Keeping this in view, in-situ measurement
of swelling perssure which give the realistic value, is significant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard considerable
assistance has been
given by Central Building Research Institute,
Roorkee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS : 2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained in the
rounded off value shotrld be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.  SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This code deals with field instrumentation
for measurement
of
swelling pressure in expansive soils in relation to design of foundations
of single/double
storey buildings and other allied light structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Rules for rounding
off numerical
values ( revised).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :11550-1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Before
conducting
the test,
the
limit
tests in accordance
with
IS  :  2720 ( Part 5 ) - 1986* and IS  :  2720 ( Part 6 ) - 1972t and free
swell in accordance
with
IS  :  2720 ( Part
40 ) - 1977$ should
be
carried out to classify
the soil for its expansiveness.
Measurement
of
in-situ swelling
pressure
in expansive
soils
at varying
depths should
be made by recording
the upward
thrust
exerted
by the swelling of the
soil generated at the interface of a rigid steel plate placed in a bore hole
at a particular
depth.
The  in-sitzr  swelling pressure test is a simple
form
of modified
laboratory
swelling pressure
test with the difference
that in the field test the soil sample is not-confined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. EQUIPMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>3.0 The assembly used for the measurement

exactly in the cente of
the circular plate. Due-care should be taken to ensure the verticality
of
the socket
during
welding.
A -galvanized
iron pipe of 20 mm outside
diameter should be screwed firmly in the socket
provided
in the centre
of plate ( see Fig. 1 ). The length
of the pipe
should be in accordance
with the depth at which the measurement
is to be made. The plate and
central pipe assembly should be enclosed with a 4 mm thick

with a 4 mm thick
galvanized iron sheet having a suitable socket, welded
in the centre.
To
enable the central pipe connected
with the circular plate pass through the
socket without any friction a clear gap of 2 mm should be kept.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Proving
Ring
with Dial Gauge -
For the measurement
of the
intensity of pressure a proving ring of 200 kg maximum
capacity
with a
sensitive dial gauge ( 0’001 mm ) with a travel of 25 mm should be used.
The proving ring should
be placed
on a 50 mm dia, 10 mm thick mild
steel plate, 50 mm long mild steel pin of the diameter exactly equal to the
internal diameter of the central pipe welded at its
bottom, centrally, to
ensure
push fit into central
pipe. The top of this circular plate should
be provided with recess in the centre
to house
a 12 mm diameter steel
ball.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Dial Gauge and  Magnetic Base -
The dial gauge and the magnetic
base should be in accordance
with IS  :  1888-1982*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4 Screw  Jack -
A simple
screw jack having 300 kg capacity should
be used to maintain
the no volume
change
conditions
below
the test
plate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 Guide Frame
Reaction
Beam and Anchoring
Assembly -
A guide
frame should be used to maintain
verticality
of the central
rod during
the test. The guide frame should consist of 5 mm
wide and 3 mm thick
steel flats having
semi-circular
support
of the
diameter
equal to the
encasing pipe used to encase the central pipe for any kind of.disturbance.
The reaction beam and the anchoring
assembly
should be in accordance
with IS  :  1888-1982*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6  Plate Bucket Auger -
In order to keep the bottom
of the bore hole
completely
levelled, a suitable plate bucket
according
to details given in
Fig. 2 should be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. EXCAVATION
OF PIT AND BOREHOLE
INSTALLATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 To carryout
the test successfully
a pit 1  X  1 >c 0’25 m should be
excavated
and levelled.
In the centre
of the pit a bore hole shall be
made by a spiral auger
( see IS  :  10442-1983t ) having
15 cm diameter.
The verticality
of the bore hole should
be maintained
by using auger
boring guide [ see IS  :  2720 ( Part 40 )-1977$  I  and the desired test depth
of the bore hole should
be reached
by adding
extension
rods to the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>auger. After
reaching
the desired
depth
the bottom
of the bore hole
should
be thoroughly
cleaned
by removing
any loose
material
and
perfectly levelled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. METHOD OF INSTALLATION
AND PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The plate and the chamber assembly should
be lowered carefully
in
the prepared
bore hole. The circular
plate
should
be made to rest eon
the base of the bore hole. This should
be followed
by checking the
verticality
of the central pipe using a spirit level. The central pipe should
be encased with a 40 mm diameter pipe. The lower end of the encasing
pipe should
be pushed
into the socket welded to the chamber.
This
pipe should be held suspended with suitable
clamps at the ground
level
to ensure free movement of the circular plate. The guide
clamp should
be fixed to the
central
pipe. This should
be followed by placing the
plate. The steel ball be placed
over the plate in the recess already
provided,
followed
by placing
of the proving
ring and the screw jack.
The screw jack
should’ be operated
to butt against
the bottom of the
reaction beam which is fixed in accordance
with
IS  :  1888-1982*. The
base plate should be applied
with the initial
pressure with the help of
screw jack through
the proving ring. This pressure should not exceed the
initial
overburden
pressure at the bottom level of the bore hole. This
should be followed by filling the pit with water up to
the ground
level.
The dial of the proving
ring should
be set at zero and the dial gauge
which
is placed
against
a bracket
attached
to the central
pipe and
supported
on an independent
datum bar through a magnetic base. This
dial gauge should be used to measure the upward movement
of the plate
due to swelling of the soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. RECORDING OF SWELLING PRESSURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The reading of the proving ring dial gauge and
the heave dial gauge
should be recorded
every week. The recording
of these readings should
be carried out for a period of three
months
or till such time when the
reading in the proving rings becomes constant whichever is earlier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The readings should
be recorded in the form
given below. During
recording
of the each reading the proving ring reading
shall be recorded
only after loading with the screw jack, till the heave dial reading becomes
equal
to the initial
reading
thus ensuring that the pressure
is being
measured with no volume change.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
