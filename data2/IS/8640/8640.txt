<<HEADING level=3>>RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR
DIMENSIONAL PARAMETERS FOR
INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 28 December 1977, after the draft finalized by the Structural Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Structural
and Metals
Division Gouncil and the Givil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 In a developing country like India the capital outlay under each Five
Year
Plan towards setting up of industries and consequently construction
of industrial
buildings
is very high.
In addition the quantity of steel
produced in the country is not sufficient to meet the requirement of the
industry.
It is, therefore, necessary that the parameters
of the industries
have to be standardized
on broad based norms so that it will be feasible
to easily adopt pre-fabricated
concrete
members
and to minimize the
extent of steel members for such industries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The standardization
of parameters for industries by itself will be a very
difficult task, as it will not bepossible
to specify the requirement
for each
industry and the layout including
the heights will vary from industry to
industry, for it depends on the process of the end products.
However,
if
a little more detailed analysis of the requirement
is made, it will be obvious
that it will not be that difficult as it looks.
It will not be possible to
specify any particular
constraint on the parameters but a broad norm can
be given within which any industry could be accommodated.
All that is
necessary is to have a national
standard and faithfully follow it in the
spirit in which the same is worked out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 It will, therefore, be necessary to classify the industries so that a further
classification
of the industrial structures could be made and, based on these
a recommended norm for the parameters could be worked out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 The industrial buildings will be the starting point for the engineering
profession
for planning,
designing and construction.
Therefore,
it shall
have meaningful
parameters
by specifying
the loading
conditions
and
minimum required safety considerations.
In addition, even if an industrial
complex may be classified as heavy industry, it need not necessarily
mean
that all the industrial
structures coming within this complex
should be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 8640 - 1977<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>heavy industrial
structure
and the structures could be of all the types.
Similar reasoning applies for various classifications made in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 It is, therefore, suggested that the classification shall be based primarily
on the number of cycles of specific loading case anticipated for the portions
of the structure.
On the basis of estimated life span and rate
of load
repetitions, the classification of the structure
for the whole or part of the
building can be made.
The maximum life span of 50 years is generally
recommended and based on the above, the classifications are suggested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 There are buildings without crane facility and also of special require-
ment to meet the process and utility
industries for which the above
classification
based on cycles of loads due to cranes will not be applicable.
Therefore
a separate classification is made for them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.8 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of significant
places retained
in
the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
specifies the important
dimensional
parameters
for
normal industrial
buildings classified
according
to the service
require-
ments ( see 4 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  STATUTORY
REGULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  Statutory regulations relating to dimensions of industrial building and
components wherever applicable shall be adhered to.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  LAYOUT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The layout of building depends on various factors such as functional
requirements
and local conditions.
When the bays are arranged east to
west or north to south, it may be advantageous
to adopt northlight roof
structures.
Need  for  further extension and increase in crane capacity shall
also be kept in view before planning the layout of the building
( see Fig. 1
and 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6. -HEIGHT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  It will be necessary to adopt certain standard heights for the columns
so that it will be easy to standardize the components.
The recommended
heights to the top of crane rails are:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Industrial
structures covered under
4-5
m
Groups C, D, E and F<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Industrial structures covered under
Group B

m<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Industrial structures covered under
Group A
6-
15 m<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The
heights
shall be varied in modules of 0.5 m.
In cases where
cranes are not required for the light industries,
the eaves heights may be
standardized at 3.5 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Now -The
recommended
heights given above are generally applicable.
for any specific requirements the heights shall be chosen as actually required.
However,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. CRANE
CLEARANCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.0  Minimum
top and side clearance
where cranes
are provided, are
recommended
as under ( see Fig. 3 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Top Clearance-The
provision
of cranes
has a bearing on the
height of the building.
It is therefore recommended
that the following
crane clearances between the top of crane rail to the underside of the roof
or obstruction,
as the case may be, shall be followed:
a) For cranes up to 50 tonnes capacity
3
m<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) For cranes above 50 tonnes up to 120 tonnes
3.6 m<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) For cranes higher than 120 tonnes capacity
4.2 m<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -For
special purposes like iron and steel making industries and similar other
requirement,
the actual required~clearances based on crane manufacturing practice may
be followed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  Side Clearance -  The side clearances for the cranes should also be
standardized
in order to bring
uniformity
in space utilization.
It is,
therefore,
recommended
that
the
following
side
clearances
shall
be
followed:
a) Where no access is provided for maintenance
at crane level the
minimum side clearance
from the face of roof leg to the centre
line of the rail
shall be 500 mm.
In
addition
it should be
ensured that the clearance
between the face of the roof leg and
the crane structure ( end carriage ) shall be minimum 50 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Where
access for maintenance
at crane level is provided, the
above
provision
for side clearance
shall be increased to meet
relevant statutory requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_11>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS t 8640 - f977<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c) In the case of floor operated  EOT  cranes, the distance between
the face of the roof leg and the centre line of the rails may be
reduced to 300 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  ROOF
WORK<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 General
-Roof
work standardization
is comparatively
easier
to
achieve than any other component
of the industrial building.
Following
recommendations
shall be followed in the standardization
of roof work:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For latitudes higher than 23)” saw-tooth north light or its varients
such as folded-plate or shell type roofs with clear glazing may be
adopted.
For lesser latitudes
a monitor or pitched type or even
saw-tooth
type roof with adequate
diffusive glazing could be
adopted.
b) Roof
components
like truss girder,
roof girder main truss and
inter-truss
shall be standardized
for the spans for which the
recommended
parameters
have been given earlier
and for the
loading conditions.
With this standardization
it will be easy to
plan each component
for a pre-fabrication
either in concrete or
in steel depending upon the economy and other constraints
that
may be expected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
