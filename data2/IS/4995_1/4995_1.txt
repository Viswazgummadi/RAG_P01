FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part I ) ( First
Revision
) was adopted
by the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 9 December
1974,
after the draft finalized
by the Criteria
for Design
of Structures
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Storage
structures
like bins
(silos
and bunkers ) for
storing
different
materials
are
one
among
the
important
structures
coming
up in
any
industrial
or organized
storage complex.
The necessity to store and contain
materials
like coke, coal, ores in the various steel plants and other
industrial
establishments
cannot
be overemphasized.
In cement
factories
as well as
in construction
projects,
cement is stored in large silos,
On the agricultural
front the foodgrain
storage structures play a vital role in ensuring
the supply
of foodgrains
at all times of the year.
Bulk storage
of materials
in bins has
certain
advantages
over other forms
of storage.
Therefore,
the necessity to
formulate
standard
criteria
Tar design
of such structures
has been felt and
this standard
is aimed
at giving the necessary
guidelines
to arrive
at the
structural
design
of reinforced
concrete
bins
for
the
storage
of various
materials
of different
properties
and characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  This
standard
published
in
1968
covered
the
requirements
of the
structural
design
for foodgrain
storage
bins ( silos ).
It has been
felt that
instead of bringing
out one separate
standard
to cover the requirements
of
all materials
other than foodgrains,
it would he judicious
to cover the subject
under one standard
in which
provisions
for bins storing diflerent
matrrials
could be dealt with adequately.
Therefore,
the first revision of this standard
had been taken up to cover the requirements
of storage bins for all materials
including
foodgrains,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 4995 ( Part I ) - 1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  The
different
stored
materials,
such as coke,
coal, ores,
foodgrains,
fertilizers,
cement
and flour can be classified
either
as granular
or powdery
materials.
Extensive
research
work all over the world has indicated
that
assessment
of bin loads caused
due
to a stored
material
would
require
different
treatments
depending
upon whether
it is a granular
or powdery
material.
Considering
this, the standard
has now been brought
out in two
parts, namely,
Part I -
General
requirements
and assessment of bin loads,
and Part II -
Design
criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been  given to  the
findings
of recent
research
and international
coordination
amongst
the
standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries.
This
has
been
met with by referring
to the following standards
and publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

loads.

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5.1
In view of the continuing
research
done on flow characteristics
of
materials,
the
emphasis
in the
code
is on
structural
adequacy
of bins.
However,
as regards
flow characteristics
of the materials,
the
designers
would be well advised to consult the relevant
litera,are.
This code is based
on the latest available
data and is amenable
to review as and when more
reliable information
on this subject becomes
available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant

Homogenization -
In the case of homogenizing
bin, the filling consists
of powdery
materials
which
is circulated
by compressed
air for mixing
purposes.
During
homogenization
of powdery
materials
the lateral
and
vertical
pressures depend upon the volume
of the empty
space available in
the upper portion
of the bin.
This
may be kept
about
40 percent
of the
total
volume
of the
bin.
The
lateral

vertical
pressures
shall
be
calculated
using the
following
expression
and

not
be
less than

Pneumatic Embtying -
During
pneumatic

a number
of small holes located

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Effects Causing Increase in Bin Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1  Eccentric
Emptying-Eccentric
emptying
of a bin
gives
rise
to
increased
horizontal
loads non-uniformly
distributed
over the periphery
and
extending
over the full height
of the bin.
Eccentric
outlets in bins shall be
avoided
as far as possible,
and, where
they have to be provided
to meet
functional
requirements,
due consideration
shall be given in design to the
increased
pressure
experienced
by
the
walls.
Till
more
information
is
available,
the increased
pressure
may be calculated
as given under 6.3.1.1.
This
increased
pressure
shall be considered,
for the purpose
of design,
to
be acting both on the wall nearer to the outlet as well as on the wall on the
opposite side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1.1
The
additional
pressure
P’h shall be considered
to act for the
fuil height of the bin and is obtained
from the expression

<<PARAGRAPH>>P’h = Phi -
Ph
where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>phi = pressure obtained
on the wall of the bin imagined

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1.3  The effect of eccentric

in des?gn if the
eccentricity
is less than  d/6  or the height of the bin is not greater
than  2d,
where  d  is the maximum
possible diameter
of the circle that can be inscribed
in the bin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2
Archiq
of  Stored Material -
Some
stored
materials
arc susceptible
to arching
action across the bin walls.
The frequent
collapse of such arches
gives
rise
to increased
vertical
pressures.
The
vertical
pressure
on
the
bottom
of the bin storing such materials
shall be taken
as twice the filling
pressure,
P,; h
.
owever the load need not be assumed to be greater. than  W.<.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3
Aeration of Stored Material -
When
bins are provided
with equip-
ment
for
ventilating
the
bin
filling at rest, a distinction
must be made
between
bins for granular
material
and bins for powdery
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3.1
When
the material
is granular,
an increase in the horizontal
pressures
is to be
cxpectcd.
Therefore,
the
horizontal
pressure
Ph,  as
calculated
as per  6.1.1.1,  for fillin g,  nrc  to be increased
by the  inlet  pressure
of the air over that portion
or the height
of the bin in which the air inlets
are located.
From
the level of the highest inlet upwards,
this increase
in
pressure may be tapered off uniformly
down to zero at the top of the bin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3.2
For powdery materials
the measurements
made so far do not
indicate
any significant
increases
in load when ventilating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3.3
Bins for storage of powdery materials
are often equipped
with
devices (or pncumntic
emptying,
and thrsc bring
about
a loosening
of the
bin filling
in the region
of the
outlet.
In this case also,
no significant
increases
in load due to the air supply have so far been detected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.4
Discharge Promoting Devices G-  Modern
bins storing various materials
may be provided
with various discharge
promoting
devices
such as inserts,
bridge like structure
above the outlet or relief
nose.
In all such cases the
effective
cross section
of the bin is locally
reduced.
Recent
research
has
given
an intlicntion
that
in such bins
the
horizontal
wall
pressures
arc
esccssively
incrcascd
locally or along the tmtire bin height.
In the absence
of reliable knowledge
available
on the subject
the designer
is cautioned
to
assess the wall loads for such bins most judiciously
and by carrying
out
experimental
investigation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4  Effects
Causing
Decrease
in Bin Loads -
In view of the load
reducing
effect of the bin bottom,
the horizontal
pressure
during
emptying
may be reduced
up to a height
1’2  d or  0’75
h whichever
is  smaller
from
the
bin
bottom.
This
may
be considered
as varying
linearly
from the
emptying
pressure at this height
to the filling
pressure
at the bin bottom
( see also Fig. 3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
