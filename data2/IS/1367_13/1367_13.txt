<<PARAGRAPH>>EMBRITTLEMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-O. General  -For
steel fasteners to be in the embrittled
condition
after hot-dip
galvanizing
is rare,
and its occurrence depends on  a  combination
of factors.
Under certain conditions.
some steels may lose
their
ductile
properties
and become embrittled.
The following
information
is given as  a guidance
in
critical applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.
Strain-Age
Embrittlement
-
Strain-age
embrittlement
occurs
when
steels
of
certain
compositions are aged following cold working.
Steels made by the Bessemer process are generally more
susceptible to strain age embrittlement than those made by the open hearth, electric or oxygen process;
aluminium killed steels are ‘the least susceptible.
Embrittlement can occur very elowly even at ambient
temperatures; the galvanizing process, involving immersion in a bath of molten zinc for up to 5 minutes
at a temperature of about 450% can greatly accelerate the process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Manufacture of fasteners commonly involve cold working in the form of upsetting, thread rolling,
etc.
Where it is known that a steel susceptible to strain-age embrittlement has been used, the fasteners
should be stress relieved before galvanizing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.
Hydrogen
Embrittlement
-
Hydrogen embrittlemcnt can occur in steels of high tensile strength
( greater than 1 COO MPe ) or high surface hardness due to case hardening or cold working.
It results
from the absorption of atomic hydrogen generated
at the steel surface by processes, such as acid
pickling or cathodic cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The galvanizing process should itself serve to provide substantial diffusion of hydrogen.
Where
additional safeguard is sought ( as for bolts of Grade 10.9 or higher, cleaned bv acid pickling ), fasteners
should be baked at a temperature of 200 & 10°C. for a time found on the basis of experience
to be
adequate.
(For guidance, a time of 30 minutes before galvanizing,
or 4 hours immediately
after
galvanizing, might prove satisfactory. )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Required
-The
following reagents are required?<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Antimony
chloride solution-20
g of antimony trioxide ( Sb*O, ) or 32g of antimony trichloride
(SbC&) dissolved in 1 000 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Hydrochloric acid-concentrated
(  sp gr  1'14 to 1 13 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2. Preparation
of Samples
for Test -
The test samples shall preferably be full size or for larger’
fasteners may be a section cut from the shank unless otherwise agreed between the manufacturer and the
purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The test sample in case of nuts shall be one complete nut and the calculation of the surface area
of the nut shall exclude threaded hole.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The samples shall be cleaned by dipping them in benzene (C,H,) or other suitsable organic solvent
which will not attack the zinc, coating, wiping dry with a clean soft cloth, and then dipping into a two
percent solution
of sulphuric
acid at l5.6-21,lOC for 15 seconds and thoroughly rinsing in clear water.
The samples shall be finally dried by wiping with a clean soft cloth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3. Procedure--The
samples shall be weighed to the ndarest 0 Cl g.
The zinc coating shall then be
stripped from each sample by completely immersing the sample in any convenient
volume of solution,
made by adding 5 ml of antimony chloride solution to each 100 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid.
The temperature of the stripping solution shall not exceed 38°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The same solution may be repeatedly used without further addition of antimony chloride solution
until the time for stripping become inconveniently long.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the evo;lution of hydrogen has ceased or when only a few bubbles are being evolved,
the sample shall be removed from the solution, scrubed under running water, and then dried by wiping
with a clean soft cloth and heating to about 100°C and cooling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The stripped sample shall then be weighed, the surface area rr easured and the average mass of
the zinc coating per unit area of the surface calculated.<<HEADING_END>>
