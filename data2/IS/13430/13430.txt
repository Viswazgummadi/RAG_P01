<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety in Construction
Sectional Committee,
CED 45<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by the
Safety
in Construction
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A large number of workmen,
skilled and unskilled, are employed in the numerous
construction
work,
big and small, under
execution
in the country.
Due to the increased tempo of such works and large
scale machanization,
hazards of accidents
have
increased
considerably.
It has, therefore,
become
imperative that adequate safety rules are laid down for every phase of work and that these are meticul-
ously followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety aspects in some of the constructions
may assume such a great importance
that instead
of merely
deputing supervisory
staff in adequate strength to look after the safety aspects, it may become desirable
to have a separate organization
to control
this important
aspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many safety measures are required to be taken during construction
and alterations
to existing
build-
ings for the  safety
of workers and public. It has, therefore,
been felt necessary to lay down the safety
measures required to be taken during such construction
with a view to minimizing
the risk of accidents
and injuries and accordingly
this standard has been brought out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
