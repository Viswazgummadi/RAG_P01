<<PARAGRAPH>>NATIONAL FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard which is identical with IS0 14050 : 1998 ‘Environmental
management -
Vocabulary
issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was adopted by the
Bureau of Indian Standards on the recommendations of the Water Environmental Protection Sectional
Committee (CHD 12) and approval of the Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard has been prepared by Technical Committee lSO/TC 207 ‘Environmental
Management’. The text of the IS0 Standard has been approved as suitable for publication as Indian
Standard without deviations. However, attention is particularly drawn that wherever the words ‘Interna-
tional Standard’ appear referring to this standard they should be read as ‘Indian Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International
Standard contains
concepts
and their definition
as used
in the IS0 14000 series of standards
and related to environmental
man-
agement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Communication
is important
in the implementation
and operation
of Envi-
ronmental
Management
Systems. This communication
will be most effec-
tive if there is a common understanding
of the terms used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many environmental
terms and definitions
are the result of recently devel-
oped concepts.
The gradual evolution
of these environmental
concepts
in-
evitably
means that environmental
terminology
will continue
to develop.
The purpose
of this document
is to convey
understanding
of the terms
used in the published
standards in the IS0 14000 series.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The terms and definitions
in this International
Standard are derived from
the following

management.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

this International

<<PARAGRAPH>>Other
concepts
which
may be encountered
in the environmental

to
aid users

on environmental
management,
some of these additional
concepts
are included
with

<<PARAGRAPH>>Users should
be aware that the application
and description
of these con-
cepts vary throughout
the international

community.
Their
presence
in Annex

to promote
or endorse
the use of
these concepts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
