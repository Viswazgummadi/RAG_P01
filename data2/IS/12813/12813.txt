<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee, CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 21 September 1989, after the
draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional
Committee bad been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With the advent of large scale cement plants and introduction
of sophisticated
technology for the
manufacture
of cement, it has become absolutely
essential to have a precise control
in quarrying,
crushing, proportioning
of raw materials for raw mix preparation
and stable operaiion of the kiln to
get desired quality of clinker.
For this purpose, the analytical data of the chemical constituents is
essential at more frequent intervals
for necessary
corrective
actions to be taken.
The conventional
methods
of chemical
analysis,
such as gravimetric
and volumetric methods
which are generally
practised, though
accurate and precise, are time consuming resultmg in delay for necessary corrective
actions.
In addition
to the conventional
methods
given in IS 4032 : 1985, the technique of atomic
absorption
spectrophotometric
analysis may be used for routine quality control purposes: The advan-
tages of atomic absorption technique over the conventional
analytical methods are its rapidity, relative
freedom
from
interferences ( which affords
high degree of selectivity ) and high degree of sensitivity
for over 60 elements.
Application of such rapid analytical
methods for analysis of major and minor
constituents
of cement for the routine control purposes
will be immensely beneficial.
With this in
view, the Cement and Concrete
Sectional Committee
felt necessary to bring out a standard covering
atomic absorption
spectrophotometric
methods for analysis of hydraulic cement.
This standard lays
down the procedure for conducting atomic absorption spectrophotometric
analysis of major and minor
constituents
of different
hydraulic
cement.
This method
may be suitably used for analysis
of
clinker as well as raw materials
and raw mix used in cement
manufacture.
In case of dispute or
doubtful marginal
values in estimation of elements
covered in IS 4032  :  1985, the methods described
in IS 4032 : 1985, shall be taken as refree method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible
for the formulation
of the standard is given at
Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value,
observed or calculated,
is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for
rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

SPECTROPHOTOMETER<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basis for using absorption to determino atomic
concentration
is as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
covers the atomic
absorption
spectrophotometric
procedure
for
chemical ana-
lysis of hydraulic cement and. clinker.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1 Assume a parallel beam of monochromatic
radiant
energy of intensity lov, at frequency
v
is
incident
on an atomic vapour
of path length, 1.
Then, if the intensity
of the transmitted
beam is
Iv, the absorption coefficient Kv of the vapour at
frequency v is defined by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 This
method
covers the
determination
of
SiO*,
A1208, FeaO,, CaO, MgO, NapO, KzO,
MnB03, TIO~ and CrzOs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE - Compositions

in the

<<HEADING level=3>>Since the absorption line has a finite half width
Kv will vary with v. However, classical dispersion
theory states that the integrated absorption  (Kvdv)
is given by the relation:<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2 This equation
is valid only when a transition
is initiated
from the ground
state.  NV is essentially
equal to the total number of ato.ms per cubic
centimetre
( NO ). The integrated
absorption
is
then proportional
to the concentration
of free
atoms in the absorbing vapour and is independent
of the temperature
of the vapour.
For
most
elements,
NV can be replaced by NO which then
brings about a simple linear relationship
between
the integrated
absorption
coefficient
and
the
concentration.
Since it is difficult to measure the
integrated absorption coefficients, peak absorption
is measured. In practice, the equation for Iv given
in 4.1.1 is valid only
when calibration
solutions
are used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The samples of the cement shall be taken
according
to the requirement
of IS 3535 : 1986
and the relevant standard specification for the type
of cement being tested,
The representative sample
of the cement selected as above shall be thoroughly
mixed before using.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 OUTLINE OF THE METHOD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3 Although
the integrated absorption
is pro-
portional
to the concentration
of free atoms in
the absorbing
medium and is independent
of the
temperature
of the vapour, the ability of a flame
to produce
ground
state atoms is temperature
dependent.
The temperature of the flame must be
high enough to dissociate
the molecules,
but not
so hot as to produce
large
numbers
of ions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 In atomic absorption,
a sample solution
is
aspirated
into a flame through
which radiation
from a line emission source  of  the element sought
passes. The monochromatic
radiation is absorbed
in proportion
to the concentration
of the neutral
atoms present. The concentration
of the analyte
is obtained by comparison to calibration solutions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.4 The monochromator
in atomic absorption
and flame emission is used to isolate the resonance
line from nearby lines and back ground radiation.
The band width is controlled by means of narrow,
monochromator
slits; however
such slits cause
reduction
of desired radiation
at the detector.
Flame background
radiation
( radiation
emitted
from the flame or from elements therein ) is also
present
and is relatively
constant.
The effect of
this background
radiation
can be eliminated by
modulating
the
incident, hollow cathode lamp
radiation before it reaches the atomic vapours and
tuning the amplifier to this modulation frequency.
The continuous
flame emission is rejected by the
tuned amplifier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 The typical
dilutions
indicated
in this table is with reference to
approximate
percentage of constituent
present
in standard
samples
in order to
obtain
the linearity
range given in
co1  7  above.
However, if
the percentage of constituent
in standard sample is different than that indicated, calibration
may be done even,
with the same dilutions.
z The precision of lime estimation
can be further improved by choosing very close range standard samples  for
calibration.
3 The linearity
range can be further
extended by reducing the path by rotation
of the burner
or by using
smaller path length burner.
4 Some of the commercially
available
instruments
are having two channel
system wherein by use of internal’
standard
element
which is not present in the sample. the absorbance
ratios of lime with internal
standard’
element are computed resulting in elimination
of dilution errors.
§  In case of calcium
and magnesium
standards
O-1 percent
lanthanum/strontium
shall be added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

shall be adjusted so that it falls within the  range
of linearity.
