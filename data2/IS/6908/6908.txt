<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Different types of asbestos cemrnt pipes have been in use in this country
for over 50 years and
considerable
experience is available in regard to their
use as water
suppl
d
pressure
mains and
building pipes, gutters and fittings for conveying
rain-water,
sullage
fro
the buildings
to the
drainage and sewerage system.
This
standard lays down
the requirements
of asbestos
cement
pipes and fittings for sewerage and drainage.
When the pipes are intended
for conveyance
of
particularly
aggressive residual waters or to be laid in particularly
aggressive grounds,
the nature
of these waters and grounds shall be specified beforehand
to the manufacturer
who may suggest
appropriate
material or treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1975.
This revision has been prepared
with a view to modify
some of the requirements
in the light of experience
gained in the use of this standard.
The major
changes in this revision include modification
in the class and minimum ultimate
crushing
load for
pipes, changes in the requirements
for straightness, transverse
crushing
strength
and longitudinal
bending strength and modification
in tolerances on dimensions and in respect of criteria for accept-
ance, sampling and marking.
ln this revision the requirements
for fittings
have been aligned
to
a great extent with the requirements
of IS0
Standard.
Hydraulic
pressure
test, longitudinal
bending strength and acid resistance test for pipes have been made optional in this revision.
The
word “Non-pressure”
appearing in the title of the earlier version of standard
has been omitted in
this revision to align the title with the international
practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In revising this standard due weightage has been given to international
co-ordination
among
the
standards and practices prevailing in different countries in bddition to relating
it to the practices
in the field in this country.
This has been done
by deriving
assistance
from
IS0
881 : 1980
‘Asbestos-cement
pipes, joints and fittings for sewerage and drainage’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the technical committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard
is
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(  revised )‘.
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value
should
be the sa~me as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

arrived
at by mutual
agreement
between

<<PARAGRAPH>>2 External
diameter

jointing
rings are located,
shall be declared
by the
manufacturers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2  The choice of class of pipe
is determined
by the
pipeline
design engineer
who alone
is qualified
to
judge
the conditions
of installation,
laying
and
operation
of the pipes.
However,
it is recommend-
ed that a class be selected
such
that,
taking
into
account
all
the loads
and the
bedding
adopted,
the pipes in use give a factor
of safety
at crushing
of at least 1.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.5 Regularity of the Internal Diameter
( Optional Test )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If required,
the regularity
of the internal dia-
meter
of pipes
of
nominal
diameter
up to
500 rhm may be checked by means of a sphere
or a disc, of a material
unaffected
by water,
passing
freely in the pipe.
The
disc shall be
kept perpendicblar
to the axis of the pipe.
The
diameter of the sphere or the disc shall be less
than the nominal
diameter
of the pipe
by the
following
value,
expressed
in
millimetres
( rounded to the nearest millimetre
):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 Occasional
internal
pressures
are
admissible
provided
that

<<PARAGRAPH>>The nominal length
of the pipes shall corres-

It should
preferably
be not less than:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If required,
the regularity
of the
internal diameter of pipes of nominal
diameter
exceeding 500 mm shall be checked
by measur-
ing at each end of the pipe three diameters at an
angle of about
60” between
them,
with
an
accuracy of %I mm.
None of the six measured
diameters shall be smaller than that
allowed by
application
of the above formula.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) 3 m for pipes
with a nominal
diameter
equal to or less than 200 mm, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
