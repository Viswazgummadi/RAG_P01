<<PARAGRAPH>>Wrought Steel Products Sectional Committee,

<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Fifth Revision)
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Wrought
Steel Products
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first issued in 1962 and subsequently
revised in 1969, 1975, 1984 and 1992. It was mentioned
in the foreword of IS 2062  :  1992, that Grade A steel which is supplied with a guaranteed
carbon equivalent
value, supersedes
IS 226. While reviewing
the standard in the light of experience
gained during these years,
Committee
decided, to revise it to align it with the present practices followed by the Indian industries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision, following
changes have been made:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4  Amendments
number 1,2,3
and 4 have been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  References
of Indian Standards have been updated.
c>  Deoxidation
mode for Grade B steel has been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4  Frequency
of test samples for tensile, bend and impact tests has been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grade A steel specified
in this standard,
is intended
for use in structures
subject to normal conditions
for
non-critical
applications.
The use of Grade A steel is generally justified for these structural parts which are not
prone to brittle fracture on account of its thickness, size and shape adopted and/or because of the fabrication
and/or service conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grade B steel specified in this standard is intended for use in structures subject to critical loading applications,
where service temperatures
do not fall below 0°C. Use of Grade B steel is generally specified for those structural
parts which are prone to brittle fracture and/or are subjected to severe fluctuation
of stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grade C steel specified in this standard, is supplied with guaranteed
low temperature
impact properties.
This
grade is intended
to be used in structures
or structural
parts, where the risk of brittle fracture
requires
consideration
due to their design, size and/or service conditions.
In cases where owing to increased thicknesses,
loading conditions
and general design of the structures, higher resistance to brittle fracture is required, use of
steel of Grade C with a guarantee of impact properties at 0°C or -2O’C or -4O’C will be advisable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The steel products conforming
to the requirements
of this specification
can be rolled from the cast billet ingots,
billets, blooms, slabs and continuously
cast billets, blooms or slabs conforming
to IS 2830  :  1992 ‘Carbon steel
cast billet ingots, billets, blooms and slabs for re-rolling
into steel for general structural
purposes
(second
revision)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard~is complied with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS 2  : 1960  ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised)‘.  The number of significant
places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

TEST<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise agreed to between the purchaser and
the manufacturer,
the nominal
dimensions
of rolled
products
conforming
to this standard
shall be in
accordance
with
the relevant
lndian
Standard.
Currently
available
Indian
Standards
are listed
in
Table 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1 Impact
test shall normally
be carried out on
products
having
thickness/diameter
greater than or
equal
to 12 mm.
The test specimen
shall be SO
machined
that the axis of the test specimen is parallel
to the direction
of rolling and the base closer to the
rolled surface is more than 1 mm from it. The notch
axis shall be perpendicular
to the rolled surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15 TOLERANCES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.1 If stated in the order,
impact tests may be
carried out on products having a thickness less than 12
mm; the dimensions
of the test pieces shall be in
conformity
with IS 1757 (see also Note 4 of Table 3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rolling and cutting tolerances
for steel products
conforming
to this standard shall be those specified in
IS 1852. Stricter tolerances may be followed if agreed
to between the purchaser and the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2 This test is carried out using a V-notch test piece
(see IS 1757) the value for consideration
being the
airthmatic
mean of the results obtained on three test
pieces taken-side
by side from the same product (see
Table 3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16 RETEST<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Should any one of test pieces first selected fail to pass
any of the tests specified in this standard, two further
samples shall be selected for testing in respect of each
failure.
Should
the test pieces
from both these
additional
samples pass, the material represented
by
the test samples shall be deemed to comply with the
requirements
of that particular
test.
Should the test
pieces from either of these additional samples fail, the
material
represented
by the test samples
shall be
considered as not having complied with this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.3 The test sample shall be taken from the thickest
product.
If the test sample taken from the thickest
product rolled from a cast meets the requirements,
the
whole cast shall be deemed to meet the requirements
of the test. If not, the test shall be performed
on a
section of next lower thickness rolled from the same
cast and if it meets the requirements
specified, this
particular
thickness
as also other sections of lower
thickness shall be deemed to satisfy the specification.
If this thickness
also does not meet the requirements,
the test shall be carried out on the next lower thickness
and so on, because the toughness
of the product will
be dependent
on the rolling direction as well as on the
section size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
