<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 27 February
1981, after the draft finalized by the
Sanitary
Appliances

Committee
had been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard was first issued in 1962.
In this revision the minimum

off in
accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For
this purpose,
a number
of boxes shall be taken at random
and inspected
for the requirements
of this specification.
The number
of sample
boxes
to be taken from a lot shall be in accordance
with co1 1 and 2 of Table
2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Criteria
for Conformity
-
The

Certification
Mark.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N0.r~ -
The use of the IS1 Certification
Mark is governed by the provisions
of the Indian Standards
Institution
( Certification
Marks ) Act and the Rules and
Regulations
made thereunder.
The IS1 Mark on products
covered by an Indian
Standard
conveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply
with the
requirements
of that standard
under a well-defined
system of inspection,
testing
and quality
control
which is devised and supervised by IS1 and operated
by the
producer.
IS1 marked products are also continuously checked by IS1 for conformity
to that standard
as a further
safeguard.
Details of conditions
under which a
licence for the use of the IS1 Certification
Mark may be granted
to manufacturers
or processors, may be obtained from the Indian Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
