<<HEADING level=3>>CODE OF PRACTICE FOR CONSTRUCTION
OF
COCOA BEANS STORAGE STRUCTURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 12 December
1981, after the draft finalized by the Stimulant
Foods
Sectional
Committee,
had been approved by the Agricultural
and Food
Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The damage to cocoa beans due to fungal, microbial and insect attacks
can be minimized to a large extent if cocoa beans are stored in structures
which prevent as far as practicable,
their entry inside and also if suitable
measures are taken during handling, transport and storage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The damage and pollution of cocoa beans during storage are due to
temperature,
moisture and dampness, insects and rodents. It is, therefore,
obvious that in order to conserve cocoa beans they should be stored in
sound structures of different types, each type being suitable for a particular
region in the country
and code of practice
should be formulated
and
adopted for handling,
transporting
and storing;
when such standards
become available and are implemented,
they will go a long way in mini-
mising the loss of cocoa beans.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard has been formulated
mainly with a view to guiding
processors, dealers and other agencies connected with handling of cocoa
beans so that the damage to cocoa beans is, as far as possible, reduced to
the minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 This code has been prepared for the construction
of structures which
would permit effective control of insect and other pests of stored cocoa
beans and which entirely exclude rain and ground moisture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
covers requirements
and method for construction
of
cocoa beans bag storage type structures.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard, the following definitions shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 18817 - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Bag -
A container made either of jute,
fabric or laminates
having
the standard dimensions and containing a net content of60 to 65 kg of dry
cocoa beans.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Bag Storage Structure -
Structure in which bags containing cocoa
beans are stored.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  LOCATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The cocoa beans bag storage structure shall be located on a raised
and well-drained
site, or on suitably made-up soils, if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The structure shall not be located on lands subjected
to’ floods or
inundations and shah be safe from damage by surface or seepage water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 The structure shall be at least 15 m away from residential buildings,
factories ( other than cocoa processing factories ), dairies, poultry farms,
kilns and other possible sources of fire and 30 m away from garbage, dump-
ing grounds, slaughter
houses, hide curing centres, tanneries
and such
other places, the close vicinity of which is deleterious to safe storage of
cocoa beans.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 The structure
shall be away from large trees.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 The structure shall be generally accessible to lorries and preferably
situated near a rail head with goods siding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.1 Where the structure is near waterways, such as ferry heads and
docks sufficient berthing,
loading and unloading facilities shall be made
available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  BAG STORAGE STRUCTURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The bag storage structure may be of dimensions most economically
suited to the land available.
The storage capacity
shall be calculated
taking into account the coefficient factor of 0*8m2 per metric tonne of
cured cocoa seeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -
The coefficient factor is derived from (a) 14 bags stacked one over the
other; (b) each such bag containing 62.5 kg of cocoa beans; (c) 30 percent floor area
for passage, in between the stacks; and (d) stacks of 30 bags.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The minimum height of the wall may be 5.5 m for flat roofed structures
and in the case of other structures the minimum wall height may be 425 m inside
at the point where the roof crosses the wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2 The trench shall be one metre away from the outer periphery of the
structure, and shall be at the lowest level of the foundation with a longi-
tudinal bed slope towards the natural fall of the ground. It shall be con-
nected to an outfall drain for ultimate disposal of the water. It shall be
filled with rubble or brick bats or graded jelly to a depth of O-7 m and the
rest with earth, and then levelled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.3 The rubble filling of drain should be so arranged as to have the effect
of an inverted filter, that is, bigger rubble should be put at the bottom and
the size of rubble, brick bat or jelly to be reduced gradually.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-The
requirements given under 14 above depend upon locality and site
conditions may and not be insisted upon in the case of inland region with rainfall
of less than 750 mm. In coastal and heavy rainfall regions these are necessary, where
the soil conditions require.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
