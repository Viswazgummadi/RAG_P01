F.OREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 16 October 1968, after the draft finalized by the Painting, Varnishing and
Allied Finishes Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the ‘Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>OS This standard is the second part of the Indian Standard code of practice
for painting of non-ferrous metals in buildings, and deals with the painting
schedule.
The first part of this standard covers the pretreatment.
Both
the parts together are intended to provide guidance with regard to the
painting of non-ferrous metals in buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international co-ordination among the standards and practices prevailing in
different countries in addition to relating it to ‘the practices in the field
in this country.
This has been met by referring to BSCP 231 : 1966 ‘ Paint-
ing of buildings’
published by the British Standards
Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4 This standard is one of a series of Indian Standards
on painting in
buildiigs.
Other standards published so far in the series are given in
Appendix A.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis~ shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS: 2-1960*.
The number of ngnificant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

INFORMATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Required
information
for the efficient  painting of non-ferrous metals
as  given in 3 of IS  :  2524 ( Part I )-1968t
shall be taken into account.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. MATERIALS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 General
-
It is the feature of certain non-ferrous metals, for example,
aluminium,
zinc, cadmium,
copper, lead and tin, that under rural atmos-
pheric conditions, they are capable of resisting corrosion without painting.
Anodized aluminium
may be especiaily
resisting.
Metal-to-metal
joints
_
need careful treatment,
especially if they are likely to be exposed to damp
conditions and the metals are dissimilar.
A jointing
compound ( see 4.1.1 )
or a preformed bandage or strip, should be used to insulate magnesium
and
aluminium
from one another,
but bitumen
paints or rubber-based
com-
pounds may be used for joints involving other metals.
In all cases the joint
should be made while the jointing compound is still wet, the metal having
been previously prepared and primed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1
Jointing
Cornfound -
These
are usually paste-like
materials
used
for coating surfaces which are to be brought together and which will be
inaccessible.
Sometimes several coats of the paint used elsewhere on the
structure are used for jointing, when it is usual to bring the surfaces together
before the last applied coat is dry.
.Where dissimilar metals are used in
conjunction
in a structure, an isolating jointing
compound is essential, and
those containing
chromates are preferred where aluminium
or magnesium
is one of the metals.
A typical compound for this purpose consists of equal
parts by weight of barium chromate and kaolin in an oil varnish medium,
the content being between 50 and 60 percent by weight and free from water
soluble sulpha .es and chlorides.
Bitumen or bituminous pastes and rubber-
based jointinr, compounds are used for other metals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2
The
surface
should be prepared
as specified
in 6 of IS:
2524
(  Part I )-1968t.
Even where this includes using an etch primer it is still
necessary to apply
a priming
paint appropriate
to the individual metal
except in the case of lead and terne coating. Some etch primers are softened
;
by water. For situations where exposure of the etch-primed
surface to mois-
ture may be expected special types of water-resistant
etch primer should be
used, or they should be quickly overcoated with primer.
Where the metals
concerned come into contact with alkaline materials, for example, concrete,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

,
lime mortar and brickwork,
they should
be given one or two coats of
bituminous
paint and, where the conditions are persistently
damp,
even
thicker 6hns are desirable.
Ahnninium,
lead, terne plate and tin must be
treated fully in this way> zinc, cadmium, tin and magnesium
need only. be
treated in this way if conditions are adverse, while
copper
is unlikely
to
need protection.
Where non-ferrous metals are brought
into permanent
contact with hard-woods, such as oak and chest-nut,
for example,
when
used for flashings for oak frames and sills,  two coats  of bituminous
paint.
should be applied to both contact surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>46
AIumisiissm
-Whether
the preparation
has included
pretreatment
with an etch primer or not a zinc chrome or a modified zinc chrome paint
should be used.
For subsequent coats, normal types of oil, cleoresinous or
synthetic resinous paints may be used provided that they are compatible
with the priming paint.
l3ituminous
paints are also permissible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 Zinc  and Zinc-Goated
Metals -As
many items constructed
from
zinc and zinc-coated
metal,
such as ducting,
cladding
and ‘casing
units
arrive on site untreated,
particular
care should lx taken for pretreatment
and preparation
of zinc surfaces:
For subsequent
coatings, normal
types
of paint, as described in 4.2, may be used provided that they are compatible
with the priming paint and will adhere well to it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4  CopPer Lead 7  The first coating or primer may be an unpigmentcd
resin varnish or an etching primer.
If a light-coloured
finish is required,
a coat of aluminium paint over the resin varnish will need to be applied; its
leafing properties help to prevent the discoloration
of superimposed
coats
of  paint  by green compounds should they be formed by inter-action
between
the copper and the medium.
The fmishing coats may be those indicated
for zinc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 Magnesium
-
The medium throughout the paint system to be applied
to magnesium and its alloys should be highly resistant to water and alkali,
for example, a stoving or air-drying
medium, such as that based on tung
oil/phenolic resin varnish.
The primer should not contain graphite,
lead
pigments or metallic lead, bronze or aluminium; it should, however, contain
zinc  chromate in a proportion appropriate
to the severity of the conditions
ofexposure.
For normal exposure, the zinc chromate should constitute about
20 percent by weight of the dry paint film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. SCHEDULE

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
The painting system may comprise primer, primer surE3cer or Wer,
putty and 6nish coats in &ll or in suitable combination,
such as primer/
fkish or smfkr/Snish
as may be found necessary depending on tbe condition
of substrate and its end use. Fix&b coats alone may be applied where ade-
quate. Dry, mineral oil or  water  -ding
using suitable grades of abrasive
paper may, be carried out at appropriate stages to obtain a smooth finish.
Each successive coat may be applied only when the preceding coat is thorough-
ly dry.
After applying the top coat further proccssin~, such as to produce
any decorative design for pleasing appearance,
varnishmg or polishing with
suitable polishing compounds may be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2
The types of primer, Ijrimer su&acer, etc, may be of any type com-
patible to each other and suitable for application over the substrate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.13
Application may be by any satisfactory method and air drying,
force drying or stoving may be carried out.<<HEADING_END>>

Painting
-
A variety of paint systems applied by  or&nary
or sophisticated methods of application like roller coat, electrostatic spraying,
etc, and air drying, force drying or stoving all or part of the components
in the painting system are possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 On-Site Painiing
-
Surfaces untreated or protected with a temporary
protective shall be pretreated as specified in 6 of IS  :  2524 ( Part I j-1968*
and then painted in a suitable system as mentioned in 5.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>53.1
Surfaces already factor): pretreated and primed or finished shall be
cleaned of foreign matter like 011, grease, dust, etc; damaged areas, if any,
shall be appropriately feather-edged and touched up with suitable primer and
brought forward as necessary with primer, primer surfacer, putty, finish
coats, etc.
The entire surface may then be flatted, if necessary, before ap-
plying finish coats.
Generally only an air-drying
system may be_ possible
for on-site painting and applications may be linked to brushing and spraying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. MAX&DSANCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Gemeratl -Since
the prime object of painting is to protect the metal
from corrosion, the paint film should ,not be aIlowed to deteriorate
to a
serious extent More recoating.
If the paint film is allowed to crack or peel
Corn the surf&x, corrosion may. start and spread under the paint completely
in order to prepaxe the surf?ce properly for repainting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Removal of&c old Paint -
In removing the old paint, care should be
ti
to avoid, as fiu  as  possible, damaging  any  anodized or other chemical
~nv&on
coating which may. have betn applied to protect
the metal.
For this reason, an organic solvent-type paint  remover  should be employed,
so that only a minimum of scraping and .mechanical abrasion will be needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

adhesion of the rest appears to be sound, it may be sufficient to remove
loose paint and the corrosion products.<<HEADING_END>>
