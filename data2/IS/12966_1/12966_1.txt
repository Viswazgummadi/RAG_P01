the
purpose
of
this
standard
the
following definitions
shall apply.
4 PURPOSE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The need for galleries
varies
from
dam to
dam. Some of the common
purpose
for which
galleries are provided are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Gallery<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gallery
is an opening
within dam which
provides access into or through the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) To provide drainage way for water seeping
through the upstream face of the dam and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>from the foundations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Adit<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To provide
space for drilling
holes and
grouting
the
foundation
in order
to
provide a grout curtain;
To provide
access to the interior
of the
dam
for
observing
its behaviour
after
completion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A horizontal
gallery
connecting
the
gallery
system in the dam with
downstream
face or
features outside the dam such as power house or
gate house.
Also called
‘Access Gallery’
or
‘Entrance Gallery’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Chamber

<<PARAGRAPH>>To provide access to chambers
like hoist
chamber,
pump
chamber,
pump
weI&
instrument
niches, etc;
Visitors gallery
to provide
access routes
for visitors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a gallery is enlarged to permit installation
of equipment,
it is called
a chamber,
e.g. hoist
chamber, gate chamber, etc.
4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 In addition to galleries
other
openings are
also provided in dams for different purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Foundation
Gallery<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is a gallery
which generally
extends over the
length
of
the
dam
near
the
rock
profile
conforming
in elevation to the transverse profile
of the canyon; in plan, it is near and parallel to
the axis of the dam.
From this gallery,
holes
are drilled
and
grouted
for
the main grout
curtain and drainage holes are drilled for draining
water seeping
through the foundation
in order
to provide relief in uplift pressures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5  LOCATION AND SIZE OF COMMON
GALLERiES AND OPENINGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  Foundation
Gallery<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This gallery should
be provided
in the body of
the dam where height of the dam above normal
foundation
level is more than IO m ( measured<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_4>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I!3 12966 ( Part 1)  ;  1992<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>up to to crest level in case of overflow portion
of the dam ).
For lesser heads,
its necessity
should
be left to the discretion
of the designer.
The
purpose
of this gallery is defined in 3.4,
4.1( a ) & 4.1(b).
The
miqimum
size
of
gallery
should
be 1.5 m X 2’25 m, however a
larger size of 2’0 m  X  2’5 m can be provided to
acccmmcdate
drilling equipment.
The general
details of this gallery are given in IS 10135  :  1985.
It should bz located
at a distarce of 3’0 metres
or 5 percent
of the reservoir
head
( measured
from ERL to the foundation
level ) from the
upstream face of the dam, whichever
is greater
ard
ccnsistent
with
any
other
requ,irement.
There should
be minimum
1’5 metre
concrete
cover
between
the flooi
of the gallery and the
foundation
grade.
Scmetimes,
depending upon
the  fcundaticn
grade profile aqd other considera-
tions like the height of the dam from foundation
grac’e up to Ihe spillway crest in respect of over-
flow section,
gallery dicpositicn
in other blocks,
etc, a fcucdatjor
gallery may have to be lccated
in a trench
( see Fig. 1 ).
A minimum concrete
cover of about
2’0 metros is generaliy prcvided
in the trench.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Qte Galleries and Chambers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Their size should
depend lupon
the size of the
gates, etc.
However

b.e referred to for their sizing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Instrumentation
Gallery<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The number
and location
of
such galleries
should depend
upon
the extent
of instrumen-
tation provided in a dam. These galleries should
generally be aligned
perpendicular
to the dam
axis in plan. The size is generally 1’5Om  X  2’25m
( rectanguIar
)with minor modification
necesstry
for instruments
like plumb-line,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Sump  Well<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>They should be provided in the deepest location,
Their rumber
and size should
depend upon the
quantity
of water  Seeping through
the founda-
tions acd body
of the dam.
The seepage wa!er
collected
in
upstream
inspection
galleries
provided
at higher
levels
shculd,
as far as
possible be drained-off
towards the downstream
side by gravity through adits/any
other suitable
arrangements.
Sump
well may also be located
outside the dam. In this case, sump pit provision
and a cast iron pipe of 6C0 mm diameter
will
have to be provided from sump pit to sump well.
A pump house
may be housed
above the sump
well. This is convenient
to avoid flooding
of
water in the gallery in case pumps get failed due
to Fewer failure or some other cause.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  Cottnsrream Crcincge
Gcllery<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In  high  dams ( greater than 100 m ), a supple-
mentary dlainsge
gallery
is scmtimes
provided
at about 2/3rd the base \n(idth from the upstream
face  fcr drainirg
the do\nnstream
portion of the
foundation,
if the tail water levels are high. The
size of this gallery
should,
usually
be 2.0 m  X
2’5 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 Pump Chamber<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pumps of suitable
capacity should
be provided
to pump-off the water collected in the sump well.
As far as possible,
the pumps
should be located
in a chamber
adjacent
to an inspection
gallery
above
the foundation
gallery so that in the con-
tipgency of the foundation
gallery getting flood-
ed, the pump-chamber
remains
approachable
( see Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
