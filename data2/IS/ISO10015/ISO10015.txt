<<PARAGRAPH>>Introduction<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Quality management
principles underlying the ISO 9000
family of standards
(of which the ISO 10000
series
f,orm a part) emphasize
the importance
of human
resource
management
and the need for appropriate
training.
They
recognize
that customers
are likely to both respect and value an organization’s
commitment
to its human
resources and its ability to demonstrate the strategy used to improve the competence
of its personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Personnel
at all levels should be trained to meet the organization’s
commitment
to supply products of a required
quality
in a
rapidly
changing
market
place
where
customer
requirements
and
expectations
are
increasing
continuously.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard
provides guidelines to assist organizations
and their personnel when addressing
issues
reiated to training.
It may be applied
whenever
guidance
is required to interpret references
to “education” and
“training” within the ISO 9000
family of quality assurance
and quality management
standards.
Any references
to
“training” in this document includes all types of education and training.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An organization’s
objectives
for continual
improvement,
including the
performance
of its personnel,
might be
affected by a number of internal and external factors including changes in markets, technology, innovation, and the
requirements
of customers
and other stakeholders.
Such changes
may
require an organization
to analyse
its
competence-related
needs. Figure 1 illustrates how training could be selected as an effective means of addressing
these needs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The role of this International Standard
is to provide guidance that can help an organization
to identify and analyse
training needs, design and plan the training, provide for the training, evaluate training outcomes,
and monitor and
improve the training process in order to achieve its objectives. It emphasizes
the contribution of training to continual
improvement
and is intended to help organizations
make their training a more effective and efficient investment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Appropriate
involvement
of the personnel whose competence
is being developed,
as part of the training process,
may result in those personnel feeling a greater sense of ownership of the process, resulting in their assuming more

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2
Defining
training
needs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The
training
process
should
be initiated
after a needs
analysis
of the organization
has been
conducted
and
competence-related
issues have been recorded, as depicted in Figure 1 in the Introduction.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization
should define the competence
needed for each task that affects the quality of products, assess
the competence
of the personnel to perform the task, and develop plans to close any competence
gaps that may
exist.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The definition should be based on an analysis of present and expected
needs of the organization
compared
with
the existing competence
of its personnel.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The purpose of this stage should be to:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)
define the gaps between the existing and required competence;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)
define
the
training
needed
by employees
whose
existing
competence
does
not match
the
competence
required for the tasks; and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c)
document specified training needs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The analysis of the gaps between
existing and required competence
should be conducted to determine
whether
the gaps can be closed by training or whether other actions might be necessary (see Table A.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2
Defining
the needs
of the organization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
organization’s
quality and training
policies, quality management
requirements,
resource
management
and
process design should be considered when initiating training, as an input to 4.2, to ensure that the required training
will be directed toward satisfying the organization’s needs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

necessary when work assignments
are made and performance
is assessed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The definition of an organization’s
future needs relative to its strategic goals and quality objectives,
including the
required competence
of its personnel,
may be derived from a variety of internal and external sources, such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The
purpose
of the evaluation
is to confirm that both organizational
and training objectives
have been met, i.e.
training has been effective.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The inputs for the evaluation of training outcomes are the specifications for training needs and for the training plan,
and the records from the delivery of training.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The results of training often cannot be fully analysed and validated until the trainee can be observed and tested on
the job.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Within a specified
time period after the trainee
has completed
the training, the management
of ‘L-

<<HEADING level=3>>—
in the long term, trainee job performance and productivity improvement should be assessed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The evaluation
should be conducted on the basis of established criteria (see 4.3.4),<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The evaluation
process should include the collection of data and the preparation of an evaluation
report which also

Monitoring
and
improving
the
training
process<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main purpose of monitoring is to ensure that the training process, as part of the organization’s
quality system,
is being managed
and implemented as required so as to provide objective evidence that the process is effective in
meeting the organization’s training requirements.
Monitoring involves reviewing the entire training process at each
of the four stages (see Figure 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_13>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1s/1s0
10015:1999<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Monitoring
should
be conducted
by competent
personnel
in accordance
with the
organization’s
documented
procedures.
Where
possible,
such personnel
should be independent
of the functions
in which they are directly
involved.
Methods
for monitoring
might include: consultation,
observation,
and data collection.
Methods
should
have been decided during the training plan specification stage (see 4.3.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Monitoring is a valuable tool for enhancing the effectiveness
of the training process (see Table A.5).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2
Validation
of the
training
process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inputs for monitoring might include all the records from all stages in the training process. Based on these records, a
review of the different
stages
can
be performed
to detect
nonconformity
issues for corrective
and
preventive
actions. Such inputs can be collected on an on-going basis to provide the basis of validating the training process,
and for making recommendations
for improvement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>If the procedures are followed and the specified requirements
met, then the personnel competence
records should
be up-dated to reflect this additional qualification.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the procedures
are not followed and the requirements
are met, then the procedures
should be revised and the
personnel competence
records should be up-dated to reflect this additional qualification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>If the procedures are followed and the requirements
not met, then corrective action maybe
needed to improve the
training process or develop an appropriate
non-training solution.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Overall, the review of the training process should identify any further opportunities for improving the effectiveness
of any stage of the training process.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Appropriate records should be maintained of the various monitoring and evaluation activities conducted, the results
obtained, and the actions planned.<<HEADING_END>>
