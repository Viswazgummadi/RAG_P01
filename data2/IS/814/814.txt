<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian
Standard
( Fifth
Revision)
was
adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft
finalized
by the
Welding
General
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requirements
of covered
electrodes
for metal
arc welding
of
structural
steel
were
covered
in
Part
1 and Part
11 of IS 814 for
welding
products
other
than
sheets
and
for welding
sheets
respectively.
1s 814 was first published
in 1957 and subsequently
revised
in 1963, 1967; 1970 and
1974.
In the fourth
revision,
IS 814, was split
in two parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The classification
and coding
of the covered
electrodes
was covered
in IS 815.
IS 815 was first
issued
in 1956 and
subsequently
revised
in 1966 and
1974.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While
revising
these
two standards
the committee
thought
it appropriate
to cover the classifica-
tion
and coding
along
with the specified
requirements
of electrodes
by merging
both
the
parts
of IS 814 and 1s 815.
Important
modifications
affected
in this revision
are as under:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The classifiation
system
has been
simplified
to a code
consisting
of a alphabets
to indi-
cate the type
of coating
and four digits
to indicate
the basic
properties
of the electrode;
The  tests
for deep penetration
electrodes
have been eliminated
as these
were
considered
to be of little
significance;
In the butt weld assembly
the transverse
tensile
and charpy
impact
tests
have been
elimi-
nated
and
only bend
test
has
been
specified.
Provisions
for ‘hydrogen
removal
heat-
treatment’
for the bend
specimen
have also been
included;
For the determination
of the quantity
of
dXusible
hydrogen
a reference
has been made
to IS 11802  :  1986 &Methods
for determination
of diffusible
hydrogen
content
of deposited
weld metals
from
covered
electrodes
in welding
mild
and low alloy
steels’;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>C)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Use of non-rimming
steel for
core
wire
has
been
permitted
by giving
reference
to the
amended
IS 2879  :  1975 ‘Mild
steel for metal
arc welding
electrode
core
wires
(  second
rel>ision )‘;
Assessment
of all weld impact
test has been
made
on the
lines
of ANSI/AWSA
5.1-81,
‘Specification
for covered
carbon
steel arc welding
electrodes’;
and
Under
the initial
tests,
radiographic
test has been
included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

whether
a particular

is complied

the final value,

shall
be
rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 <Rules for rounding

The number

should
be the

<<PARAGRAPH>>(  CZause 5.1  )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>CHARACTERISTICS
OF  COVERING
AND COATING
RATIO<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is a medium quantity
of dense slag, which
often has a brown to dark-brown
colour and a
glossy appearance.
It is easily
detached,
and
as it rises
fo the
surface
of the
weld very
quickly,
slag inclusions
are not likely to occur.
This type of electrode
given an arc of average
penetration,
and is suitable for welding
in all
positions.
This type of electrode
is used both
on a.c. and d.c. where d.c. positive
polarity
is
generally
preferred
for crrical
applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-l ACID ( A )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Electrode
of acid type have a medium or thick
covering
and
produce
an iron oxide, mang-
anese oxide, silica rich slag (with some titania
in some cases ), the metallurgical
characteri-
stics of which is acidic. The covering contains,
besides oxides,
of iron/or
manganese
( with
some
titania
in some
cases ), a fairly
high
percentage
of ferro-manganese
and/or
other
deoxidisers.
The slag generally
solidifies
in a
charcteristics
honeycomb
structure
and
is
easiIy detached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As the weld metal is higty!y resistant
to hot
and cold cracking,
these rlectrodes
are
parti-
cularly suitable for weIdi:rg heavy sections and
very rigid mild steel structures.
They are
also
recommended
for welding low alloy steels and
steels., carbon
and sulphur
content
of which
are hrgher
than those
of mild steel
of good
weldable quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This type
of electrode
usually
has a high
fusion rate and may be used with high current
intensities.
Penetration
can
be good,
parti-
cularly if the covering is thick. These electrodes
are most suitable
for welding
in flat position
but can be used in other
positions
and can be
operated
both on a.c. and d.c.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These
electrodes
must
be stored
in a reas-
onabIy dry place and shouId
be dried
before
use, according
to the recommendation
of the
manufacturer.
This
ensures
that
the weId
metal will have a Iow hydrogen
content
and
there is a less risk of underbead
cracking when
weIding steel likely to show a marked
harden-
ing in the heat af!ected
zone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2 BASIC ( B )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Electrode

wise it is us_taIIy preferred
for flat and horizontal

position
though
welding
in
other
positions
can
also
be
possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3 CELLULOSIC ( C )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The coverings
of the cellulosic
type
contains
a large
quantity
of combustible
organic
substances,
so that the decomposition
of the
latter in arc produces
a voluminous
gas shieId.
The amount
of slag produced
is small and the
slag is easily detached.
This type
of electrode
is characterised
by a
highly penetrating
arc and fairiy
high fusion
rate.
Spatter
losses
arc
fairly
high and the
weld bead is some what coarse,
with unevenly
spaced ripples. These
electrodes
are
usually
suitable for welding in all positions.
Generally
this type of electrodes
are
suitable for use on
d.c. with electrode
positive,
but some electro-
des are
also available
which
are suitable
for
use on a.c.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and
not more
than
180” C as
measured
by temperature
indicating

at the area specified
in Fig. 7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The backing

by
using a suitable
current
within

by the
manufacturer.
When
the
electrode
can
be used both on d.c. and

be used
with
OCV not less
than
that
prescribed
by the
manufacturer.
When the electrode

should
be adopted.
If all the

from
any
rust,

<<PARAGRAPH>>(  Page 8, clause 9.6 ) -L  Substitute the following for the existing clause:
‘9.6 All  welded
test  assembly [ see Fig. 7 ( renumbered
as Fig. 9 ) ] after removal of packing strip,
shall be machined
or ground smooth so as to avoid difficulty in interpretation
of radiograph
of
the weld. It shall then be subjected to radiographic
test as per IS 1182  :  1983. The radiograph
shall not show crack or incomplete
fusion. The radiographic
acceptance
standard in respect of
porosity and slag inclusions is indicated in Table 7 on page 3 of this Amendment.
( Renumber
the
subsequent Tables. )
In making the evaluation
for radiographic
acceptance
standard, a length of 25 mm from
each end
of the welded assembly shall be excluded.’
