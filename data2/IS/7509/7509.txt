<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermal Insulation Materials Sectional Committee, CHD 027<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Thermal Insulation Materials Sectional Committee had been approved by the Chemical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The material covered by this standard is in the form of dry powder, intended to be mixed with a
suitable proportion of water, applied as a plastic mass, and dried in place, for use as insulation and
not as a finishing cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The standard covers the specification of thermal insulating cements for use at limiting
temperatures up to 350°C, 750°C and 950°C. Typical materials used are:
TYPE 350
a) Hydrated magnesium carbonate and/or hydrated calcium silicate with suitable reinforcing
fibres.
b) Predominantly mineral wool fibres with suitable proportion of heat resistant binders.
TYPE 750
Hydrated calcium silicate and/or diatomaceous earth (silica) with suitable proportion of heat
resistant binders and reinforcing fibres.
TYPE 950
Exfoliated vermiculite and/or diatomaceous earth (silica) with suitable proportion of heat
resistant binders.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the publication of IS 7509 : 1974 Thermal insulating cement (type 750), IS 7510 : 1974
Thermal insulating cement (type 350) and IS 9350 : 1980 Thermal insulating cement (type 950)
covering thermal insulating cements for the range from 350°C to 950°C — the Committee decided
to amalgamate the three standards into one.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Committee responsible for the preparation of this standard is given at Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (April 1999). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1  From each of the bags selected according
to  A-1.3  approximately equal quantity of the
material shall be taken and thoroughly mixed
to form a composite sample weighing not less
than 45 kg which would be sufficient for
carrying out triplicate determination of all
characteristics given in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All bags of insulating cement belonging to the
same batch of manufacture, in a single
consignment, shall be grouped together and
each such group shall constitute a lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-1.2  For ascertaining the conformity of the lot
to the requirements of this specification tests
shall be carried out on each lot separately.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.1.1  The composite sample shall be divided

another for the supplier and the third to be
used as the referee sample.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-1.3  The number of bags to be selected (  n  )
shall depend on the lot size (  N  ) and shall be in
accordance with Table 2.<<HEADING_END>>

sample shall be transferred to separate sample
bags. These bags shall be properly stitched and
labelled with full identification particulars.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-1.3.1  These bags shall be selected at random.

<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of the Standard Mark is governed by the provisions of the  Bureau of Indian
Standards Act, 1986  and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder. The Standard Mark on
products covered by an Indian Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply with the requirements of that standard under a well defined system of inspection,
testing and quality control which is devised and supervised by BIS and operated by the
producer. Standard marked products are also continuously checked by BIS for conformity to
that standard as a further safeguard. Details of conditions under which a licence for the use of
the Standard Mark may be granted to manufacturers or producers may be obtained from the
Bureau of Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Review of Indian Standards<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Amendments are issued to standards as the need arises on the basis of comments. Standards are also
reviewed periodically; a standard along with amendments is reaffirmed when such review indicates that no
changes are needed; if the review indicates that changes are needed, it is taken up for revision. Users of
Indian Standards should ascertain that they are in possession of the latest amendments or edition by
