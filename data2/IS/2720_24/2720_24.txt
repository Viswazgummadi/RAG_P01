<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part XXIV)
(First Revision) was adopted by
the Indian Standards Institution on 16 February
1976, after the draft
finalized by the Soil Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  With a view to establishing uniform procedures for the determination of
different characteristics of soils and also for facilitating a comparative study
of the results, the Indian Standards Institution has brought out the ‘Indian
Standard methods of test for soils (IS  :  2720)’
which is being published
in parts. So far 38 parts have been published. This part (Part XXIV)
which was originally published in 1967 covers the method for the determina-
tion of cation exchange capacity of soil.
Cation exchange capacity gives
an indication of the aflinity of soil for water and its capacity for swelling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
In this revision, a method to determine the exchangeable metallic
cations and a method to determine the exchangeable hydrogen ions sepa-
rately have been given.
The sum of the exchangeable ions determined
by these methods gives the total exchangeable ions in the soil; however,
because of fixation of potassium and ammonium by illite and vermiculite
type of minerals, the cation exchange capacity values as determined by
these ions are generally lower than the true values.
A  single method which
determines the cation exchange
capacity
(metallic
and hydrogen ions
together) has also been included.
In kcepii
with the latest trend the
term
‘base exchange
capacity’
has been replaced by the term ‘cation
exchange capacity’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international co-ordination among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with
this standard, if the Snal value, observad or calculated, is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS:
2-1960+.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard (Part XXIV)
lays down the methods for the determina-
tion of exchangeable
metallic cation and exchangeable
hydrogen ion, sum
of which will be the cation exchange capacity of soils.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1.1  It  also lays down a single method which determines the cation
exchange capacity (metallic and hydrogen ions together).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard, the following definition shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Cation Exchange Capacity -
Cation exchange is the physio-chemical
process whereby one .type of ions (cation) adsorbed on soil particles is re-
placed by another type.
The cation exchange capacity signifies the capacity
of soil to retain cations up to its highest limit; or it can also be defined as
the power of the soil to combine with cation in such a manner that they
cannot be easily removed by leaching with water, but can be exchanged
by an equivalent amount of other cations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

hydroxide solution diluted to 5 litres.
The above two solutions should be mixed in equal volumes. ThejH
of the
mixed solution should be determined in a comparator using bromothymol
blue as indicator.
IfpH

acid
solution or ammonium hydroxide solution should be added to have the /IH

Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3.1
Transfer
50 to 100 g (see Note 1) of soil to 400-ml
beaker,
add
250 ml of 1 N ammonium
acetate
solution,
‘stir well and allow to stand
overnight
at room
temperature.
Then
decant
through
a 15- or 18.5-cm
filter paper and leach with further portions of the ammonium
acetate solution
in small quantities,
allowing
the filter to drain
completely
between
each
addition,
in a 1-litre flask.
Continue
leaching
until one litre of the filtrate
has been collected
(see Note 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -Take
50 g of soil when more than 20 to 25 milli-equivalent
percent of
exchangeable
cation are present and 100 g when less than 10 milli-equivalent
percent are
present, as determined
by the rapid method with 0.05 N hydrochloric
acid.
NOTE 2 -Where
possible the extraction
may be done by centrifuge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3.2  Transfer
a suitable
aliquot
of the leachate
corresponding
to
10 g of soil, to 500-ml
silica basin and evaporate
to small volume
on the
water-bath.
Transfer
the solution at this stage to a lOO-ml silica basin and
continue
the evaporation
to dryness, finishing the operation
over a hot-plate.
Ignite in a muflle furnace, gently at first and then for 20 minutes at a mndium
to full red heat, so convrrtmg
the acetates of the exchangeable
metal ions to
carbonates
or oxides.
Support
the silica basin on a triangle
to prevent
the
bottom
being
overheated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3.3
When
cold, add 20 to 50 ml of 0.05 N hydrochloric
acid, or
sufficient quantity
to ensure an excess  of  acid  at this stage; warm gently and
leave to stand until solution
of the alkalis is complete.
Then
titrate
the
excess of acid with 0.05 N sodium hydroxide
using methyl red as indicator.
If the methyl red is absorbed
as the titration proceeds add further a drop or
two just before
the end-point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.1  Take 5 g of soil in a IOO-ml centrifuge tube and stir in 50 ml of 1 N
sodium acetate of @H 5.0 with a policeman-tipped
rod.
Digest the soil
suspension in a near boiling water-bath
for 30 minutes with intermittant
stirring.
Remove the salts by centrifugation of the suspension and decan-
tation of the clear supernatant
liquid
(see Note).
Give two additional
washings with 1 N sodium acetate of PH 5.0, the 30 minutes boiling water-
bath treatment being repeated if the sample is known to be calcareous.
If
still the presence of salts is doubted, give two more washings with 1 N sodium
acetate of @H 5.0.
Then give the sample 5 washings with 1 N calcium
chloride solution.
Remove the excess salts by washings (usually 5) with 80
percent acetone, until the excess calcium chloride is removed as indicated by
a negative AgNOs test for chloride in the last of the washings.
Finally
replace calcium by means of 5 washings with a neutral 1 N sodium acetate
solution.
Place in a 500-ml conical flask, the calcium solution (about 250 ml)
resulting from displacement in the determination of cation exchange capa-
city.
Then? add 10 ml of the ammonium chloride-ammonium
hydroxide
buffer solutron to bring the solution to PH 10; and then add 10 drops of
erichrome black T indicator solution and 1 ml of 2 percent sodium cyanide
solution.
Similarly prepare a blank of sodium acetate and titrate it to a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
