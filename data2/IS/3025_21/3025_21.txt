<<PARAGRAPH>>(Incorporating Amendment No. 1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope  — Prescribes two methods for determination of total hardness, namely:
a) Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acetate acid (EDTA) method, and
b) Method based on analytical data.
1.1  The first method is based on the reaction of calcium and magnesium salts with ethylenediamine
tetra acetic acid or its disodium salt and is applicable to all types of water but not applicable to waste
water. The analytical data method is based on computation from analytical results of the sample and
is applicable to water and waste water. In case of dispute, the method based on analytical data shall
be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. EDTA Method
2.1   Principle  — This method depends on ability of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (C 10  H 16  O 8  N 2 )<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>or its disodium salt to form stable complexes with calcium and magnesium ions. When the dye
eriochrome black T (EBT) (C 2 O H 13 . N 3 O 7 S)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>is added to a solution containing calcium and magnesium ions at  p H 10.0 a wine red complex is
formed. This solution is titrated with standard solution of disodium salt of EDTA, which extracts
calcium and magnesium from the dye complex and the dye is changed back to its original blue colour.
Eriochrome black T is used to indicate the end-point for the titration of calcium and magnesium
together.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  Interferences
2.2.1  The EDTA forms stable complexes with iron, manganese, copper, lead, cobalt, zinc and nickel.
Heavy metal interferences can be eliminated by complexing the metals with cyanide. In the presence
of cyanide, the procedure may be used even when iron, copper, zinc or lead concentrations are as high
as 10 mg/l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2  The higher oxidation states of manganese above Mn ++  react rapidly with the indicator to
form discoloured oxidation products. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride reagent may be used to reduce
manganese to divalent state. The divalent manganese interference can be removed by addition of
one or two small crystals of potassium ferrocyanide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.3  In presence of high aluminium concentrations, the blue colour near end point starts
disappearing and reverts to red.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.4  Phosphate and carbonate ions may precipitate calcium at the  p H of titration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3   Reagents<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1  Buffer solution  — Dissolve 16.9 g ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) in 143 ml concentrated
ammonium hydroxide (NH 4 OH), add 1.25 g of magnesium salt of EDTA and dilute to 250 ml with
distilled water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Store the solution in a polyethylene bottle tightly stoppered to prevent loss of ammonia or
pick-up of carbon dioxide for no longer than 1 month. Dilute 10 ml of the solution to 100 ml with
distilled water and check that the  p H value is 10.0 ± 0.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.2  In the absence of magnesium salt of EDTA, dissolve 1.179 g disodium salt of EDTA (AR
quality) and 780 mg magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4 .7H 2 O) or 644 mg magnesium chloride (MgCl 2 .
6H 2 O) in 50 ml of distilled water. Add this solution to 16.9 g ammonium chloride and 143 ml
concentrated ammonium hydroxide with mixing and dilute to 250 ml with distilled water. To
attain the highest accuracy, adjust to exact equivalance through appropriate addition of a small
amount of EDTA or magnesium sulphate or chloride. The exact amount can be determined by
taking an appropriate aliquot of buffer and titrate it with disodium salt of EDTA as in  2.4.1 . Keep
the solutions tightly stoppered to prevent loss of ammonia or absorbance of carbon dioxide and do
not store for more than a month. Dilute 10 ml of the solution to 100 ml with distilled water and
check that the  p H value is 10.0 ± 0.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.3  Standard calcium solution  — 1.00 ml = 1.00 mg calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). Dry analytical
grade calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) in an oven at 180°C for 1 hour. Weigh 1.000 g, suspend it in
distilled water and add 1 : 1 hydrochloric acid AR quality, dropwise slowly to dissolve the solid.
Use minimum amount of acid. Boil for a few minutes, cool, add a few drops of methyl red indicator
and adjust to orange colour with 3N ammonium hydroxide or 1 : 1 hydrochloric acid. Dilute to
1 000 ml with distilled water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.4  Eriochrome black T indicator solution  — Dissolve 0.40 g eriochrome black T and 4.5 g
hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH 2 OH HCl) in 100 ml 95 percent ethanol. This indicator is stable
for more than 2 months. Alternatively, dissolve 0.5 g eriochrome black T in 100 ml
triethanolamine or 2-methoxyethanol or mixed 0.5 g EBT dye and 100 g soduim chloride in a
pestle and mortar. Store in a tightly stoppered bottle. All indicator formulations tend to
deteriorate especially when exposed to moisture. If the end point colour change is not sharp
enough it is either due to the presence of some interfering ions or due to deterioration of the
indicator. In the latter case, addition of inhibitor sodium cyanide or sodium sulphide (NaCN or
Na 2 S) does not sharpen the end point colour change.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3.5  Inhibitors  — For most waters inhibitors are not necessary. If interfering ions are present,
inhibitors given in  2.3.5.1  to  2.3.5.4  may be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.5.1  Hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution  — Dissolve 45 g hydroxylamine hydrochloride
(NH 2 OH.HCl) in demineralised water and dilute to 1 litre, or dissolve 4.5 g hydroxylamine
hydrochloride in 100 ml of 95 percent ethanol or isopropanol.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3.5.2   Potassium ferrocyanide crystals<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3.5.3  Sodium sulphide inhibitor  — Dissolve 5.0 g sodium sulphide (Na 2 S.9H 2 O) or 3.7 g Na 2 S.
5H 2 O in 100 ml distilled water. Tightly stopper so as to avoid excessive contact with air.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.5.4  Sodium cyanide solution  — Dissolve 2.5 g sodium cyanide (NaCN) in demineralised water
and dilute to 100 ml. As sodium cyanide is extremely poisonous, it should be handled with care.
The solution should not be made acidic and should be flushed down the drain with large amounts
of water when it is to be disposed off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 3025 (Part 21) - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.6  Standard EDTA solution  — Dissolve 3.723 g EDTA (Na 2 H 2 C 10 H 12 O N 2 .2 H 2 O) which has
been dried overnight in a sulphuric acid desiccator, in demineralised water and dilute to 1 000 ml.
The reagent is stable for several weeks and large volume is usually prepared. Check the reagent by
titrating 25 ml of standard calcium solution as described in  2.4.1 . Store in polyethylene bottles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4   Procedure
2.4.1  Standardization  — Pipette 25.0 ml of standard calcium solution in a porcelain basin and
adjust the volume to 50 ml with distilled water. Add 1 ml buffer solution ( 2.3.1 ). Add 1 to 2 drops
of indicator ( 2.3.4 ), titrate slowly with continuous stirring until the redish tinge disappears,
adding last few drops at 3 to 5 second interval. At the end point the colour is sky blue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.2  Procedure for drinking ,  surface and saline waters  — Pipette an aliquot of water sample,
maximum 50 ml, in a porcelain dish or 150-ml beaker and adjust the volume to approximately
50 ml. Add 1 ml hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH 2 OH.HCl), solution. Add 1 to 2 ml buffer
solution so as to achieve  p H of 10.0 to 10.1. If the end point is not sharp (as determined by practice)
add 2 ml sodium cyanide or sodium sulphide inhibitor solution. The addition of sodium cyanide or
sodium sulphide may be omitted if copper, zinc, lead, cobalt and nickel are absent and if the
sample contains less than 0.25 mg of iron and 0.025 mg of manganese. If manganese is present,
add 1 or 2 small crystals of potassium ferri cyanide [K 4  Fe (CN) 6 . 3H 2 O]. Stir and wait for at least
5 minutes until sodium ferri cyanide precipitates. Add 2 ml eriochrome black T indicator solution,
titrate with standard EDTA solution stirring rapidly in the beginning and slowly towards the end
till end point is reached when all the traces of red and purple colour disappear and solution is clear
sky blue in colour. Blank titration, carried out in a similar way as that for sample, may be used for
comparison.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.3  Procedure for waste waters and highly polluted waters  — Digest an aliquot of the sample
with 3 ml of distilled concentrated nitric acid in a beaker on a hot plate and evaporate to near
dryness cautiously making sure that the sample does not boil. Repeat digestion with nitric acid till
the digestate is light in colour. Evaporate to near dryness and cool the beaker. Add a small
quantity of 1 : 1 hydrochloric acid (5 ml) and warm on a hot-plate or steam-bath to dissolve the
residue. Cool, adjust to a suitable volume and take an aliquot of this digested sample. Proceed as
given in  2.4.2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Note 1  — For water with very low hardness (less than 5 mg/l) micro burette may be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note 2  — Selection of sample size may be made such that the result lies between 200 to 300 mg/l of hardness
(as CaCO 3 ).
2.5  Calculation  — Calculate the hardness as follows:
Total hardness as (CaCO 3 ), mg/l = [100 (  V 1 – V 2  )/ V 3 ] ×  CF<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Report  — Report hardness in mg/l as CaCO 3  rounded to the first decimal place when the value
is less than 10 mg/l and to the nearest unit if the value is more than 10 mg/l.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7  Precision and Accuracy  — The precision is within 1 mg/l. The accuracy depends on the
interfering substances present. In the absence of any interference, it is within 1 mg/l.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Note  — Standard deviation of 1.2 mg/l has been reported.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. Method Based on Analytical Data<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Principle  — Total hardness computed from the concentration of the different metallic cation
(other than alkali metals) in the sample but most often the cations taken into account are calcium,
magnesium, iron, aluminium, zinc, strontium, barium and manganese.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2   Calculation<<HEADING_END>>

N O T E
Total hardness of water is the sum of the concentrations of all the metallic cations other than
cations of alkali metals, expressed as equivalent calcium carbonate concentration. In most natural
waters, hardness is mainly due to calcium and magnesium ions. In some waters, measurable
concentrations of iron, aluminium, manganese, barium, zinc and other metals may be present.
When the hardness is numerically greater than the sum of carbonate alkalinity and bicarbonate
alkalinity; the amount of hardness which is equivalent to total alkalinity is called ‘carbonate
hardness’ and the amount of hardness in excess of this is called ‘non-carbonate hardness’. Some
waters containing high concentrations of borates, phosphates, silicates, may contribute to total
alkalinity.
