Scope \u2014 Prescribes two methods for determination of total hardness, namely:\na)Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acetate acid (EDTA) method, and\nb)Method based on analytical data.\n1.1The first method is based on the reaction of calcium and magnesium salts with ethylenediamine\ntetra acetic acid or its disodium salt and is applicable to all types of water but not applicable to waste\nwater. The analytical data method is based on computation from analytical results of the sample and\nis applicable to water and waste water. In case of dispute, the method based on analytical data shall\nbe used.\n2. EDTA Method\n2.1 Principle \u2014 This method depends on ability of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (C H O N )\n10 16 8 2\nor its disodium salt to form stable complexes with calcium and magnesium ions. When the dye\neriochrome black T (EBT) (C O H . N O S)\n2 13 3 7\nis added to a solution containing calcium and magnesium ions at pH 10.0 a wine red complex is\nformed. This solution is titrated with standard solution of disodium salt of EDTA, which extracts\ncalcium and magnesium from the dye complex and the dye is changed back to its original blue colour.\nEriochrome black T is used to indicate the end-point for the titration of calcium and magnesium\ntogether.\n2.2 Interferences\n2.2.1The EDTA forms stable complexes with iron, manganese, copper, lead, cobalt, zinc and nickel.\nHeavy metal interferences can be eliminated by complexing the metals with cyanide. In the presence\nof cyanide, the procedure may be used even when iron, copper, zinc or lead concentrations are as high\nas 10mg/l.",
