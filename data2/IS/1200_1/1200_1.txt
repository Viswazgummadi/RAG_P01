<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods
of Measurement
of Works of Civil Engineering
(Excluding
River
Valley
Projects )
Sectional Committee, CED 44<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 1 ) ( Fourth Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by the Methods of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering
( Fxcluding
~~;;c~,alley
Projects ) Sectional Committee
had been approved by the  Civil
Engineering
Division<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement occupies a very important place in the planning and execution of any civil engineering
work from the time of first estimates
to the final completion and settlement of payments for a
project.
Methods
followed
for measurement
are not uniform and considerable differences exist
between practices followed by different construction
agencies and also between various Central
and
State Government
departments.
While it is recognized that each system of measurement has to be
specifically related to administrative
and financial organizations
within a department
responsible
for
the work, a unification
of various systems at technical level has been accepted as very desirable,
specially
as it permits
a wider range of operation for civil engineering contractors
and eliminates
ambiguities and misunderstandings
of various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Among various civil engineering items, measurement of buildings was the first to be taken up for
standardization
and this standard having provisions relating to building work was first published in
1958  and was subsequently
revised in 1964.
In its second revision. the standard was issued in
different parts corresponding
to different trades in building and civil engineering
works.
The third
revision of the standard was published in 1974.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This fourth
revision
has been brought out to incorporate
the changes found necessary in light of
usage of this standard and the suggestions made by various bodies implementing it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether particular requirement of this standard is complied
with, the
final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a measurement. shall be rounded off
in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised)‘.
The number
of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Where hard/dense
soil,
soft/disintegrated
rock and hard  rock are mixed, the measure-
ment for the total quantity shall be made by
methods (a ) and/or ( b) given above.
If
possible after
the removal
of the
hard/
dense
soil
the
levels
of
the
exposed
rocks
urface
should
be taken and
the
quantity
of the hard/dense
soil removed,
worked
out from the difference
between
the original levels and new levelsS’. If this
is not possible
the excavation
should
be
completed
leaving[,tell-tales
and from the
cross-section of these tell-tales, the area of
the hard/dense
soil excavated
should
be
worked out and ihen the volume of the
hard/dense
soil
excavated
arrived
at.
Quantity of hard dense soil should then be
deducted from the total quantity
of hard
rock
and
soft/disintegrated
rock.
The
quantities of hard rock and soft/disintegrated
rock should then be separated
as in ( c)
above by stacking the hard rock separately.
Where soft/loose soil, hard/dense soil, soft/
disintegrated
rock and hard rock are mixed,
the measurements
of the entire
quantity
shall be made by methods ( a ) and/or

given above.
The separate
quantities
of
soft/loose soil and hard/dense soil shall be
worked out from the cross-section based on
dead men or tell-tales as mentioned in ( d )
in case of
hard/dense
soil.
The
total
quantity of soft/loose
and hard/dense
soil
shall then be deducted
from the total ex-
cavation to arrive at the total
quantity
of
rock excavated.

integrated rock and hard rock excavated

<<PARAGRAPH>>Soft/Disintegrated
Rock
( Not
Requiring
Blasting ) -  Rock or boulders
which may
be. quarried
or split with crowbars.
This
will
also
include
laterite
and
hard
conglomerate.
Hard Rock ( Requiring
Blasting ) -
Any
rock or boulder
for the
excavation
of
which blasting is required.
NOTE -Boulder
is a rock
fragment
usually
rounded by weathering disintegration and exfolia-
tionor abrasion by water or ice, having maximum.
diameter in anv direction of more than 300 mm.

river  bed. soil, talus,  slope wash and terrace
material of dissimilar origin.
Hard Rock ( Blasting Prohibited) -  Hard
rock
requiring
blasting
as
described
under (e) but where blasting is prohibited
for any reason
and excavation
has to be
carried
out by chiselling, wedging or any
other agreed method.

OF‘MEASUREMENT
OR
VARIOUS
TYPES OF EXCAVATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The measurement
of earthwork shall be done
in cubic metres, unless otherwise mentioned.
The
measurements to be taken shall be those of the
authorized
dimensions from which soil has been
taken
out
and
shall
be
measured
without
allowance for increase in bulk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Excavation
in  Earthwork
Including
Rock
Cutting<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1 WhereLer it is not possible or convenient
to take measurements from borrow pits  or cutting,
excavation
shall be worked
out
from
‘6Iling’
(  see 4.3 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The measurement
of excavation
in
earthwork
including rock cutting shall be made as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the excavation
is in trenches
or
from borrow pits in fairly uniform
ground,
the measurements
of cutting
trenches or
borrow
pits shall be made. ‘Dead men’ or
‘tell-tales’ may be left at suitable intervals
to
determine
the
average
depth
of
excavation.
Where the ground
is not uniform, levels
shall be taken before
the start, after site
clearance
and after the completion of the
work and the quantity
of excavation
in
cutting computed from these levels.
Where soft/disintegrated
irock
and
hard
rock are mixed the measurement
for the
total quantity shall be made by method (a)
and/or
(b) given above.
The hard rock
excavated
shall be stacked and measured
in stack. The quantity
of the hard rock
excavated
shall be arrived at by applying
pre-accepted
deductions ( stated as a per
centage )
for
voids.
From
the
total
quantity
of the mixture
the quantity
of
hard rock excavated thus arrived
at shall
be deducted to work out the quantity
of
the soft/disintegrated
rock excavated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2 Dressing or trimming
sides of excavations
and levelling or grading and ramming of bottoms
shall be described with the item of  excavation
except in the case of rough excavation ( see 4.5 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3 All
excavation
shall
be
measured
in
successive stages of 1’5 m  stating  the  commencing
level.
This shall not apply toffcases where no
lift is involved as in hillside cutting.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4 All excavation shall generally
be described
as ‘excavate
and get out’.
Getting
out
shall
include throwing the excavated earth at least one
metre or l/3 depth ( see Note ) of excavation
whichever is more clear of edge of the excavation.
The subsequent
disposal
of surplus
excavated
material shall either be stated as a separate
item
or included with the item of excavation
stating
the lead.
NOTE -  In  special cases where
disposal
area
is
limited or where application
of this requirement
is
impracticable, the person in-charge may adopt a berm
of reduced width in any case not less than 600 mm
provided the material being excavated
is sufficiently
stable and shoring is designed to carry the additional
loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
