<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Third Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 11 May
1989, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Asbestos cement pressure pipes are being used in this country
for more than 50 years
and consi-
derable experience
is available in regard to their use,
over
ground
and underground,
for water
supply pressure mains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was originally published in 1960 and subsequently
revised
in 1970 and 1980.
The
Sectional Committee
decided to revise the standard further in the light of experience gained
in its
use.
In the first revision,
standard
dimensions for three classes of pipes ( Class 5, 10 and
15 )
of diameter 80 to 200 mm only were given.
In the second revision, detailed dimensions
for  pipes
of class 20 and 25 were included, in addition
to covering pipes of diameter 80 to 600 mm for all
the five classes of pipes.
In this revision, dimensions
for pipes of diameter 700 to 1 000 mm and
two new classes of pipes, that is, Class 5 TP and Class 10 TP for diameter
700 to 1000 mm have
been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Addition
of ground silica or pozzolana to replace ordinary Portland
cement in the manufacture
has
been permitted
in this specification
in the case of autoclaved
pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers all requirements
of asbestos
cement
presssure
pipes manufactured
in the
sountry
for
local consumption
as well
as for export.
Necessary
guidance
regarding
the
sL!ection of asbestos cement pressure pipes may be obtained from Indian Standard
‘Guidelines
for
selection of asbestos
cement pipes subject
to external
loads
with or without
internal
pressure
(  under preparation )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard, due weightage has been given to international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices prevailing in different countries
in addition to relating it to the
practices in the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing the result
off a test, shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values
(  revised )‘.  The number
of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
