<<HEADING level=3>>METHODS OF SAMPLING AND
ANALYSIS OF CONCRETE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institu-
tion on 10 November
1,959, after the draft finalized by tht Cement and
Foz;e
Sectional Commtttee had been approved by the B&ding Division
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Testing plays an important role in controlling the quality of cement
concrete work.
Systematic testing of the raw materials for concrete as
also, the concrete, both while it is fresh and after it has hardened, is an
inseparable part of any quality control programme for concrete.
It helps
to achieve higher efficiency of the materials used and greater assurance of
the performance of the concrete in regard to both strength and durability.
The test methods used should be simple, direct and convenient in their
application.
This standard has been prepared with this object in view
and provides a guide to the sampling, analysis, and determination of linear
changes of concrete.
Strength tests for concrete
have
been covered
separately in IS  :  516-1959 Methods of Tests for Strength of Concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The Sectional Committee responsible for the preparation of this stand-
ard has taken into consideration the views of concrete specialists, testing
authorities, consumers and technologists and has related the standard to
the practices followed in the country in this field.
The need for inter-
national co-ordination between standards prevailing in different countries
of the world has also been recognized.
These considerations led the
Sectional Committee to derive assistance from the published standards and
publications of the following organizations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>BRITISH STANDARDS INSTITUTION<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  This method specifies the procedure to be followed in the field for
obtaining representative samples of fresh concrete directly Coti the mixer
or from concrete at the time and place of depositipn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Sample - The  composite
sample shall be truly representative of the
batch and shall be not less than CO2 ma in volume.
It shall be composed
of  a  mixture of portions taken Corn d&rent
points in the batch.
When
continuous
mixers~ are used, ” batch shall be regarded as the discharge
* from the mixture during one minute.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Procednfe<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1  From Mixers  -At
least three approximately
equal sample incre_
ments totalling 0.02 ms shall be taken Corn a batch during its discharge
and each sample
increment
shall be collected l$ passing a clean and
dry receptacle across the stream d concrete.
This receptacle shall be con-
structed of non-absorbent
material,
preferably of metal and shall be such
that the sample retained is not segregated.
A fiat surface without retain-
ing sides will not fulfil this purpose.
Where three sample increments
are
taken they shall be taken at about the time when one-quarter, one-halfand
three-quarters
of the concrete have been discharged from the mixer and if
more than three are taken they shall be at correspondingly
shorter, but
equally spaced, intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2  From Concrete at k
%ne
and Place of Deposition-The
sample
shall be taken while a batch of concrete is being, or immediately
after it
has been, discharged on the site.
The sample shall be collected from not
less than five weli-distributed
positions, avoiding the edge of the mass
where segregation may have occurred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Mixing
the  Composite
Sample -  The composite sample obtained
by either of the methods described above, shall be mixed on a non-absor-
bent base either with a shovel or by other-suitable
implement
in such a
manner as to ensure uniformity.
The sample thus obtained shall be used
immediatciy

preparing
test specimens from
hardened concrete
in structures and
pavements.
A specimen to be tested for strength shall not be removed
from the structure until the ctmcrete has become hard enough to permit
its removal without disturbing the bond between the mortar and the
coarse aggregate.
Normally, the concrete shall be 14 days old before the
specimens are removed.
Specimens that show abnormal defects or that
have been damaged in removal shall not be  used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Apparatas
4.2.1  DA%-
A  core drill shall be used for securing cylindrical
core
specimens.
For specimens taken perpendicular to the horizontal surface, a
short drill is satisfactory. For inclined holes, a diamond drill is satisfactory.
42.2
Saw -
A saw shall be used for securing beam specimens from the
structure or pavement  *  for flexural strength tests. The saw shali have a
diamond or silicon carbide cutting edge and shall have adjustments that
permit of cutting specimens
conforming
to the dimensions specified
in 4.3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Test specimcas

-
A core specimen for the determination of pave-
ment thickness shall have a diameter of at least 10 cm. A core specimen
for the determination of compressive strength shall have a diameter at least
three times the maximum nominal size of the coarse aggregate used in the
concrete, and in no case shall the diameter of the specimen be less than
twice the maximum nominal size of the coarse aggregate.
The length of
the specimen, when capped, shall be as nearly as practicable
twice its
diimeter.

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 Procedure
4.4.1 Core  Drilling -
A core specimen taken perpendicular
to a hori-
zontal surface shall be located, when possible, with its axis perpendicular
to the bed of the concrete as originally placed.
Aispecimen
taken per-
pendicular to a vertical St&ace, or perpendicular to a surface with a batter,
shall be taken from near the middle of a unit of deposit.
4.4.2  Slab Removal-A
sufficiently large slab shall be removed so that
the desired test specimens may be secured without the inclusion of any
concrete
which
has been
cracked,
spalled,
undercut,
or
otherwise
damaged.
4.4.3  Beam Sawing -
The  sawing operation shall .be so performed that
the concrete will not be weakened by shock or by heating.
The sawn
surfaces shall be smooth, plane, parallel and shall be free from steps, ridges
and grooves. Care shall be taken in handling the sawn beam specimens to
avoid chipping or cracking.
4.5  Measarement
of Drilled Core Specimens
4.5.1  Mean Diametcr-
The mean diameter shall be determined to the
nearest millimetre from three pairs of measurements.
The two measure-
ments in each pair shall be taken at right angles to each other, one pair
being taken at the middle of the core and the other pairs at the quarter
points of the depth.
The mean of the six readings shall be taken as the
diameter.
45.2
Height -
The height of the core shall be determined by measuring
the maximum
and minimum
heights, which shall be reported to the
nearest millimetre.
4.5.3  Position of Reinforccmmt -
The positions of any remforcement shall
be determined by measuring to the nearest millimetre from the centre of
the exposed bars to the top of the core.
The diameter and, if possible, the
spacing of the bars shall be recorded, and also the minimum top and
bottom cover.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

have leaked out between the mould and the base plate shall be cleaned
away.
The mould shall be removed from the concrete immediately by
raising it slowly and carefully in a vertical direction.
This allows the
concrete to subside and the slump shall be measured immediately by
ddtermining the difference between the height of the mould and that of
the highest point of the specimen being tested.
The above operations
shall be carried out at a place free from vibration or shock, and within a
ljeriod of two minutes after sampling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5
Shm@ -
The slump measured shall be recorded in terms of milli-
lnetres of subsidence of the specimen during the test.
Any slump speci-
men which collapses or shears off laterally gives incorrect result and if this
occurs the test shall be repeated with another sample.
If, in the repeat
test also, the specimen should shear, the slump.shall be measured and the
fact that the specimen sheared, shall be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-Some
indication of the cohesiveness and workability of the mix can be
obtained, if after the slump measurement has been completed, the side of the concrete
is tapped gently with the tamping rod; a well-proportioned concrete which has an
appreciable slump will gradually slump fm’ther, but if the mix has  been  badly
proportioned, it is likely to fall apart.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

‘I%C  sample of concrete TV be tested shall be placed  i
gently in the upper hopper, using the  hand sccmp.
The hopper shall be  ’
filled level with its brim and the trap-door shall be opened so that the
concrete falls into the lower hopper..
Certain mixes  have a  tendency to
stick in one or both of the hoppers.
If this occurs, the concrete may be
helped through by pushing the rod gently into the concrete from the top.
&ring
this process, the cylinder shall be covered by the trowels.
Im-
mediately after the concrete has come to rest, the cylinder shall be un-
covered, the trap-door of the lower hopper opened, and the concrete
allowed to fall into the cylinder.
The excess of concrete remaining above
the level of the top of the cylinder shall then be cut off by holding a trowel
in each hand, with the plane of the blades horizontal, and nicving them
simultaneously one from each side across the top of the cylinder, at the
same time keeping them pressed on the top edge of the cylinder.
The
outside of the cylinder shall then be wiped clean.
The above operation
shall be carried out at a place free from vibration  or  shock.
The ‘weight
of the concrete in the cylinder shall then be determined to the nearest
10 g.
This weight shall be known  as  c  the  weight of partially compacted
concrete ‘.
The cylinder shall be refilled with concrete .from the same
sample in layers approximately
5 cm deep, the layers being heavily
rammed or preferably vibrated so as to obtain full compaction.
The top
surface of the fully compacted concrete shall be carefully struck off level
with the top of the cylinder.
The outside of the cylinder shall then be
wiped clean.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ncue -  The test is sufficiently sensitive to enable differences in workability at&&
from the initial processes in the hydration of the cement to bc measured.
Each tat,
therefore, should be carried out at a constant time interval after the mixing is completed
if strictly co&parable results are to be ,obtaincd.
A convenient time for releasing &
concrete from the upper hopper has been found to be 2 minutes after the completion
of mixing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>83.1 Change in barometric pressure caused by change in elevation or

conditions; will affect the calibration ofprcssure type apparatus for deter-
mination of air content. The  steps
described under this clause are pre-
rquisites for the final calibration test to determine the operating pressure  P
on the pressure gauge as described hereunder. Normally, this calibration
need be made only once ( at the time of the initial calibration ), or only
occasionally to check volume constancy of the. calibration cylinder and
measuring bowl.
On the other hand, the calibration test described
in 8.3.7 must be made as frequently ax necessary, to ensure that the proper
gauge pressure  P is being us4
in tests  for the air content of concrete.

entrap as little air as possible and remove accumulations of foam promptly.
Tap the sides of the bowl and lightly rod the upper layer of the aggregate
about t-en times and stir after each addition of fine aggregate to eliminate
entrapped air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When all of the aggregate has been placed in the bowl and inundated
for at least 5 minutes, strike off all foam and excess water and thoroughly
clean the flanges of both bowl and conical cover so that when the cover is

described in 8.4.. The aggregate correction factor G is equal to ir,--h, as
determined in the tests on the aggregate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -The

can be determined only by test, since apparently it is  not  directly related to
absorption of the particles.
The test can be easily made and shall not be ignored.
Ordinarily the factor remains reasonably constant for given aggregates, but an
occasional check test is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4  Procedure for Determining
Air Content of Concrete-
Place
a representative sample of the concrete in the measuring bowl in three
equal layers, consolidating each layer by rodding the bowl. Vibration may
be substituted for rodding and by tapping the sample when the air content
of concrete placed by vibration is to be determined.
When the concrete
is to be placed by rodding, consolidate each layer of concrete by about
25 strokes of the tamping rod evenly distributed over the cross-section.
Follow the rodding of each layer by tapping the sides of the bowl smartly
10 to 15 times with the mallet until the cavities left by r&ding arelevelled
out and no large bubbles of the air appear on the surface of the rodded
layer.
In rodding the i!rst layer, the rod shall not forcibly strike the
bottom of the bowl.
In rodding the second and final layers, only enough
force shall be used to cause the rod to penetrate the surface of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_38>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>previous layer.
Slightly over6ll the howl with the third layer and, after
rodding or vibration,
remove the excess concrete by sliding the str&e-oE
bar across the top flange with
a sawing motion until the bowl is just
level full.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thoroughly clean the- flanges of the bowl and of the conical cover so
that when the cover is clamped in place, a pressure-tight
seal will be
obtained.
Assemble the apparatus and add water over the concrete by
means of the tube until it rises to about halfway mark in the standpipe.
Incline the apparatus
assembly about 30” f&m vertical end, using the
bottom of the bowl aa a pivot, dexribe
several complete circles with the
upper end of the column simultaneously tapping the conical cover lightly
to remove any entrapped air bubbles above the concrete sample.
Return
the apparatus assembly to its vertical position and fill the water column
slightly above the zero mark, while lightly tapping the sides of the bowl.
Foam on the surface of the water column may be removed with a syringe
or with a spray  of  alcohol  to provide a clear meniscus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bring the water level to the zero mark of the graduated tube before
closing the vent at the top of the water column ( Fig. 9A !.
Apply slightly
more than the desired test pressure  P ( 092  kg/cm* more ) to the concrete
by means of the small. hand pump.
To relieve local restraints, tap thC
sides of the measures smartly, and when the pressure gauge indicates the
exact
test pressure  P (as  determined iri accordance
with 8.3.1
in the
calibration test ), read the water level A1 arid record to the nearest division
or half division ( @IO or @05
percent air content ) on the graduated
precision bore tube or gauge glass of the standpipe
( Fig. 9B ).
For
extremely
harsh mixes, it may be necessary to tap the bowl vigorously
until further ‘tapping produces no change in the indicated
air content.
Gradually release_ the air pressure through the vent at the top of the water
column and tap the sides of the bowl lightly for about one minute.
Record the water level h,, to the nearest division or  half  division ( Fig. 9C ).
The apparent air content A, is equal to A1 -

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 Preparation
of Sample -Every
precaution
shall be taken to
have the sample of concrete used for analysis truly representative of the
material under consideration.
Several portions weighing at least 5 kg each
shail be taken to avoid all but slight inequalities of the concrete mix.
These portions shall then be broken up, crushed in a suitable machine to
about one centimetre size and reduced to a fineness of approximately
IS Sieve 10 to IS Sieve 8 in a ball mill, disc pulveriser or by any other
suitable device.
Care shall be taken that rhe finer fractions of the broken
sample, which are richer in ,cement, are not discarded or lost.
After
thorough mitiing and quartering, a portion approximately
100 g shall be
taken and carefully freed, by means of a strong magnet, from particles of
metallic iron abraded from the pulveriser ball mill.
The clean sample
shall then be dried at 105°C for at least 2 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.4 Procedure -  Weigh into each of three 250 ml beakers, not less than
a 2 g portion of the prepared sample.
Moisten with a stream of hot water,
while stirring to prevent adhesion to the beaker or the formation of lumps
in .the mass.
Slowljl add 100 ml of 3.3 N hydrochloric acid and stir
thoroughly.
The lumps which tend to form should be reduced with the
glass rod.
After the evolution
of carbon dioxide has ceased and the
reaction is apparently complete, heat gently for a few minutes and allow
the contents of thi beaker to settle.
Decant through an ignited and
weighed Gooch crucible which contains a mat of short asbestos shreds,
practically insoluble in hydrochloric acid and thick enough to be opaque

Once the filtration has, begun, care shall be taken so that the
mat and accumulated residue do not dry out completely until the filtration
process is complete.
Regulate the suction so as to maintain a rapid rate
of dropping during the greater part of the filtration.
Retain as much of
the residue in the beaker as possible.

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.5 The filtrate now contains the silica in the form of silicic acid in true
solution or in suspension in the hydrochloric acid medium.
If the aggre-
gates of the original sample are largely calcarcous or dolomitic, add 10 ml
of hydrochloric acid ( sp ,gr 1.19 ) to the solution. Transfer to a suitable
beaker with several rinsings of the flltqllask,
Evaporate to dryness with
great care to minimize spattering, bake at not over 120°C for one hour,
moisten with hydrochloric acid ( sp gr l-19 ), evaporate and bake again
and take for filtration in 75 ml of 2 N or 3 N hydrochloric acid heated to
boiling.
Filter through an ashless filter paper and wash the residue with
50 ml of hot 1 N hydrochloric acid and then with hot water until the
washings are free from chloride.
Repeat the evaporation and filtering
processes to recover the small amounts of silica dissolved and add these!
to the first residue. Determine the silica present in the sample by trcat-
ment with hydrofluoric and sulphuric. acids in accordance with the
procedure given in Appendix A of IS  :  269-1958’ .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.6 Correction
Factor  -When
the aggregates, used in the concrete
being analyzed, are available, a blank test shall be run on these aggregates
to determine their content of silica, soluble under the conditions of the
test (see 9.4 ).
This content of the soluble silica shall then be used as a
correction factor and be subtracted from the total soluble silica found in  the
concrete, the difference being due to the cement contained in the
specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7 Calculation -The
percentage of cement in the sample shall be cal-
culated by dividing the percentage of silica found by the factor O-214 0,
provided the silica content of the cement is not known to be different from
this value.
When possible, the known value shall be taken as  the  factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

This shall be taken as the  ‘  original wet measurement ‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE
-The
instrument reading required is not the absolute length of the specimen
but the difference in length between the specimen and an invar rod of approximat&
the same length.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘IYhe specilnen
shall then be dried
in the oven as described
under 10.2.2
at the specified temperature and humidity for at least 44
hours.
The specimen shall then be removed from the oven and cooled for
at least four houq in a desiccator containing solid calcium chloride in a
saturated solution of calcium chloride.
The length of the specimen shall
then be measured as described above at a temperature of 24 to 30°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  lf measurements are made at temperatures other than 2YC,
they
&odd

reduced by PO02 percept of the dry length for each 2W above 25°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.4.1 The cycle of drying, cooling and measuring shall be repeated
until constant length is attained, that is, when the difference between two
consecutive readings separated by a period,of  drying  of at least 4% hours,
followed by cooling for at least four hours, ,is less than 0.01 mm for a 15 cm
specimen, and proportionately greater for a larger specimen.
The final
reading shall be taken as the dry measurement.
During the above drying
process, further wet specimens shall not be placed in the same oven, and
there shall be a free access of air to all surfaces of the specimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.43
After ,t)it: dry ‘measurement has been taken, the length of the
specimen shall be measured, adjacent, to the balls, .to the nearest 0’5 mm
and this shall be taken as the  ‘ dry  length ‘.

<<PARAGRAPH>>103 Determination
of Moistme
Movement
-  For the determination
of the moisture movement, the specimen shall first be tested for initial
drying shriiage
or drying shrinkage as described above and the dry
measurement determined.
The specimen shall then be immersed in water
at 24 to 30°C in such a manner that one of the larger faces of the specimen
just breaks surface in the water and shall be left so immersed for four days
after which the  (  final wet measurement  ’  shall be determined.
The mois-
ture movement
shall be calculated as the difference between the  c  dry
measurement  ’  and  ‘  final wet measurement  ’  expressed as percentage of the
‘dry
length’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
