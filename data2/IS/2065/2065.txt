<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 30 November
1983, after the draft finalized by
the Water Supply and Sanitation Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard, first published in 1963 ‘and subsequently revised in 1952,
made an attempt to provide the minimum standards for the design, layout
and workmanship governing water supply in buildings and helped in bring-
ing about desired uniformity in the bye-laws and regulations framed by
different water supply authorities in the country.
The need for following
the regulations are imperative as they are intended for the prevention of
waste, misuse, undue consumption and contamination
of drinking water,
the conservation of which  has become an urgent necessity in view of its
increasing demand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
The salient changes made in the revision are for estimating the
demand load for water supply system, for which the minimum water supply
requirements for residential purposes has been changed to 200 liters per
head per day and the discharge curve are now based on Hazen and
William formula.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.2.2 A separate Indian Standard laying down guidelines for registra-
tion of plumbers is under preparation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.9 For the purpose of deciding whether a ,particular requirement of this
standard
is complied with
the
final value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing the result of a test  or analysis,  shall be rounded
off  iA
accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.
The rmmber of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.

flow that will be satisfactory for any part of

the size of the family and
other, ancilliary
requirements,
such as
gardening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1 The water supply requireme&.s for’ residences and. for buildings
other than residences have been specified in IS  :  1172-1983*.
Whereas
in the case of buildings other than residences, the number of persons
normally required to occupy the same is usually known;
in the case of
residences, the number of persons occupying the premises varies largely
from place to place.
In many large cities, there is over-crowding in
residential buildings.
The requirements stipulated in this code are based
upon an average family of 5 and a consumption of 1000 litres per one
dwelling unit.
Thus if a building contains ten dwelling units, the rquire-
ment of water has been taken as 10 000 litres per day.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  Rate of Flow -
One of the important items that needs to be deter-
mined before the sizes of pipes and fittings for any part of the water piping
system may be decided upon, is the rate of flow in the service pipe which,
in turn,.depends upon the mimber of hours for which the supply. is avai-
lable at sMciently
high pre ure.
$
If the number of hours for which the
supply  is  available is less, t epe will be large number of fittings in use
simultaneously and the rate df flow will be correspondingly large.
%
5.3.1 “me data rquired
for determining the size of the communication
and service pipe are (a) the maximum rate of discharge required, (b) the
length of the pipe, (c) the head loss by friction in that length, and (d) the.
roughness of the jnterior surf&
of the pipe.
In determining the head
loss by friction, allowance
shall be
made
for
the elevation of the
intake works in relation to the available pressure in the water main and of_
the losses  in fittings,
such
as  bends,  stoptaps
meters
f  see  IS  : 2951 _
(  Part 2 )-1965t]and any obstnxtions to the flow of water.
As the pipe-
line tends to accumidate internal jncrustation in course of time, normally
a~ average value for w
co-eEcient  6 C ’ is  assumed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.1 Several formulae,  diagrams
and tables of calculated values are
available for the measurement of flow through pipes.

<<PAGE_13>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pattern ( like turbulent, transient, laminar ) yields accurate and mutually
consistent results over a very large range of the flow compared to emperi-
cal formulae which have limitations regarding their range of applicability.
Although non-dimensional
parameters are used, these rational formulae
based on Raynolds number need information on viscosity and the calcula-
tions are more involved.
To obviate the involved calculations, a universal
pipe friction diagram as prescribed
in IS  :  2951 ( Part 1 )-1965* and
IS  :  2951 ( Part 2 )-1965t may be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.2 Temperature of water and consequently its viscosity at a place is
an extremely variable factor, depending upon season and time.
Further,
commercially available standard sizes of pipes are only to be used against
the size arrived at by actual design.
Therefore, several emperical formulae
are used, even though they give less accurate results.
The Hazen and
William formula and the charts based on the same may be used without
any risk of inaccuracy in view of the fact that the pipes normally to be
used for water supply are of smaller sizes.. Nomogram of Hazen and
William’s equation has been provided in Appendix C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Principles
-
Some of the details of plumbing which are consi-

Though the
details of construction may vary, the basic sanitary and safety principles
are the same, and they merit serious study.
Furthermore,
in the event
of any unforeseen situation not covered by specific provisions in this code,
the principles enumerated may serve as useful guides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Wholesome water supply provided for drinking and culinary purposes
shall not be liable to contamination from any less satisfactory water. There
shall, therefore,
be no cross-connection
whatsoever
between a pipe or

or water which has been used for any purpose..
The provision
f
of re ux or non-return valves or closed and sealed stop valves shall not
be construed as a permissible substitute for complete absence of cross-
connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 The,design of the pipe work shall be such that there is no possibility~
of backflow towards the source of supply from any cistern or appliance
whether by siphonage or otherwise.
Reflux or non-return valves shall not’
be relied upon to prevent such backflow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 Where a supply of wholesome water is required as an alternative or
stand-by to a supply of less satisfactory water or is required to be mixed
with the latter, it shall.be delivered only into a cistern, and by a pipe of
fitting  discharging into the air gap at a height above the top edge of the
cistern  equal  to twice its nominal bore, and in no case less than I50 mm.
It is necessary to maintain a definite air gap in all appliances or taps used

The  following general principles shall apply in the layout
and planning of the pipe work,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>al.1 Any  pipe going underground
should have adequate cover.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2 Every communication
sible position,
a stop cock o F

It should be fixed with a cover or guard box so as to be accessible
to the Authority.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.3 Where the service pipe is of diameter less than  50 mm,  the stop
valves shall be of the screw-down type and shall have loose washer plates
to ac:t as non-return
valves ( SM IS  :  781-1977* ).
Other stop valves in
the service line may be of the gate type ( see IS  :  778.198Ot ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.4 In flats and tenements supplied by a common service pipe, a stop
tap &all be fixed to control the branch to each separately
occupied part.
In

bran
e buildings a sufficient number of stop valves shall be fixed on
pipes, and to control
so as to minimize interruption
o P
roups of ball valves and draw off taps,

All such stop
valves shall be fixed in accessible ‘positions and properly protected from
being tampered with; they may be of the gate type to minimize loss of head
b,’ friction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.13 Water for drinking or for culinary purposes shall not, as far as
possible, pass through any cistern, and, therefore,
direct taps supplying
water for these purposes shall be on branch pipes connected directly to the
service pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.8 Pumps shall not be allowed on the service pipe as they cause a
drop of pressure on the suction side thereby affecting the supply to the
adjoining
properties.
In cases where pumping
is required
a pro

protected storage tank of adequate capacity shall be provided to fee
the
pump.
8.1.7 Service pipes thall be so designed and constructed as to avoid air-
locks, so that
all piping and fittings above ground
can
be  completely
emptied of wafer to facilitate repairs.
There shall be draining taps or
draw-off taps ( not underground

Service pipes shall be designed so as to reduce the production and
tr:lnsmission of noise as much as possible.
Appliances which create noise
shall be installed as far distant as possible from the living rooms of the
house and shall be housed in sound-proof cabins.
The planning
of the
building
shall allow for such arrangements.
High velocity of  water
in
piping and fittings shall be avoided.
Piping shall be confined as far as
possible, to rooms where appliances are fixed; it shall have easy bends, and
where
quietness is particularly
desired, holder bats or clamps shall be
insulated from the piping by suitable pads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.9 The rising pipe to the storage cistern, if any, or any feed cistern
shall be taken as directly as possible to the cistern and shall be fixed away
from windows or ventilators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

that it is not unduly exposed to
accidental
damage, and shall be fixed in such positions as to facilitate
cleaning and avoid accumulations of dirt.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.11
All pipe work shall be planned so that the piping is accessible for
inspection, replacement
and repair.
To avoid its being unsightly, it is
usually possible to arrange it in or adjacent to cupboards, recesses, etc,
provided there  is sufficient  space to work on the piping with the usual
tools.
Piping shall not be buried in walls or solid Jloors.
Where unavoidable
piping may be buried for short distances provided that adequate protection
is given against damage and that no joints are buried.
If piping is laid
in ducts or chases, there shall be enough space to facilitate repairs and shall
be so constructed as to prevent the entry of vermin.
To facilitate removal
of pipe casing, floor boards covering piping shall be fixed with screws or
bolts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.12
When it is necessary for a pipe to pass through a wall or floor,
a sleeve shall be fixed therein for reception of the pipe and to allow
freedom for kxpansion and  contraction
and other movement.
Piping laid
in timber floors shall, where possible, be parallel with the joists.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2  Prohibited
Connections
-
A service pipe shall not be connected
into any distribution
pipe; such connection may permit the backflow of
water from a cistern into the  SeXViCe
pipe, in certain circumstances,
with
consequent danger of contamination
and depletion of storage capacity.
It
might also result in pipes and fittings being subjected to a pressure  higher
than that for which they are designed, and in flooding from  overflowing
cisterns.

-
The bottoms of the trench excavations
shall be carefully prepared so that the barrels .of the pipes, when laid, are
well bedded for their whole length on a firm surface and are true to line
and gradient.
The width of the excavation shall be sufficient to allow the
pipes to be properly laid and jointed, joints holes being made where
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1  In the refilling of the trenches, the pipes shall be surrounded with
fine selected material, well rammed so as to resist subsequent movement

pipes to be bedded on alayer of fine selected material, or ( especially where
there is a steep gradient ) on a layer of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Preparing
Pipes for Laying Underground
-
The pipes shall be
carefully cleared of all foreign matter before being laid.
They shall be
thoroughly brushed out internally with a well-fitting hard brush, and after
laying the open end shall be temporarily
plugged to prevent ingress of
water,
soil, etc, precaution
shall be taken to prevent floatation of the
plugged pipes, should the trench become flooded.

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1 Cast &on Piper -
The  spigot and socket joints of cast -iron pipes
are usually caulked with lead.
The’common
form of joint is made by first
caulking in sp/un yam, then fillin
molten lead, taking care that no b
the space left in the joint by running in
oss enters the joint, and then thoroughly
caulking the lead.
The spun yarn shah be clean and sterile and the lead
shall conform to IS  :  782-19788.
The lead need not extend into the joint
further than the back of the groove formed in the socket.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.1  The spun yarn is used to centre the spigot in the socket, to
prevent the flow of molten lead into the bore of the
amount of lead required to complete the joint an

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.5 Provision of Stop Valves -
Storage  tanks shall be provided with a
stop valve or stop tap at every outlet other ‘than overflow pipes, so that
there shall be no necessity to empty the vessel to enable repairs to be
carried out to the downtake pipes, fittings, etc.
Such valves or taps shall
preferably be full-way gate valves so as not to impose any undue obstruc-
tion of the flow of the water.
A  stop valves shall be provided on the.inlet
connection also to facilitate stopping of %ow temporarily in the event of
itiproper functioning of ball valve or for cleaning of. storage tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.6 ,Position
of Storage of  Tanks
-
Every storage tank used or %xed
in connection with the water supplied by the Authority shall be easily
accessible and placed in such position as to admit of thorough inspection
and cleaning, and if placed within the house or building, it shall have a
clear space of not less than 60 cm between the top of the cistern and
ceiling, rafter or roof.
If the capacity of tank is bigger than 500 litres, a
greater clear space shall be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.6.1 In cases where overhead storage tanks are supported on roof slab
of the building, careful inspection and calculation shall be carried out to
ascertain whether the structure of the building is of sufficient strength to
take the increased load.
The tanks shall be preferably supported on
beareis so as to distribute the load.
The tieight of the tank; and its
contents of water shall be calculated and taken into account in the design
of bearers and supports.
Where bearers are used as supports, the height
shall not be less than 200 mm clear space.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.7 Grouping of  Storage  Tanks -
If  the storage required is more than
5 QOO 1, it is advantageous to arrange it in a series OS tanks or in compart-
ments so inter-connected
that each, can be isolated for cleaning and
inspection,without interfering with the supply of water.
This can conve-
niently be done by the use of a header pipe to which each tank/compart-
ment is connected and from which the distributing pipes branch off, each
branch into and out of the header pipe being provided with a stop valve.
Each- tank/compartment shall have its own float-operated valve and over-
%ow pipe, and a draining valve to facilitate cleaning out.
It is often
convenient,
even in smsill installations, to provide two tanks coupled
together in this way.
In large storage tanks, the outlet shall be at the end
opposite the inlet, to avoid stagnation of the water. In high rise buildings,
storage tanks may be placed in different tiers to ensure more equitable
pressure distribution of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.8 Proivision of Outlets - The  outlet pipe shall be %xed 50 to 75 inm
above the bottom of the tank and provided preferably with copper gauge
miners.
The wash-out or draining pipe shall be made flush at the bottom
of the tank at its lowest point.
The  %OOF  of the tank shall be erected so
as to give a slight fall to the wash-out pipe for cleaning purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Where this is not possible the manhole cover shall be raised 30 cm
above the highest
flood level of the locality or ground level
whichever is higher.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The design of the tank shall be such as to provide for the draining
of the tank when necessary and water shall not be allowed to
collect round about the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The tank shall be perfectly watertight,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The inner surface of the tank shall be rendered
smooth as far as
possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) The top of the tank shall’be so levelled as to prevent accumulation
of water thereon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>,f) The .tank. shall’have a complete cement concrete cover leaving a
manhole opening provided with a properly fitting mosquito-proof
hinged cast iron cover fitted with a leakproof cast iron frame.
Where tank is of a large size, adequate number of manholes shall
be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) No gap shall be allowed to remain round the suction pipe and
arrangement
shall be provided for proper discharge, of spill water
from the electric pump by connecting the pump cabin to the  water
drain, or by providing a small hole which will enable the water

overflow pipes or vent shafts, if provided, shall have a
wiregauge cover of 1.5 mm mesh properly screwed tightly to the
opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.10 Jointing of Pipes to Storage Tanks -
For jointing steel pipe to
a storage tank, the end of the pipe shall be threaded,
passed through a
hole in the tank and secured by backnuts both inside and outside.
The
pipe end shall be flush with the face of the inside backnut to obvrate corro-
sion of the pipe threads.
For joining copper pipe to steel or copper tank
a connector of non-ferrous metal shall be used having a shoulder to bear
on the outside of the tank and secured by a backnut inside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.11 Storage Capacities -
The quantity of water to be stored shall be
calculated taking into account the following factors:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Hours of supply at ‘sufficiently high pressure to fill up the over-
head storage tanks;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Frequency
of replenishment
of overhead

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Consequences of exhausting storage particularly
in case of public
buildings like hospitals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>If the water supply is intermittent
and the hours of supply are
irregular, it is desirable to have a minimum storage of half-a-day’s
supply
for overhead tanks.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.11.1  The particulars
of water
supply requirements
of residential
buildings and of buildings other than residences are given under 3.1 and 3.2
of IS  :  1172-1983*.
It
has been
stipulated
that, where there
is full-
flushing system a minimum of 200 litres per head per day shall be assured
out of which about 45 litres per head per day may be taken as flushing
requirements
and the remaining 155 litres for other domestic purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.11.2
When a single supply is provided it is not necessary for health
reasons
to have separate
storage
for flushing and sanitary
purposes.
In such cases when only one storage tank has been provided, tapping of
water may be done at two different levels so that a part of the water will
be exclusively available for flushing purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.12  Pamping of Water<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.12.1  In case of multi-storey buildings where the height of the fitting
or storage tank is such as will not permit of their being fed with the avail-
able pressures in the water main, pumping is necessary.
The house service
pumps are usually of the centrifugal
type driven by electric motors, where
electric power is available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.12.2
In cases where pumping is necessary,
storage tank shall be
provided either at the ground level or partially buried underground,
in
which case it shall conform
to the requirements
given under 11.9 for
underground storage tanks.
The storage tank should have a minimum
capacity of 50 percent of the overhead storage tank.
The advantage of
the storage tank is that it can be fed continuously during low pressure
hours and, therefore,
the pump can be worked at any time of the day and
the overhead storage ‘may be replenished
continuously.
The pump also
works at a steady head and there is no chance of overloading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.  WATER PITMNGS AND APPLIANCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.1 Bath, Lavatory and Mixing Taps -
Bath, lavatory and mixing

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 781-1977*.
Combination taps, mixing valves ( see IS  :  t701-196Oj )
or blenders, for mixing hot and cold water and discharging the mixture
through a single outlet shall be fed with both hot water and cold water
under pressure only from cisternsat
the same level or from the same
cistern; the  cold water should not be s&lied  directly  from  a seroice pipe as other-
&e, there is danger of scalding  if the pressure in the service pipe unexpee
tedly fails.
To ensure satisfactory results from such fittings, it is also
desirable that the feed pipe does not also feed other fittings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12;2 Position
Where Self-closing
Taps are Permissible
- Self-closing
taps and other special fittings of makes approved by the Authority may be
permitted to be used on direct pipes and distributing pipes from tanks.

-
All water closets and urinals
shall be supplied with water from proper flushing cistern or from other
equally efficient and suitable waste preventing apparatus. Flushing cisterns
having 10 litres discharge capacity
and discharging at an average rate
of 5 l/s are considered suitable for wash-down water closets and squatting
pans IS  :  2556 ( Part 2 )-19818 and IS  :  2556 ( Part 3 )-198111.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>13. CLEANING
AND DISINFECTION
OF THE SUPPLY SYSTEM<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.4  All water mains, communication pipes, service and distribution pipes
used for water for domestic purposes should be thoroughly and efficiently
disinfected before being taken into use and also after every major repair
The method of disinfection shall be subject to the approval of the Autho-
rity.
They shall also be periodically cleaned at intervals,depending
upon
the quality of water and the treatment it receives before use.
It is,
however, desirable that the communication
pipes and the storage cisterns
are thoroughly. cleaned at least once every year in order to remove any
suspended impurities that may have settled in the pipes or the tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.2 Disinfection
of Storage Tanks and Downtake Distribution
Pipes -  Storage tanks and downtake distribution pipes shall be disinfected
as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The storage tanks and pipes shall first be filled with water and
thoroughly  flushed  out.
The storage tanks shall then be filled with Water
again and disinfecting chemical containing chlorine added gradually while
the tanks are being filled, to ensure thorough mixing.
SUacient chemical
shall be used to give the water a dose of 50 parts of chlorine to- one million
parts of water.
If ordinary
bleachin
tion will be 150 g of powder
to 1000 $
powder
is used, the propor-
of  water.
The powder shall
be mixed with water to a creamy consistency before being added to the
water in the storage tank.
If a pro rietary brand of chemical is used, the
proportions shall be as specified by t R e makers.
When the storage tank is
full, the supply shall be  stopped and all the taps on the distributing pipes
opened  successively, working progressively away from the storage tank.
Each tap shall be closed when the vater discharge.  begins to smell of
chlorine.
The  storage tank shall then be  topped  up with water from the
supply pipe and .witb more disinf’ixting chemical in the recommended
.

<<HEADING level=3>>14.  INSPECTION ANO TESTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1 Testing of Mains Before Conmmdng
Work -  AU pipes, flttings
and appliances shall be inspected, before delivery
at the site to see whether
they bear, where appropriate,
the certification
mark of the Indian
Stan-
dards Institution
or the mark of the testing station
of the Authority.
All
pipes and fittings
shall be inspected
and tested by the manufacturers
at
their factory and shall comply with the requirements
of this Code.
They
shall be tested hydraulically
under a pressure equal to twice the maximum
permissible
working
pressure or under such ,greater pressure as may be
specified.
The pipes and fittings shall be inspected
on site before laying
and shall be sounded
to disclose
cracks.
Any
defective
item
shall
be
clearly marked as rejected and forthwith removed
from the site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2  Testing of Mains After Laying --  After laying
and jointing,
the
main shall be slowly and carefully
charged
with water, so that all air is
expelled
from
the main
by providing
a 25-mm
inlet with a stopcock
allowed to stand full of water for a few days if time permits, and then tested
under- pressure.
The test pressure shall be O-5 N/mm* or the maximum
working pressure plus 50 percent, whichever
is the greater.
The pressure
shall be applied
by means
of a manually
operated
test pump, or in the
case
of long mains or mains of large diameter,
by a power-driven
test
pump, provided
that ,the pump is not left unattended.
In either case due
precaution
shall be taken to ensure that the required
test pressure is not
exceeded.
Pressure gauges
shall
be accurate
and shall preferably
have
been recalibrated
before the test.
The test pump having
been stopped,
the test pressure shall maintain
itself without measureable
loss for at least
half an hour.
The mains, shall be tested in sections as the work of laying
proceeds;
it is an advantage
to have the joints
exposed
for inspection
during the testing.
The open end of the main may be temporarily
closed
for testing under moderate pressure by fitting a watertight
expanding
plug
of which several types are available.
The end of the main
and the plug
shall be secured by struts or otherwise,
to resist the end thrust of the water
pressure in the mains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2.1 If the section of the main tested terminates
with a sluice valve,
the wedge of the valve shall not be used to retain the water.
Instead
the
valve shall be temporarily
fitted with a blank flange,
or iq the case  of. a
socketed valve, with a plug, and the wedge
placed
in the open position
while testing.
End support shall be given as m 14.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The service shah
then be inspected under working conditions of pressure and flow.
When
all draw-off taps are closed, the service pipe shall be absolutely watertight.
All piping, fittings and appliances shall be checked over for satisfactory
support, and protection from damage,
corrosion and frost.
Because of
the possibility of damage in transit, cisterns shall be re-tested for water
tightness on arrival on the site, before fixing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.  MAINTENANCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1  Storage tanks shall be regularly inspected and shall be cleaned out if
necessary.
Tanks showing signs of corrosion shall be emptied, thoroughly
wire-brushed to remove loose material
( but not scrapped ), cleaned-and
coated with anti-corrosive paint of inert composition not liable to impart
taste or odour or otherwise contaminate
the water.
Before cleaning the
cistern, the outlet shah be plugged to prevent debris entering the pipe.
The tank shall be examined
for corrosion
and water tightness
after
cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.2 Record drawings showing pipe layout and valve positions shall be kept
up to date and inspection undertaken
to ensure that any maintenance
work has not introduced
cross-connections
or
any
other undesirable
feature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.3 Any temporary attachment fixed to a tap or outlet shall never be left
in such a position that back-siphonage
of polluted water into the’ supply
system may occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.4  All valves shall be periodically operated to maintain
free movement
of the working parts.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.5 All taps and ball valves shall be inspected for water tightness; glands
shall be made PO&~: washers shall be reolaced and machanism
