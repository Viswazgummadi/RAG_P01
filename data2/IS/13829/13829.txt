<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards after
the draft finalized by
the Pesticides Residue Analysis Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Food and Agriculture
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Both,
atrazine ( 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-5-triazine
) and simazine
( 2-chloro-4,
6-bis-ethylamino-s-triazine
) are used as herbicides
in
agriculture
for the
control
of weeds.
Assessment of their residues
in food
commodities
is therefore
an important
step in safeguarding
human health and establishment
of regulatory
policy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard will enable
the health
authorities
and others engaged
in the field to follow uniform
test procedures
for the estimation of residues of atrazine and simazine in various commodities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard, due consideration
has been given to the maximum
limits of
atrazine
and simazine residues laid under the provisions of  Prevention of Food
Adulteration
Act,
1954  and the Rules framed
thereunder.
The test method
is restricted
to the prescribed
level of
residues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this standard, if the final value,
observed or calculated,
is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance
w$h IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules.
for rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
