FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution on 14 March 1983, after the draft finalized by the
Joint
Sectional
Committee
for
Concrete
Reinforcement
had
been
approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard was first published in 1970 to cover the requirements
of strands used in prestressed concrete
work.
The present revision has
been taken up with a view to incorporating modifications found necessary
as a result of use of this standard both by manufacturers
and users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The significant
modifications
incorporated
in this revision
are in
respect of provisions relating to physical requirements
of nominal
mass
of strand and proof load and the sample size for tensile test.
Further,
SI units have been adopted
in the revision
and references to related
Indian Standards appearing in the standard have been updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard,
due weightage
has been given
to international
co-ordination
among the
standards
and
practices
prevailing in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices
in the field in this  country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular requirement
of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

properties and characteristics
as prescribed
in this specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2 The element wire to be used for strand shall be cold-drawn

method
may be used by agree-

and
the perchaser.
In this test, an ini-
tial load equivalent
to 10 percent
of required
minimum
breaking
strength
as prescribed
in Table
3 shall be applied
to the test piece and a sensitive
extensometer
then attached.
The
dial of the latter shall
be
adjusted
to
read O+Ol mm/mm

to represent
the extension

the initial load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The load shall be increased
until
the extensometer
shows
an exten-

conforms
to that specified
in 6.4.
During

Should any sample fail any of the tests, by agreement ._
between manufacturer and purchaser, two additional test samples from
the same end of the same coil shall be taken and subjected to the test or
tests in which the original sample failed.
Should both additional
test
samples pass the test or tests, the coil from which they were taken shall
be deemed to comply with the requirements of this standard.
Should
either of them fail, the coil shall be deemed not to comply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
