<<PARAGRAPH>>When
the
added
chemical
may
evaporate
at
tem-
peratures
used when
mixing
or during the test,
it may
be necessa~
to analyse the soil at the end of the test
to confirm
that the soil contains
the required
amount
of the test chemical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dissolve
the chemical
in water
and mix directly
with
the soil. Ensure that the volume
of water
added does
not exceed
the
water
holding
capacity
and that
the
same quantity
of water
is used for each batch of soil
and for each concentration
of chemical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Fill a tube of known
volume,
with
the base closed
by
a sheet
of filter

the soil and cap the tube.
Submerge
the tube
in a water
bath at room
tempera-
ture (with the water
level beneath
the top of the tube)
for 2 h. Then lower
the tube below
the water
level for
a further
1 h. Place the
tube
in a tray
of wet,
finely
ground,
quartz
sand
to
drain
for
2 h.
Weigh
the
sample
and d~
to constant
mass at 105 ‘C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dissolve
the chemical
in water
and mix with
dry sand.
A rotating
drum
is useful for this. Mix the treated
sand
with
soil. If large quantities
of water,
i.e. those
likely
to exceed
the
required
water
holding
capacity
of the
soil are required,
the sand can be dried in the rotating
drum,
with
a current
of air, before
mixing
with
the
soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

capacity
is calculated

Dry the sand in a stream
of air while
continuing
to mix (e.g. while
rotating

Mix
the
treated
sand

Ensure
that
the
same
quantity
of solvent

<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1
Principle<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality
of an unknown
soil is estimated
by deter-
mining
the emergence
and early growth
response
of
a variety
of terrestrial
plant
species
in a soil of un-
known
quality
and two
control
soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If appropriate,
further
sets of four pots with
mixtures
of the
unknown
soil and sieved
control
soil
may
be
filled
to
prepare
diluted
samples
containing
various
concentrations
of
substances
in the
soil
with
con-
tamination
of an unknown
type.
Mixtures
of contam-
inated soil and control
soil may be prepared
to provide<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Statistically
significant
differences
in emergence

This
may

when
lack
of
emergence
and growth
is likely
to occur
on the

known
soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The soil under
test
and the

soil of the

textural
class but of a quality that is known
to be good
should
be prepared
and stored
under
the same

ditions
as the
second
control
soil used as a standard<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(recommendations
for a suitable
standard
are given in
6.3). Precise
matching
of soil properties
is not critical
to the
test:
most
plants
are sufficiently
robust
to be
relatively
unaffected
by
small
differences
in
soil
properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.4
Expression of the results<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any reduction
of emergence
or growth
of plants in the
test
soil should
be expressed
as a percentage
of the
data obtained
from
the
plants
grown
on the

soil,
of which
the
