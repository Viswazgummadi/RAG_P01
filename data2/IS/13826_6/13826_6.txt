<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard ( Part 6 ) was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the drafe
finalized by the Water-Proofing
and Damp-Proofing
Sectional
Committee
had ~been approved -by,
the Civil Engineering
Division Council,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tar pitcuhu%d
cover
bitumen
felts of
hessian
based
and glass fibre
base
respectively.
The above standards
require,
amongst other requirements,
detailed testing
of
each
of these products.
Various
methods
of test relating
to each product
for determination
of
physical
properties
have been included
in
the separate
standards.
All types of felts have to
satisfy
some common
essential
physical
requirements
for which methods of test are same.
A
series
of standards
covering
methods
of
test have,
therefore,
been formulated
to cover the
determination
of various
physical
requirements
of bitumen
felt.
This standard
covers
water
absorption
test.
Other parts of the standard are as follows  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1 Breaking strength test
Part 2 Pliability test
IL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 3 Storage sticking test
Part 4 Pressure head test
Part 5 Heat resistance test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-Part 7 Determination

<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the technical
committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard is
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised)‘.
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the:
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
