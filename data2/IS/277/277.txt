<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Fifth Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft
finalized by the
Wrought
Steel Products
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Metallurgical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1951 and subsequently
revised in 1962, 1969, 1977 and 1985.
In this revision steel sheets of lower thickness
from
0.18 mm onwards
and higher width of 1200
mm have been
included.
In the case of corrugated
sheets, steel sheets with 13 corrugation
have
been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Galvanized
steel sheets covered
by this standard are
intended to be used for general
purposes,
such as panelling and roofing.
Steel sheets conforming
to this standard
are not intended
to be
used for other special applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
convenience
in ordering
galvanized steel sheet,
the plain sheets
should be ordered on the
basis of their length,
width and thicknesses.
Sheets in coil form should be ordered
on the basis
of their
internal
diameter,
width,
thickness
and mass.
Whereas the corrugated
sheets may be
ordered
on the basis of their length, thickness
and depth and number of corrugations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is
complied with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis, shall be
rounded
of? in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding,
off  numerical
values ( revised )‘.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value
should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
