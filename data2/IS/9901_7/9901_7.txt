FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Part
VII ) was adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 3 December
1981, after the draft finalized
by the
Acoustics

had been approved
by the Electronics
and
Telecommunication
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
This
standard
which
covers
field
measurements
of impact
sound
insulation
of floors, is one of the series of Indian
Standards
on measure-
ment
of sound

in buildings
and of building
elements.

is:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) To
give
a procedure
to measure
the impact

between
two rooms in buildings,
thus making
it possible to check
whether
the desired
acoustical
conditions
have
been
obtained;

<<PAGE_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9901 ( Part VII ) - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) To give a field procedure
to determine
whether
building
elements
have met specifications
and to check whether
faults have occurred
during
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 While
preparing
this
standard,
assistance
has
been
derived
from
ISO/DIS
14O/VII ‘Measurement
of sound insulation
in buildings
and of
building
elements:
Part
VII
Field
measurements
of
impact

of
floors’,
issued
by
the
International
Organization
for
Standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In
reporting
the
result
of
a test
made
in
accordance
with
this
standard,
if the final value observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it
shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
( Part
VII
) specifies
field
method
for measuring
the
impact
sound insulation
properties
of floors between
two rooms
by using
a standard
tapping
machine
and for determining
the protection
afforded
by floors to the occupants
of the building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose
of this
standard,
the
terms
and definitions
given
in IS  :  1885 ( Part III/Set
8 )-1974t
and IS : 9901
(Part VI )-1961:
shall
apply in addition
to the following
terms.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Standardized
Impact
Sound
Pressure
Level-The
impact
sound pressure
level  L1,  reduced
by a correction
term
which
is given
in
decibels,
being ten times the common
logarithm
of the ratio between
the
measured
reverberation
time I of the receiving
room
and the reference
reverberation
time To.
This quantity
is denoted
by  Lln T:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>LlnT =  Li - 10 ~%&I  2dB
*
0<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For dwellings
To is given-by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l- o = 0-5s<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1  -The
standardizing of the impact sound pressure level to a reverber-
ation time of 0.5s takes into account
that in dwellings the reverberation
time has
been found to be (nearly
independent
of the volume
and of frequency ) equal
to 0.5s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

values (  revised).

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 2-The
standardizing
of
the

level
to
the
reverberation
time of T0 = 0.5s is equivalent
to standardizing
the impact

<<HEADING level=3>>where<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A,, =  absorption area, in square metres; and<<HEADING_END>>

Arrangement
-
For the test arrangement
to be used in the
field, it is not possible
to standardize
the area of the test specimen
and the
volume
and shape of the rooms.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The normalized
impact
sound pressure
level is used when
the impact

filters.
The
discrimination
characteristics
of the
filters should be in accordance
with IS  :  6964-1973*.
Third-octave

the series beginning
with
centre
frequency
125 Hz and ending
at 2 000 Hz should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 1 -Use
of lower frequency
is dependent
on the distribution
of natural
frequency.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTIC 2 -The
minimum reverberation
times for the empty room
are adjusted
to a volume of 180 me.
For other volumes, these times should be multiplied by the<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>factor (V/180) * ( V being the volume of the room expressed in cubic metres  )  except<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>at high frequencies,

condition,
this can be determined
in accordance
with the method
shown in IS  :  9901 (Part
II)-1981:.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 It is recommended
that
different
organizations
in the same
country
periodically
perform
comparison
measurements
on the same test specimen
to check the repeatability
and the reproducibility
of their test procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
