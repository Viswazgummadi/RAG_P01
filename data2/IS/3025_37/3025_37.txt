Prescribes
three
methods
for
determination
of
arsenic.
In
the
atomic
absorption
spectrometric
method,
arsenic is converted
int6 its hydride and the atomized to gas phase atoms. Th’
silver diethyl
dithiocarbamate
method .is applicable
when
interferences
are absent.
Mercuric
bromid
stain method requires care and experience.
The choice depends upon the accuracy required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  The silver diethyl
dithiocarbamate
,method shall be the refree method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  Atomic
Absorption
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>!.l  Scope
and
Application
-Arsenic
is converted
into its volatile
hydride
by sodium
borohydrid
‘eagent
in acid solution.
The hydride
is purged continuously
by argon or nitrogen
into an appropriat
atomizer
of an atomic
absorption
spectrometer
and converted
to gas phase atoms.
The sodiur
aorohydride
reducing
agent,
by rapid generation
of elemental hydrides
in an appropriate
reaction ccl
ninimizes
dilution
of hydrides
by the carrier gas and provides rapid, sensitive
determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>!.2  Interferences
-fnterferences
are minimized
because
arsenic
hydride
is removed
from solution
:ontaining
most potential
interfering
substances.
Slight response variations
occur when acid matrlce

the samples and standard
in the same manner

Before using the hydride generation/analysis,
system, optimize operating
parameters.
Aspirate
aqueous

Preparation
of
samples
and standards
for
total
arsenic
-
Add 50 ml sample or standard to
2oo  ml beaker.
Add 1 ml of 2’50 N sulphuric acid and 5 ml of 5 percent potassium persulphate.
Boil
gently on a preheated hot plate for about 30 minutes or until the final volume is reduced to 10 ml.
Do
not let sample go to dryness.
After manual digestion, dilute to  50  ml.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.5  Determination
-
To 50 ml digested standard or sample in a  200  ml beaker, add 5 ml concentra-
ted hydrochloric acid and mix.
Add 5 ml of sodium iodide pre-reductant solution, mix and wait at least
30 minutes.
Attach one beaker at a time to the rubber stopper containing the gas dispersion tube for
the purging of gas, sodium borohydride reagent inlet and the outlet to the atomizer. Turn on strip chart
recorder and wait until the base line is established by the purging gas and all is expelled from reaction
cell.
Add 0’5 ml of sodium borohydride
reagent. After the instrument absorbance has reached e
maximum and returned to the base line, remove beaker, rinse dispersion tube with water and proceed to
next sample or standard.
Periodically compare arsenic ( Ill ) and arsenic ( V ) curves for response
consistency.
Check for presence of chemical interferences that supress instrument response for arsenic
by treating
a digested
sample with 10 pg/l arsenic (III ) or arsenic ( V ) as appropriate,
Average
recoveries should be not less than 90 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6  Calculation
-
Construct a standard curve by plotting peak heights of standards  versus
concentration
of standards.
Measure peak heights of samples and read concentrations from the curve. If sample was
diluted before digestion, apply an appropriate factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. Silver
Diethyl
Dithiocarbamate
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Scope  and Application
-
Inorganic arsenic is reduced to amine by zinc in acid solution in an arsine
generator.
The arsine is then passed through scrubber containing glass wool impregnated with lead
acetate solution and into an absorber tube containing silver diethyl dithiocarbamate dissolved in pyridine
or chloroform.
In the absorber, arsine reacts ‘with silver salt forming a soluble red complex suitable
for spectrophotometric measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  interference
-
Certain metals like chromium, cobalt, copper, mercury nickel, potassium and silver
interfere in the generation of arsine.
The concentration of these metals normally present in water and
wastewaters do not interfere significantly.
Antimony salt interferes with colour developments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Stain
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Scope
and Application
-
After
sample concentration,
arsenic is liberated as arsine by  zinc in acid
solution  in ,arsine generator.
The generated
arsine is passed through
a column
containing
a roll of
cotton
moistened
with lead acetate solution.
The generated arsine produces
a yellow-brown
stain on

The length of the stain is roughly proportional
to
the amount
of arsine present.

<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Arsenic may occur in water as a result of mineral dissolution, industrial discharges or application
of insecticides.
Severe poisoning
can arise from ingestion of as little as 100 mg of arsenic.
The
arsenic concentration
on most potable waters seldom exceeds 0’01 mg/l.
