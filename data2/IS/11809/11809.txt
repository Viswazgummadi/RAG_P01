<<PARAGRAPH>>Irrigation Canals and Canal Linings Sectional Committee, RVD 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after the draft finalized by
the Irrigation Canals and Canal Linings Sectional Committee had been approved by the River
Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lining of canals is considered an important feature of irrigation projects as it not only minimizes
the loss of water due to seepage but also results in achieving considerable economy in the use of
cultivable land which would otherwise be prone to water logging due to rise of the water table.
Further the water, thus saved, may be usefully utilized for the extension and improvement of
irrigation facilities. Lining of water courses in areas irrigated by tube-wells assumes special
significance as the pumped water supplied is relatively more costly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lining of canals permits the adoption of high velocities resulting in proportionate savings in the
cross-sectional areas of the channel and land width required, with corresponding saving in the cost
of excavation and masonry works, which may in certain cases completely offset the extra cost of
lining. Lining also ensures stability of the channel sections thereby reducing the maintenance cost.
The benefits that accrue from lining of canals generally justify the initial capital cost and due to
this there is now a better appreciation of the need for lining of canals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Judicious selection of serviceable and economical lining at the first instance and subsequent
proper execution of the work while laying the lining, results in achieving considerable overall
economy in the project. Selection of the type of lining for the canal, should be done in accordance
with IS 10430 : 1982 ‘Criteria for design of lined canals and guidelines for selection of type of
lining’. Having once decided to adopt stone masonry lining in any particular canal, this standard
would give necessary guidance in laying of stone masonry lining. Stone masonry lining has its own
advantages particularly where suitable stones are available in the vicinity of canals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1982. This revision has been prepared so as to keep the
provisions abreast of the latest practices. As stone slab lining is similar to lining by precast cement
slabs, while revising this standard, the requirements for the former have been deleted and are now
covered in IS 3873 : 1993 ‘Laying cement concrete/stone slab lining on canals—Code of practice’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (September 2000). Side bar indicates modification
of the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>subgrade for laying of the stone masonry layer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  If the water table is high it should be
lowered to at least 300 mm below the subgrade.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers stone masonry lining
for canals.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5  The subgrade should be divided into
compartments by stone masonry or concrete
ribs of size not less than 300 mm × 150 mm.
The compartments should have dimensions of
not more than 15 m along the centre line of the
canal. The spacing of ribs across the centre line
should be selected in such a manner so as to
divide the canal bed and slope symmetrically
about the centre line, so that ribs are provided
at the junction of the slope and bed and at the
upper extremity of the slope. If stone masonry
ribs are used, the stone should meet the
requirements given in  4.1 . If concrete ribs are
adopted, the concrete in ribs shall be of the
same strength as that of the lining concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7  Single stone profiles of lining, parallel to
centre line of the canal, should be prepared at
suitable intervals. Mortar should be uniformly
spread over the subgrade and the stone should
be properly laid in position quickly. It should be
ensured that the vertical joints are completely
filled with mortar. The stone should be laid on
the bed with their length at right angles to the
centre line of the canal, while on the side slopes
they should be laid parallel to the centre line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 PREPARATION OF SUBGRADE<<HEADING_END>>

done in accordance with IS 3873 : 1993.<<HEADING_END>>

stones
should be
of

mentioned in Table 1 and should have specific
gravity not less than 2.5 when tested according
to IS 1122 : 1974 and soundness not less than
10% loss of weight after 5 cycles when tested
according to IS 1126 : 1974.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.8  Stones should be firmly embedded in
mortar. Hollows, if any, should be rectified by
relaying the defective portions with fresh
mortar.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  The stone should be laid on lime mortar
(1 : 2) or cement mortar 1 : 3 over a bed of
minimum 12 mm thick lime/cement mortar.
The joints shall be pointed with similar mortar.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.9  On completion of laying and from the next
day, the lining should be kept wet by sprinkling
water over it, to keep the mortar well wetted.
On the next day, the surface should be kept wet
and joints of the stone masonry should be
carefully examined. Hollow joints should be
raked to a depth of 12 mm, loose mortar
removed from sides and top of stone and the
joints properly refilled. Any loose stone should
be removed and relaid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3  The lining should be started after at least
35 m length of canal sub-grade is properly
dressed to receive lining. The subgrade should
be uniformly soaked with water, without
making it slushy, to ensure that water
penetrates to a depth of about 300 mm in sandy
soil and about 150 mm in other soils. Wetting of
subgrade should continue in advance of laying
of stone slabs so that the soil does not absorb
moisture from the mortar placed on the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.10  The completed lining should be checked
for level with wooden templates and spirit
levels.<<HEADING_END>>
