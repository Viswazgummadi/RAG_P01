TESTING OF CONCRETE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 20 December 1979, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Indian Standards
Institution
has already published a series of
standards on methods of testing cement and concrete.
It has been recog-
nized that reproducible and repeatable test results c&n be obtained only with
standard testing equipment capable of giving the desired level of accuracy.
The Sectional Committee has, therefore, decided to bring out a series  ofspeci-
fications
covering  the  requirements
of  equipments
used
for testing cement
and concrete, to encourage their development and manufacture in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Accor,_ingly, this standard has been prepared to cover the requirements
of the flexura1 testing apparatus used for the determination
of modulus of
rupture
of concrete.
The value of modulus of rupture gives a relative
measure of the tknsile strength of concrete.
The method of determining the
modulus of rupture has been covered in IS  :  516-1959*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard, due weightage has been given to in-
ternational
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing in
different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field ixi
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off’ in accordance with
IS  :  2-196q_.
The number of si_gnificant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard covers the requirements
of flexural testing apparatus
used for the determination
of modulus of rupture of concrete, that is, 15 x
15 x 70 cm or 10 x 10 x 50 cm beams by third point loading method,
making use of any suitable machine for application of load ( see 4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.
REQUIREMENTS
OF THE APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The assembly used for the flexural testing apparatus shall satisfy the
following requirements:
a)
It shall have two bearing blocks and two load applying blocks
for third point loading.
b)
The load shall be equally divided between the two loading blocks.
c)
It shall ensure application of load normal to the loaded and sup-
ported surfaces of the specimen and in such a manner as to avoid
any eccentricity, restraint or torsion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 A diagram of a typical flexural testing apparatus that complies with the
requirements specified in 2.1 is given in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.
DIMENSIONS
AND SALIENT FEATURES OF THE APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Dimensions -
The principal dimensions of different component
parts
of the flexural testing apparatus shall be as detailed in Fig. 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Salient Features -
The salient features of the apparatus
shall be as
given in 3.2.1 to 3.2.4.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1 The bearing surfaces shall be of case hardened steel having a
hardness of not less than 480 VH or equivalent. The bearing blocks as well
as
I  he load
applying
blocks shall be cylindrical
rollers
of 40 mm
diameter as shown in Fig.  1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2 The load applying and supporting blocks shall be held in position
by means of spring loaded screws or other suitable arrangements which shall
not interfere with the requirements specified in 2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3 The load applying and supporting blocks shall have a length at
least 10 mm greater than the width of the beam.
The frames ‘on which the
loading as well as the bearing blocks are to be supported, shall have suit-
able provisions for mounting blocks at two different positions depending on
the size of the beam to be tested, that is, on the bottom frame at 60 cm
span for  15 x
15  cm specimens and 40 cm span for 10 x 10 cm specimens,
and on the top frame at 20 cm and 13.3 cm respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4  Loading
System
-
The load shall be applied through the two
loading blocks mounted on the top supporting
frame at a. centre to centre
distance of  20  cm or 13.3 cm and resting symmetrically on the specimen as
ahown in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. REQUIREMENTS

LOAD
APPLICATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Capacity - The capa &y of the machine used for application of load
shall be not more than 50 kN and it shall be capable of applying the load at
