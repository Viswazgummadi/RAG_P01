FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
(  First Revision
) w.as adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 2% February
1983, after the draft finalized
by the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Indian
Standards
Institution
has already
published
a number
of
standards
on
different
types
of cements
and
methods
of physical
and
chemical
tests of these
cements.
Having
recognized
that
reliable
and
reproducible
test
results
could
be obtained
only
with use of standard
types of testing
equipment
capable
of giving
desired
level of accuracy,
the
Committee
had taken up formulation
of Indian
Standards
on instruments
for testing
cement.
These standards
are expected
to promote
development
and manufacture
of standard
testing
equipment
in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard
was first published
in 1969 and
the present
revision
has
been
formulated
to incorporate
certain
modifications
found
necessary
based
on .the
experience
gained
in the manufacture
and
use
of this
equipment.
In
this
revision,
an
optional
requirement
of providing
a
suitable
counter
for recording
the number
of drops
of the table
and
a
device
for switching
off the motor
after a specified
number
of drops has
been included.
Further
since the hardness
requirements
of the material
have already
been specified,
the material
specification
for cam, cam shaft
and vertical
shaft have
been
modified
to permit
flexibility
in selection
of
the material
for manufacture.
In addition,
since
outside
caliper
has not
been considered
as,an essential
accessory
to the flow table
equipment,
the
relevant
provision
has been suitably
modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and
practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expres-
sing the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS : 2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The table top, to which the shaft with its
ititegral contact shoulder is attached, shall be mounted on a frame in such
a manner
that it can be raised and dropped vertically
through
12 mm

plane surface
free from surface defects, and shall be scribed as shawn in Fig. 1E.
The
table top shall not vary by more than 0 05 mm from a true plane surface.
The table shall have an edge thickness of 7.5 mm and shall have six integ-
ral radial stiffening ribs.
The mass of table and attached
shaft shall be
4.00 f 0.05 kg and shall be symmetrical
around the centre of the shaft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2
Cam and Vertical Shaft -
The wearing surfaces of cam tip and verti-
cal shaft shall be case hardened, where indicated in Fig. 1B and 1C.
The

the cam not less than 120” from the point of drop.
The face of the cam
shall be a smooth spiraled curve of uniformly increasing radius from 12 to
