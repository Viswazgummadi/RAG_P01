<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the Foundation
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The installation
of heavy rotary
machines,
namely.
steam turbo-generators,
turbo-compressors
and
blowers,
involves
design
of their
foundations
taking
into considerations
the
vibration
characteristics
of
the
foundarions
system.
While
many
of the
special
features
relating
to the
design
and
construction
of such machine
foundations
are guided
by the manufacturers,
slill a large
part
of the
details
shall
have
to be according
to
certain
general
principles
of design
covering
machine
foundations.
This code of practice
for design and construction
of machine
foundations
( IS 2974 )
is being published
in parts.
This part lays down the general
principles
for
frame
foundations
for
rotary
machines
of medium
to high frequencies.

<<PARAGRAPH>>In the  design and construction
of foundations
for rotary
machines,
a proper
coordinations
between
the different
branches
of engineering,
including
those
dealing
with
erection
and
commissioning
is
essential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Coordinated
efforts by the different
branches
would result in satisfactory
performance,
convenience
of operation,
economy
and a good general
appearance
of the complete
unit.
The
main
unit
with
all its auxiliaries
and adjacent
piping
must be provided
for, when making
the foundation
plans
and
al1 the details
should
be well worked out, before going ahead with the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
first published
in the year 1967 and subsequently
revised in 1975.
This
revision
has
been prepared,
based on a numbers
of comments
received
on
this
standard,
keeping
in
view
the
current
design practices
followed
in India and abroad.
The sizes and capacities
of turbo-generators
have increased
( up to 500 MW ) since the last revision
of the code.
There
have been
fundamental
changes
in the design philosophy
of turbogenerator
foundations,
for example
use of slender
columns,
long and flexible top decks, etc.
With the advent
of powerful
computers
and finite element
analysis
computer
programmes
the use of three-dimensional
space
frame
models
for static
and
dynamic
analysis
has become common
in design offices.
The code has been made
more
relevant
to design
office use.
Aspects such as preliminary
sizing
of the
foundations
and
loading
combinations
are
expected
to be useful to the less experienced
designers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For large sized foundations
with complex
structural
arrangement,
it has
been
observed
that
two-
dimensional
plane frame models are nof possible
to use.
For
such
foundations
three-dimensional
space frame model is recommended
for analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
require,ment
of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test, shall be rounded
o!t in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(  revised )‘.
The
number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that
of the
specified
value
in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In a system undergoing
vibration,
a mode of vibration
is a characteristic
pattern
assumed
by the system
in which
the motion
of every
particle
is simple
harmonic
with the same frequency.
Two or more
modes may exist concurrently
in a multi-degree
free-
dom system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This  code is primarily
meant fordesigningframed
type
foundations
for turbo-generators

However,
the provisions
of this code may be used
suitably for other machine foundations of similar types,
for example, foundations
of turbo-compressors,
boiler
feed pumps, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9 STRUCTURAL
ANALYSIS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 Modelling<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The analysis
shall be done using a simulated
mathe-
matical model of linear-elastic
properties.
For turbo-
generator foundations
of more than 100 MW capacity,
a three-dimensional
space frame model
is recom-
mended.
The modelling
should take into account the
basic characteristics
of the system, that is, mass, stiff-
ness
and
damping.
Special
attention
is required
while idealing
the points
of excitation.
The model
should
simulate
the vibration
characteristics
of the
machine
foundation
system to a sufficient
degree of
accuracy
(see Fig. 3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Free Vibration
Analysis<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Free vibration analysis shall be carried out to calculate
the natural frequenciesand
modeshapesofthe
founda-
tion. The highest natural frequency
calculated
should
be at least 10 percent higher than the operating
fre-
quencyofthe
machine. Damping may be neglected
for
the purpose of free vibration
analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.1
Frequency Criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The  following
frequency
criteria shall be checked:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For smaller foundations
(for example,
turbo-genera-
tor foundations
of less than 100 MW capacity) with
a regular framing
arrangement,
plane frame models
may
be used
in the transverse
and
longitudinal
direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fundamental
natural
frequency
shall be at
least 20perccnt
away from the machine operating
speed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>that is, fi < 0.8 fm<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1 The following
points shall be considered
while
constructing
the model for dynamic
analysis:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The foundation
shall be modelled as a three-
dimensional
space frame in which the col-
umns and beams are idealised
as 3-D beam
elements
with six degrees of freedom at each
node.
Slabs and walls,
if present,
may be
modelled
using thin shell (plate bending)
ele-
ments. The columns
shall be assumed
to be
fixed at the base, disregarding
the base mat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>fi >  1.2fin<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fn
= fundamental
natural frequency
of the
foundation,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fm = operating
speed of the machine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, it is preferable
to maintain
a frequency
separation
of 50 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nodes shall be specified to all bearing points,
beam-columnjunctions,
mid-points
and quar-
ter points ofbeams
and columns and wherever
the member cross-sections change significantly.
Generally,
the number of modes specified on
any member should be sufficient
to calculate
all the modes having frequencies
less than or
equal to the operating
speed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3
Forced
Vibration
Analysis<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Forced vibration
analysis
shall be performed
at the
operating  speed  and also at irequencies
corresponding
to certain selected modes for transient
resonance.
The
calculated
displacement
shall be checked against the
specified criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lumped-mass
approachshall
be used forcom-
puting modal masses of the foundation.
The
machine
shall be modelled
to lump its mass
together with the mass of the foundation.
The
stiffness and damping of the shaft and casing
shall generally
be disregarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.1  Forcing Function<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally,
the unbalance
forces are furnished
by the
machine manufacturer
at each bearing location

<<HEADING level=3>>A  sinusoidal
forcing function of the form<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The base  mat may generally
be modelled
with plate
bending elements or as a grillage of beams. The soil or

as spring
elements.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F(t) =  F,  sin (tot  t $)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>shall be used for analysis.
In the absence of data from

<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 The  bearing pressure on soil or the load on the
heaviest
loaded

the net allowable
bearing
pressure
or the safe load
capacity of piles respectively.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4  Seismic Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Response spectrum analysis shall be carried out as per
IS 1893  :  1984. At least the first five modes shall be
considered
for mode superposition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12 DESIGN<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.1  Working  stress  method as per IS 456  :  1978 shall
be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5  Static Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A detailed
static analysis
of the foundation
shall be
performed
to ensure that the foundation
carries all the
loads safely. The same model which has been used for
dynamic
analysis
may be used for static analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2  Increase in Permissible
Stresses<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where stresses due to either earthquake,
short-circuit
or loss of blade unbalance
forces/bearing
failure loads
are combined
with those due to dead and permanent
load, the permissible
stresses as specified
in  IS  456  :
1978  may be increased
by 25 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
turbine
rotor
is balanced
dynamically
to
enable
smooth
operation
of the machine.
An emer-
gency condition
can occur when one or more turbine
blades
break loose from the rotor, which would im-
pose a large dynamic
force on the foundation
at the
bearing
locations.
The forces corresponding
to a
massing
last-row
blade for each turbine
section are
supplied
by the machine
manufacturer
in the form
of
unbalance
forces
or
equivalent
static forces.
Since the turbo-generator
is tripped in such a condition
these forces occur for a short time required
for the
coasting
down time of the machine.
It is sufficient
to
check the foundation
for strength under these forces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The forcing

It is advisable
to perform a
dynamic analysis of the foundation.
Sometimes,
only
the equivalent
static force is supplied which assumes
an infinitely
rigid foundation
and can make the foun-
dation  design  highly conservative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the absence of vendor supplied data, the following

<<PARAGRAPH>>When
a line-to-line

short circuit
occurs at the generator
terminal,
it imposes
a huge
torque on the TG foundation.
The short-circuit
