<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 23 October
1969, after the draft finalized
by the Flooring
and Plaster-
ing
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Granolithic
concrete
floor
topping
is adopted
for
floors
of heavy
engineering-factories,
workshops,
garrages,
warehouses,
etc, where the floor
is subjected
to heavy
loads,
and severe
abrasion
combined
with impact.
The granolithic
concrete
essentially
consists of a rich
concrete
made
with
specially
selected
aggregate
of ‘high hardness,
surface
texture
and particle
shape
suitable
for
use as a wearing
finish
to floors.
Although
plain
concrete
as laid conforming
to IS,:2571-1963*
would
be satisfactory
for
many purposes,
granolithic
concrete
is chosen because
of its high
abrasion
resistance
and used for floor toppiygs
wherever
abrasion
combined
with
impact
is likely to be severe.
In this standard
the method
of laying
the
granolithic
concrete
topping
is only given
and all other
details up to the
laying of base concrete
or suspended
slab shall conform
to the procedure
laid down in IS  :  2571-1963*
which is an adjunct
to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 There
are two methods
of laying
the  in situ  granolithic
concrete
floor
topping.
The topping
shall either be laid within three hours of the laying
of the base, that is, monolithically
with the base concrete;
or alternatively,
it shall be laid at any time after the base had begun
to harden,
in such
a
way as to produce
the maximum
possible bond between
the base and top-
ping, that is, it shall be laid separately
from the base.
A high standard
of
workmanship
is essential
and skilled floor layers should be employed
for the
job.
Inferior
work often leads to curling,
breaking
of bond between
the
base and topping
concrete,
cracking
and dusting
of the top surface.
.In
ground
floors, it is advisable
to lay the granolithic
concrete
topping monoli-
thically
with the base concrete.
Depending
upon the nature
of use and
performance
expected
from the floor topping,
the floor finish has to be laid<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

-
Integral additions, either as hardeners or accelerators,
or other surface hardening treatments are not normally required, but their
application
may be advantageous
in
certain
circumstances.
Caution
should be exercised
in the use of admixtures
and the manufacturer’s
recommendations
should be followed wherever required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 Abrasives-Metallic
or non-metallic materials of high abrasion resis-
tance
may be incorporated
in the floor topping mix to increase
the
abrasion resistance of the floor topping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6, Surface
Hardening
Solutions
- These may be solutions of sodium
silicate,
magnesium
silicofluoride,
or zinc silicofluoride
or proprietary
materials consisting mainly of one or more of these compounds.
Proprietary
materials
may be used only
in accordance
with the
manufacturer’s
instructions ( see Appendix A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. DESIGN
CONSIDERATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Abrasion
Resistance
-- Although
plain concrete
is ssitisfactory for
many purposes, granolithic
concrete
has higher abrasion
resistance
and
should be used for floor topping wherever abrasion is likely to be severe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Size
of Panels-The
floor topping shall be divided
into suitable
panels so as to reduce the risk of cracking.
Size of the panel is governed
by the thickness of floor finish, the type of construction
(monolithic
or
separate),
local
conditions
of temperature,
humidity and the season in
which flooring is laid.
For floor finish laid in exposed situations or in hot
and dry climates, the size of the panels shall be smaller as compared to the
floor finish laid in less exposed situations or in cold and humid climates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-IS :  5491- 1969<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the size of panels
laid monolithically
with the base may be larger
than
that of floor finish laid separately
on the hardened
base.
Generally,
in the
case
of
suspended
slabs
no
dimension
of
a panel
shall
exceed
4 m
in case of floor topping
laid monolithically
with the structural
slab and 2 m
iit case
of floor
topping
laid
separately
on a hardened
base.
In
case
of ground
floors,
the
size of the
topping
panel
may
synchronize
w~ith
that of the base concrete.
Length
of a panel shall not exceed
one and a
half times its breadth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Joints-
Construction
joints between
bays of the floor finish need only
be plain
untreated
vertical
butt joints
and
should
be placed
over any
joints in the base.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where
expansion
joints
are
necessary
in the walls
and
roof
of a
building,
there
should
be corresponding
joints
in the
floor.
The
floor
finish should not be allowed
to cover the joint
filler of the expansion
joint
in the base
concrete;
either
the joint
filler
should
extend
through
the
full thickness
of the base concrete
and finish or the space above
it should
be filled with a suitable
sealing compound.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Mix Proportions-Mix
proportion
for the granolithic
concrete
floor
topping
for different
types of floor
finish
shall
be 1: 1:2
(cement:
fine
aggregate
:  coarse aggregate,
by volume ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5  Protection
Against
Dampness
-The
layer
of
coarse
sand
or
boulder
soling
provided
under
the base concrete
will generally
serve the
~purpose of damp-proofing
required
for
ordinary
floors
under
normal
conditions.
However,
in more
severe
conditions,
where
it is expected
that
the dampness
may find its way on the top of the floor in the course of
usage
of
floor,
a more
effective
damp-proof
treatment
shall
be given
underneath
the floor by either of the methods given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Laying
the base concrete
in two layers and painting
the top of the
lower
layer
with two coats of bitumen
conforming
to. IS:
1580-
1969*
applied at the rate of 1.5 kg/ma,
The surface
of the lower
layer
shall be finished
smooth
while laying
the concrete
so that
bitumen
can be applied
uniformly.
The
bnumen
shall be applied
after
the concrete
has set and is sufficiently
hard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Sandwiching
a waterproofing
membrane,
such
as
bitumen
felt
conlorming
to
IS: 1322-19657
in the
base
concrete
laid in two
layers.
The surface
of the lower
layer
shall be finished
smooth
while
laying
the concrete
so as to provide
an even surface
and
thus prevent
damage
to the surface of waterproofing
membrane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

not later than two to
three hours of laying
the base concrete,
depending
upon the temperature
and the atmospheric
conditions.
The base concrete
at the time of laying
the topping
shall be still green but sufficiently
firm to enable
the workmen
to work over it by placing
planks on its surface.
The granolithic
concrete
mix ( 1:  1:2)
for the topping
shall be deposited
on the base
concrete
in
the screed

immediately.
The
topping
shall
then
be
floated
with
a
wooden
float to render
the surface
even and after
the surface
is slightly
hardened,
it shall be finished
smooth as described

to it, it shall be kept continuously
moist for at least ten
days by means of wet gunny bags, 50 mm thick layer of damp sand spread
over the surface
or pooling
water
on the surface.
During
this period
the

GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.1
It is not necessary,
generally,
to apply any further
treatment
to the
granolithic
cancrete
floor top surface,
but dusting
may be reduced
by the
application
of one of the
surface
hardening
solutions
described
in 3.6.
These
treatments
are
likely
to need
renewal
at intervals
of one
year.
Where
proprietory
materials
are to be used, advice should be obtained
from
the manufacturers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A-2. CLEANING
THE SURFACE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1  The top surface of the granolithic concrete should be clean and free
from grease or oil to enable the hardening solutions to penetrate.
Sweep-
ing to remove
dust and
dirt may be adequate
only
in some
cases
of new floors and additional
cleaning may be necessary.
The top surface
shall be wetted with water and scrubbed with coir or steel wire brush and
thoroughly
cleaned
by washing
with
clean
water.
The
floor should
be allowed to dry so that the hardening solution can be absorbc:d into the
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3. TREATMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1 Sodium Silicate-A
solution containing
one part by volume of
sodium silicate and four to six parts of water should be spread cvcnly over
the granolithic concrete top surface with a mop or soft brush, the stronger
solution being used on a less absorptive
surface.
Any excess
material
should be wiped off and the floor allowed
to dry.
After the floor has
been washed with clean water, a second coat,
containing
one part ol
sodium silicate to three or four parts of water, should be applied, and this
should be allowed to. dry similarly.
A third coat may be applied after
washing if the floor is still porous.
After drying,
the flock should be
washed
with hot’ clean
water.
Effective
results are obtained
if
the
treatment is applied seven to ten days after the end of.curing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.2  Silicofluoride -  The cr~ta% of magnesium silicofluoricle or of zinc
silicofluoride should be d&solved in water at the rate of O-1 g/cm” for the
&st coat and 0.2 g/cm3 for subsequent coats.
Three
coats are usually
applied at 24-hour intqrvals.
There is no need to wash the top surface
of the floor between
coats, but it is advisable
to wash with clean water
after the final treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
