<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee, WRD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 3) (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Water Resources Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In measurement of works of river projects a large diversity of methods exist at present according to local
practices. The lack of uniformity creates complications regarding measurements and payments. This standard
has been formulated in various parts, covering each type of work separately. This part is intended to provide a
uniform basis for measuring the work done in respect of grouting for river valley projects. Due care has been
taken to ensure conformity with IS 13418: 1992 ‘Proforma for analysis of unit rate of grouting used in river
valley projects’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1980 and revised in 1994. With the experience gained by its usage and by
the revision and updation of related standards, it was necessary to revise the standard second time so as to bring
it in line with the current field practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no 1S0 standard on the subject. This standard has been prepared based on indigenous manufacturers’
data/practices prevalent in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
1S2: !960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised)’.
The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
