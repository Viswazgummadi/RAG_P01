OF DENSITY
INDEX
(RELATIVE

) OF COHESIONLESS
SOILS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( E‘irst Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 28 November
1983,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the Soil Engineering
and
Rock klechnriics
Sectional
(‘omlllittee
had
been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
part
deals
with
the
method
for the
determination
of density
index
(  relative
density
) of cohesionless
soils. For cohesionless
soils in the
natural
or artificially
cotnpacted
state neither
the actuffl density
( or void
ratio ) nor
the actual
density
express
2s a percentage
of the maximum
density
give an exact
idea
of the compactness
01 the soil.
The
concept
of density
index
(  relative
density
)  gives a practically
useful
measure
of
compactness
of such soils.
The compacti\
e characteristics
of cohesionless
soils and
the related
properties
of such
soils
are dependent
on facto! s
like grain
size distribution
and
shape
of individual
particles.
Density
index
~( relative
density
) is also affected
by these factors
and
serves as a
parameter
to correlate
properties
of  soils.
Various
soil properties,
such
as
penetration
resistance,
compressibility,
compaction
li iction
angle,
permeability
and
California
bearing
ratio
are
fount1
to
havr
simple
relationships
with
density
index
( relatiye
density
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

along the axis of the guide
brackets.
The dial gauge holder should be
inserted in each of the guide brackets on the mould with the dial gauge
stem on top of the calibration bar and on the axis of the guide brackets.
The dial gauge holder should be placed in the, same position in the guide
brackets each time by means of matchmarks
on the guide brackets and
the holder. Six dial gauge readings should be obtained, three on the left
side and three on the right side, and these six readings averaged.
The
initial dial reading should be computed by adding together the,surcharge
base plate thickness and the average of the six dial gauge readings and
subtracting the thickness of the calibration bar.
The initial dial reading
is constant for a particular
mould and surcharge base plate combination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>I§ 8 27,29 ( Part 14 ) - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2  Soil containing particles smaller than 9.50 mm should be placed as
loosely as possible in the mould by pouring the soil through the spout in a
steady stream.
The spout should be adjusted so that the height of free fall
of the soil is always 25 mm. While pouring the soil the pouring device
should be moved in a spiral motion from the outside towards the centre
to  form _a soil layer
of uniform
thickness
without segregation.
The
mould should be filled
approximately
25 mm above the top and levelled
with top by. making
one continuous
pass with the steel straightedge.
If
all excess matter is not removed, an additional
continuous pass should be
made.
Great
care shall be exercised
to avoid jarring
the mould during
the entire
pouring
and trimming
operation.
The
mould and the soil
should be weighed and the mass recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3
Soil containing
particles larger than 9.50 mm should be placed by
means of a large scoop ( or shovel  )  held as close as possible to and just
above the soil surface to cause the material
to slide rather than fall into
the  previously
placed soil.
If necessary, large particles may be held by
hand  to prevent them from rolling off the scoop.
The mould should be
filled
to overflowing
but not more than 25 mm above
the top.
The
surface of the soil should be levelled with the top of the mould using the
steel straightedge
( and the fingers, if necessary)
in such a way that any
slight projections
of the larger particles
above the top of the mould shall
approximately
balance
the larger
voids in the surface below the top of
the mould.
The mould
and the soil should be weighedand
the mass
recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5  Procedure
for
the Determination
of Maximum

<<HEADING level=3>>3.5.1  The maximum
density may be determined
by either the dry or
wet method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.2
Dry Method<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.2.1
The guide sleeve
should
be
assembled
on
top
of
the
mould and the clamp
assemblies
tightened
so that the inner surfaces of
the walls of the mould and the sleeve are in line. The lock nuts on the
two set screws equipped with them should be tightened.
The third clamp
should be loosened, the guide sleeve removed, the empty mould weighed
and its mass recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.2.2
The
mould should then be filled with the thoroughly mixed
ovendry
soil by the procedure
explained in 3.4.2 or 3.4.3.
The mould
filled for the determination
of minimum
density may also be used for
this test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.2.3
The guide sleeves should be attached to the mould and the
surcharge
base plate should be placed on the soil surface.

of the 15 000 cm* mould.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.2.4
The
mould should be fixed to the vibrator deck (see Fig. 1D
for  assembly.
The vibrator control should be set at maximum
amplitude
and the loaded soil specimen should be vibrated
for 8 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Wet Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5.3.1
The wet method (  Se6  Note ) may be conducted on dry soil
or wet soil from the field.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE--While
the dry method is preferred
from
the standpoint
of securin
results in a shorter
period
of time,
the highest
maximum
density
is
obtaine ff
from
some
soils
in
a saturated
state.
At
the beginning
of
a
laboratory
testing programme,
or when a radical change of materials
occurs,
the maximum
densitv
test should
be performed
on both wet and dry soils to determine
which
method
results
in higher
maximum
density.
If the wet method produces higher
maximum
densities (‘in excess of one percent ) it shall be followed
in succeeding
tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.3.2
The mould should be filled with wet soil. Sufficient water
should be added to the soil to allow a small quantity
of free water to
accumulate
on the surface of the soil  during’  filling.
During and just after
filling the mould, it should be vibrated for a total of 6 minutes.
During
this period the amplitude
of  the vibrator should be reduced
as much as
necessary to avoid excessive boiling and fluffing of the soil, which
may
occur
in some soils.
During
the final minutes of vibration,
any water
appearing
above the surface of the soil should be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.3.3
The guide sleeve, surcharge
base plate and surcharge
weight
should be assembled as described in 8.5.2.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.3.4
The specimen
with the surcharge weight should be vibrated
for 8 minutes.
After the vibration, the surcharge lveight and the guide
should be removed
from
the mould.
Dial
gauge
readings
should
be obtained
on two opposite
sides of the surchilrge
base plate and
recorded. The entire wet specimen should be carefully
removed from the
mould, dried to constant mass, weighed and the mass recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
