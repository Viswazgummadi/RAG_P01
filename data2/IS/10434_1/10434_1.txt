<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
(Part 1) (First Revision)
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by the Hydraulic
Structures
Instrumentation
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Water
Resources
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To minimize
cracking,
large straight gravity
and arch gravity dams are made in blocks, separated
from each
other by transverse
and longitudinal
contraction
joints. To restore the dam to its monolithic
state for integrated
behaviour,
contraction
joints
are grouted
with cement
grout. Grouting
of joints
is done when the joints
have
opened to maximum.
Measurement
of joints movement
during grouting operation
will indicate how much grout
should be pumped
into the joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements
of joint movements
subsequent
to the completion
of the grouting of contraction
joints, provides
information
regarding
the behaviour
of the grouted joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surface
measurements
and joint movements
will be useful for watching
shearing
movement
of joints.
These
measurements
can be done with mechanical
strain gauges applied to gauge inserts. However,
full reliance cannot
be placed on the surface measurements
as all parts of joints do not open at the same time and not even the same
amount.
Internal joint movement
may, therefore,
also need to be measured.
Vibrating
wires type jointmeters
for measurement
of joint movement
at the surface and in the interior of concrete
and masonry
dams are being
separately
covered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
has been published
in two parts. Part 2 of the standard covers foundation
deformation
measuring
devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1982. This first revision
is being taken up to incorporate
the knowledge
gained during the use of the standard.
In this revision reference
clause has been added and some addition
has
been made in the method of installation
of resistance
type jointmeter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the Committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard
is given at Annex E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Construction
and principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The horizontal
distance
xl at time [1 is obtained
from
the equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The meter is in the form of a long brass cylinder
with
a flange at one end and a threaded
hub on the other to
fit a tapped socket. In practice, the socket is embedded
in the concrete
of a leading
monolith
to form
the
anchorage
for the meter on one side of the contraction
joint
to be measured.
The
flange
on the meter
is
engaged
and held by the embedding
concrete
in the
following
monolith
on the opposite
side of the joint.
Inside
the brass
case,
a steel
framework
supports
ceramic
pulleys
and a long single loop of steel wire,
which is held in tension by small coil springs. A greater
part of the displacement
which the meter undergoes
in
use is taken up by the springs
(see Fig. 2). The brass
tube is completely
filled with a corrosion
resistant oil.
A separate sealing chamber is provided for terminating
the three rubber covered conductor
cables that connect
the jointmeter
to the terminal boxes in the galleries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B 1=
distance between upper two inserts across the
joint, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cl =
distance between lower-two inserts across the
joint.
Similarly
X2and y? at time  tz are calculated.
Between
times [.land [~, the horizontal
movement
of the joint is
M – xl and slide movement
is y2 – yl.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The instrument
is designed
to take advantage
of two
electrical
properties
of steel wire, namely,
resistance
varies directly with temperature
and resistance
varies
directly with tension. When the ends of the jointmeter
are pulled
apart by opening
of a joint,
the outer or
expansion
loop elongates
and increases
in tension and
consequently
in resistance
as well. At the same time,
the inner or contraction
loop decreases
in resistance
as
it shortens. The ratio of the resistance
of the expansion
loop divided by the resistance
of the contraction
loop
is used as a measure
of joint opening.
Temperature
is
measured
by taking
the sum
of the resistances
of
expansion
and contraction
coils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6
Source of Error<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Seating the gauge is one of the chief sources of error.
Application
of excessive
longitudinal
force should be
avoided
for seating
the points
in the inserts.
Other
sources of error are the dial indicator
and temperature
changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4
MEASUREMENT
OF
INTERNAL
JOINT
MOVEMENTS
BY JOINTMETERS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>%1 Jointmeters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two kinds of jointmeters
for internal joint movement
measurements
are in use:
a)
Unbended
resistance
type, and
b)
Vibrating
wire type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since
there
may
be
considerable
shearing
or
movement
in contraction joints as adjacent blocks cool
at different
rates,
the jointmeter
is designed
to
withstand a shearing movement
of 2.5 mm by reducing
the frame section at the ends to serve as elastic hinges.

for easy installation.
Screw the socket cm the plug.
When
socket
installation
is complete,
care
should be taken by the workmen
not to hang
things on the socket or use it as a step in getting
out of the form or misuse
it in any other way
as to cause misalignment.
As a precaution
it is
good practice
to run a few stay wires to the
form to keep the socket in position and prevent
its misalignment.
The arrangement
is shown in
Fig. 3.
If it is considered
that for the particular
con-
crete being used, the force exerted by the nails
in the plug and ties is greater
than the bond
resistance
on the socket,
to prevent
pulling
it
out during form removal.
The anchor
should
necessarily
be provided
in the case of masonry
dams.
If the cable
leads are to run in the block
in
which the socket is embedded,
recess should
be provided
adjacent
to the socket into which
not less than 1 m of the cable should be coiled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Number
and Location<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1
Number
of jointmeters
required
to be provided
in any given dam will depend
upon the dimensions,
block layout, provision
of transverse
and longitudinal
joints
or transverse
joints
only, configuration
of the
foundation
profile,
presence
of specially
treated
foundation
features
under the dam, and the extent to
which measurements
of joint behaviour
would prove
adequate
in representing
the joint movements
for the
entire structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
In the case of dams built in V-shaped
canyon,
jointmeters
should be installed in at least three blocks,
namely,
one central
block
representing
deepest
and
maximum
section of the dam, and a block each in the
abutment
portions representing
blocks built on steeply
sloping abutments.
In other cases they maybe installed
one
in
the
overflow
section
and
one
in
the
non-overflow
section
or any
other
representative
block
as may be decided.
At a given elevation,
the
jointmeters
in each of these blocks should be installed
at the
centre
of the transverse
dimensions
of the
monoliths
in the blocks,
and should be spaced about
15 m vertically
in the height of the longitudinal
and
transverse
contraction
joints
as the
grouting
lifts
(zoning of joints by provision
of metal seal) are limited
to about 15 m in height. This spacing may be modified
in the top portion
of the joint if joint height does not
permit of 15 m spacing for the entire height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.3
After the low block reaches
the elevation
in
which
the jointmeter
itself
is to be embedded,
the
following
procedure
shall be followed:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the form is removed,
remove
the plug,
fill greased
cloth and screw in the hexagonal
headed plug;
Complete
the lift at the jointmeter
location;
Dig back at the location
until the plug is un-
covered
leaving a small trench about 30 cm x
30 cm;
Back out the plug and greased cloth and insert
the jointmeter,
screwing
it uprigh~
While fixing the moveable
end of jointmeter,
allowance
may
be given
for the
meter,
to
respond
for expansion
and contraction
that is
in both the directions.
Tie the jointmeter
cable lead out of the pour (if
cable is embedded
in the high block) and back-
fill with 75 mm maximum
concrete,
hand pud-
dling the concrete
around the meten and
Next day, splice the meter cable; and the cable
extension
may preferably
be done at the time
of embedment
to allow
observation
to be
made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Total resistance
of meter as measured
in the field. With a 4-conductor
cable the cell resistance
is measured
directly, and WIS
column may be left blank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Resistance of the white and black conductors,
as measured directly during the splicing operations.  Asan attemative,
a  reasonably
accurate value may be determined
by subtracting
the total resistance
of the contraction
and expansion
coils measured
in series
from the sum of the resistances
of the contraction
and expansion coils measured
separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Col4:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Col5:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Resistance
of meter excluding
cable leads. It is obtained
by subtracting

cable the meter
resistance
is measured directly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>~01  6:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temperature
of the meter, obtained by subtracting
(B) from the cell resistanceinCO15,
multiplying
the difference

adding the product  to  (A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Col7:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The resistance
mtio of the meter as measured
with the test set.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Total change in resistance
ratio(CO17) from a selected initial vatue when the joint is known to be closed.  Thisis  usuatly taken
at about 24 h after the concrete/masonry
has been placed. Proper algebraic sign should be shown.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Co]  8:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c’ol9:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Multiply
values in COI8 by the correlated

(D), The algebraic
signs of co] 8 we carried
over into CO19,
positi;;
values indicating an opening of the joint with respect to the initial position and  vice-versa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Since the magnitude
of the thermal length changes of the meter and concrete/masonry
due to changes
in temperature
are
significantly
small relative to the joint movements
being measured
and the range of the meter, no temperature
correction
is made.
Temperature
data is of general interest and provides a means for detecting faulty operation
of the measuring point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
