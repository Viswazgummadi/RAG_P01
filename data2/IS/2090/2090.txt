FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 14 March
1983, after the draft finalized by the
Joint
Sectional
Committee
for
Concrete
Reinforcement
had
been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard
was first published in 1962 to cover the requirements
of  high
tensile steel bars used in prestressed
concrete.
The
present
revision has been taken up with a view to incQrporating modifications
found necessary as a result of experience gained in using this standard
both by manufacturers
and users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 10 this revision, modifications have been incorporated
in provisions
relatiig to tolerances,
proof stress and relaxation test.
The requirement
of  young’s
modulus has been deleted.
Further
S.I.
units have
been
adopted for specifying the various physical requirements in the standard
and references
to various
other
Indian
Sandards
appearing
in this
standard have been updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In  the formulation of this standard,
due weightage has been  giveti to
international
co-ordination
among the standard and practices prevailing.
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated.
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accord-
ance with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

elongation ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Tensile Strength -  The maximum
load reached
in a tensile
test
divided

area of the gauge length portion

COMPOSITION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The steel shall be manufactured
by the,open-hearth,
electric,
duplex,
acid bessem. er, basic oxygen ( LD ) process or a combination
of these
processes with the addition of necessary alloying elements.
In case any
other process is employed
in the manufacture,
prior
approval
of the
purchaser shall be obtained.
The steel shall be hot rolled into bars and
subsequently
processed to give the required physical
properties.
Where
the bars are threaded
the thread shall be either cut or rolled.
Threaded
ends shall be protected from corrosion and damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1 The

0.050
percent
of
sulphur
and
not

phosphorus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 All finished bars
shall
be cleanly
rolled
to specified
dimensions.
They
shall be sound and free from splits, harmful surface flaws, rough,
jagged
and imperfect edges; and other c’efects.
Unless otherwise agreed
between the purchaser and the manufacturer,
they shall not carry
rust
or other matter to a degree likely to impair their adhesion in concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

relaxation
readings shall commence from the end of sixth minute.
