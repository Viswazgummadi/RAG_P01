<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 1 ) ( First Revision > wzs eecpted
by the Bureau cf Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by the Terminolcgy
Relating to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A large number
of Indian
Standards
have already been published
covering various aspects of
river valley
projects
and some more similar slandaidsare
in the process of formulation.
These
standards include technical terms and precise definitions for such terms are required for avoiding
embiguity
in their
interpretation.
To achieve
this aim, the Sectional
Committee
is bringing
out Indian Standards Glossary  of  Terms Relating to River Valley Projects ( IS 4410 )  ;  being publi-
shed in parts.
This standard
( Part 1 ) covers definitions of terms commonly
occuring
in the
limited field of irrigation practices, for example, types of crops, areas and water requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
was first published
in 1967.
This revision
has been prepared
in the light of the
experience
gained during the last 24 years in the use of this standard.
In this revision
additional
terms have been added
besides modifying
some of the terms so as to bring it in line with latest
technology.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage has been given to international
co-ordination
among
standards
and practices,
prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the
practice in the field in this country.
This has been met by deriving
considerable
assistance from
multilingual
technical
dictionary
on irrigation
and drainage
published
by International
Com-
mission on Irrigation
and Drainage ( ICID ) and many other sources.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
