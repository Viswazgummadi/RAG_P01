Hydrogen Embrittiement \u2014 Hydrogen embrittlement can occur in steels of high tensile strength\n( greater than 1000 MPa ) or high surface hardness due to case hardening or cold working. It results\nfrom the absorption of atomic hydrogen generated at the steel surface by processes, such as acid\npickling or cathodic cleaning.",
