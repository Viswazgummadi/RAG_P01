4.2 Uniformity of Coating — The uniformity of zinc costing shall be such that the coating shall
withstand the copper sulphate test as given in IS : 2633-1972 ‘ Methods of testing uniformity of coating
on zinc coated articles (first revision) ' without showing any. adherent red deposit of metallic copper
upon the base metal with the following exceptions:
a) A fina line of copper on the crest of tha screw threads or on sharp edges of bolt/nut or at.
or adjacent to any cut or abrasion present in the original fastener shal! not be considered a
defect to cause rejection, and .
b) Any deposit of metallic copper with threads of fasteners which have been re-thread rolled
after galvanizing, is allowable. _
4.3 Adhesion of Coating — The coating shalt withstand the knife test as covered in IS : 2629-1966.
5. Appearance and Defects — The galvanized coating shall be continuous and free from defects, such
as blisters, flux stains, dross, excessive projections or other imperfections which would impair service-
, ability. The causes for these defects, remedial and grounds for rejection are given ‘in
Appendix A to IS: 2629-1966 (for terminology a/so see JS : 2629-1966).

_ specimens to be tested shall be selected at random in accordance with Table 3.

6.2 Refests — Should any one of the samples selected fail to meet the requirements at 4 and 5, twice
the number of samples first taken shail be so tested, and If any one of these fails the batch represented
by the samples shal] be rejected or the batch may be re-galvanized and re-submitted for testing. .

EMBRITTLEMENT.
A-0. General — For steel fasteners to be in the embrittled condition after hot-dip galvanizing is rare,
and its occurrence depends on a combination of factors. Under certain conditions. some steels may lose
their ductile properties and become embrittied. The following information is given as a guidance in

A-2. Hydrogen Embrittiement — Hydrogen embrittlement can occur in steels of high tensile strength
( greater than 1000 MPa ) or high surface hardness due to case hardening or cold working. It results
from the absorption of atomic hydrogen generated at the steel surface by processes, such as acid
pickling or cathodic cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

EXPLANATORY NOTE
The-requirements for hot-dip galvanized coatings on threaded fasteners were earlier covered in
iS : ‘Hot-dip galvanized coatings on fasteners’. Consequent to the decision to revise
1S ; 1367-1967 ‘Technical supply conditions for threaded steel fastener ( first revision )' splitting it
into many parts, it was felt appropriate to publish ‘ hot-dip coatings on threaded fasteners’
as one of its parts.
In the preparation of this standard considerable assistance has been derived from AS > 1214-1973
‘Hot-dip galvanized coatings on threaded fasteners issued by Standards Association of Australia.
