<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Third Revision ) was adopted
by the
Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the
Fire Fighting Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division -Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
(
the draft finaliied
by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydrants
are invariably used for fire fighting purposes to
derive water from the water line.
The
hydrants
could be stand-post
type or underground,
that is, sluice-valve
type.
This standard
covering underground
fire hydrants,
sluice-valve
type was first published in 1958 and revised in
1965.
The
second
revision
has been prepared
to incorporate
complete
details
of duck-foot
bend besides making other contents
up to date.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage has been given to international
co-ordination
among the standards
and
practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to
relating it
to the practices
in the field in this
country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the present
revision of the standard,
in addition
to
general
updating,
the following
major
changes have been introduced:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A detailed figure of
‘Underground
Fire Hydrant
Valve’ including an ‘item list’ of com-
ponents giving their details has been included.
b) ‘Valve seat tightness test’ has also been included under performance
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
a particular
requirment
of
this
standard
is
complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test
or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS
2  :  1960
‘Rules
for
rounding
off
numerical
values ( revised)‘.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value
should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

REQUIREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1 Hydrostatic
Pressure Test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Immediately
after
casting
and
before
machining all cast iron parts shall be thoroughly
cleaned,
and before
rusting commences,
shall
be coated by dipping
in a bath
containing
a
composition
having
a bituminous
base ( see
IS 158 :. 1981 ) and maintained
at a temperature
between 143 and 166°C. The proportions
of the
ingredients
of
the
composition
shall be so
regulated as to
produce a coating
having the
properties
specified in 8.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each assembled
unit
shall be subjected
to a
hydrostatic
pressure
of
2.1
MN/ma
with
the
valve
open
and
outlet
closed
for
a
period
of
2.5
minutes
for
the
purpose
of
locating
porosity
in
the
casting.
When
so tested,
it shall
not fail or show any sign of
leakage
either
through
the
valve
body
or
through the gland of the spindle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Valve Seat Tightness Test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 The
casting
shall
be
re-heated
before
dipping; either by immersion
in hot water
or
by heating in an oven, or shall be held in the
dipping
bath
sufficiently
long
to
reach
an
equivalent
temperature,
the method used being
at the maker’s option.
Care shall be taken to
see that the casting
are perfectly
dry immedia-
tely before dipping.
On removal from the bath
the
castings shall be sufficiently
drained
and
ensure that no portion
is left uncoated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The stop valve shall be fully closed by screwing
down the spindle.
A hydrostatic
pressure
of
1.4 MN/me shall then be applied to each valve
on its
inlet
side.
There shall be no leakage
through the valve and its seat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11 CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTANCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each hydrant
shall be tested for the
require-
ments prescribed
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3 The coating shall be such that it shall not
impart
any
taste
or smell
to water.
The
coating shall be smooth,
glossy and tenacious,
sufficiently hard so as not to flow when exposed
to a temperature
of 77°C and not so brittle
at a
temperature
of 0°C as to chip off when scribed
lightly with the point of a penknife.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12 MARKING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1 Each hydrant
shall be clearly and  perma-
nently marked with the following information:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Manufacturer’s
name or trade-mark,
and
b) Year of manufacture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9 PAINTING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Complete
hydrant shall be painted
externally
with two coats of fire red paint conforming
