<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Dams
(Ovefflow
and Non-overflow)
and Diversion
Works
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the River
Valley
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mass concrete
structures
undergo
volumetric
changes
with time after the placement
of concrete.
A rapid rise
in the temperature
of mass concrete
takes place during
the phase when the concrete
mass is in plastic
stage
and undergoes
hardening.
After hardening,
the concrete gradually cools due to effect of atmospheric
temperature,
which tends to subject the concrete
to high tensile stresses.
Cracking
occurs in the concrete
when these tensile
stresses
exceed
the tensile
strength
of the concrete.
This cracking
is undesirable
because
it affects
the water
tightness, durability
and appearance
of hydraulic
structures.
The cracking tendency maybe
reduced to acceptable
levels
through
appropriate
design,
construction
and concrete
placement
procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temperature
control
is essential
to (a) minimize
volumetric
changes
and control
the size and
spacing
of
undesirable
cracks
and (b) facilitate
completion
of the structure
during
the specified
construction
period
by
increasing
lift heights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final
value, observed
or calculated
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
should
be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (revised)’.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value
should
be the same as that of the specified
value
in thk
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The  coefficient of thermal expansion for concrete
is essentially
constant
over
the normal
temperature
range,
and tends to increase
with increasing
cement
content
and
decrease
with
age.
The
main
factors
affecting
the
value
of the
coefficient
of
thermal
expansion
of concrete
are aggregate
type and moisture
content;
other factors such as mix proportion,
cement
type and age influence
its magnitude
to a lesser extent.
Typical
values
of coefficient
of thermal
expansion
of concrete
using
various
aggregates
is given
in

and only one type of cement from the same

may be assumed
as 335 kJ/kg at 28

Thermal Diffusivity<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is an index of the ease, or difficulty,
with which
concrete
undergoes
temperature
change.
For normal
weight concrete
where density
and specific heat vary
within
narrow
range,
thermal
diffusivity
reflects
the
conductivity
value.
High diffusivity
indicates
greater
ease
in
gaining
or losing
heat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.6
Adiabatic Temperature Rise  in  Mass Concrete<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Newly placed concrete undergoes
a rise in temperature
due to exothetmic
reaction
of the cementing
material
in the concrete.
Hence, for temperature
computations
of mass concrete,
certain
parameters
are required
to
be known or assumed.
One of the important parameters
is adiabatic temperature rise in concrete. This is required
to determine the amount of heat generated for a specific
period of time and effective cement content. Compound
compositions
and fineness of cement largely influence
generation
of heat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4
Thermal Conductivity<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermal
conductivity
is a measure
of the capability
of concrete
to conduct
heat.
The thermal conductivity
varies with mineralogical
characteristics
of aggregate,
moisture
content, density and temperature
of concrete.
Values
of thermal
conductivity
should
be obtained
by laboratory
tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adiabatic
temperature
rise
is governed
by the law:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>T
= T, (l-e-m’) where
‘T,’ and ‘m’ are constants
for a particular
concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the
absence
of laboratory
tests,
the
values
of
diffusivity
and thermal
conductivity
of concrete
as
given
in Table

be adopted
for preliminary
studies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.6.1
For temperature
rise, the specific
heat of all
the ingredients
of concrete
is the governing
factor and
the concrete absorbs the heat generated
by the cement.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.7.1  The
entire
quantum
of heat
generated
by
hydration
of cement
does
not go into
raising
the
temperature
of concrete.
As heat is generated,
there
is also a loss to, or gain from,
the atmosphere
due
to the difference
in temperature
between concrete
and
the atmosphere.
For
all practical
purposes,
it is
sufficient to estimate the loss of heat from the exposed
top surface of the lift.
The heat loss from the vertical
sides of the lift may be neglected.
Also, the heat loss
after successive
lifts have been laid over the lift in
question, is relatively
small and can be neglected,
that
is, the heat lost from the exposed
top surface
during
the interval
between
two lifts only is considered
for
estimating total heat loss.
The loss of heat is calculated

In the first and second
idealized
conditions,
the lift is assumed
to be cast on an inert lift which
is at the
same
temperature
as that
of atmosphere.
However,
as at the end of the exposure
period of the
previous
lift that is, at the time of placement
of the
new lift, some part of the total heat generated
in the
previous
lift still remain unlost, the temperatureof
the
previous
lift
is
increased
above
atmospheric
temperature
due to this remaining
heat.
Therefore,
some heat from the previous
lift is lost through
the
exposed
surface
of the
lift in question
during
the
exposure
period
of this new lift.
This heat loss is
given

A chilled

directed
on the sand as it is transported
on conveyer

by
passing it through screw conveyers,
the blades of which
carry chilled water inside.
Immersion
of sand in cold
water
is not practical
because
of the
difficulty
in
removing
free water from the sand after cooling.
This
also leads

Cementitious
materials
used in concrete
are
hydraulic
materials,
so their quality
control
requires
that they be handled and batched dry. If the temperature
of the cement
is brought
down below
the dew point
of the surrounding
atmosphere,
moisture will condense
and adversely affect the ultimate quality of the cement.
Generally,
the temperature
of bulk cement
supplied
is
about 37”C;
hence
it neither
cools
naturally
nor
looses
a sizable
portion
of excess
heat
before
it is
used.
Therefore,
cooling
of cement
is not normally
done.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5
METHODS
OF TEMPERATURE
CONTROL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
Most
commonly
used methods
are precooking,
post cooling and reducing
heat of hydration
by proper
mix design.
The ideal condition
would be simply to
place the
concrete
at stable temperature
of dam and
heat of hydration
removed,
as it is generated,
so that
temperature
of concrete
is not allowed
to rise above
stable
temperature.
However
this is not possible
to
achieve
practical
y. Therefore,
the
most
practical
method
is to mecool
concrete
so as to restrain
the
net temperatu~e
rise to acceptable
levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1.4
Refrigeration plant capaci~<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As the temperatures
of aggregates
will generally follow
the
annual
cycle
of ambient
air
temperature,
the
refrigeration
plant
capacity
requirement
should
be
determined
for a specific
segment
of time, that is for
a week or a month. The refrigeration
may be designed
to produce
a single
material,
such as ice, or may be
divided
into
various
cooling
systems
for production
of ice, chilled
water
and/or
cooled
air according
to
heat
balance
needs.
The
size
of the cooling
plant
required
is expressed
in tonnes
of refrigeration.
Refrigeration
capacity
of plant is worked out in terms
of ice equivalent
(see Annex
B).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2
Precooking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1
One
of
the
most
effective
and
positive
temperature
control
measure
is precooking
which
reduces
the
placement
temperature
of
concrete
(see 4.2.6.2).
The method, or combination
of methods,
used to reduce
concrete
placement
temperatures
will
vary
with
the degree
of cooling
required
and
the
equipment
available
with the project
authority
or the
contractor.
In this method usually the fine and coarse
aggregates
and the water are separately
cooled to the
requisite
temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3
Post
Cooling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1.1
Mixing water may be cooled to varying degrees,
usually from O“C to 4“C.
Adding
crushed
ice or ice
flakes to the mix is an effective
method
of cooling
because it takes advantage
of the latent heat of fusion
of ice.
The addition
of large amount
of ice flakes,
however,
may
not be possible
in cases
where
both
coarse aggregate
and sand contain appreciable
amount
of free water, in which
case the amount
of water to
be added to the mix may be so small that substitution
of part of the water
to be added
with ice may not
be feasible.
From practical
considerations,
not more
than 70 percent of water should be replaced by crushed
ice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1
Post cooling is a means of crack control. Control
of
concrete
temperature
may
be
effectively
accomplished
by circulating
cold water through
thin
walled pipes embedded
in concrete.
This will reduce
the temperature
of newly placed
concrete
by several
degrees,
but the primary
purpose
of the system
is to
accelerate
the
subsequent
heat
removal
and
accompanying
volume
decrease,
during
early
ages
when the elastic modulus is relatively low. Post cooling
is also used where longitudinal
contraction
joints
are
provided
in order to reduce the temperature
of concrete
to the desired
value
prior
to grouting
of transverse
contraction
joint.
Post cooling
will create
a flatter
temperature
gradient
between
the warm concrete
and
the cooler exterior
atmosphere
which,
in turn, helps
in avoiding
temperature
cracks.
Other methods
such
as evaporative
cooling
with a fine water spray,
cold
water curing
and shading
may prove
beneficial,
but
the results are variable and do not significantly
affect
the temperature
in the interior
of massive
placement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although most rock minerals
have comparatively
low
heat capacity,
since aggregates
comprise
the greatest
proportion
of concrete
mix,
the temperature
of the
aggregate
has the greatest influence on the temperature.
of the concrete.
Cooling
of coarse aggregate
to about
1.7°C may
be accomplished
in several
ways.
One
method
is to chill
the aggregates
in large tanks
of
refrigerated
water
for a given period
of time or by
spraying
cold
water.
Effective
cooling
of coarse
aggregate
is also attained
by forcing
refrigerated

<<HEADING level=3>>parameters

<<PARAGRAPH>>aluminium
or synthetic
plastic pipe or tubing generally
ot_25 mm dia and 1.50 mm wall thickness
placed
in
grid like coils over the top of each concrete lift. When
the expected
active cooling
period exceeds
3 months,
steel tubing
should
be used.
The number
of coils in
a block
depends
upon the size of the block
and the
horizontal
spacing of the pipes.
For practical reasons,
pipe coils are placed and tied to the top of a hardened
concrete
surface
and thus vertical spacing
of the pipe
corresponds
to lift thickness.
A horizontal
spacing
same
as the vertical
spacing
will result
in the most
uniform cooling pattern but variations may be allowed.
Supply
and return headers,
with manifolds
to permit
individual
connections
to each coil are normally placed
on the downstream
face of the dam.
In some case,
cooling
shafts, galleries
and embedded
header system
may
be used
to advantage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.1
The  cement
content
in the concrete
plays
an
important
role in evolution
of heat of hydration.
By
suitably
modifying
the
concrete
mix
design,
the
quantity
of cement
per cubic metre
of concrete
may
be reduced so as to reduce the amount of heat generated
by cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.2
The height, of the placement
lift is generally
governed
by economic
considerations.
Shallow
lifts
not only slow down
the construction
but also result
in increased construction
joints which entail additional
costs for cleaning
and preparation
for placement
of
the next lift.
The thickness
of lift is also related
to
the temperature
control
measures
proposed
and the
ambient
temperature
at the site.
To reduce
the net
temperature
rise, the lift thickness
should be reduced
if time is not a constraint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1.2
Postcooling
by running chilled water through
embedded
pipes is nowadays
recommended
only when
longitudinal
joints
are
provided.
Postcooling
is
generally
avoided
mainly
because
it is costlier
than
precooking system.
Improved techniques for precooking
the dry components
would be beneficial
when a large
reduction in placement
temperature
is necessary.
With
recent
advancement
in concrete
technology,
the
quantity
of cement
used
for producing
concrete
of
required
strength
has been reduced
appreciably
and
thus
postcooling
may not be considered
necessary
in dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.3
There
is
always
some
time
lag
between
placement
of concrete
in successive
lifts.
Depending
upon
ambient
temperatures,
these
delays
can
be
beneficial
or harmful.
Allowance
of sufficient
time
between two construction
lifts to allow large dissipation
of heat from the surface is an effective
and important
factor
to control
the rise in the temperature
during
construction.
The minimum
elapsed
time
between
placing
of successive
lifts
in any
block
is usually
restricted
to 72 hours, but temperature
studies
should
be made to relate heat loss or heat gain to the placement
lift heights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The

after placement

the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.4
During

months
the
ambient
temperature
is very high and, as such, heat gain from
the atmosphere
is also high.
This
may be reduced
by continuous
curing
of the concrete
by sprinklers
using river water,
after concrete
has set.
In such a
case,

PLANT

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-1
The capacity
of refrigeration
plant can be designed
so as to constitute
all cooling
media into one material
such as production
of ice or can be divided
into different
cooling
systems
such as production
of ice, chilled
water
and/or
chilled
air according
to requirements
of heat balance.
Use of ice is one of the basic
methods
to lower
the concrete
placement
temperature.
Refrigeration
capacity
of plant is worked
out in terms
of ice
equivalent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-2
EXAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is proposed
to cool
coarse
aggregate
(CA) having
temperature
of 32.22°C
to 26.67°C
using
river
water
at a temperature
of 26.67”C,
then further
cooling
to 21.11 ‘C by chilled
water
having
temperature
of O“C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Following
data
has been
used for estimating
the refrigeration

of the plant:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specific

<<PARAGRAPH>>Heat
required
to be extracted
from
CA to lower
the temperature
from
26.67°C
to 21.11 ‘C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>= Wt of CA x Sp heat of CA x Temperature

<<PARAGRAPH>>Therefore,

<<PARAGRAPH>>Since
it would

it
is
