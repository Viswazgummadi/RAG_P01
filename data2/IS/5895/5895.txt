Roller pitch<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.4.1
A minimum
of full
3-roller
contact between
rollers and base of rigid flat based load shall
be ensured.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4.2
At
loading
points,
roller pitch may be reduced or special rollers provided
to accommodate
shock loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4.3
Flexible
loads
such
as thin
cardboard
cartons
may
need -a reduced
pitch
of rolleror
required wheel conveyors
to prevent sagging.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4.4
Projections
below running
surfaces (such
as binding
wire, straps, seam), impair
the
free
travel of the load and might impose the full load weight
on each individual
roller.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4.5
Giving
due considerations
to requirements
specified
in 3.2.4.1
to 3.2.4.4
the roller pitch
in millimetres
shall be selected from the following
recommended
pitches,
depending
on the diameter
of the roller and the dimensions
of the load:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>37’5, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4.6
The pitch on the centre line of the bend may not be same as that of the
adjacent
straight
track.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4.7
Subject
to agreement
between
the
user and the supplier
the pitches may also be taken
from an arithmetical
progression
starting
from 50 mm with an arithmetical
ratio of 25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.5
Roller
lengths<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.5.1
Cardboard
cartons,

containers
or flexible

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2i5.2
The polygonal
effect of loads at bends may sometimes
be the controlling
factor
in deter-
mining
the minimum
width
of roller required
(see Appendix
A ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.5.3
The roller lengths shall be selected from the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>100, 125,160,
200, 250,315,400.
500, 630,800,
1 000 and 1 250 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.5.4
Subject to agreement between
the user and the supplier
the length of rollers may also
be
taken
from
arithmetical
progression
starting
from 100 mm with
an arithmetical
ratio of 50 mm.
Rigid
flat based loads can be carried on rollers of width
less than the load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.6.1
For straight
sections
of conveyor,
rollers shall be parallel

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.6.2
Means shall be provided
to prevent rotation
of all roller spindles
except where the
design
provides for rotating
spindles  secured
in the rollers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3-2.8
Bearings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.8.1
Rollers
may be fitted
with
a variety of end bearings,
the most commonly
used  being non-
precision
(uncaged
) ballraces,
several types
of which
include
external
seats.
Other
end
bearings
incorporate
oil
impregnated
or nylon bushes.
End bearings are constructed
from : (a) pressed plated,
(b) machined
plated retained
in pressed plate enclosures,
or (c) solid bar machinings.
Components
are
hardened
where necessary and although
the majority
have a natural finish,
anticorrosion
protection
can
be applied where the duty warrants
this.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.8.2
The diameter
of roller
and spindle
is normally
related to the safe load capacity
although
this can be affected by operational
conditions.
The selection
of the most suitable
type of bearing
to
fit
a particular
size of roller enabling
it to fulfil
a specific function
is best left to the manufacturer
and
for this purpose detailed
knowledge
of the application
is essential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>EX’PLANATORY
NOTE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard deals with
unpowered
roller conveyors
for moving work.
They
consist
of cylindri-
cal or tapered rollers mounted
in a fabricated
frame.
The
rollers
are free
to revolve
in the frame.
These
conveyors
are not suitable
for moving
fragile work.
The main purpose of this type of conveyor
is to reduce the manual effort associated
with
the movement
of heavy work
pieces.
In gravity
roller
conveyors,
in which case the conveyor
is at an inclination
work pieces are moved along
the conveyors
by gravity.
The work pieces less than 5 kg in weight
require a gradient
of 3 or more, while
2” is usually
sufficient
for work pieces exceeding
5 kg in weight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
was
first
published
in 1970’and
is revised to take into account the technological
advances made in the field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard considerable
assistance has been derived from BS : 2567-1972
‘Specification
for steel
non-powered
roller conveyors,’
issued by British
Standards
Institute
and JIS’
B : 8804-1976
