<<HEADING level=3>>1. Scope-
Prescribes
electrometric
and coiorimetric
methods
for the determination
of  pH value.
Both methods
are applicable
to ail types of water and waste water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  Electrometric
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Principle
-The
pH value is determined
by measurement
of the electromotive
force of a cejj
consisting
of an indicator
electrode
( an electrode
responsive
to hydrogen
ions such as a gias
electrode)
immersed
in the
test
solution
and a reference
electrode
(usually
mercury/calome
electrode),
Contact
between the test solution
and the reference
electrode
is usually
achieved
b
means of a liquid junction,
which forms part of the reference
electrode.
The electromotive
force
j
measured
with a pH meter, that is, a high impedence
voltmeter
calibrated
in terms of pH.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1 Several
types of electrodes
have
been suggested
for electrometric
determination
of pj
value.
Although
the
hydrogen
gas electrode
is recognised
as primary
standard
the
glas:
electrode
in combination
with caiomei
electrode
is generally
used with
reference
potential
provjdec
by saturated
calomel
electrode.
The
glass
electrode
system
is based on the fact that a  chang,
of
1  pii  unit produces
an electrical
change of 59’1 mV
at 25°C.
The active element
of a glas!
electrode
is a membrane
of a special
glass.
The membrane
forms a partition
between
two liqujd!
of differing
hydrogen
ion concentration
and  a  potential
is produced
between the two sides of the
membrane
which is proportional
to the difference
in pH between the liquids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Interference<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1
Above
pH value of 10, high sodium concentrations
interfere
with the measurement.
Correc
tions
for the sodium
error may
be made
by consulting
the chart supplied
by the manufacturer
o
pjectrodes
being used.
Sodium
errors at pH value levels greater
than 10 can be reduced
or eljmj<
nated by using a low sodium error electrode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2 Oij and grease may interfere
by coating
the pH electrode
and causing
a sluggish
response
rhese coatings
can usually
be removed by gentle wiping
or detergent
washing,
followed
by distljlec
tvater rinsing.
An
additional
treatment
with
hydrochloric
acid (1 percent)
may be necessary

‘emove any remaining
film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3 Temperature
affects the pH Values in two WaYe. The first is covered by the change
in ejec.
:rode output at various
temperatures.
This interference
can be controlled
with instruments
having
emperature
compensation
or by calibrating
the electrode-instrument
system
at the temperature
,f the samples.
The second source is the change
of pH inherent
in the sample
at various
tempe.
‘atures.
This error is sample-dependent
and cannot
be controlled.

be reported.

adjust it accordingly.
Rinse and gently wipe the electrodes
with solution.
If field measurements are being made, the
electrodes may be immersed directly
in the sample stream to an adequate depth and moved in a
manner to ensure sufficient sample movement across the electrode sensing element as indicated
by drift free readings.
( < 0’1 pH unit ).
If necessary, Immerse them into the sample beaker  or
sample stream and stir at a constant rate to provide homogenity and suspension of solids.
Rate of
stirring
should minimize the air transfer
rate at the air-water interface of the sample.
Note and
record sample pH and temperature
However,  if there
is a continuous
drift, take a second
reading
with the fresh aliquot of sample without stirring and report it as  thepH value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pH value is the logrithm
of reciprocal
of hydrogen
ion activity
in moles
per iitre.
In water
solution,
variations
in pH value from 7 are mainly
due to hydrolysis
of salts of strong
bases and
weak acids or  vice
verse.
Dissolved
gases such as carbon dioxide,
hydrogen
sulphide
and ammonia
also affect pH value of water.
The overall pH value range
of natural
water
is generally
between
6
and 8.
In case of alkaline
thermal
spring
waters
pH value
may be more than 9 while
for acidic
thermal
spring
waters
the pH may be 4 or even less than 4.
Industrial
wastes
may be strongly
acidic or basic and their effect on pH value of receiving
water depends
on the buffering
capacity
OY
water.
The pH value obtained
in the laboratory
may not be the same as that of water at the time of
collection
of samples
due to loss-or
absorption
of gases,
reactions
with sediments,
hydrolysis
and
oxidation
or reduction
taking
place
within
the
sample
bottle.
pH value
should
preferably
be
determined
at the time of collection
of sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pH value
may be determined
either
electrometrically
or calorimetrically.
The electro-
metric method is more accur&e
but requires
special
apparatus.
The calorimetric
method
is simple
and requires
less expensive
apparatus,
and is sufficiently
accurate for general work.
It is, however,
subject to interference
by colour,
turbidity,
high saline
content,
free chlorine and various oxidants
and reductants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
