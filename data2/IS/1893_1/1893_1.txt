<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Part 1 ) ( Fifth Revision)
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, afler the
draft finalized by the Earthquake Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Himalayan-Nagalushai region, Indo-GangeticPlain, Western India, Kutch and Kathiawarregions are geologically
unstable parts of the country, and some devastating earthquakes of the world have occurred there.
A  major
part of the peninsular
India has also been visited by strong earthquakes,
but these were relatively few in
number occurring at much larger time intervals at any site, and had considerably lesser intensity. The earth@ake
resistant design of structures taking into account seismic data from studies of these Indian earthquakes has
become very essential, particularly
in view of the intense construction
activity all over the country.
It is to
serve this purpose that IS 1893 : 1962 ‘Recommendations for earthquake resistant design of structures’ was
published and revised first time in 1966.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a result of additional seismic data collected in India and further knowledge and experience gained since
the publication of the first revision of this standard, the sectional committee felt the need to revise the standard
again incorporating many changes, such as revision of maps showing seismic zones and epicentres, and adding
a more rational approach for design of buildings and sub-structures
of bridges.
These were covered in the
second revision of 1S 1893 brought out in 1970.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a result of the increased use of the standard, considerable amount of suggestions were received for modifying
some of the provisions of the standard and, therefore, third revision of the standard was brought out in 1975.
The following changes were incorporated in the third revision:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The standard incorporated seismic zone factors (previously given as multiplying factors in the second
revision ) on a more rational basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Importance
factors were introduced to account for the varying degrees of importance for various
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the clauses for design of multi-storeyed buildings, the coefficient of flexibility was given in the
form of a curve with respect to period of buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A more rational formula was used to combine modal shear forces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>New clauses were introduced for determination
of hydrodynamic pressures in elevated tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Clauses on concrete and masonry dams were modified, taking into account their dynamic behavionr
during earthquakes. Simplified formulae for design forces were introduced based on results of extensive
studies carried out since second revision of the standard was published.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fourth revision, brought out in 1984, was prepared to modifi some of the provisions of the standard as a
result of experience gained with the use ofthe standard. In this revision, a number of important basic modifications
with respect to load factors, field values of N, base shear and modal analysis were introduced.
A new concept
of performance
factor depending on the structural framing system and on the ductility of construction
was
incorporated. Figure 2 for average acceleration spectra was also modified and a curve for zero percent damping
incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 1893( Part 1 ) :2002<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the fifth revision, with a view to keep abreast with the rapid development and extensive research that has
been carried out in the field of earthquake resistant design of various structures, the committee has decided
to cover the provisions for different types of structures in separate parts. Hence, IS 1893 has been split into
the following five parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1 General provisions and buildings<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 2 Liquid retaining tanks — Elevated and ground supported<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 3 Bridges and retaining walls<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 4 Industrial structures including stack like structures<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 5 Dams and embankments<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1 contains provisions that are general in nature and applicable to all structures. Also, it contains provisions
that are specific to buildings only. Unless stated otherwise, the provisions in Parts 2 to 5 shall be read necessarily
in conjunction with the general provisions in Part 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Pending
finalization
of Parts 2 to 5 of IS 1893, provisions
of Part
1 will be read along with the relevant
clauses of IS 1893 : 1984 for structures
other than buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following are the major and important moditlcations made in the fifth revision:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The seismic zone map is revised with only four zones, instead of five. Erstwhile Zone I has been
merged to Zone 11. Hence, Zone I does not appear in the new zoning; only Zones II, 111,IV and V do.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The values of seismic zone factors have been changed; these now reflect more realistic values of
effective peak ground acceleration considering Maximum Considered Earthquake ( MCE ) and service
life of structure in each seismic zone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Response spectra are now specified for three types of founding strata, namely rock and hard soil,
medium soil and soft soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Empirical expression for estimating the fundamental natural period  Ta of multi-storeyed
buildings
with regular moment resisting frames has been revised.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This revision adopts the procedure of first calculating the actual force that maybe experienced by
the structure during the probable maximum earthquake, if it were to remain elastic. Then, the concept
of response reduction due to ductile deformation
or frictional
energy dissipation
in the cracks is
brought into the code explicitly, by introducing the ‘response reduction factor’ in place of the earlier
performance factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A lower bound is specified for the design base shear of buildings, based on empirical estimate of the
fimdarnental natural period  Ta.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The soil-foundation
system factor is dropped.
Instead, a clause is introduced to restrict the use of
foundations vulnerable to differential settlements in severe seismic zones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>@<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Torsional eccentricity values have been revised upwards in view of serious darnages observed in
buildings with irregular plans.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Modal combination
rule in dynamic analysis of buildings has been revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>J)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other clauses have been redrafted where necessary for more effective implementation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is not intended in this standard to lay down regulation so that no structure shall suffer any damage during
earthquake of all magnitudes.
It has been endeavored
to ensure that, as far as possible, structures are able
to respond, without structural darnage to shocks of moderate intensities and without total collapse to shocks
of heavy intensities.
While this standard is intended for the earthquake resistant design of normal structures,
it has to be emphasized that in the case of special structures, such as large and tall dams, long-span bridges,
major industrial projects, etc, site-specific detailed investigation should be undertaken, unless otherwise specified
in the relevant clauses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_4>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 1893( Part 1 ): 2002<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Though the basis for the design of different types of structures is covered in this standard, it is not implied
that detailed dynamic analysis should be made in every case. In highly seismic areas, construction
of a type
which entails hea~y debris and consequent loss of life and property, such as masonry, particularly mud masonry
and rubble masonry, should preferably be avoided. For guidance on precautions to be observed in the construction
of buildings, reference maybe made to IS 4326, IS 13827 and IS 13828.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Earthquake
can cause damage not only on account of the shaking which results from them but also due to
other chain effects like landslides, floods, fires and disruption to communication. It is, therefore, important to
take necessary precautions in the siting, planning and design of structures so that they are safe against such
secondary effects also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Sectional Committee has appreciated that there cannot bean entirely scientific basis for zoning in view
of the scanty data available.
Though the magnitudes of different
earthquakes which have occurred in the
past are known to a reasonable degree of accuracy, the intensities of the shocks caused by these earthquakes
have so far been mostly estimated by damage surveys and there is little instrumental
evidence to corroborate
the conclusions arrived at. Maximum intensity at different places can be fixed on a scale only on the basis of
the observations made and recorded after the earthquake and thus a zoning map which is based on the maximum
intensities arrived at, is likely to lead in some cases to an incorrect conclusion in view of(a) incorrectness in
the assessment of intensities,
(b) human error in judgment during the damage survey, and (c) variation in
quality and design of structures causing variation in type and extent of damage to the structures for the same
intensity of shock. The Sectional Committee has therefore, considered that a rational approach to the problem
would be to arrive at a zoning map based on known magnitudes and the known epicentres ( see Annex A )
assuming all other conditions as being average and to modifi such an idealized isoseismal map in light of
tectonics ( see Annex B ), lithology ( see Annex C ) and the maximum intensities as recorded from damage
surveys. The Committee has also reviewed such a map in the light of the past history and future possibilities
and also attempted to draw the lines demarcating
the different zones so as to be clear of important
towns,
cities and industrial areas, after making special examination of such cases, as a little modification in the zonal
demarcations may mean considerable difference to the economics of a project in that area. Maps shown in
Fig. 1 and Annexes A, B and C are prepared based on information available upto 1993.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the seismic zoning map, Zone I and II of the contemporary map have been merged and assigned the level
of Zone 11. The Killari area has been included in Zone III and necessary modifications made, keeping in view
the probabilistic hazard evaluation.
The Bellary isolated zone has been removed. The parts of eastern coast
areas have shown similar hazard to that of the Killari area, the level of Zone II has been enhanced to Zone III
and connected with Zone III of Godawari Graben area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The seismic hazard level with respect to ZPA at 50 percent risk level and 100 years service life goes on
progressively increasing from southern peninsular portion to the Himalayan main seismic source, the revised
seismic zoning map has given status of Zone III to Narmada Tectonic Domain, Mahanandi Graben and Godawari
Graben. This is a logical normalization keeping in view the apprehended higher strain rates in these domains
on geological consideration
of higher neotectonic activity recorded in these areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is particularly
drawn to the fact that the intensity of shock due to an earthquake could vary locally
at anyplace due to variation in soil conditions. Earthquake response of systems would be affected by different
types of foundation system in addition to variation of ground motion due to various types of  soils.
Considering
the effects in a gross manner, the standard gives guidelines for arriving at design seismic coet%cients based
on stiffness of base soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important to note that the seismic coefficient, used in the design of any structure, is dependent on nany
variable factors and it is an extremely difficult task to determine the exact seismic coefficient in each given
case. It is, therefore, necessa~
to indicate broadly the seismic coefficients that could generally be adopted
in different parts or zones of the country though, of course, a rigorous analysis considering
all the factors
involved has to be made in the case of all important projects in order to arrive at a suitable seismic coeftlcients
for design. The Sectional Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard has attempted to include
a seismic zoning map (see Fig. 1) for this purpose. The object of this map is to classifi the area of the country
into a number of zones in which one may reasonably expect earthquake shaking of more or less same maximum
intensity in future. The Intensity as per Comprehensive Intensity Scale ( MSK64 ) ( see Annex D ) broadly
associated with the various zones is VI ( or less ), VII, VIII and IX ( and above ) for Zones II, III, IV and V
respectively.
The maximum seismic ground acceleration in each zone cannot be presently predicted with<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>accuracy either on a deterministic
or on a probabilistic
basis.
The basic zone factors included herein are
reasonable estimates of effective peak ground
accelerations for the design of various structures covered in
this standard. Zone factors for some important towns are given in Annex E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Base isolation and energy absorbing devices may be used for earthquake
resistant design. Only standard
devices having detailed experimental data on the performance should be used. The designer must demonstrate
by detailed analyses that these devices provide sufficient protection to the buildings and equipment as envisaged
in this standard. Performance of locally assembled isolation and energy absorbing devices should be evaluated
experimentally before they are used in practice. Design of buildings and equipment using such device should
be reviewed by the competent authority.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Base isolation systems are found usefhl for short period structures, say less than 0.7s including soil-structure
interaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard, due weightage has been given to international
coordination
among the
standards and practices prevailing in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country. Assistance has particularly
been derived from the following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6 GENERAL PRINCIPLES
AND DESIGN
CRITERIA<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In steel structures, members and their connections
shouldbe soproportioned that high ductility is obtain~
tide SP 6 ( Part 6 ), avoiding premature failure due to
elastic or inelastic buckling of any type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 General
Principles<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1
Ground
Motion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The characteristics ( intensity, duratio~ etc ) of seismic
ground vibrations expected at any location depends
upon the magnitude of earthquake, its depth of focus,
distance from the epicentre, characteristics of the path
through which the seismic waves travel, and the soil
strata on which the structure
stands. The random
earthquake ground motions, which cause the structure
to vibrate,
can be resolved in any three mutually
perpendicular directions. The predominant direction
of ground vibration is usually horizontal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specified earthquake loads are based upon post-
elastic energy dissipation in the structure and because
of this fact, the provision of this standard for design,
detailing and construction shall be satisfied even for
structures and members for which load combinations
that do not contain the earthquake effect indicate larger
demands than combinations including earthquake.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.4
Soil-Structure
Interaction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The soil-structure interaction refers to the effects of
the supporting foundation medium on the motion of
structure.
The soil-structure
interaction may not be
considered
in the seismic analysis for structures
supported on rock or rock-like material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Earthquake-generated
vertical inertia forces are to be
considered in design unless checked and proven by
specimen calculations to be not significant. Vertical
acceleration should be considered in structures with
large spans, those in which stability is a criterion for
design, or for overall stability analysis of structures.
Reduction in gravity force due to vertical component
of ground motions can be particularly detrimental in
cases of prestressed
horizontal
members
and of
cantilevered members. Hence, special attention should
be paid to the effect ofvertical component of the ground
motion on prestressed or cantilevered beams, girders
and slabs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.5 The design lateral force specified in this standard
shall be considered in each of the two orthogonal
horizontal directions of the structure. For structures
which have lateral force resisting elements in the two
orthogonal directions only, the design lateral force
shall be considered along one direction at a time, and
not in both directions
simultaneously.
Structures,
having lateral force resisting elements (for example
frames, shear walls ) in directions other than the two
orthogonal directions, shall be analysed considering
the load combinations specified in 6.3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2 The response of a structure to ground vibrations
is a fimction of the nature of foundation soil; materials,
form, size and mode of construction
of structures;
and the duration and characteristics of ground motion.
This standard specifies design forces for structures
standing on rocks or soils which do not settle, liquefi
or slide due to loss of strength during ground vibrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where both horizontal and vertical seismic forces are
taken
into account,
load combinations
specified
in 6.3.3 shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.6
Equipment
and other
systems,
which
are
supported at various floor levels of the structure, will
be subjected to motions corresponding
to vibration
at their support points. In important cases, it may be
necessary to obtain floor response spectra for design
of equipment supports. For detail reference be made
to IS 1893 (Part 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3 The design approach adopted in this standard
is to ensure that structures possess at least a minimum
strength to withstand minor earthquakes ( <DBE ),
which
occur frequently,
without
damage;
resist
moderate earthquakes
( DBE ) without significant
structural damage though some non-structural damage
may OCCUEand aims that structures withstand a major
earthquake ( MCE ) without collapse, Actual forces
that appear on structures during earthquakes are much
greater than the design forces speciiled in this standard.
However, ductility, arising from inelastic material
behaviourand detailing, and overstrength, arising from
the additional reserve strength in structures over and
above the design strength, are relied upon to account<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.7  Additions

Structures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Additions shall be made to existing structures only
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
