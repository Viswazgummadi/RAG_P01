<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Sixth Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized by the Sanitary Appliances and Water Fittings Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1956. The first, second, third, fourth and fifth revisions were issued
in 1961, 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1978 respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision, the following major modifications
have been effected:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various terms used in this standard have been broadly
aligned with IS0 4064 ( Part  1 ) :  1977
and EEC Council Directive.
Indicating
devices for reading the volume
of water
have
been elaborated
in three
types
I
namely with pointers,
digital andcombination
of the two.
Depending
upon the metrological
characteristics,
Class A and Class B water meters have been
introduced,
based on IS0 4064 ( Part 1 ) and EEC Council
Directive.
An additional
class,
namely Class ‘0’ ( ordinary
) has been added to serve the existing
needs of the water
meter
industry.
This class ( class 0 ) shall stand withdrawn after a period of 3 years from
the date
of printing of this standard.
4  Type B water meter made with ferrous metal has been withdrawn.
e)  Pressure loss requirement
has been made stringent in line with EEC Council Directive.
f 1  Overall lengths of the meters have been specified both with nipples and without nipples.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard,
considerable
assistance has been derived from the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) IS0 4064/l  :  1977 Measurement
of water flow in closed conduits -
Meters for cold potable
water: Part  I  Specification,
issued by International
Organization
for Standardization.
b) European Communities
Council Directive 75/33/EEC of December
1974 on the approximation
of the laws of the
member
states
relating
to cold-water
meters, issued by the Council of
European
Communities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the technical
committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard
is given
in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off  numerical
values (  revised )‘.  The number of signi-
ficant places retained in the rounded  off  value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

A list of materials
recommended
for manufacture
of
body and component
parts of water meters is given in
Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.1 Where so required for dry-type water meters, the
transparent window covering the dial shall be provided
with a wiper on the inner side for wiping off condensed
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The  meter casing shall be fitted in the pipe line by
means of two cylindrical
nipples or tail pieces with
connecting
nuts which shall be provided
with each
meter. The threads on the connection
shall conform to
IS 2643 (Parts 1 to 3 )  :  1975.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>6.1.1 Plastics used in the manufacture
of various com-
ponents listed at Annex B shall also meet the following
requirements:

of elongation
see A-7 of IS 2267  :  1972 ).
Water absorption
on immersion
for 24 h should
not exceed 0.6 percent by weight (for procedure
of determination
of water absorption see B-7 of

except in the case of
single jet inferential
type of meters. The free area of
holes shall be such that it complies with the headloss at
nominal and maximum flow rates. However, in the case
of meters provided
with internal
strainer
involving
opening of the registration
box for cleaning,
an addi-
tional external strainer shall be fitted on the inlet side
satisfying the above requirements.

<<PARAGRAPH>>Where meters may be subjected to an accidental rever-
sal of flow they must be capable of withstanding
it
without any deterioration
or change of their tnetrologi-
