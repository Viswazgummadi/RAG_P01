<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Waterproofing
and Damp-Proofing
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lime concrete,
apart
from
its use as a structural
material
in several situations
in building
construction,
is also used for a waterproofed
roof
finish.
The
introduction
of pozzolanic
materials,
such as burnt brick pozzolana
in lime concrete
and compaction
to  maximum density
enhances
the waterproofing
effect. This
standard
is intended to provide guidance with respect
to preparation
and use of the lime concrete
for waterproofing
of roofs on the basis of existing
knowledge and experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1965 and revised in 1980. Since then a number
of standards
referred
in this standard
have been revised
necessitating
the need of this second revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision following modifications
have been done:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials
used for
lime concrete
have, been
specified
as per
latest version of the
relevant
Indian Standard.
Preparation
of lime concrete
has been elaborated
to bring it in line with IS 2541  :  1991
Code of practice for preparation
and use of lime concrete.
Recommendation
for roof finish for extreme c!imatic condition
has been added.
All other references
.have been updated..for
the benefit of the user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
ofI numerical
values
( revised).’
The
number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value
should be the same that
of the

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1  Hand Mixing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1.1
Mixing shall be done on a clean
water
tight
platform
of sufficient
size
to
provide
ample mixing
area. The
platform
shall have
tight close joints so that there is no leakage of
water or mortar
through them and mixing
tool
does not strike the joints while in operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the roof is fat, slope not less than 1 in 60
shall be given.
However,
in
case
of
heavy
rainfall area slope of 1 in 40 is recommended.
The
minimum
compacted
thickness
of the
concrete
layer shah, however, be nowhere
less
than 50 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1.2 Coarse
aggregate
and lime-pozzolana
mortar
in the proportion
of 2&  :  1 parts
by
volume shall be used. Coarse aggregate
shall be
slaked to an even surface on the platform
and
lime pozzolana mortar prepared as per 6.1 shall
then be evenly spread over the aggregate
and
the
whole
thoroughly
mixed
water
in just
sufficient
quantity
shall
be applied
with
a
sprinkler, to enable
the mortar
to adhere
to
each piece of
aggregate.
The mixing
shall be
done by turning it over and over several
times,
until all the particles
of aggregate
are covered
with
mortar
and
a
concrete
of
uniform
appearance
and consistency
is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3  After the lime concrete
is laid, it shall be
initially rammed with a rammer
weighing
not
more than 2 kg and the finish
brought
to the
required
evenness
and
slope.
Alternately
bamboo
strips
may
be used
for
the
initial
ramming. Further
consolidation
shall
be done
using wooden
THAPIES
with rounded
edges.
The workmen will sit close together,
and beat
the
surface
lightly
and in rhythm
and move
forward gradually.
The beating
will normally
have to be carried on for at least
seven
days
until the THAPI makes no impression
on the
surface
and rebounds
readily
from
it when
struck.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2  Machine Mixing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two and a half parts by volume of clean saturated
surface dry coarse
aggregate
shall first be fed
into the mixer and then one part
by volume of
lime. Pozzolana
mortar as per 6.1 shall then be
added to the mixer and the content
mixed well.
Mixing
shall
be
continued
until
there
is a
uniform
distribution
of
the
material.
Final
adjustment
of water,
to obtain
concrete
of
required
consistency
may be made by adding
clean
water,
if necessary,
and turning
the
ingredients
in the mixer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The ramming
and
compacting
of
lime
concrete
may also
be done
by a tamping
machine
which
has
been
developed
by
Central
Building
Research
Institute,
Roorkee
and
is commercially
available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1  If
the
surface
during
the
process
of
compaction
becomes
too uneven that
water
lodges in pools, the surface shall be pricked
up
and fresh lime concrete
spread and consolidated
as is necessary
so as to ensure proper
slopes
and levels are being maintained
with adequate
bonding
between
old
and
new
concrete
by
sprinkling
requisite
quantity
of
lime
water
(  1  part of putty and 3 to 4 parts of water ) with
any of the solution prepared
under 7.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Lime concrete
may also
be prepared
by
mixing the aggregate
inclusive
of brick dust obtai-
ned during
breakicg
with slaked
lime in the same
proportions
by volume
as in 6.3.2.
The aggregate
shall
be thoroughly
soaked
before
use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 The lime concrete
shall be used in the work
within
36 hours
of the preparation
of lime
mortar if burnt clay pozzolana
is incorporated
( see IS 2541  :  1974 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.2  Special care shall
be taken
to properly
consolidate
the concrete
at
its junction
with
the parapet
wall.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Addition
of 12 kg of washing
soap
and 4
kg of alum in each cubic metre
of lime
concrete
dissolved
in water
will improve
the
waterproofing
quality
of the lime concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3  During compaction
by hand-beating
the
surface shall be sprinkled
liberally
with lime
water
( 1 Part
of putty
and 3 to 4 parts of
water ) and small proportion
of sugar solution
( see Note 1 ) or a solution prepared by soaking
in water the
dry nuts
of Terminalia
chebula
( see Note 2 ) for
obtaining
improved
water-
proofing of the
concrete.
On completion
of
beating, the mortar that comes on the top shall
be
smoothened
with
a trowel
or float,
if
necessary,
with the addition
of sugar

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1  The sugar solution
is
prepared
in
the
northern
parts
of
the country
by mixing
about
3 kg
of
jaggery
and
14 kg of BAEL fruit to 100 litres
of
water by boiling.
2 The solution
of Terminalia
chebula
( KADUKAI
)
may be prepared
as follows:
The dry nuts shall
be broken
to
small
pieces
and allowed
to soak
in
water.
The
general
practice
is to
have
a proportion
600 g
of
KADUKAI,
200 g of jaggsry
and
40 litres
of
water for IO rn2 work. This solution
is brewed
for 12 to 24 hours.
The
resulting
liquor
is
decanted
and used for the work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 FINISH<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1
In  case of accessible
roof finish
one layer
of burnt clay flat terracing
tiles [ see IS 2690
Part 1 )  :  1975 and IS
2690
(  Part
2 )  :  1975 ]
may be laid over a thin layer
of lime mortar.
However, in the extreme condition
where there
is considerable
expansion
and contraction,
two
layers of tiles may be put on the
top of lime
pozzolana
concrete.
The tiles should be joined
with non-shrinking
impervious mortar by adding
suitable integral waterproofing
admixtures
or 5
percent
used engine
oil by weight of cement
and finished
neat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 In  some
areas,
METHI,
jaggery
and
hemp
are
added while preparing
and laying
lime concrete.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 Curing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lime concrete
after
compaction
shall be
cured
for a minimum of
10 days or
until it
hardens by covering
with a thin
layer
of grass
or straw which shall be kept wet continuously.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 The protection
against
water
penetration
for the
roof
finish
is enhanced
by efficient
drainage of surface
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5  Treatment
of Junction

and tile finish
shall
not be
less than 1 in 60 and the slope
in the
case of
plain lime concrete
finish shall not be less than
1 in 50.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All  along the junction
of the roof surface
with
the masonry of the parapet wall, a strip of lime
