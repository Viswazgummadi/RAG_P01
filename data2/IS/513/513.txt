<<PARAGRAPH>>Wrought Steel Products Sectional Committee, MTD 4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Fourth Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft
finalized by the Wrought
Steel Products Sectional Committee
had been
approved
by
the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1954 and subsequently
revised in 1963, 1973 and 1986.
While
reviewing the standard in the light of experience gained during these years,
the committee decided
to revise it toalign with the present practices being followed by the Indian Industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision the following changes have been made:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) Mechanical and bend test requirements
have been modified,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii) Dimensions and dimensional
tolerances have been modified, and
iii) Test for stabilization
has been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While considering the revision a proposal came up for discussion
to incorporate
the values for the
plastic anisotropy
( t > and for strain
hardening
exponent
( n ) for guidance,
as an additional
useful
parameters
for the assessment of the utilization
properties.
However,
the committee
was.
of the opinion that sufficient proof of evidence,and
experience
to confirm the reliability
of the r
and
n values
as parameters
for certain utilization
spheres of the product is still lacking.
The.
inclusion of such a recommendation
in the standard has, therefore,
been deferred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steel sheets and strips conforming
to this standard are of weldable quality and are suitable both for
fusion welding and resistance welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cold roped steel sheets and strips are available in a variety of types and finishes.
In order to assist
the
manufacturers,
it is recommended
to the purchaser to indicate on the enquiry or order the
purpose for which the material is to be used.
A drawing of the part in question would be useful.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where the manufacturer
guarantees that the ‘steel sheets or strips are
suitable to make a
particular part or for a given purpose’, the steel should not be subject
to rejection
if there
are
minor
variations
from the specified
chemical composition
and/or
mechanical properties
for that
steel.
In such cases the purchaser when ordering the steel shall add the words ‘suitable for making
the part’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If mutually agreed to between the manufacturer
and the purchaser,
material
may be  supplied
only
on a guarantee of performance,
in  which case the rejection rate during processing
and attributable
to the quality of the material shall not exceed a mutually agreed limit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard assistance has been derived from BS 1449 ( Part 1 )  : 1983 ‘Steel
plate, sheet and strip; Part 1 Specification for carbon and carbon-manganese
plate, sheet and  strip’,
issued by the British Standards
Institution
and DIN
1623 ( Part 1 ) ‘Steel
flat
products,
cold
rolled steel sheet and strip, technical delivery conditions,
mild unalloyed
steels for cold  forming’,
issued by DIN, Germany.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with the-
tinal value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test
or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off
in accordance
with
IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical values (  revised )‘. The
number of significant pli;ces retained in the rounded off value should be the  same as that  of the.
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
