<<PARAGRAPH>>Planning Bye-Laws and Dimensional Co-ordination
Sectional Committee, CED 10<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 1 ) ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on
25 April 1990 after the draft finalized by the Planning
Bye-Laws and Dimensional
Co-ordination
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the aims of modular
co-ordination
is to provide compatibility
and inter-changeability
of
components.
In earlier
days a practical
system of tolerance was derived as clearance fit, prescribing
minus tolerance on each component
without any allowance to the space in which it is to be placed.
The extensive
use of prefabricated
elements
and components in building construction
have provoked
the concept
of tolerances
in recent years. The concept
of tolerance is indeed a tool td be used for
dimensional control of the component
which can fit without
any problem
for size, squareness,
bow,
plumbness,
posit on and appearance.
In order to ensure clarity and unambiguous expression in
tolerance
principles,
it is necessary to adopt the internationally
agreed
glossary of terms.
This
standard, therefore,
has been prepared
giving the definitions of these terms which are specially used
in relation to principles and applications of tolerances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was originally published as IS 6408  :  1971 ‘Recommendations
for modular co-ordination:
Application of tolerances in building industry’,
In the usage of this standard, a need was felt to cover
the terminology in a comprehensive manner in addition to effecting the other technical changes deemed
necessary
on the basis of the experience
gained over the years.
As a result the standard is being
bifurcated into two parts as follows:
Part  I  Glossary of terms, and
Part 2 Principles and applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This, the first part provides a glossary of terms applicable to principles and applications of tolerances
for modular co-ordination
in building industry.
The definitions
of general terms relating to modular
co-ordination
are covered in IS 4993 : 1983 ‘Glossary
of terms relating to modular co-ordination
(  second revision )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>tn the preparation
of this standard due weightage has been given to international co-ordination
among
the standards and practices prevailing in different countries
in addition to relating it to the pratices in
the field in this country.
This has been met by deriving assistance from the following documents:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
