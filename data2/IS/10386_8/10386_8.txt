<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety in Construction, Operation and Maintenance of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee, RVD 21<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Safety
in Construction,
Operation and Maintenance of River Valley Frojects Sectional Committee had been
approved by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The job of excavation for foundation and seating of structures such as  concrete and masomy dams,
barrages and power houses, stripping of ground, excavation for cut off trenches for earth and rockfill
embankments, excavation for canals and approach and exit channels, etc, forms the first and foremost
major activity in the construction of the above-mentioned
structures. Normally excavation is carried out
( depending on the type of-structure and depth of excavation ) in different kinds of strata, excavation in
soil, excavation in soft rock, excavation in bouldery strata and excavation in hard rock (where necessary).
It is essential that the excavated slopes which are to be backfilled later need to be stable during the
construction period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The slopes which are exposed have to -be stable during construction periods and also during life of the
structure. Where blasting operations are resorted to necessary precautions need to be taken for the safety
of the men and machinery as well as for the structure. This standard lays down requirements that should
be followed with regard to safety aspects during open excavation work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The recommendations
made in this standard are for general guidance and may need modification
depending upon individual site conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised ).’ The  number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value~in this-standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6 Reference should also be made to IS 10386
( Part 1)  :  1983 and IS 10386 ( Part 2 )  :  1982.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard lays down requirements
for the
safety aspects to be taken during excavation for
structures
like dams, barrages,
power houses,
canals, channels
and such other structures
as-
sociated with river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 INVESTIGATION DATA<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4~1 Before proceeding with the workof excavation,
sufficient knowledge of’sub-surface strata is-essen-
tial.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The nature, location and depths of various
zones of sub-surface
like over burden,
soft/
weathered rock, and hard rock, seams/faults and
joint patterns in rockstrata, water tables etc, should
be available prior to excavation work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian
Standards
listed
in Annex A are
necessary adjuncts to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 GENERAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The matter of safety and accident prevention is
the responsibility of every person employed on the
job. All persons need to be alert to dangerous
conditions and to take necessary precautions
for
their own safety as well as that of others working at
site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The physical and engineering properties of the
over burden material should also be determined
well in advance of the excavation work if the depth
of over burden is 10 m and above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 DESIGN DATA<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally the work is done outdoors. Workmen are
exposed to hazardous conditions of heat and cold,
rain, wind and movement
of heavy machinery.
Hence safety measures required to be taken assume
greater significance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Design details like probable foundation level
or bed levels._in case of approach and exit channels,
as well as design cross-sections
of the structure
under construction
should be made ready before
commencement
of the excavation work. Various
excavation slopes and benches/berms
and conse-
quently top width of the excavation required to
commence
the work should
also be fmed in
advance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The safety requirement
during excavation for
any structure
may vary according to the type of
structure, type of strata encountered
and number
of men and type of machinery deployed at site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Proper education and organization
is neces-
sary for safety requirements
to be implemented in
a proper manner. The workmen are required to be
made aware of the importance
of observing the
safety rules.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 EXCAVATION SLOPES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Excavationslopes
adopted in the field should
be safe against sliding or slip during the entire
period of construction so they do not endanger the
safety of men and machinery, as alsothe structure
under construction, adjacent to the area of excava-
tion. This is essential as the construction
of river
valley projects continues over years, during which
time many normal and abnormal monsoons and
other
hazardous
field
conditions
may
be
encountered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 The contractor
carrying out the work should
employ a safety engineer/manager
who should be
familiar with all potential hazards on the job and
whose duty would be to educate the workmen as
well as to supervise installation and maintenance of
safety equipment,
first aid stations,
machinery
guards and other safeguards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 For general guidance, the following slopes may
be adopted for open excavation work up to 10 m
depth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 The shape and slopes adopted for excavation
should be safe over the entire periodof
construc-
tion of the structure barring unforeseen causes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3 Ladders when used should extend for at least
one metre above the top of the cut to provide a hand
hold for stepping on, or off, the ladder. Ladders
should be properly constructed, used, maintained
and periodically
inspected
in accordance
with
IS 3696 ( Part 2 )  :  1991.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9 LIGHTING, WARNING SINGALS ETC<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case the soil overburden depth is 10 m and above
slope stability analysis should be carried out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 Adequate
lighting arrangements
should be
provided in the excavation area for night work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Berms or benches of suitable width should be
provided from consideration of slope stability, ease
of excavation, transportation
of excavated material
etc, depending on the site conditions and require-
ments. The berms should normally be at maximum
vertical intervals of 10 m and width of berms/bench
should_generally be about 3 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 All pathways and roadways in the vicinity of the
excavation area, should be provided with proper
warning signals wherever
necessary,
to ensure
safety of pedestrians and vehicular traffic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At all approaches
and exit points of the site of
excavation, danger and warning signals should be
placed. In risky locations, a flagman with red flag
should be posted to warn the public and approach-
ingvehicles and to guide them in proper directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In special cases where the requirement
of berm
width is impracticable
and/or not felt necessary,
reduced width may be adopted  but  in no case should
it be less than 1.0 m, provided the material being
excavated is sufficiently stable. In all such cases
substantial
toe boards should be provided
to
prevent ‘roll back’ into the excavated trench.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In any bend/crossing of pathways/roadways proper
direction
of the
pathway/roadway
should
be
displayed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 Whenever a workman is required to climb up
or down a excavation slope he should do so with a
safety rope tied securely to a safety belt on his
person so that in case of an emergency he can be
assisted or drawn to safety.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 TOOLS, PLANT AND MACHINERY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Care should be taken to keep tools such as
shovels, pickaxes, etc, far away from the edge of the
trench.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.4 Lone workers should not be permitted to work
in the area of excavation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Heavy machinery deployed during excavation
should be kept away from the excavated sides at a
distance of not less than 6 m when in the idle
condition and also from the road traffic, if any, in
the near vicinity [see also IS 10386 (Part 3)  :  19921.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10 DRILLING AND BLASTING OPERATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1 Whenever
drilling and blasting operations
are involved
in the excavation
process, safety
precautions as laid down in IS 10386 (Part 4)  :  1982
should be strictly followed. During excavation of
rock by blasting, safety of adjacent structures
is
required to be taken care of by adopting controlled
blasting,
presplitting
method,
use of delay
detonators etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 The use of trucks
or wagons and heavy
machinery in and around the excavation trenches
should
be done
under
the supervision
of
experienced foremen or supervisors. Movement of
vehicles and machines should not be permitted
near the lip of the excavation and hence roads,
leading to or from the excavation trenches should
be carefully located. Care should be exercised by the
foreman or supervisor when guiding vehicles for
loading, so that they are not backed into the walls
of the pit. When
loading vehicles
manually,
a
constant watch should be kept for any bend slides
or boulders rolling down the excavated slope.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Loose rock masses or fragments thrown up
during blasting and resting at different levels on
excavated slopes, berms etc, should be removed
promptly to avoid the danger of their falling down
on workmen working at lower levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11 OVERHANGS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 ACCESS AND ESCAPE WAYS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Pathways should be non-slippery and of ade-
quate
width. They should
be strong
enough
to withstand the movement of workers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1 Overhangs in the excavated face are hazard-
ous as these may come down unexpectedly
and
result in fatal accidents to workmen working at
lower levels. Such overhangs should be removed
before further work in that area is continued.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Gangways should be strong and of proper con-
struction. Planks used should be of uniform thick-
ness. Gangways should be kept clear of excavated
material or other obstructions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2 All excavated faces, on which work is going
on or work is temporarily
suspended, should be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 10386 ( Part 8 )  :  1995<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.3 Adequate measures should be taken to drain
the water from the upper surfaces of excavated
slopes or benches. This will prevent saturation of
soil which could result in slips of the excavated
slopes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>maintained or left at safe slopes, so that danger
from caving in or sliding is eliminated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3 Excavated slopes rendered unstable by nearby
blasting operations, rain, freezing and thawing ac
tion or by operation or movement of machinery
should be made safe by breakingthem
down until a
stable slope is achieved. During such trimming of
slopes no person should be permitted to work in the
area immediately below and no material should be
removed
from the bottom,
until the work of
stabilizing the slope is completed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16 DAMAGE TO ADJACENT STRUCTURES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.1 Due to improper design of blasting charges
during excavation
in weathered/hard
rock, the
vibrations caused in the process may endanger the
safety of adjacent structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.2 Where danger to the safety of structures
adjacent to the area of blasting is expected, delay
detonators
should
be
used
to
reduce
the
shockwaves. Practices such as line drilling method
should be adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12 EXCAVATION NEAR ABUTMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1 Abutment faces, when excavated for abutting
dams, are generally of steeper slopes and of greater
height. Care should be exercised to monitor the
safety of such slopes until abutment blocks are
constructed. Periodic inspection of excavated faces
for any sign of instability of the’hill slopes should
be carried out and any instability taken note of.
Immediate remedial measures should be taken to
prevent sliding of slopes and hillmass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>17 COMMON HAZARDS IN EXCAVATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>17.1 The officer
incharge
of excavation
work
should familiarize
himself with the nature
of
material to be excavated, machinery deployed for
the work, blasting operations required to be carried
out, and also the factors he has to specially look for
and guard against. Some important
factors are
~given below.
a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13 VISITORS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1 Visitors should not generally be permitted to
enter the area of excavation unless they are accom-
panied by a supervisor
or foreman.
Adequate
precautions
should be taken to prevent workers
and visitors
from
approaching
potentially
dangerous areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safe  Slopes -  Safe slopes to be adopted for
different types of subsurfacematerials.
u’ater Content or Degree of Saturation --The
side walls of an excavated trench which are
stable when dry may become highly unstable
due to saturation of earth following heavy
rain or water entering the area from other
sources. The side walls of the excavated
trench may also become unstable due to
excessive drawdown during the dewatering
operation for lowering the water table.
Freezing and Thawing -
Due to expansion
of water when frozen, rock fragments, joints
in the rock, boulders
etc, are generally
loosened. Therefore,
side walls of the ex-
cavation need to be constantly watched for
any signs of opening of the joints/cracks
during thawing, which may endanger the
stability of excavated slopes.
VZ6ration from nearby Sources -
Vibration
due to movement of machinery, vehicles,
railroad, blasting and other sources, may
have an effect on slope stability.
Adjacent Loose Fill -
The  possibility of
encountering  pockets  of unstable materials
requires-special investigation, attention and
care.
Damages to Adjacent Structure -
Due to
heavy blasting operations
adopted during
excavation work there may be a possiblity of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>14 POWER LINES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1 Live wires and cables are laid in the area of
excavation for blasting operations, drilling of holes
and other operations involving the use of electric
power. Where such cables are laid, care should be
taken to see that these cables are not laid in a
haphazard manner. Supervisors, foremen and the
construction staff should ensure that workmen or
visitors are kept away from live wires. Wherever
necessary, warning signals should be posted. Cables
which are cut or open should be promptly replaced
[see IS 10386 (Part 5)  :  19921.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1 During excavation work, adequate arrange-
ments should be provided for dewatering and bail-
ing out water from the excavated area to prevent
slippery surfaces and sliding of slopes due to stand-
ing water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
