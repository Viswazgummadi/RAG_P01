FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 8 February
1974, after the draft finalized by the Waterproofing
and
Damp-proofing
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Bitumen mastic has proved to be successful waterproofing
and damp-
proofing material and is being used extensively in buildings.
This standard
lays down methcd of providing pro+ ,,tion by an impervious membrane to
provide a continucus
waterproof lining to walls, floors and foundations of
structures
below ground le?‘el or to prevent
rising of moisture through
capillary to walls and floors constructed
above ground.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing in
different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country.
This
has been met by deriving assistance from BSCP
102: 1963 Protection of Buildings Against Water from the Ground published
by  British Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard
is complied
with: the
final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
lays down the procedure for applying bitumen mastic for
damp-proofing
to:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) portion
of buildings below ground in order to exclude visible
penetration
of water and provide a vapour seal against hydrostatic
pressure, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) walls and floors above ground level in order to prevent rising of
water through capillary action.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

which to lay bitumen
mastic
attention
may be given to the aspects
stated
under 6.1.1 to 6.1.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  General  Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.1
Unless
a screed is applied
on the surface on which the mastic is
to be laid, care shall be taken in laying the concrete
base so that any undue
ridges, indentations
and irregularities
are avoided
to ensure
uniformity
in
the membrane.
In case the treatment

the sides of the mixer and then in-
wards
towards
the centre.
The charge
in the mechanical
mixer shall
be
gradually
heated to about
200°C and when the bitumen
mastic has attained
a melted
condition,
it shall
be agitated
continuously
to ensure
a uniform
consistency.
During
remelting
the temperature
of bitumen

<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  Thickness
of Treatment
-
Bitumen
mastic
shall be applied
in one or
three coats as stated
below
to all surfaces,
whether
horizontal,
sloping
or
vertical.
The thickness
shall be as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For walls and floors above
ground
level the bitumen
mastic
shall
be laid in one coat minimum
of 10 mm thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) For vertical
surfaces
and surfaces
steeper than 30” to the horizon-
tal below

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 7198 - 1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) For horizontal
surfaces
and sloping
surfaces
not steeper
than 30”
to the horizontal
below
the ground
level,
the bitumen
mastic
shall be applied
in three coats to a total thickness
of not less than
30 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Method
of Laying-Bitumen
mastic
when
applied
in three coals
on
vertical,
horizontal
or sloping
surfaces,
the first coat should
be applied
thinly
such that it acts as an adhesive
layer and also prevents
blowing.
While laying on the horizontal
surface
each coat should
be spread
with a
float
evenly
and uniformly
over tlie previously
prepared
surface
to the
recommended
thickness.
For laying
on the vertical
surface
the first coat
may be plastered
with a metal
trowel as evenly and uniformly
as possible.
The second and subsequent
coats may be applied
with a wooden
float to a
uniform
thickness.
The second and third coats of mastic
asphalt
shall be
applied
as soon
as possible
after
the preceding
coat
as to
prevent
the
accumulation
of dust
or dirt
between
layers
which
would
impair
the
adhesion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1 Blows in each coat formed
by entrapped
air or moisture
during
the laying shall be punctured
and repaired
while the asphalt
is warm and
before the next coat is applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.2 Joints
in successive
coats
of bitumen
mastic
shall
be staggered
at least 150 mm for horizontal
and 15 mm for vertical
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3  Chases -The
top of the vertical bitumen
mastic shall be turned
into a
chase
not
less than
25 x25
mm
unless
it is being
continued
horizon-
tally.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4  Angle Fillet -
Angle fillet not less than 50 mm wide shall be applied
in two coats at the junction
of two planes forming
an internal
angle.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5  Construction
Joints  -Edges
of the mastic
already
laid
should
be
warmed
with hot asphalt
and then cut out with a metal
trowel
to remove
any dust or dirt that may have collected.
The fresh mastic is to be poured
before the warmed
up surface of the joint cools off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
