<<HEADING level=1>>( First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.
F O R E W O R D<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 20 February 1978, after the draft finalized by
the Doors, Windows and Shutters Sectional Committee had been
approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Indian Standards Institution has already issued IS : 1038-1975*
which covers steel doors, windows and ventilators for use in domestic
buildings, such as residences, offices and schools. The range of sizes
included in IS : 1038-1975*, however, does not meet all the needs of
industrial buildings, like factories and warehouses, where larger
single units are generally required to be used. Although, it is possible
to couple two or more units in the domestic range to form larger units,
yet the increased weight and cost and the resulting type of openings
make it necessary to evolve a separate range to cover specifically the
requirements of windows for industrial buildings. This standard has
been prepared with this object in view and, as in the case of
IS : 1038-1975*, the sizes of units have been derived on the basis of a
10-cm module and tolerances have been specified in accordance with
IS : 1233-1969†.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  This standard was first published in 1959. In this revision
reference to rolled steel sections used for fabrication of doors, windows
and ventilators has been omitted and separately included in
IS : 7452-1974‡. With regard to the clearance on all the four sides for
the purpose of fitting the doors windows or ventilators into modular
openings, in view of the difficulties experienced with the adoption of
specified clearance the provisions have been modified to 10 mm
alround. Accordingly, the manufacturing sizes of these components
have been suitably modified. Consequential changes have also been
incorporated in the sizes of glass panes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Specification for steel doors, windows and ventilators (  second revision  ).
†Recommendations for modular co-ordination of dimensions in the building industry
(  first revision  ).
‡Specification for hot rolled steel sections for doors, windows and ventilators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1361 - 1978<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1  Another important modification incorporated in this revision
relates to the process of welding permitted for corner joints. In this
context, provisions have been made to permit any method of welding
provided the joints conform to certain requirements as given in this
standard.
0.4  In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given
to international coordination among the standards and practices
prevailing in different countries in addition to relating it to the
practices in the field in this country.
0.5  This edition 2.2 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (July 1983) and
Amendment No. 2 (March 1986). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.
0.6  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard deals with steel windows suitable for use in
industrial buildings and designed to suit openings based on a module
of 10 cm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY
2.0  For the purpose of this standard, the following definitions shall
apply.
2.1 Sash  — A complete industrial window unit, whether of the fixed or
opening type.
2.2 Composite Window  — A window comprising of two or more
sashes joined together with one or more coupling members.
2.3 Ventilator  — The opening part of a sash. It consists of an inner

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Sashes shall be square and flat.
7.2  Sashes shall be constructed of sections which have been cut to the
required length and mitred. The corners of fixed and opening frames
shall be welded to form a solid fused welded joint conforming to the
requirements given in  7.2.1 . All frames shall be square and flat. The
process of welding adopted may be flash butt welding or any other
suitable method which gives the desired requirement.
7.2.1   Requirements of Welded Joints
7.2.1.1  Visual inspection test  — When two opposite corners of the
frame are cut, paint removed and inspected, the joint shall conform to
the following:
a) Welds should have been made all along the place of meeting the
members;
b) Welds should have been properly ground; and
c) Complete cross section of the corner shall be checked up to see
that the joint is completely solid and there are no cavities visible.
7.2.1.2  Micro and macro examinations  — From the two opposite
corners obtained for visual test as in  7.2.1.1 , the flanges of the sections
shall be cut with the help of a saw. The cut surfaces of the remaining
portions shall be polished, etched and examined.
The polished and etched faces of the weld and the base metal shall be
free from cracks and reasonably free from under cutting, overlaps,
gross porosity and entrapped slag.
7.2.1.3  Fillet weld test  — The fillet weld in the remaining portion of the
joint obtained in  7.2.1.2 , shall be fractured by hammering. The
fractured surfaces shall be free from slag inclusions, porosity, crack,
penetration defects and fusion defects.
7.3  Tee sections for glazing shall be tenoned and riveted into the
frames and where they intersect, the vertical tie shall be broached and
the horizontal tee threaded through it, and the intersection closed by
hydraulic pressure.
7.4  Ventilators, consisting of an inner opening frame and an outer
fixed frame, shall be made as separate units which shall be bedded in
mastic and screwed into the sash frames or tees with steel screws. The
bars forming the vertical members of the inner and outer frames of
centre-hung ventilators shall be reversed at the point of pivot; the top
