FO-REWORD
.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institu-
tion on 30 March 1987, after the draft finalized by the Jute and Jute
Products
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Textile
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Indian Standard on jute sacking bags for packing cement ( IS  : 258O-
1982* ) was published
in 1963, It was first revised
in 1965 and sub-‘
sequently in 1982.
With the increase in the demand
for jute
sacking’
cloth
for manufacture
of cement bags conforming
to IS  :  2580-1982*,:
by the fabricators,
the need for preparitig a separate
standard
for this.
fabric
has been felt.
Publication
of this standard will help in procure-’
ment of the _equired quality
of jute sacking
cloth suitable
for manu-
facture of cement bags conforming
to IS  :  2580-1982”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied

the result of a test, shall be rounded

The number
of significant places retained in the rounded

2.3  Corrected Net Mass ( Bale ) -
The mass obtained
by adjusting the
actual net mass on the’basis
of actual regain to the contract
regain.
It is calculated as follows:
Net mass X ( 100 -I- contract moisture regain,
Corrected

The warp threads of fabric.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6 Pick ( or Shots ) -
The weft or filling threads of a fabric.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Porter -
The value obtained by counting in a finished
cloth
the
number
of warp threads per full gauge length of 47 mm ( 37/20 inch )
and dividing it by the number of warp threads per split.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  This definition
of porter,
based on the Indian
practice,
refers
to the
finished
fabric and has to be distinguished
from
Dundee
practice,

to
which porter
is evaluated
in terms of loom reed used in weaving the cloth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
