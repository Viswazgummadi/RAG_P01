<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the
Dams ( Overflow
and Non-overflow
)  Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
River
Valley
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1983.
The revision
of this standard
has been
taken to incorporate
the
latest practices
being followed
in the field.
The major
changes
in this revision
include
modifications
in the
method
for computation
of freeboard,

with IS 2  : 1960  ‘Rules for rounding

GUIDELINES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>(First Revision)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5  Significant
Wave Height<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It
is
the
average
wave
height
of the highest
one third of the wave
present
in each
sampling
interval,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
gives guidelines
regarding
proce-
dures for working
out
freeboard
for embankment
dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Wave Length<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 TERMPNOLOCY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It
is the
length
in
m from
crest
to
crest
for
significant
wave.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0
For the purpose
of this standard,
the follow-
ing terminology
should
apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7
Wave
Period<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1
Design
Wave Height<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It
is the
average
interval
in seconds
between
successive
crests or troughs of significant
waves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It
is that
wave
height
which
the
structure
is
clesigncd
to withstand
so that it does not undergo
more than
the
accepted
probability
of damage,
should the same wave height be exceeded.
It is a
suitable
multiple
of the significant
wave
height
depending
on the degree
of risk to be accepted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8 Wave
Run-Up<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It
is the
difference
( vertical
height
) between
maximum
elevation
attained
by wave run-up
on
a slope
and
the
water
elevation
on
the
slope
excluding
wave action.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Fetch Length<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.9 Wind
Set-Up<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It
is the
straight
line
distance
along the wind
direction
( along
central
radial
of fetch ) over
open water on which the wind blows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
wind blows over a water
surface
it exerts
a horizontal
force on the water
surface driving
it
in the direction
of the wind.
This effect results in
piling
up of the water on one shore of the lake or
reservoir.
The
magnitude
of rise above the still
reservoir
water
surface is called ‘wind set-up’
or
‘wind-tide’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1
&fective Fetch<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is the weighted
average
fetch
length of water
spread,
covered
by
45” angle
on
either
side of
trial fetch
( assuming
the wind to be completely
non-effective
beyond
this area ) and measured
in
a direction
parallel to the central radial line of the
trial fetch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
