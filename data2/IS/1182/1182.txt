FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted
by the Indian
Staqdards Institution on 25 April 1983, after the draft finalized by the Non;
Destructive
Testing
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by
the
Structural and Metals Division Council.
0.2 This standard was first published in 1957 and was subsequently revised
in 1967. It has now been revised in the light of the experience
gained
since its last revision. The recommendations
given in this revision are based
primarily on radiographic techniques which have been used sucQssfully in
industry for examination of welded joints.
0.3 In this standard two different
techniques,
a general technique apd a
special technique
for application
in more important
and ditiicult fields
where higher sensitivity is required, have been specified.
0.4 This standard should be used in conjunction with IS : 2595 - 1978*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard
prescribes
recommendations
for
the
radiographic
examination of fusion welded butt joints in steel plates.
1;2, This standard covers two techniques, namely, Technique A and Techni-
que B. No attempt is made to define which technique
should be used for
any particular application
because this is a matter for agreement betweeo
the contracting parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. RADIOGRAPHIC
TECHNIQUES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The two techniques covered in this standard are classified as follows:
Technique A -This
technique
is particularly
intended
for general<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Coda of practice for radiographic tating (first revision ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>application for radiographic examination. Most applications are covered
by the ‘use of this technique.
Technique B - This  technique is intended for more important and
critical applications, where Technique A may not have enough sensitivity
to reveal all the defects desired to be detected. In this technique only
fine-grained films or ultra-fine-grained films and lead screens shall be
used. This technique generally requires longer exposure time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  TERMINOLOGY
3.1 For the purpose of this standard, the definitions given in IS  :  812-1957”
and IS  :  2478-1981t shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 PROTECTION OF PERSONNEL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Since exposure of any part of the human body to X-rays or gamma-
,iays may become highly injurious to health, it is essential that wherever
X-ray equipment or radioactive sources are in use, adequate precautions are
taken to protect the radiographer and other persons in the vicinity. For
details about radioactive protection, reference may be made to IS  : 2598-
1966:.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. WELD SURFACE PREPARATION
5.1 In order to simplify interpretation of radiographs, it is advisable to
remove surface irregularities before radiographic examination. In general
surface preparation is not’, necessary for radiogmphy, but, where surface
irregularities might cause daculty in detecting internal defects, the surface
may be conditioned by any suitable process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. LOCATION OF THE WELJJ IN THE RADIOGRAPH
6.1 Markers, usually in the form of lead arrows or other symbols, shall be
placed along side the weld on each sides of it, so that the position of the
weld can be identified on the radiograph.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. IDENTIFICATION OF RADIOGRAPHS
7.1 Each section of weld radiographed shall have suitable symbols affixed to
it to identify:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the job or work piece,
b) the joint,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the section of the joint,
d) manufacturer’s name or trade-mark, and
e) date.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The symbols consisting of lead letters or numerals, shall be positioned
on the work piece so that their,images appear on the radiograph to ensure
unequivocal identification of the section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1 In addition, the radiograph may be marked with manufacturer’s
identification and dates of radiography, which need not necessarily appear
as radiographic images.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. MARKING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  In general, permanent marking for the work piece shall be used to
provide reference points for accurate relocation of the position of each
radiograph. Where the nature of the material and its service conditions
render stamping undesirable, other suitable means of marking such as
painting shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9. OVERLAP OF FILMS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  In radiographing a continuous length of weld joint with separate films,
the separate radiographs of the joint should overlap at least IO mm to
ensure that no portion of the joint remaina unexamined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10. IMAGE QUALITY INDICATORS ( IQ1 )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  Image quality indicator ( IQ1 ) sensitivity is a means by which the quality
of radiographic techniques used may be compared and is not a measure of
Saw sensitivity as the latter is a complex function of the geometry, absorp-
tion and location of the flaw. The use of an image quality indicator ( IQ1 )
otherwise known as a penetrameter, provides a guide to the quality. of the
radiographic technique used. An IQ1 conforming to IS  :  3657-1978’ should
be placed at one or .both ends of.every section radiographed, on the surface
facing the source side of radiation and depending on its type, adjacent to
or across the weld. Only where this surfaceis inaccessible, the IQ1 shall be
placed on the film’side. If this has to be done, a lead letter ‘F’ should be
placed near the IQ1 and this should also be mentioned in the test report, as
the IQ1 indication does not have the same meaning when the IQ1 is placed
in this position;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11. RECOMMENDED TECHNIQUES FOR MAKING  RADIOGRAPHS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 Films and Screens<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.1  The films to be used for Technique
A shall be fine grain, very
high contrast,
medium speed, direct type film while for Technique B they
shall be ultra-fine grain, high contrast, direct type film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.2  For X-rays and gamma-rays, using Iridium-192 source, front and
back intensifying
lead screens shall have, for both Techniques A and B, a
thickness between 0’02 and 0’25 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.3 For X-ray voltages below 120 kif, the absorption
of the front
screen is greater than the intensifying action produced if lead screens of the
usual thickness are employed. For this reason a screen of tin is sometimes
recommendeddor
use at low X-ray energies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.4  For gamma-rays, using Cobalt-60 source, front and back screens
of copper, steel or lead may be used. For screens other than lead, a thickness
of 0’2 to 0’5 mm shall be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2 Cassettes - Films and screens should be placed in’cassettes
wh ch
may be rigid or flexible. Rigid cassettes are, recommended,
but for specimens
with curvatures,
flexible cassettes may be used. In all cases, precautions
shall be taken to ,ensure good film-screen
contact. Pre-packed strip film
with integral metal intensifying screens may also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3 Alignment of Beam - The beam of radiation shall be directed to the
middle of the section under examination and shall be normal to the plate
surface at that point; except in a special examination
for certain
defects
which it is known will be best revealed by a different alignment of the beam,
for example, defects at a fusion face are revealed when the exposure is
made with the beam directed along the fusion face.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.4 Interception of Undesirable and Scattered Radiation
11.4.1 No  back scattered radiation shall reach the film. The film shall be
shielded from all back scattered
radiation
by lead spot of an adequate
thickness placed behind the film-screen combination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.4.2 In order
to reduce the effect of scattered
radiation,
adequate
marking shall be provided so as to limit the area irradiated to the section
under. examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.5 Source-to-Film Distance/Focus-to-Film
Distance<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.5.1 The distance between the film and the adjacent weld surface should
be as small as Possible. The minimum source-to-specimen
distaacef  (that<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS :  1182-
1m<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘is the distance  between  the radiation  source and the surface of  specimen
facing the X-ray tube or gamma-ray
pource)
depends on the effective
dimension .f of the focal spot or source of .radiation
and the distance b
between
the film and the surface of the specimen ( which normally is
identical with the thickness s of the specimen).
11.5.2 The minimum source-to-specimen
distancefshould
be chosen
SO
that the ratio of this distance ,to the effective dimension of focal spot or
Fource of radiation  d,  that is, the ratiof/d,
is not below the values according
to the following equation:
f/d =  7’5 s2f3 for Technique A, and
f/d = 15 s213  for Technique B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.53  In Fig. 1 these relationships  between the ratio  f/d  and the thick-
ness s of the specimen arc plotted in a graph and in Fig. 2, in a nomogram.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>’ 11.5.4  If the distance b between the tiurface of specimen and the film. is
large compared to the thickness s, then s shall be replaced
by b on th$
abcissa of Fig. 1 or on the right scale of Fig. 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.6 Size of Area Examined - The maximum length of .weld to be examin-
ed at each exposure should be determined, by the difference
between  the
thickness of material penetrated
in the centre of the radiation beam and
that at the extremities of the exposed area, measure in the direction of the
incident beam at that point. The differences in density resulting from thig
variation of thickness and rtcorded on the film.should be within the density
range indicated in 11.7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.7 Density of Radiograph - Exposure conditions should be such that the
density of the radiograph of the sound weld metal in the area under exami-
nation shall be not less than 1’7 for Technique A and 2’0 for Technique
B,
and not greater than 3’0 for both the techoiques. A maximum density of 3’0
has been quoted as this represents the usual limit of most film viewing equip-
ment, but higher densities may be used with advantage where the viewing
light is sufficiently bright to permit adequate
interpretation.
These values
are ioclusive of the fog density ( density of a processed unexposed film ) of
not greater than 0’3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.8 X-ray Tube Voltage and  Type of Gamma-Ray  Sources
11.8.1  To maintain a good sensitivity of defect detection, the X-ray tube
Volta&e should be as low as possible. As a basis for choosing an appropriate
voltage, the maximum-values given ili ‘Fig. 3,should not be’ exceeded. For
some applications where there is a thickness change across the area of speci-
men being radiographed,
a modification of technique using a slightly higher
voltage, may  be used, but it should be noted that an excessively high tube
voltak: will lead to a loss of defect sensitivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.8.3  It  should be noted that the sensitivity of fldw detection attainable
with gamma-rays is generally inferior to that obtained with X-rays. The
difference in sensitivity is greatest oo thin welds aod becomes less marked
oo thicker sections. The use of gamma-rays should therefore be limited, as
far as possible, to applications where the shape,  thickaess
or accessibility of
the welds make X-ray examination impraticable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.9 Processing - The film shall be processed in accordance with recognix-
ed good practice. A standard type of X-ray developer shall be used and
the processing solutions shall be maiotaioed in good working condition.
Particular atteotioo should be
id
which shall be in accordance wit r
to temperature and developing time,
Alm manufacturer’s recommendations.
The radiographs shall be free from imperfections due to processing, or other
defects which would interfere with interpretation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.10 Viewing-The
radiograph shall be examined by diffused light in a
room where extraneous light does not interfere with viewing, and the
illuminated area shall be masked to the minimum required for viewing the
radiographic image. The brightness of the viewing screen shall prefzably
be adjustable so as to allow satisfactory viewing of the radiographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
