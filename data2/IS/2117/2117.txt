<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian
Standard
( Third Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the
draft finalized by the Clay Pcoducts for Buildings
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Different practices for the manufacture
of hand-made
common bricks are adopted
in different
regions of
the country.
It will be advantageous
to give the existing knowledge and experience so far gained in the
form of guide in order to specify the minimum requirements for various manufacturing
operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In brick industry all operations, such as preparation of clay, moulding, drying and firing are carried out in
the open. The kiln most commonly used is the bull’s trench. The design and construction of such a kiln of
optimum capacity has been covered in IS 4805  :  1978. This standard has been prepared to furnish general
guidance in the selection of raw materials and the processes of manufacture
of hand-moulded
bricks ( from
clay-alluvial
and black cotton ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bricks may be made from a mixture
of plastic clays and fly ash from thermal
power stations.
However,
as the composition of these material varies over a wide range it is necessary to determine a suitable batch
composition
after laboratory tests. Two materials may be mixed wet either manually or in a machine. The
processes of moulding, drying and firing are similar to those described in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1963 and revised in 1967 and 1975.
This
revision has been prepared
to include such of’ the data which have been established since it was last revised, like manufacturing
bricks
with various additives like fly ash, sandy loam, rice husk ash, basalt stone dust and details of firing process
besides making other contents up to date.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The site should
be
selected
after
giving
due
consideration
to the
suitability
of soil
and the
location
of water-table.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE
-
The data for the chemical
and mineralogical
composition
of the soil as raw material
for the manu-
facture
of building
bricks
are
not yet
conclusively
established.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE
-
It is a good practice
to select a site where the
water-table
during
burning
season
remains
at
least
about 2 metres below kiln floor.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.2  The chemical
analysis
of the soil shall be
made
in
accordance
with
IS 1727 : 1967 and
IS 2720
( Part
21 )  :  1977.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  The site should be located
in conformity
with
the prevailing
town
planning
regulations
or other
bye-laws
of similar nature,
particularly
in view
of
the
smoke
of
the
kiln
which
may
prove
a
nuisance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3
The
plastic
properties
of the clay
shall
be
determined
by finding the plasticity
index
by the
method
given
in IS 2720 ( Part 5 )  :  1985.
Tht
range
of plasticity
index shall be 15 to 25.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The availability
of suitable
clay conforming
to
the requirements
laid down in 5, within an econo-
mical
distance,
will
be
an
important
factor
influencing
the location
of the kiln; greater
consi-
deration
shall, however,
be given to
the
distance
of the
distribution
centre
of the finished
bricks
rather
than
only to availability
of the raw mate-
rials from the source,
as otherwise
it
may
prove
more
costly
to
arrange
the distribution
and des-
patch
of finished bricks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3.1
For quick field observations
and intermit-
tent checks,
sample
tests as given in Annex
B may
be found useful.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2
Additives<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain
additives
such
as fly ash,
sandy
loam.
rice
husk ash,
basalt
stone
dust,
etc are
ofterA
required
not only to modify
the
shaping,
drying
and
firing
behaviour
of clay
mass but
helps in
the conservation
of agricultural
land
and utilisa-
tion of waste materials
available
in large
quanti-
ties.
These
additives
should,
however,
have
a
desirable
level of physical
and chemical
charater-
istics so as to modify the behaviour
of clay mass
within
the
optimum
range
without
any adverse
effect on the performance
and durability
of bricks.
Some of the basic
physico-chemical
requirements
of conventional
additives
are as under:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  The
nearness
to
a rail
head
or transport

<<HEADING level=3>>5  SELECTION
OF RAW MATERIALS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Selection
of Clay<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  The clay or mixture
of clays selected
should
preferably
conform
to the
following
mechanical
composition:<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  Fly  Ash<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4 Basalt Stone Dust<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1.1
Fly ash is a waste
material
available
in
large
quantities
from
thermal
power plants and
can be mixed to the brick earths
as alluvial,
red,
black,
marine
clays,
etc
used for brick making.
The
Indian
fly ash
contains
amorphous
glassy  ’
material,
mullite,
haematite,
magnetite,
etc and
shows a chemical
composition
similar
to
brick
earths.
These
silicates
also help
towards
strength
development
in clay bodies on firing, when mixed
in optimum
proportion
depending
on the physico-
chemical
and plastic properties
of soils to be used
for brick making.
The proportion
of fly ash mixed
as an
additive
to the brick earth should be opti-
mum to reduce
drying
shrinkage,
check
drying
losses
and to
develop
strength
on firing w:thout
bloating
or black
coring
in
fired
product.
The
crystallites
present
in
the
fly ash should
comply
with the resultant
high temperature
phases in the
finished
product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Basalt stone occurs
underneath
the
black
cotton
soil and
its dust
is a waste material
available
in
large
quantities
from
stone
crushers.
The
finer
fraction
from basalt stone crushing
units can suir-
ably
be
mixed
with
soil
mass
to
modify
the
shaping,
drying
and
firing
behaviour
of bricks.
The
dust recommended
for use as an additive
with
brick earth should be fine ( passing
1 mm screen
j
free
from
coarse
materials
or
mica

and
should be of non-calcitic
or dolomitic
origin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

( ALLUVIAL
)
CLAY
ADMIXTURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.0  The
soil
used
for
making
building
bricks
should be processed
so as to be free
from
gravel,
coarse
sand
( practical
size more
than 2 mm )
lime and
kanker  particles,
vegetable
matter,
etc.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Requisite
predetermined
proportions
of addi-
tives
such
as fly ash, sandy loam, rice husk ash,
stone dust, etc as indicated
above should be spread
over the
plain
ground
surface
on volume
bas:s.
The
soil
mass
is
then
manually
excavated,
puddled,
watered
and left over for weathering
and
subsequent
processing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1.2
The
desirable
characteristics
of
fly ash
which
could
be used
as
an additive
to the soil

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  Weathering<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The soil should
be left in
heaps
and
exposed
to
weather
as long as possible
and for eat least
one
month
in
cases
where
such weathering
is consi-
dered
necessary
for
the
soil.
This
is done
to
develop a homogeneity
in the mass of soils, parti-
cularly
if they
are
from
different
sources,
and
also to eliminate
the impurities
which get oxidized.
Soluble
salts in the clay would also be washed off
by rain
to some extent
~by this, which otherwise,
may cause scumming
at the time
of burning
the
bricks in the kiln. The soil should be turned
over
at least twice and it should
be
ensured
that
the
entire
soil
is
wet
throughout
the
period
of
weathering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Addition
of sandy loam is often found effective
in
controlling

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3  Tampering<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1  Addition
of water
to the soil at the dumps
is necessary
for the easy mixing
and workability,
but the addition
of water should be controlled
in
such a way
that
it may
not create
problem
in
moulding
and drying.
Excessive
moisture
content
may affect the size and shape of the finished brick.
The
tempering
of the clay
should
preferably
be
carried
out by storing
the soil in a cool place  in
layers
of about
30
cm
thick
for
not
less than
36 hours. This
will
produce

The  thickness
of the sides of the
mould
shall be
not less than 3 mmif
of metal,
and not less than
10 mm if of wood.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3
After addition
of water
and kneading,
the
soil
may
be pugged in a pug-mill
of suitable size
corresponding
to the quantity
of production
of
bricks.
The pug-mill
may be mechanically
opera-
ted
or
may be a simple
animal
driven
type.
Salient

<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Mixing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two or more soils may have to be mixed
so as to
conform
to the requirements
of clay as laid down
in 5.1.1.
The mixing
may be done in a vat, before
tempering

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
-
Values of the allowance for shrinkage n L,
n  B, A H, A D, A X, A Y,
etc as  percentage of tht
corresponding dimensions of the finished brick and frog,
will depend not only upon  the nature of raw

Foriarge
scale production
it
is recommended
that before
finalizing the mould size,
experimental
lots of bricks will be actually
burnt in thr,

<<HEADING level=3>>7.0  In the areas where black
cotton
soils
occur,
a more elaborate
method*
of processing
as given
in 7.1 shall be followed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 The clay, which may be black
or a mixture
-of black
and
yellow,
is first
washed free of the
lime kanker in the  ‘  GHOL ’  tanks.
The
slurry is
then run off to the settling
tanks.
After  3-4  days,
when the clay has settled down,
the
supernatant
water
is
bucketed
off.
Opening
material
like
powdered
grog of fine coal ash ( passing 200
mm-
IS Sieve),
which
opens
up the texture
of clay
mass, is then added in predetermined
proportions.
This is usually
30 to 40 percent
of the mass of
clay.
A solution of 0.5 percent
sodium
chloride
may also be added at this stage
to
prevent
lime
bursting,
The clay is then thoroughly
mixed with
the opening
material
added
and allowed to dry
further
for
a period
of
3-4
days
till the
mix
attains the correct
moulding
consistency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8;2 Moulding
Procedure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1
Hand-made
bricks
may be either
ground.
moulded
or
table-moulded.
A level, firm surface
of ground,
will be used in the former
case. Typica!
specification
for accessories
for table moulding
are
given in Annex
D.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.2
Before
moulding,
the inside
of the mould
will be cleaned
and then
sprinkled
with
sand or
ash. If slop moulding
is adopted the mould should
be dipped in water and
cleaned.
The mould will
then be set firnily on the level surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.~1
Preflaration of Grog<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3
A quantity
of clay
slightly
more than the
volume ot‘ the mould,
should
be taken,
rolled in
sand,
if found
necessary,
then
shaped
suitably
into a single
lump
and
dashed
firmly
into
the
mould with a force
(  that is to be judged
by the
moulder
by experience
)
SO  that the clay comple-
tely occupies
the
mould
~without air pockets
and
with the minimum
surplus for removal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grog
is prepared
by
lightly
calcining
lumps of
black
cotton
soil (about
10 to 15 cm dia) in a
clamp at about 700 to 750°C.
Coal ash, fire wood,
brambles,
etc, may
be
used
as fuel. The
fuel
and  clay lumps are arranged
in alternate
layers
in the  clamp. After calcination,
the clay is pulveri-
zed in a machine,
such
as a disintegrator,
a
hammer
mill or a pan-mill,
to a fineness  of less
than 2.0  mm.

brick does not stick to the ground.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.5
The shaped brick is thenejected
by pressing
down the pedal when the loose bottom
steel plate
alongwith
the

The moulded
brick
is then
turned
on the
side,
over
the
wooden
pallet.
Both
the
plates
loosely adhering
to the
brick
surface
are
gently
removed.
The base plate is returned
to the mould
box for subsequent
shaping
of other
bricks from
the brick moulding
table.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.2
For
moulding
bricks,
clay
is mixed
with
water and kneaded
in the same manner
as detailed
under 6.0
and 7.0.
The
consistency
of rhe
clay
should
be plastic
and preferably
be kept margi-
nally stiff.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.8
Another
wooden
pallet is then
placed on
-the top face of the
brick
which
is then
carried
away to the drying
ground
where it is placed on
edge to dry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.3
At the moulding
table a quantity
of clay is
rolled
into
clots
slightly
larger
in volume
than
the~mould.
The clot
is then rolled over fine sand
and thrown
with little force into the mould so that
the clay completely
occupies
the
mould
without
air
pockets
and
with
minimum
surplus
for
removal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9  DRYlNG<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1  The moulded
brick
should be allowed
to dry
to an
approximate
moisture
content
of 5 to 7
percent.
The recommended
method
of drying is
shown in Fig. 2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Before throwing the  clot
into the mould. the
inside of the mould should he cleaned and then sprink-
led with sand or ash.
However,
in case of highly sticky
or plastic soil mix, the inner side of the mould may be
wiped off with wet or oily rag
for easy
demoulding.
This may be done whenever necessary,
and preferably,
after shaping 4 or 5 bricks from the mould.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.1

<<PARAGRAPH>>The schedule
of firing may, however,
vary accord--
ing to the requirements
of a kiln firing a particular
clay using a particular
type of coal.
It will also
vary
if coal ash or fly ash containing
a certain
amount
of unburnt
carbon,
is admixed
with the
clay.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.4
When
a sufficiently
strong
draught
has been
built up, the chimney
may be
advanced
by 5 to
6 m and the position of the cross damper
readjus-
ted. Thus
within
24
to 30 h the
kiln
should
be
brought
up to full firing
order.
Firing
in the feed
holes of the temporary
wall should
be
continued
till the fire has advanced
by at least 10 to 12 m and
the bricks in the first row have
been
fully
burnt.
The
temporary
wall
can
be
pulled
down
only
after the fire has gone
round
the
curved
part of
the trench
and the

fresh
row
should be opened
only
when the
temperature
at
the base of the
setting
or on
the
kiln
floor has
reached
at least
750°C.
This
is indicated
by the
appearance
of a dull
red
glow.
Initially
small
quantities
of coal, say, 260 to 500 g should be fed
at a time in each feed hole;
the
amount
of feed
should be raised
gradually
to 1 to 2 kg/feed-hole
as the
temperature
rises.
After
each
feed
the
feed-hole
caps should
be
tightly
replaced
to pre-
vent in-leakage
of cold air.
While

<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1 Schedule
of Firing
In a large

the
schedule
of firing
that
should
generally
be
maintained
is indicated
below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.2
The
temperature
at which
bricks are to be
fired may
range
from
900 to 1 000°C
depending
upon the type of clay.
The
temperature
may be
observed
by
means
of
suitable

5 m/24 h. Operation
of dampers,
setting of bricks and emptying
of bricks
will keep

<<HEADING level=3>>14  UNLOADING
OF BRICKS
FROM
THE
KILN, SORTING
AND
STACKING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.3  There
are five distinct
stages
in
the firing
cycle,
such as (a) smoking,
(b)
pre-heating,
(c)
firing,
(d) soaking,
and
(e) cooling,
to
which
the
bricks
in
the
kiln
should be
subjected
to.
The proper
and efficient
control
of these
stages
greatly depend upon the technique
and experience
of the burner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.1  The
bricks
should
be
unloaded
from the
kiln and conveyed
to the sorting
area with mini-
mum breakage.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1.1
In
the
case
of bricks
made
from clays
containing
lime
kanker,
the
bricks
in
stack
should be thoroughly
soaked
in
water (docked)
to prevent
lime bursting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.4
Under
normal
conditions,
the
pair
of
chimneys
are
maintained
at a distance
of
10 to
15 m from
the
first
row
under
fire,
and
are
shifted
once
every
12 hours.
However,
if any
combustible
matter
has
been mixed with the clay
then the
chimneys
should
be
maintained
at
a
,distance
of 20 m or so.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2
The
bricks
should
be
sorted
out
into the
various classes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.3
Bricks,
which
remain
underburnt
may
be
stacked
along
the walls of
freshly
loaded~cham-
bers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.4
For proper
inspection
of the
quality
and
count of bricks,
they may be arranged
m stacks on
dry surface,
the stacks
being
two-brick
thick
up
to ten-course
high and up to hundred-brick
long
and
the
distance
between
two
adjacent
stacks
being not less than 0 8 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.4.1
The
