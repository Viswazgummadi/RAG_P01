<<PARAGRAPH>>heavy engineering
works, such as bridge
structures,
industrial
foundations
and multi-storeyed
buildings.
In view of the establishment
of variods
mechanized
plants,
it is felt that some guidelines
for the quality
requirements
of such
bricks
should be laid down,
so that bricks of such strength
could be judiciously
utilized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
( Third
Revision
) was
adopted
by
the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on
28 Jauuary
1988,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the
Clay
Products
for
Building
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by
the
Civil Engineering
Divi-
sion Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
This standard
was first
published
in 1962 and
subsequently
revised
in
1970
and
1985.
In this
third revision
class
designation
of the
bricks
has
been based on the
minimum
compressive
strength
of’ the
bricks
expressed
in
N/mm2
instead
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
For
the
purpose
of deciding
whether
a parti-
cular
requirement
of
this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result
of  a  test or analysis,
shall be
rounded
off
in accordance
with IS : 2-1960”.
The
number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value
should
be the same
as that of the speci-
fied  value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Furthermore
sub-classifications
A
and
B of bricks have been completely
removed
deleting
requirements
of sub-class
B bricks
and
the tole-
rances
on dimensions
of
bricks
have been
changed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

strength
for various
classes as
given in  3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  The method
of sampling
and
the criterion
for
conformity
shall
be in
accordance
with
the pro-
I
cedure
laid down in IS : 5454-1978*.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  The compressive
strength
of any individual
brick
shall

by more than
20 percent.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Each brick shall be marked
( in the frog where
provided
) with

manufacturers
identification
mark or initials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Water Absorption
-
The bricks when tested
according
to the
procedure

( Part 2 )-19767
after
immersion
in
water
for 24
hours, the average
water
absorption
by mass shall
not be more than
10 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.1  Each brick may also
be marked
with
the
Standard
Mark.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nom -
The use of the Standard
Mark
is governed
by
the provisions of the Bureau of Indian Standards Act
1986,
and the Rules and Regulations
made thereunder.
Presence
of this mark
on products covered by an Indian
Standard
conveys the assurance
that they
have
been produced
to
comply
with the requirements
of that standard
under a
well-defined system of inspection, testing
and quality
con-
trol which
is devised and supervised by BIS and operated
by the producer, has the further safeguard that the products
as actually
marketed are also continuously checked by BIS
for conformity
to that standard. Details of conditions under
which a licence for the use of the Standard Mark
may be
granted to manufacturers
or producers,
may be obtained
from the Bureau of Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1 If specified
by the
purchaser,
5
hours
boiling
test according
to the
procedure
laid down
in IS : 3495 ( Part 2 )-I9767
may
also
be done.
In
that
case,
the
average
water
absorption
by mass
shall not be more than
15 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

-
The
bricks
when
tested
in
accordance
with
the
procedure
laid
down
in
IS : 3495 ( Part 3 )-1976$,
the rating
of efflorescence
shall be ‘Nil’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
