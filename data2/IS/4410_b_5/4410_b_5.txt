FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Part XI/Set
5 ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution
on 31 March
1977, after the draft finalized by the
Terminology
Relating to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number of Indian Standards have been published covering various
aspects of river valley projects and a large number of similar standards are
in  the process of formulation.
These standards include technical terms, the
precise definitions
of which
are required
to avoid ambiguity
in their
Interpretation.
To achieve this end, the Institution
is bringing
out this
glossary of terms relating to river
valley projects
( IS  :  4410 ) which is
being published in parts.
Part XI covers the important
field of hydrology
which is a separate science by itself.
In view of the vastness of this subject,
this is being covered in different sections. This section covers terms relating
to floods. Other sections will be the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>General terms
Precipitation and runoff
Infiltration and water losses
Hydrographs
Ground water
Discharge measurements
Quality of waters<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination among the standards and practices prevailin
in
different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the 6  elf in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
