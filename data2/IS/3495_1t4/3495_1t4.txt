<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Parts
1 to  4 ) ( Third
Revision
) was
adopted
by the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Clay Products
for Buildings
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
covering
methods
of tests was first published
in 1966 and subsequently
revised in 1973
and 1976.
This revision
has been prepared
so as to bring in line with
the
latest
Indian
Standards
on bricks.
Opportunity
has also been taken to up-to-date
the contents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the results of a test made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
ofT, it shall
be done
in accordance
with
1S 2  :  1960 ‘Rules
for
rounding
off numerical
values ( revised >‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
