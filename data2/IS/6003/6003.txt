FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 14 March
1983,
after
the draft finalized
by the
Joint
Sectional
Committee
for Concrete
Reinforcement
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard
was first published
in 1970 to cover the requirements
for
indented
hard-drawn
and stress-relieved
wire used in prestressed
concrete
work.
This
revision
has been
taken
up with
a view
to incorporating
modifications
found necessary
as a result of experience
gained in using this
standard
both by manufacturers
and users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In this revision,
modifications
have been
incorporated
in
provisions
relating
to manufacture
and requirements
of relaxation
and susceptibility
to stress corrosion.
Further
SI units have been adopted in this revision and
references
to related
Indian
Standards
have been updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
Requirements
of plain hard-drawn
steel wire for prestressed
concrete
are covered in IS  :  1785 ( Part I )-1983*
and IS  :  1785 ( Part II )-1983t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among
the
standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of thi!
standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expres-
sing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  Z-19601.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
