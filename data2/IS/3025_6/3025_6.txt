<<HEADING level=3>>1.  Scope-
Prescribes
a consistant
series
method
for the determination
of threshold
odour.
This
method
is applicable
to all types of water and waste water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.  Principle
-
The sample of water is diluted
with odour-free
water until a dilution
that is of least
definitely
perceptible
odour
to each
tester is found.
The resulting
ratio by which
the sample has
been diluted
is called
the threshold
odour
number
(T.O.).
As odour sensitivity
differs with indivi-
duals and same person
may also not be consistant,
a panel of not less than five
persons
and
pre-
ferably
10 persons
or more is recommended.
As  an absolute
minimum
two persons
are necessary;
one to make sample
dilutions
and other to determine
threshold
odour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.  Sample
Handling
and Preservation
-Sample
shall
be collected
in glass bottles
with
glass or
tetrafluoroethylene
lined closures.
Plastic
containers
are not reliable
for odour samples
and
shall
not be used.
Odour
tests
should
be completed
as
soon
as possible
after collection,
In case
storage
is necessary,
collect
at least 1 000 ml sample
in a bottle
filled
to the top,
Refrigerate,
and
ensure that no extraneous
odours
are drawn
into the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.  Interferences
-Chlorinated
waters
interfere
with odour measurement.
In such
cases
dechlori-
nation
may be carried
out by using
sodium
thiosulphate
in exact stoichiometric
quantity.
Prepare
a
blank to which
some amount
of dechlorinating
agent has been added to determine
if any odour
has
been
imparted.
Such
odours
usually
disappear
upon
standing
if excess
reagent
has not been
added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Threshold
Measurement
-
Use a panel of five or more persons
for conducting
this test,
The
total volume
of sample
and odour-free
water
used
in each test should
be 200 ml.
Put the proper
volume
of odour-free
water
into
flask first
and then
add the sample
to water.
Use Table
1 for
dilutions
and corresponding
threshold
numbers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note
1 -Person
carrying
out tests should not prepare
samples
or know dilutions.
A  person should not
carry out routine
determinations
for long periods of time because of human adaptability
to odourr and fatlgue.
Persons selected should neither be extremely sensitive nor insensltive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Note
2 -
Prior to the test extraneous
odour sti;muli such ae tho.se caused by smoking, eating, use of acsntrd
soap, perfume, shaving lotion, etc, should be avolded by the persons performing the test.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Determine
approximate
range
of threshold
odour
by adding
200, 50 and 12’5 ml of sample to
separate
500-ml glass stoppered
conical
flasks containing
odour-free
water
to make a total volume
of  200 ml.  Use  a separate
flask containing
odour-free
water as reference
for comparison.
If test ts

at 60°C,
heat the dilutions
and reference
solution
in a constant
temperature
bath<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:3025(Part6)-1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>at 60 &  1%.
Shake  the flask containing
the odour-free
water,
remove
the stopper
and sniff
the
vapours.
Test the sample
containing
the least amount
of odour
bearing
water
in the same way.
If odour is detected
in this dilution
prepare
a more dilute
sample as given
in 7.2.1.
If odour
is not
detected
in the first dilution,
repeat the above procedure
using the sample containing
the next higher
concentration
of the odour-bearing
water and continue
this process
until odour
is clearly
detected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.21
If the sample
being tested requires
more extensive
dilution,
prepare
intermediate
,dilutions
of sample
as shown
in Table
1 diluted
to 200 ml with
odour-free
water.
Use this
dilution
for
threshold
determination.
Multiply
the T.O. obtained
by the appropriate
factor to correct
for inter-
mediate
dilution.
In rare cases more than one ten fold intermediate
dilution
step may be required,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 Based on the results
obtained
in the preliminary
test prepare
a set of dilutions
with
the help of
Table 1.
Insert one or more blanks
in the series
in the vicinity
of the expected
threshold
without
knowledge
of observer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 Record the observations
of each tester by indicating
odour
in each test flask.
If odour
is noted
mark plus sign ( + ) it absent,
indicate
by a minus sign ( -
diluted
to 200 ml against

<<HEADING level=3>>8. Calculations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 The threshold
odour
number
is the dilution
ratio at which
odour
is just
detectable.
In the
example
in 7.4 the first detectable
odour occurred
when 25 ml sample was diluted
to 200 ml. Obtain
threshold
value by dividing
200 by 25 which
is 8.
Alternatively
read value from Table
1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Sometimes
responses
are anomalous.
A low concentration
may be called positive
and a higher
concentration
in
the series
may
be called
negative.
In such
cases,
threshold
is that point
of
detection
after which
no anomalies
are there, for example:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Threghold<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3  To
find
the
most
probable
average
threshold
from
large
numbers
of panels
use statistical
methods
( generally
geometric
mean ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ultimate
odour
testing
device is the human
nose.
Odour
tests
are performed
to arrive
at qualitative
descriptions
and
approximate
quantitative
measurements
of odour
intensity.
The
method
prescribed
here
for intensity
measurement
is the threshold
odour
test.
This
method
is
applicable
to samples
ranging
from
nearly
odourless
natural
waters
to industrial
wastes
with
threshold
odour
numbers
in thousands.
There
are no intrinsic
difficulties
with
highly
odourous
samples
because
they are diluted
proportionately
before
being
presented
to the test observers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
