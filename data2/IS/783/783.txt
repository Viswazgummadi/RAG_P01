<<HEADING level=2>>(  First Revision /<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 July 1985, after the draft finalized by the
Cement and Concrete Sectional
Committee
and been approved
by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Concrete pipes are largely used for sewers, water mains, culverts and
irrigation purposes.
To ensure
that pipes manufactured
in accordance
with IS  :  458-1971* and IS  :  784-1978t are not subjected to loads in
excess of those for which they have been designed, this standard lays down
the methods for finding the loads on pipes and their supporting
strength
and the methods for handling, laying and jointing of pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Concrete
pipes have to be properly handled, bedded and back-filled,
if they have to carry safely the full design loads.
Even the highest
quality of concrete pipes manufactured in accordance
with the specifica-
tions may be destroyed
by improper handling, bedding and back-filling
As various factors, such as the size of the pipe and the nature
of the sot1
infiuence pipe laying practice, it is not possible to lay down any rigid
rules.
Each case will have to be dealt with on its own merits, and this
standard is intended to provide
a general guidance in such work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard was first published in 1959. The first revision incorpora-
tes the modifications required as a result of experience gained with the use
of this standard and brings the standard in line with the present practice
followed in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1 In the present revision a number of important
basic modifications
with respect to symbols, illustrative figures, graphs, impact factors, testing,
etc, have been introduced.

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In the preparation
of this standard
assistance
has been
derived
from
AS CA33-1962
‘Concrete
pipe

issued
by the Standards
Association
of Australia.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test
or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960.”
The number
of significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in.this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
covers recommended
design
practice
for the laying
of
precast
concrete
pipes.
It includes
methods
for calculating
loads on pipes
according
to installation
conditions,
and
gives
the
corresponding
load
factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1.1  This standard
is intended
primarily
for use in association
with
IS  :  45%1971t
and IS  :  784-1978:
for pipes, but may also be used
for the
calculation
of loads on other rigid pipes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. APPLICATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The
purpose
of this
standaid
is to
provide
a basis for relating
the
loads on precast concrete
pipes
laid under
various
installation
conditions
to the test strength
of pipe in accordance
with IS  :  45%197lt
through
load
factors appropriate
to the installation
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions
of this standard
may be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) to calculate
external
loads which, when divided by the appropriate
load factor,
will indicate
the
strength
of pipe required
in terms
of the test loads given in IS  :  45%1971t;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) to assess the supporting
strength
of a pipe
under
specified
instal-
lation
conditions
by multiplying
the
test
load given
in 1S  :  45%
1971~ for the class of pipe by the load factor specified
herein,
and
hence to determine
the permissible
loading
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>P = concentrated load in kN.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>p =  projection
ratio of a ‘pipe installed under embankment condi-

It is calculated by dividing the vertical distance h from
the top of the pipe down to the level of the undisturbed ground
surface at the sides of the pipes, by the external diameter  D  of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the pipe, that is $-- ( see A-2 and A-3 ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 1 -  Where a pipe is laid on a continuouS concrete cradle  the top horizontal
surface of the cradle ( see B-9 and  B-10 )  may be taken as the level of  the undistur-
bed ground surface.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -  Where a pipe is laid in a wide trench with no bench of undisturbed
ground at the  sides of the pipe, the
top horizontal
surface of compacted
sand or
other granular foundation
material at the sides of the pipe may be taken as the  level
of the undisturbed
ground
surface provided the foundation material at the sides of
the pipe is compacted
to the same
density
as the ijndisturbed ground
or to 90
percent
of the maximum
density
at optimum
moisture content as determined
by a
suitable method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  3 -- Where the site is irregular it is usual to average the levels at distance
D  on each side of the centre line of the pipe, but the level from which the average is
calculated should never be, taken more than  1.5  D  from the centre line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P' =  negative
projection
ratio
of a pipe,  defined as the ratio of the
depth of the fill material measured from the top of the pipe to
the natural ground surface to the width of the trench, that is:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-g  (.  see A-4 and A-5 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -  For imperfect trench conditions,  p’  is defined
as the ratio of the depth
of the trench excavated in the compacted
fill material
to the width of the trench
which preferably should be equal to the external diameter of the pipe ( see A-4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 -
Where the site is irregular it is usual to average the levels at distance  D
on each side of the centre line of the pipe, but the level from which

<<HEADING level=3>>10. LOAD  FACTORS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1 Load  Due to Fill Material  or  Uniformly Distributed Load -  The load
factors
applicable
when pipes are loaded with fill material
and/or
a
uniformly
distributed
static superimposed
load, and are installed under
various conditions are given in Appendix B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Concentrated
Loads - The load factor applicable
when pipes are
loaded with concentrated superimposed
static or live loads shall be 1.5
irrespective
of the pipe installation
conditions,
except that for Class D
.  bedding, the factor shall be 1.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE - The load  factors  given in B-9 to  B-16  are applicable for loose granular
6lI material.
For other fill material, the load factors given will be conservative.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11. IMPACT FACTORS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  Effect of Impact -
Where superimposed loads are dynamic, allowance
shall be made for the effect of impact by multiplying
the superimposed
load by an impact factor a appropriate to the type of loading, the depth of
cover over the pipe, and the smoothness of any load bearing
surface over
the pipe, ab indicated in 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4. When considering the effect
of impact, the depth of cover over the top of the pipe is critical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2 Road  Vehicle Loading -
The impact factor a depends on the depth
of cover measured from the top of the pipe to the top of the pavement
above the pipe, and on the smoothness of the pavement surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The impact factors
given in Table 1 shall be used where a smooth
pavement surface is anticipated.
Where a rough pavement surface is anti-
cipated ( that is, due to settlement of the fill material ), and the depth of
cover is 900 mm or less, the impact factors  shall  be increased by at least
20 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3 Aircraft
Loading - An impact
factor a of unity shall bi used for all
depths of cover and all pavement surface conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.4 Railway Loading - The impact factor
a  depends on the’depth
of
cover over the pipe, measured from the top of the pipe to the underside
of the rails.
The impact factors given in Table 2 shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

WATER LOAD<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.1 The vertical load due to wpter carried in a pipe need only be taken
into account where the pipe is laid on  Type
D  bedding ( see B-7, B-8,
B-15 and B-16 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where it is necessary
to take the water load into account the pipe
should be assumed full, and three-quarters
of the weight of the water per
linear metre of the pipe should then be added to the vertical loads calcula-
ted in accordance with 7, 8 and 9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_21>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Is : 783 -  1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>If the maximum internal pressure and three edge bearing  strength for
a  pipe are known, the relation ( see Fig,  6 )  between  the internal

<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall be noted from Fig. 6 that:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>for any working pressure

can safely be applied to the pipe.
By multiplying
W/F  by the
appropriate
load factor
F,  the value  W  of external vertical load
from earth fill, etc, which the pipe can safely support is obtained;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>alternatively, if the value  W/F  is predetermined
by the installa-
tion conditions,
the
intersection
X of a horizontal
line drawn
through  W/F  with a vertical line through  P,  should then l& below
the curve; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>if, for a predetermined
value of  W/F  the intersection of X is above
the curve constructed for test values proposed, a higher test load
T  or test pressure  Pt  should be chosen.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>14.3 Flexible Joints -  The water seal is effected because of contact pressure
between the sealing rubber  ritig( or similar material ) and the pipe surface.
These are mainly two  types.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.3.1  Roll on Joint -
A rubber ring ( circular in cross-section )  is placed
at or near the end of the spigot and rolls  along it as the spigot enters the
socket.
The details of the joint are shown in Fig. 11.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>14.3.2  Confined Gasket -
Rubber ring ofcircular cross-section is held in
the groove formed on the spigot.
Spme times, the cross-section
is in the
shape of lip. The lips are opened due to water pressure which ensure water
seal.
For assembly of this joint a lubricant has to be applied to the sliding
surfaces.
The lubricant
washes off when the pipe is in service.

<<HEADING level=3>>15.1 Transport, Handling and Stringing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1.1  Transport -
Pipes should be loaded at the works for transport-
ation, either by rail or by road, in such a way that they are secure and
that no movement can take place on the vehicle during transit.
The same
care is needed if pipes are to be transferred from one vehicle to another,
however, short the journey may be.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_25>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 783 -  1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1.2 Ofs Loading -
Off  loading should be carried out by means of
chainblock
with shear ,legs or crane of adequate capacity, using properly
designed slings and spreader beams or specially designed lifting beams ( sea
Fig. 13 ).
Slings should be placed around the circumference
of the pipe
and should not be threaded through the pipe bore’ as the latter method
may damage the jointing surfaces.
For the same reasons, hooks
located
in the ends of the pipes should not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FIG. 13 A TYPICAL LIFTING BEAM<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1.3  Stacking -  Pipes may  be  placed directly on the ground provided
it is reasonably level and free fr.>m rocks and other projections.
Stacking
in tiers is permissible provided i’imber bearer are placed between succeed-
ing tiers.
If pipes are to be sta;:ked more than two tiers high, reference
should be made to manufacture ;br advice before exceeding the two tiers
specified.
15.1.4  Stringing -
Stringing consists of placing pipes on the ground
in line ready for laying.
Care is again needed to prevent damage during
this operation.
15.2 Trench Excavation - Trench shall be of sufficient width to provide a
free working space on each side of the pipe.
The free working space shall
be preferably not less than 150 mm on either side.
For deeper excavations
wider trench may be required.
The trench width should be kept minimum,
sufficient to allow proper tamping of the backfill.
Any inadvertant increase
in the actual width should be referred to the designer.
If the sides of the
trench are not vertical, the toes of the side slopes shall end at the top of
pipe, and practically
vertically sided trench shall be dug from these down
to the subgrade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15;3 Pipe Insptction and Repairs
15.3.1  Inspection of .Pipe Before Laying -  Prior to being placed in the

<<PARAGRAPH>>153.2
Repairing Damaged Pipes -
Any damage
to the pipe may impair
its strength
or integrity
consequently
although
some minor damage
may be
repairable
at site, such repairs should be undertaken
only
by pipe
manu-
facturer
or under his supervision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.4  Laying, Jointing and Anchoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.4.1  Laying -
Pipes
should
be lowered
into
the trench with tackle
suitable
for the weight of pipes,
such
as well designed
shear
slings
with
chain block or mobile crane.
While lifting, the position
of the sling should
be checked
when
the pipe
is just
clear off the ground
to ensure proper
balance.
Laying of pipes shall preferably
proceed upgrade
of a slope.
If
the
pipes have rubber
ring joint it is easier to force spigot into socket.
In
case of collar joint,
the collars shall be slipped on before
the next
pipe
is
laid.
Expansion
joint
shall
be provided
for buried
line
at maximum
intervals
of 100 m, but
for
exposed
pipes,
the joint
intervals
shall not
exceed 45 m.
Cast iron or steel collars and lead
caulking
conforming
to
IS  :  782-1978*
shall
be used
for ‘expansion
joint.
Where flexible rubber
ring joints
are used, expansion
joints need not be provided.
When
laying
is not
in progress,
the
open
end
of the pipe line should be fitted with
temporary
end-closure.
This may make the pipe buoyant
in the
event
of
the
trench
becoming
flooded
and
any
movement
of the pipes should be
prevented
either
by partial
refilling
of
the
trench
or by
temporary
strutting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.4.2  Jointing-The
sections of the pipe should
be jointed
together
in
such a manner
that there shall be as little unevenness
as possible along
the
inside of the pipe.
The procedure
will vary according
to the type
of  joint
being used.
.Basic requirements
for all types are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For collar joint thk loose collar shall be set up over the joint so as to
have an even caulking space all round.
Into this caulking space shall be
rammed 1 : l-5 mixture of cement and sand for pressure pipes and 1  :  2 for
non-pressure pipes just sufficiently moistened to hold together in the hand.
The caulking shall be so firm that it shall be difficult to drive the point of a
pen into it.
The caulking shall be employed at both ends in a slope of
1  : 1.  In place of cement mortar, any other suitable approved
compound
may be used.
Every caulked joint shall be kept wet for about ten days for
maturing.
The section of the pipe line laid and jointed shall be covered
immediately
to protect
it from weather effects.
A minimum cover of
100 mm is considered adequate.
A polythene sheet also be used to cover
the joints to prevent evaporation of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

1 in 7 and 1 in  12,  the need for transverse

<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be noted that where very steep gradients occur the trench

<<PARAGRAPH>>could disturb granular bedding materia1; hence, reducing the effective
support for the pipes.
In these circumstances alternative bedding material
should be considered.
If the flow of’water through the bedding material
is potentially substantial, clay water stops should be introduced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of gradients steeper than 1 in 15, consideration should be
given to the use of suitable spacers to achieve the correct gap between the
end of the spigot and the back of the socket.
Precautions should be taken
to ensure that there is no movement
of adjacent pipes relative to each
other, immediately after the jointing operation
is complete.
As soon as
joint assembly is complete, the last pipe laid should be firmly restrained in
position until back filling over it is complete and well compacted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.5 Testing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.5.1 General-
All pipelines should be tested before being brought
into service.
The test should be a hydrostatic test performed by filling the
pipeline with water and raising the pressure to the selected test pressure
and maintaining this for a sufficient period to allow for absorption
of
water by the pipe material.
A graph of quantity of water added to main-
tain the test pressure against time will show when absorption of water is
substantially
completed.
In the case of large diameter low pressure pipes
consideration may be giver, to internal testing of joints only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.5.2  Site Test Pressure -  The site test pressure to be imposed should
have already been determined
when placing orders for pipes and fittings.
In general, this pressure should not be less than the maximum pipeline,
operating
pressure plus the calculated surge pressure allowance, but in no
case, should it exceed the works hydrostatic proof test pressure. If pressure
measurements are not made at the lowest point of the section under test,
an allowance should be made for the static head between the lowest point
and the point of measurement to ensure that the maximum pressure is not
exceeded at the lowest point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.5.3  Test Procedure -  At the commencement of a pipe laying project,
it is prudent to test comparatively short section in order to establish the
test procedure
and gain experience; thereafter, the test may be applied to
longer lengths.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ends
Each section should be properly sealed off, preferably with special stop
secured by adequate anchors.
The thrust on the stop ends should be
calculated on the full socket internal diameter and the anchors designed to
resist it.
It may often be economical to provide .a concrete anchor block
of couple of pipes laid and earth tamped around which has subsequently
to be demolished rather than risk movement of the stop ends during testing.
Hydraulic
jacks may be inserted between the temporary anchors and stop<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_29>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:783-
1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ends in order to take up any horizontal
movement
of the temporary
anchor.
All permanent
anchors
should be in position
and,
if of concrete,
should
have developed
adequate
strength
before testing begins.
The section under
test
should
be filled with water, taking care that all air is displaced
either
through
vents at the high points,
or by using a swab.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After
filling,
the pipeline
should be left under operating
pressure
for
a period in order to achieve conditions
as stable
as possible
for testing.
The
length
of this
period
will depend upon many factors such as initial
permeability,
absorption,
movement
of the pipeline
under pressure
and
the
quantity
of air trapped.
More water should be pumped
in from a calibrat-
ed container
until the required
test pressure
is reached.
The test pressure
should be maintained
throughout
the test by means of continuous
pumping,
using a pressure
relief valve.
The
excess
water
coming
from
the
relief
valve
should
be returned
to the calibrated
container.
The rate of  loss  of
water from the container
should
be determined
at regular
intervals;
the
standard
of acceptance
should
be clearly specified and the test should be
continued
until this is achieved.
The generally
accepted
standard
for non-
absorbent
pipelines
such as steel and iron is O-1 litre per millimetre
of pipe
diameter
per kilometre
of pipeline
per day
for each
30 metre head-of
pressure
applied.
Concrete
is an absorbent
and
permeable
material,
the
factors which govern the absorption
and permeability
are vary complex
and
they cannot
at the present
time be subject to accurate
analysis.
It is known,
however,
the following
factors play an important
part:

b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The density of the concrete,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The, amount
of surplus
( non-combined
) water
present
in the
concrete

of the test,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The amount
and quality
of the cement metrix ( water-cement
ratio
and cement content

<<HEADING level=3>>d)

f><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thickness
of the concrete
unit under test,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pressure applied,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The duration
of the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Laboratory
permeability
tests
are usually conducted
under very
low
heads, ( about 0.1 atmosphere
) which is in the order of 1 percent
of the
operating
pressure
of many trunk water mains.
For low head laboratory
permeability
tests, the permeability
coefficient
may
be in the range
of
1 x 10-s to 1 x IO-lo cm3/s per crnz ( area of concrete
under test ) per cm
( thickness
of concrete
section
under test ).
Air voids in well compacted
mature
concrete
may occupy 1 percent
of the volume
of the concrete.
As
an example
of the effect of items ( a ) and ( b ) only, when concrete
has
been artificially
dried and then placed in water without
any applied pressure,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>28<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_30>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  783 - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the accepted absorption of good quality concrete
should not exceed 65
per cent by mass of the concrete in 24 hours.
For concrete pressure pipe,
900 mm diameter, under a test pressure of 100 m head, a figure of 6 percent
for artificially dried concrete may amount to about 48 000 l/km in 24 hours.
For concrete pipelines, the standard
of aticeptability for non-absorbent
pipelines quoted above can be achieved only when absorption is complete.
In the case of concrete pipes, the attainment of this standard may be costly
and time consuming process with no equivalent advantage obtained in the
form of a higher standard of completed pipeline and it may be preferable
to specify for the rate of loss of water from .the container a figure more
appropriate
to the absorption
characteristics
of concrete and thus larger
than the figure quoted for non-absorbent
pipelines.
A figure of 3 litres
per mm diameter per km per 24 hours per 30 m head is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>155.4  Leak Detection -  If the test is not satisfactory, the fault should
be found and rectified.
Where there is difficulty in locating a fault, the
section under test should be subdivided and each part tested separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Method employed for finding leakage include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

or listening stick in contact
with the pipeline;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>use of .an electronic listening device which detects and amplifies the
sound of escaping fluide ( actual contact between the probe and
the pipe is not essential );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>e><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>injection of a dye i.nto test water (particularly
suitable in waterlogg-

but subject to approval by the appropriate
authority);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>introduction
of nitrous oxide in solution into the test water, using
an infra-red gas concentration indicator to detect the presence of
any nitrous oxide that has escaped through the leakage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.55  Final Testing -  After all sections have been jointed
together on
completion
of section testing, a test on the complete pipeline should be
carried out.
This test should be carried out at a pressure not less than the
working pressure
of the pipeline, care being taken to ensure that the
pressure at the lowest point in the pipeline does not exceed the maximum.
During the test, an .inspection should be made of all work which has not
been subjected to sectional tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The vertical load trans-

an advantage therefore, to compact the fill material adjacent to the pipe to

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:783-1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It follows from table 2 of IS  :  458-1971* that a 450 mm NP2 class
pipe which has a 0.25 mm crack load of 14.5 kN/m is suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) For an unreinforced
concrete pipe the test load required should be
at least 1.5 ( see Note ) times the calculated vertical load on the
pipe divided by the load factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hence the required minimum test load is<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>w, x 1.5 =

<<PARAGRAPH>>Hence, a choice between an unreinforced

available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
It is usual to apply a factor of safety of 15 to all unreinforced
pipes for
all installation conditions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Example 3:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Calculation

<<HEADING level=3>>Calculation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The vertical load,  Wu  on on the  pipe  due to the superimposed load is
calculated from the formula:<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>It follows from the above that 450 mm NP2 class pipe will be obviously
inadequate and 450 mm NP3 class pipe with 0.25 mm cracking load of
369 kN/m will have to be used.
Alternatively, 450 mm NP2 class pipe
with Type A bedding may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
