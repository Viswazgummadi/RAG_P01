<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 25 August 1989, after the
draft  finalized by the Fluid Flow Measurement
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the
River Valley Projects Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indian Standard have been prepared on Various types of gauging structures
used for the purpose
of fluid flow measurement.
Each type of structure has its own performance
characteristics
and can
be  used within a specified range of conditions.
This standard is prepared to give guidelines to the
users in selecting a structure most suited to, and appropriate
for their requirements.
This standard
has  been  based on IS0 8368  :  1985 ‘Guidelines
for the selection of flow gauging structures’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off  in  accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.  The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 The purpose for  which the structure
is
required will determine
the range of accuracy
which is necessary.
The accuracy
in a single
determination
of discharge
depends
upon the
estimation
of the component
uncertainties
invol-
ved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.1  The rise in level immediately
upstream
of,
and  due to, a structure
known as af5ux may
interfere with the  5ow  system and cause drainage
problems, or overflow, of limit the effectiveness
of irrigation
systems,
or cause extra
pumping
costs.
A number of structures have been deve-
loped
with high coefficients
of discharge
and
whose accuracy is relatively unimpaired
by high
submergence
ratios. The triangular
profile wires,
and flumes are examples of this type of structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3 In broad terms: thin-plate weirs will have
a range of uncertaint es from 1 to  4  percent
and
flumes and other types of weirs a range from
2
to 5 percent.
Deviations from the construction,
installation or use as laid down in the appropri-
ate Indian Standard
will result
in
measurement
errors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5  Size and Nature of Channel
5.5.1  The shape and size of the channel
have a
bearing on the practicality
of selecting any parti-
cular type of structure.
The material
forming
the bed and sides of the channel
will influence
the acceptable
head loss through
the
structure
without introducing
appreciable
leakage through
the bed and banks.
It will also determine
the
degree of protection
necessary to alleviate
scour
downstream
of the structure.
5.5.2 Broad-crested
weirs are best used in rect-
angular
channels,
but they can be used with
good  accuracy
in  non-rectangular
channels
if a
smooth, rectangular
approach
channel
extends
upstream of the weir for a distance not less than<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Range of Flow,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1 It is necessary to consider the relation be-
tween
maximum flow and minimum flow when
deciding which type of structure to use, and an
indication of the range of some typical structures
is given in Table 2. For the best overall accuracy
over a wide range of small discharges,
a thin-
plate V-notch  weir should be used in preference
to the thin-plate
rectangular
notch
or
rect-
angular full width weir.
For a wide range of
larger discharges, a trapezoidal
flume should
be
used in preference
to a broad-crested
weir, free
overall or rectangular
throat 5ume.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

suitable, but may be usable under
such circum-
stances when there is no transport
of sediment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7  Operation and Maintenance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7.1  The accuracy of any device is very depen-
dent upon the degree of maintenance
it receives.
However,
flumes are particularly
susceptible
to
errors of calibration
due to algal growths in the
throat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6  Channel Slope and Sediment Load<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.1  For flows with suspended load, the use of
thin-plate
weirs should be avoided
because
the
crest edge may be damaged or worn
out by the
suspended materials.
In addition, the rating
of
weirs can be affected by deposition
of sediment
in the approach
section to the weir.
In streams
with bed load, the use of structures
which signi-
ficantly
reduce
the
stream
velocity
is
not
recommended,
as it may result in fluctuations
of
the bed level as the flow varies.
Flumes
will
generally perform better than weirs in streams
with sediment load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7.2 When structures
operate
at
temperatures
below freezing point, consideration
shall also be
given to the effect of the accumulation
of ice on
the calibration.
In general, weirs, and thin-plate
weirs in particular,
are less affected by ice than
flumes.
In some cases, the problem of calibra-
tion errors can be overcome by he? ting the air
space over a structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7.3 The calibration
of thin-plate
weirs can be
affected by damage to the crest and corners
and
failure to clean the upstream
face where
algal
growths will introduce errors into the calibration.
The choice of structure, therefore,
will be influ-
enced by the regularity with which maintenance
can be carred out.
Broad
crested
weirs, trlan-
gular profile weirs, long-throated
llumes and free
overfall structures
will normally
pass floating
debris
more
effectively
than
thin-plate
weirs.

<<PARAGRAPH>>For gradients between 1 : 1000 and 1  :  250 and

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3  Triangular
Profile
Weirs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8  Passage
of Fish<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.1  The movement of fish upstream for spawn-
ing may be restricted
if a structure
fails to make
proper provision for their passage.
5.8.2 The
principal
factors
which affect their
movement
past such an obstruction
are the afflux
at the obstruction
and its overall length, and the
depth of water below the obstruction
and over
its crest.
5.8.3 If a thin-plate
or broad-crested
weir is to
be installed, there should be a sufficient
depth
of water from
which
the fish can take
off to
clear the weir.
Flumes
constitute
a minimal
obstruction,
depending
upon
the
velocities
through the throat and the overall
length,
Tri-
angular profile weirs need careful
consideration
as they may from a serious obstruction,
particu-
larly where energy dissipators
are incorporated
in the stilling basin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1  Triangular
profile
weirs are
particularly
appropriate
for the measurement
of flow
in
natural watercourses where minimum head losses
are sought and where relatively high accuracy
is
required.
They have a good
discharge
range
and modular
limit, are robust,
insensitive
to
minor dnmage and will operate
even when the
flow is silt-laden.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The triangular
profile has a constant
ccrefficient
of discharge over a wide range of heads.
The
weir can also be used under
submerged
flow con-
ditions;
in this case, a second head measurement
is necessary and is achieved by means of tapping
points at the crest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accuracy obtained over a wide range of flows
and heads makes them excellent
structures
for
hydrometric
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Flumes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9  cost<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.1  The financial values
of the flow passing
through the gauging device and
the benefit in
terms of improved
accuracy against the cost of
the stucture will have a direct
bearing
on the
relative investment values of different
types of
structures.
The total capital costs of construction
and long-term maintenance
costs should be con-
sidered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flumes are recommended
where material is being
transported
along
the
channel,
particularly
where there is bed movement.
Protective
works
downstream
of the throat to contrin the hydrnu-
lit  jump
are easily incorporated
into
the
main
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.2
Rectangular
Flumes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 RECOMMENDATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The dimensions of rectangular
flumes are easily
adapted to the size of the channel
and such
flumes readily fit into rectangular
channels
and
are almost
universally
used
in measuring
the
inflow to sewage treatment
works.
They are
suitable where relatively
high accuracy is requi-
red over a wide range of flow; and afflux needs
to be kept to a minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Thin-Plate
Weirs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1  Thin-plate
weirs are dependent
on the full
development
of the contraction
below the nappe
but are relatively
inexpensive
to construct,
al-
though the manufacture
of the crest requires
particular
care.
They are recommended
where
high accuracy is required
and are particularly
suitable for laboratorv
work and use in artificial
channels and other
dircumstances
where good
maintenance
can be assured and there
is little
risk of damage to, or deterioration
of, the crest.
Particular applications
include
the gauging
of
compensation
flows, flow measurement
in water
supply pumping tests and flow measurement
in
many industrial
situations.
Thin-plate
V-notch
weirs are particularly
suitable where the ratio of
high to low flow is large and where
accuracy
at
low flow is important,
owing to their greater sen-
sitivity. Thin-plate
weirs of both rectangular
and
V-notch
types
are well suited
for
temporary
installations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.3  Trapezoidal Flumes
Trapezoidal
flumes  are used for purposes
similar
to  those employing
rectangular
flumes but are
particularly
recommended
if it is necessary
to
accommodate
the gauging
station
in a trape-
zoidal  channel
and skilled
labour
is available
for
the  construction
work.
They are suitable
where
relatively high accuracy is required
over a wide
range of flowed and afflur needs to be kept to a
minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7 SUMMARY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  Broad-crested
weirs are relatively inexpen-
sive to construct and robust and thus insensitive
to minor damage.
They are best used in rect-
angular channels where regular maintenance
