FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 November
1978, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Traditionally,
quality
of concrete
in construction
works is calculated
in terms of its 28 days compressive
strength.
This
procedure
requires 28
days of moist curing before testing,
which is too long a period to be of any
value for either concrete
construction
control
or applying
timely corrective
measures.
If after 28 days, the quality of concrete
is found to be dubious,
it would
have
considerably
hardened
by that time and also might have
been buried by subsequent
construction.
Thus replacement
of the concrete
mass of questionable
attributes
becomes
very difficult
and often impracti-
cal. On the other hand, if the concrete
is found to possess excessive strength
than
required,
it would be too late to prevent
wasteful
use of cement
on
uneconomical
mix proportioning.
Hence,
standard
28 days cube testing
of concrete
is not feasible
for quality control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 What
is essentially
needed
for assessing
quality
of controlled
concrete
is an acceptance
test which
can supply
results,
while the concrete
is still
accessible
and sufficiently
green
to make its removal
practicable,
that is,
within about
24 hours
after
casting.
With
the assistance
of reliable
test
methods
employing
accelerated
curing techniques,
it is now possible to test
the compressive
strength
of concrete
within a short period and thereby
to
estimate
whether
it is likely to reach
the specified
strength
at 28 days or
not.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The
need
for
having
a reliable
and
fast
method
for
evaluating
controlled
concrete
in the field using
accelerated
curing
technique
was
recognized
by Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
and as a result,
the
Committee
decided
to evolve
a standard
method
of determining<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>18 J  9013 -  1978<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>compressive
strength
of
test specimens
cured
by
accelerated
curing
methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 This standard
lays down the method
of making,
curing
and testing in
compression
concrete
specimens
cured by two accelerated
methods
namely
warm-water
method
and boiling-water
method.
The method
laid down
in
this
standard
may
be used for quality-control
purposes,
or for the
prediction
of normal
strength
of concrete
at later
ages, by the use of an
appropriate
correlation-curve
obtained
by
testing
normally-cured
and
accelerated
cured concrete
specimens
of the mix proportion
and
materials
to be used at the site.
Such
correlation-curves
prepared
on the basis of
some case studies have been given in Appendix
A.
In this standard,
the
method
of test has been
so defined
as to be readily
applicable
to the
majority
of test specimens
made
on construction
sites and to give results
of low variability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.8 High
pressure
steam
curing
is also used as an
accelerated-curing
method,
but has not been covered
due to its inherent
limitations
in appli-
cation.
However,
this method
may be useful for internal
quality
control
purposes
under
special circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given
to
international
coordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in
different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in
the
country.
Assistance
has
also
been
rendered
by
the
researches
conducted
by Cement
Research
Institute
of India,
New Delhi.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.8 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
express-
ing the result
of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with IS : 2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value ,should
be the
same
as that
of the
specified
value
in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  The following
precautions
shall be taken  :
a) The curing

for safety measures
to
prevent

Also care shall be exercised
when

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1 Since strength
requirements
in existing
specifications
are not based
upon accelerated
curing,
results from this method
in checking the com-
pliance
of specified
strengths
at later ages shall be applied
with great
caution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2 The results can be used in rapid assessment
of variability
for process
control and signalling
the need for indicated
adjustments.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3 The magnitude
of the strength values from strength tests is influenced
by the specific combination
of materi&
Therefore
the use of  the results
from either
conventional
tests at any arbitrary
age or those from this
method shall be supported by experience or correlations developed for the
existing local conditions and materials ( see Appendix A ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

METHODS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.
Accelerated
curing of concrete hastens the process of hydration of
cement
and as a result, a substantial
proportion
of the strength to be
attained in 28 days under normal curing conditions is achieved within  a
shorter time.
The rate and extent of hydration of cement under a parti-
cular curing regime depend mainly upon the chemical
composition of
cement, water-cement
ratio and mix proportions, which are considered to
be important
parameters
in the correlation
of results from compressive
strength tests on specimens cured by accelerated curing method and normal
curing method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accelerated
curing regime, in itself, is another variable
in that
the higher temperature employed may alter the morphology of the hydra-
tion products apart from thermally
activating
the chemical reactions  of
hydration of cement,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_11>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS t  9019 -  i978<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.  The variability
arising from the curing regime to be adopted,
is
eliminated by standardizing
them, as is-done in this standard.
Figures 2
and 3 (see Note ) show typical results on the correlation of compressive
strength of concrete specimens
normally
cured and accelerated-cured
by
the Boiling Water Method and the Warm Water Method respectively.
It
is found that a correlation exists between
the results obtained on concrete
specimens, cured by accelerated method and cured by normal method, for
mixes employing different materials and mix proportions.
It is also found
that the strength of concrete after accelerated
curing ( by either method)
is of the order of 50 percent of that obtained
on normally
cured, 28 days
old specimens. When results of concrete with specific ingredients and mix
proportions
are considered,
the dispersion
of results
is considerably<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>reduced,  and  the coefficient of variation of results from accelerated curing
methods may, in that case, be expected
to be of the same order as
obtained in normally
cured, 28 days conventional tests.
Although the
tests have shown that the correlation
between results from accelerated
curing method and normally cured 28 days conventional tests is not
materially affected by the chemical composition, fineness and strength of
cements, the mix proportions or use of some indigenous admixtures, it is
preferable to establish the actual correlation under site conditions for the
specific  materials  and mix proportions to be adopted, for use in each case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
