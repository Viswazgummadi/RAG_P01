FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 20 October
1967, after the draft finalized by the Soil Engineering
Sec-
tional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Soil stabilization,
in the broadest sense, is the alteration of any inherent
property of a soil to improve its engineering performance.
The classification
of the methods of stabilization
is based on the treatment given to the soil
( for example dewatering, compaction, etc ), process invovled ( for example
thermal, electrical,
etc ) and on additives employed ( for example asphalt,
cement, etc ).
The choice of a particular
method depends on the charac-
teristics of the problem on hand.
For studying the effectiveness of a stabi-
lization technique under investigation,
certain standard methods of test are
required
and these are being published
in parts.
This part [ IS  :  4332
( Part I )-1967 ] lays d own
stabilized
soils for testing.
the method of sampling and preparation
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing in
different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in this field in
this country.
This has been met by basing the standard on B.S. 1924:1957
‘ Methods
of test for stabilized
soils  ’  published by the British Standards
Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,
it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 .l  This standard ( Part I ) lays down the general principles of sampling for
obtaining disturbed samples and the method for preparation
of stabilized
soils for testing.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules  for rounding off numerical values (retied).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:4332(PartI)-1967<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. SAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The purpose for which a sample is required may be considered either as
being to represent as large
a body of material
as possible
in order to
study its average properties, or as being one of a series representing a rela-
tively small body
of ‘material
in order to study the
variability
of its
properties.
The former samples will be referred to as  ‘  representative  ’
and typical of these are those samples taken in advance of construction
to
assess the suitability
of a given source of soil.
The
latter
samples
will
be referred to as  ‘  selected  ’  and typical are those samples taken for control
tests carried out during construction
where the samples represent only a
small proportion of the whole work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Representative
stiples
should be obtained
by taking a number
of
sub-samples from delimited areas from which material is being
sampled,
and these sub-samples should be thoroughly mixed.
The number of sub-
samples should be a minimum of five or more depending on the area.
The
quantity of the resulting sample shall be reduced to that required for tests.
If the quantity of the test sample is one-eighth or more of the total sample
it shall be obtained
by riffling or quartering.
If the quantity of the test
sample is less than one-eighth
of the total sample it shall be obtained
by
mixing
six small samples of appropriate
quantity
taken from the total
sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Where several sub-samples
are taken they should normally
each be
taken so as to eliminate as far as possible any segregation that occurred in
the placing
of the material
being sampled.
For example,
the
coarse
material of a stock-pile or lorry load will normally be concentrated
at the
base and edges,and apex will be deficient in it.
Care should also be taken
that the size of the,sampling
tool is not so small that the coarser material
rolls off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 In some insMaces the whole of a selected sample may be taken from one
@ace without subA&mpling.
For sampling a representative
sample from a
quantity af tiate$al
Qf about 4 m3 in size about 10 sub-samples may be
required.
It is convenient
of the size if the sub-sample
can be chosen
such that no,reduction in the size of this mixed sample is required.
Selected
samples will tjften be taken from soil mixed with a stabilizer, and in many
such instances
sp&
of treatment
will be of greater
importance
than
thoroughness of mixing of the sub-samples.
The changes in uniformity
brought aboutby mixing may be undesirable,
because the selected sample
may become better tiixed than the material from which it was taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 The size  of  sample  required will depend on the particle size distribution
and the purpose to which it to be put.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE---C
sample taken  should 6~  sufficient to  provide the weights of prepared
soil spcci&d for each test in the respective standards.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISi4332(PartI)-1967<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6 Where  samples are being taken for the determination
of moisture
content or for testing without change of moisture content, the use of shallow
trays for storing or carrying should be avoided as these expose the sample
unnecessarily
to evaporation
or rainfall.
The sample should be taken in
air-tight containers.
Likewise, particularly at a site laboratory where much
of the work may be carried out in the open, such samples should be kept
covered over if not sealed up, except
when material
is actually
being
abstracted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Where one-eighth or more of the total sample is being used for
the moisture content determination
the sample shall be obtained, if prac-
ticable by riffling or quartering but otherwise by combining not less than four
sub-samples taken from the main sample.
Where a greater reduction in
size is required it shall be obtained by combining
ten sub-samples taken
from the main sample, as repeated riffling or
quartering
would in many
cases reduce the moisture content of the sample.

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3.1
An amount of water as much close to the required moisture

minimize loss of moisture.
In the case of heavy clays the moist soil shall be
allowed to stand overnight in an air-tight container.
3.4.3.2
The required quantity of stabilizer shah then be added to the
soil and mixed to a uniform condition either by mixing in a mechanical
mixer for about one to two minutes, or by hand, using a spatula, trowel or
other suitable tool.
The remainder of the water shall then be added, and
mixing continued for a further period of about eight minutes.
3.4.3.3
When cement stabilized soil is being mixed for compaction tests
or for the making of cylinder or cube specimens, no more soil than can be
used within 30 minutes of adding the cement to the soil shall be mixed.
If
any stabilized soil remains at the end of this period it shall be discarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

mixer, or by hand using a spatula or other suitable
tool, for 10 minutes or until it is judged by visual inspection that adequate
dispersion of the water has been obtained,
taking care to minimize loss of

<<HEADING level=3>>3.5 Initial Preparation of Previously Mixed Stabilized Soil M&ure
for Strength Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.1  For fine-grained
cohesive soils the sample as received may have
compacted
aggregations
that have been produced as a result of mixing.
For mixes prepared in a laboratory mixer it is recommended
that all the
material
shall be passed through a 20-mm IS Sieve by working material
greater than 10 mm through
the mesh.
The
material
shall
then
be
thoroughly re-mixed by hand before preparing the test specimens. This pro-
cedure will result in a more uniformly compacted
specimen.
For mixes
taken from construction site work the specimens shall be made from all
the
mixed material
and the size of the specimen used shall be determined by
the size of the aggregations of stabilized soil produced by the mixing plant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>35.2
For materials that are stabilized with cement, it is essential that all
operations including
compaction
are completed within about 30 minutes,
after the mixing is completed, to avoid considerable loss in strength which
may occur as a result of the hydration of the cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
