<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Jndian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Jndian
Standards
on 29 September
1989, after the
draft finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With the advent
of large scale cement
plants
and introduction
of sophisticated
technology
for
the
manufacture
of cement,
it has become
absolutely
essential
to have
a precise
control
in quarrying,
crushing,
proportioning
of raw materials
for raw mix preparation,
and stable
operation
of the
kiln
to get desired
quality
of clinker.
For this purpose,
the analytical
data of the
chemical
constituents
is essential
at more frequent
intervals
for necessary
corrective
steps to be taken.
The
conventional
methods
of chemical
analysis,
such
as gravimetric
and
volumetric
methods,
which
are
generally
practised,
though
accurate
and precise,
are time consuming,
resulting
in delay
for
necessary
correc-
tive actions.
In addition
to the conventional
methods
given
in
IS 4032  ;  1985, the
technique
of
X-ray fluorescence
(XRF)
spectroscopy
may
be used
for
routine
quality
control
purposes.
The
advantage
of this technique
is its rapidity
of analysis
and
its suitability
as ‘on-line’
as well
as
‘off-line’ system.
Availability
of quick data is extremely
useful
for
corrrecting,
proportioning
and
controlling
the raw mix to ultimately
achieve
the desired
quality
of clinker
and
cement.
With
this
in view, the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
felt
it necessary
to bring
out
a standard
covering
the
method
for
X-ray
fluorescence
spectrometric
analysis
of hydraulic
cement.
This
standard
lays down the procedure
for
conducting
X-ray
fluorescence
spectroscopy
of major
and
minor
constituents
of hydraulic
cement.
This method
may be suitably
used for analysis
of clinker
as
well as raw materials
and raw mix
used
in cement
manufacture.
Jn case
of dispute
or doubtful
marginal
values
in estimation
of elements
covered
in IS  :  4032  :  1985, the
methods
described
in
IS 4032  :  1985 shall be taken
as refree method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the
technical
committee
responsible
for the
formulation
of the
standard
is
given at Annex
A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the results
of a test or analysis

if the final value,

technique.
This sample
is exposed
to primary
X-rays from
the
X-ray
tube.
The
fluorescent
X-rays
emitted
by the
elements
are
analysed
by using a set of collimators,
dispersing
crystals,
detectors
and intensity

The
intensities
of secondary

are
proportional
to the concentration
of the elements.
A calibra-
tion
is
carried
out
using
a set of
suitable
reference

with varying
ranges
of oxide

Concentration
of the
elements
are determined
from the calibration
