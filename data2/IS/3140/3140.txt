FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 4 June 1965, after the draft finalized by the Painting,
Varnishing
and
Allied Finishes Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Building
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The durability of asbestos cement
is adquate
for most purposes and
the material offers ample protection against water penetration as a roof or
wall covering;
however,
painting
of asbestos
cement products
may be
necessary or desirable for hygienic or esthetic
reasons; for waterproofing
the surface itself to prevent the asbestos sheets from soaking with water; or
for protection against chemical attack when exposed to atmospheres heavily
contaminated
with acid fume.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 Asbestos
cement
is a difficult material
to paint successfully, for
lie
wood it may contain sufficient moisture to cause blistering; like plaster
surfaces it may have variable
suction and since it is a pordand
cement
product
it will contain
alkalies
that may
attack
the paint film.
The
purpose of this standard
is to explain the preparatory
treatment
and the
painting
system
and
provide
guidance
for successfully
overcoming
the
problems connected with painting asbestos cement building products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of this
standard has taken into consideration the views of producers, consumers and
technologists and has related the standard to the manufacturing
and trade
practices followed in the country in this field. Due weightage has also been
given to the need for international
co-ordination
among standards
prevail-
ing in different countries of the world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 Thii  standard

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 8 3140 -  l!KS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  For the purpose
of this standard,
definitions
given
in IS : 1303-I959*
and the following
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Back Painting
-
Coating
the back and
edges of  the  sheets with  a
specilied
paint
to prevent
entry of moisture
from the back.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. NECESSARY
INFORMATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 For
successful
planning’and
execution
of painting
finish of asbestos
cement,
the
following
information
shall
be
furnished
to the
person
in charge:.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Situations
in which the asbestos cement
products are being used in
buildings,
for example,
with respect to sheets whether
in the roof,
in  the side-cladding
or in internal
work; with respect to pipes and
gutters,
whether
in the exterior
or in the interior
of the building.
b) The extent
of exposure
to corrosive atmosphere
for which  pro-
tection
is needed.
c) The extent to which the asbestos cement
has weathered.
d) The purpose
of painting,
whether
for rcsthetic, protective
or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  CHARACTERIST’ZCS
OF  THE SUBSTRATA
AND TREATMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Alkalinity
of tkc Surface
-
Asbestos cement
being based
on Port-
land cement
will be, specially
when new and damp,
sufficiently
alkaline
to
attack oil paint.
The necessary
precautions
in the painting work to over-
come this dif3culty
will be as in 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1
Weathering -
Probably
the
best
way
of reducing
the
risk
of
alkali
attack
is to allow
the sheets
to weather
for some
months.
The
alkalies
become
‘  carbonated
’  on exposure
to air, and rain will often
wash
them ofl the surface
to some extent.
With
long  exposure,
however,
sur-
faces
become
powdery
and dirty,
and offer a poor key for paint
unless
properly
cleaned.
Although
weathering
reduces
the risk, it may
not en-
tirely overcome
the danger
of alkali attack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2
Use  of  Appropriate Paint  $ulcm -
In choosing
paint for a particular
job,  the risk of attack
by alkali
shall
be taken
into consideration.
Paints
which
are
by themselves
highly
resistant
to alkali
attack
may be used.
But where paints used are not alkali-resistant,
at least two coats of alkali-
resistant
primer
shall be applied.
This primer shall
not  only
he resistant
but shall also form  an impervious
barrier
so that alkali cannot
get through<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IO  attack
the paint system above.
For selection
of suitable
paint
systems,
reference
may be made to IS : 2395 ( Part II )t.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3  Asbestos cement
surface
shall
not be treated
with chemicals
like
hydrochloric
acid or zinc sulphate
to neutralize
the alkalies.
Also the use
of chemicals
will often leave a powdery
deposit on the surface
which
may
interfere
with
the adhesion
of paint.
The
use of hydrochloric
acid
for
cleaning
will also make asbestos cement
sheet brittle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 P&o&y
and Suction of Surface-Asbestos
cement
sheets
are
p(lrous  in  varying
degrees and moisture
absorbed
will often be the cause of
failure
of paint
sysrem.
It is, therefore,
essential
that
asbestos
cement
sheets are dry when they are painted.
To ensure
this, each sheet shall
be
left with both sides exposed
to good drying
conditions
for seven to ten days
before painting.
Where
there is danger
of moisture
entering
the sheets from
the back
owing to dampness
or condensation,
‘ hack painting
‘shall be done with an
alkali-resistant
primer
conforming
to I5  :  109-1950*,
a bitumen
paint
con-
forming
to IS  :  1%19jOt
or a colourless
waterproofer.
Usually,
‘  back
painting
’  will
have
to be done
before
the sheets are fixed and
will be
particularly
necessary
where impervious
painting
system is adopted
for.the
treatment
of  the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Glazed

hiore
absorbent
patches,
which
are whiter
than
the rest of the surface
tend
to suck the
medium
out of the paint
and
this is likely
to affect the durability
of the
paint
film on those patches.
The suction
is aiso  generally
high
as well as
variable.
To overcome
this effect the pretreatment
with
primer
as men-
tioned
in
the
paint
schedules
shall
be applied
over  the whole
surface.
Application
of the primer
shall be minimum
two coats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the suction
is so high or variable
that
normal
painting
procedure
is unlikely
to give a satisfactory
finish, suitable
pretreatment
to the surface
shall
be

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1  ,The paints that will be used on asbestos cement sheets shall be as
classified in IS : 2395 ( Part II )*, depending upon the degree of their
alkali resistance and porosity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1.1 Unless otherwise specified, the schedules for painting asbestos
cement products shall generally be in accordance with IS : 2395 ( Part II )*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1.2 Whenever an impervious paint or paint system is used on the
face,  ‘  back painting  ’  shall be done.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2 When the backs of sheets are inaccessible for back painting, a
porous paint shall be chosen. Porous paints will  allow the sheets to
breathe so that there is less risk of trouble  caused by moisture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3  For External
Sheeting -
For external cladding an alkali-resistant
paint either (a) porous, or (b) impervious (with back painting),
may be
used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.3.1 Where it is desired to tone down- the natural coiour of the
sheets, a wash of green copper ( as ferrous sulphate about @l g/ml of
water ) shall be used. This will give a durable brownish stain, although
the finish is unlikely to be uniform.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.4  Gutters, Downpipes, ctc -
Painting of asbestos cement roof gutters
and building pipes will not be satisfactory-unless the inside ( water-carry-
ing ) surface is given a waterproof coating of bitumen; and for pipes this
treatment, of course, will have to be done before erection at site. For
painting the outer surface an alkali-resistant porous paint shall be used.
This will allow the asbestos cement to breathe and so reduce risk of
blistering and flaking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 In the case of previously
painted
surfaces,
the preparation
shall
be as
in  53.1  to 53.4.
5.3.1
In the case
of previously
painted
surfaces,
any
existing
paint
showing
extensive
flaking,
bleaching,
or saponification
should
be removed
and
the surface
allowed
to dry completely.
All loose material
shall
be
removed
by scraping,
sandpapering,
and
washing,
and
then
drying
the
surface
thoroughly.
The choice of the subsequent
paint
system in relation
to the existing
finish shall
be in accordance
with the recommendations
in
IS: 2395 ( Part II )*.
An old glossy surface
shall
always
be well rough-
ened down to facilitate
the adhesion
of subsequent
surface coatings.
5.3.2
Fungus Growth -
Fungus
growth
shall
be treated
in
accordance
with
4.3.
No attempt
shall be made
to burn
off old paint
or to hasten
drying
of the sheets with a blow lamp,
as asbestos cement
will crack
with
explosive
.violence
when heated.
53.3
If the existing
finish
is a bitumen
paint,
this may first be sealed
with two coats of aluminium
paint
or emulsion
paint
in order to prevent
it
from ‘ bleeding
’  through
subsequent
coats of enamel
or oil based paints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTIE
-Where
use of  aluminium or emulsion  paints is not ratisfactory
as a result of
soRening of bitumen
in hot dimata,
solutions
of spirit. soluble shellac or manilla resins.
may be found
suitable
ia certain
cases.
Care shall be takes
when sandpapering
the
sealer colt
on bituminous
surface,
to avoid rupturing  of surface and  bleeding
through
the bitumen.
5.3.4
Before applying
the paint
finish, the sheets shall
be given
a final
sandpapering
and
then
be wasbed
down with clean water and allowed
to
dry thoroughly.
5.3.5
After preparation
of the surface,.if
the old paint
film is sound,
one
or two coats only of any of the finishing
paints
may be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. BACK
PAINTING
6.1 Back painting
shall
be
done
when
an
impervious
paint
system
is
adopted
for the finish.
The back and edges of the sheet shall be protected
with at least one coat of alkali-resistant
primer,
bitumen
paint
or  colour-
less waterproofer.
Care
shall
be taken not to contaminate
the face of the
sheet with bitumen
or waterproofer,
or to pick up material
applied
to the
edges when
painting
the face, because
bitumen
can blend
with and dis-
colour
oil paints,
and waterproofers
will interfere
with
the drying
of paint.
If practicable,
the back painting
shall be done
after
the face of the sheet
has been painted.
In many
cases, normally
back painting
will have to be
done before the sheets are fixed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. PAINTKNG
7.1 Asbestos
sheets shall be thoroughly
dry at the time of painting,
Any
system
of painting
compatible
with
