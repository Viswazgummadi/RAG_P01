<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard (Part II) (FirstRevision)
was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 24 July 1976, after the draft finalized
by the Water Conductor Systems Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This Indian Standard was first published in 1968. Its revision was taken
up with a-view to keeping abreast with ~the technological developments that
have taken place in the field of tunnel design and construction.
This revi-
sion incorporates modified
Fig. 1 which more clearly illustrates A-line
and B-line.
A new geometric shape, egglipse, has also been added to the
list of sections recommended
for adoption for tunnels.
The details for
drawing the egglipse curve have been included as Appendix A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Tunnels are generally used for conducting water through high ground
or mountains, in rugged terrain where the cost of a surface line is exces-
sive and elsewhere as convenience
and economy dictate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard
has been published
in parts.
Other parts of
the
standard are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1 This part (-Part II) lays down only general guidance in regard to
the shape of various sections generally used for tunnels.
However,
fc:
particular project the judgement of the designer is required for making a
final choice of a section considering
the prevailing site conditions;
since
no general -recommendations
can be made to fit in each and every
indiyidual case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>-4.1.1  Circular  Section  -Th
e circular section is most suitable from structural
considerations.
However, it is difficult for excavation, particularly where
cross-sectional area is small.
.For tunnels which are likely to have to resist
heavy inward or outward
radial pressures, it is desirable
to adopt a
circular section.
In case where the tunnel is subjected to high internal
pressure, but does not have good quality of rock and/or adequate rock
cover around it, circular section is considered to be the most suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>FICL 7
TYPICAL EGGLIPSE SECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2
D Section -
D  section would be found suitable in tunnels located
in massive igneous, hard, compacted,
metamorphic
and good  quality
sedimentary
rocks -where the external pressures due to water or unsound
strata upon the lining is slight and also where the lining is not required
to be designed against internal pressure.
The principal advantages of this
section
over horse-shoe
section
(see 4.1.3)
are the added width of the
invert
which gives more
working
floor space
in the heading
during
driving and the flatter
invert which helps to eliminate
the tendency of
wet concrete
to slump and draw away from the tunnel sides after it has
been screeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3
Horse-shoe and Modified Horse-Shoe Sections -
These
sections are
a compromise
between
circular
and  D  sections.
These
sections
are
strong in their resistance
to external
pressures.
Quality
of rock
and
adequate
rock cover in terms of the internal
pressure
to which
the
tunnel is subjected govern the use of these sections.
Modified horse-shoe
section
offers
the
advantage
of flat base for constructional
ease and
change over to circular
section with minimum additional
expenditure
in
reaches of inadequate
rock cover and poor rock formations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.4
Egg Shaped and Egglipsc Sections-
Where
the rock is stratified,
soft and very
closely
laminated
( as laminated
sand
stones,
slates,*
micaceous schists, etc ) and ~where the external pressures and tensile forces<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 4880 ( Part
II ) - 1976<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>in the crown are likely to be high so as to cause serious rock falls, egg
shaped and egglipse sections should be considered.
Inthe
case of these
sections there is not much velocity reduction with reduction in discharge.
Therefore,
these sections
afford advantage
in cases of $ewage tunnels
and tunnels carrying sediments.
Egglipse has advantage over egg shaped
section as it has a smoother curvature and is hydraulically
more efficient.
Details for drawing,egglipse
curve are given in Appendix A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.5  Other Sections -
In addition
to the sections
mentioned
in 4.1.3
to 4.1.4 there may be other composite geometrical
sections which may be
adopted
particularly
for tunnels which are free flowing and often only
partly lined.
If characteristics
of a rock formation are fairly well known
it may be possible to evolve a section which is likely to fit the shape in
which the rock will break
naturally.
Thus,
while a horse-shoe or  D
section is fairly easy to obtain in some formations there are others where
the tunnel crown tends to break into a form more nearly square,
and if
there is no risk of heavy external pressure upon the lining or if the tunnel
is to be unlined there is no reason why the designed cross section
should
not be made to suit the-characteristics
of the rock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.6 The
typical geometry
of both  A-  and B-lines
for some sections
are shown in Fig. 1 and the distance between  A-  and B-lines depends on
the nature and geology of rock and method of tunnelling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
