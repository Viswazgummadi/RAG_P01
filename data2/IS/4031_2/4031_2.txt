<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard (Part 2) (Secorrd Revision)
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Standard methods of testing cement are essential adjunct to the cement specifications.
This standard in different,
parts lays down the procedure
for the tests to evaluate the physical properties of different types of hydraulic
cement. The procedure for conducting
chemical test is covered in IS 4032  :  1985 ‘Methods of chemical analysis
of hydraulic
cement  Cfirst revision)‘.  Originally
all the tests to evaluate the physical properties
of hydraulic
cement were covered in one standard but for facilitating
the use of the standard and future revisions,
the revised
standard was brought out into different parts, each part covering different tests. This part covers determination
of fineness by specific surface by Blaine air permeability
apparatus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The second revision of this standard has been prepared with a view to aligning this test method with European
Standard EN 196 (Part 6) ‘Method of testing cement: Determination
of fineness’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value, observed or
calculated,
is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values  (revised)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
(Part 2) covers
the procedure
for
determining
by Blaine air permeability
apparatus, the
fineness of cement as represented
by specific surface
expressed as total surface area in cm2/g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The timer shall have a positive starting and stopping
mechanism
and shall be capable of being read to the
nearest 0.2 s or better. The timer shall be accurate to
1 percent or better over time intervals up to 300 s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
This method is also being used for determination
of
fineness
of various
other materials.
However,
it should be
understood
that the values obtained
are relative rather than
absolute.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Balances<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Tap the cell to level the cement. Place a second new
filter paper disc on the levelled
cement.
Insert the
plunger
to make contact with the filter paper disc.
Press the plunger gently but firmly until the lower face
of the cap is in contact with the cell. Slowly withdraw
the plunger
about 5 mm, rotate it through
90” and
gently but firmly press the bed once again until the
plunger cap is in contact with the cell. The bed is now
compacted and ready for the permeability
test. Slowly
withdraw the plunger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Compacted
Cement Bed<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  Busis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The compacted
cement  bed  comprises a reproducible
arrangement
of cement
particles
with a specified
volume of air included between the particles. This air
volume is defined as a fraction of the total volume of
the bed and is termed the porosity, e.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Too rapid and vigorous
pressing
may change
the
particle
size distribution
and therefore
change
the specific
surface  of the bed. The maximum
pressure
should
be that
comfortably
exerted by a thumb on the plunger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Air Permeability Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It follows that the volume fraction occupied
by the
cement particles is (l-e).
If Vis the total volume of the
bed, the absolute volume of cement is  V(  l-e) (cm3),
and the mass of cement  m  is pV(l-e)
(g) where p is
the solid density of the cement particles p (g/cm3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1  Basis<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The specific

<<PARAGRAPH>>Agitate the sample of cement to be tested by shaking
for 2 min in a stoppered jar to disperse agglomerates.
Wait for 2 min. Stir the resulting powder gently using
a clean

used will depend
on the nature of the
apparatus
but shall
be such that the value
of p
determined
is accurate
to 0.01 g/cm3. Verify
this
accuracy
by a repeat determination
and record the

<<PARAGRAPH>>Close the top of the cylinder with a suitable plug. Open
the stopcock and with gentle aspiration raise the level
of the manometer
liquid to that of the highest etched
line, close the stopcock and observe that the level of
the manometer
liquid
remains
constant.
If it falls,
remake
the cell -manometer
joint
and check
the
stopcock,
repeat the leakage test until the improved
sealing produces a steady level of the liquid. Open the
stopcock and by gentle aspiration
adjust the level of
the liquid, to that of the highest etched line. Close the
stopcock.
Remove
the plug from the top of the
cylinder.
The manometer
liquid will begin to flow.
Start the timer as the liquid reaches the second etched
line and stop it when the liquid reaches the third etched
line. Record the time f, to the nearest 0.2 s and the
temperature
to the nearest 1°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repeat the procedure with fresh cement beds until two
values
of  V
are  obtained
differing
by less than
0.005 cm3. Record the mean of these two values as  V.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE-
Care should be taken to avoid spilling or splashing the
mercury and any contact between it and the operator’s skin and
eyes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.2  Determination

Prepare a
fresh bed of the same cement with a second sample
following  the  procedure of 5.2.4 or, where there is little
cement
available,
by breaking
up the first bed and

<<PARAGRAPH>>to  is the mean of the three measured times (s), and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Owing to the need for clearance between the cell and
the plunger, the volume of the compacted cement bed
varies for each cell-plunger
combination.
The volume
of the compacted
cement bed shall be established
for
a given cell-plunger
clearance,
this volume is to be
determined
as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Apply a very thin film of light mineral oil to the cell
interior. Place the perforated disc on the ledge in the
cell. Place two new filter paper discs on the perforated
disc and ensure that each covered the base of the cell
whilst lying flat by pressing with a rod.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Take the mean of the three values of  K  as the constant
K  for the apparatus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.3  Recalibration<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repeated use of apparatus may cause changes in the
cement
bed volume
and in the apparatus
constant
(because of the wear of cell, plunger
and perforated
disc). These changes can be determined
with the help
of a so-called
secondary
reference
cement
whose
specific surface has been measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fill the cell with mercury.
Remove any air bubbles
with a clear dry rod. Ensure that the cell is full by
pressing a glass plate on the mercury surface until it is
flush with the cell top. Empty the cell, weigh the
mercury
to the nearest
0.01 g, m2, and record the
temperature.
Remove
one filter paper disc. Form a
compacted cement bed by the method described in and
place on it a new filter paper disc. Refill the cell with
mercury, removing
air bubbles and levelling the top as
before. Remove the mercury,
weigh it to the nearest
0.01 g,  m3,  and check the temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

unusual
particle
size
distributions
and in particular,
fine cements of higher
strength
grades may prove difficult
to form into a
compacted
bed of porosity e = 0.500 by the method
of 5.2.4. Should thumb pressure on the plunger cap fail
to bring it in contact with the top of the cell or if, after
making contact and removing the pressure the plunger
moves upwards,
the porosity
of e = 0.500 shall be
considered
unattainable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
