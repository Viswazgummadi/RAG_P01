Practices Sectional Committee, CED 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 2 ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, atler the draft finalized by the
Building Construction
Practices
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Maintenance
management
in building
industry
is the art of preserving
over a long period
what has been
constructed.
It is as important as construction management or even more.
Whereas construction
stage lasts for
a short period of 2 to 5 years, maintenance
continues
for atleast 20-30 times the construction
phase. Bad
practice of maintenance
adversely affects the environment
in which people work, thus affecting the overall
output.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Even though the adverse effects of deterioration
of a building are known, yet the process of maintenance of the
building is given a very low priority and most of the management decisions are taken by the management on
the basis of expediency, and in most of the cases are unrelated compromises between the physical needs and
availability of finance.
It has been planned to publish the guidelines for maintenance management for buildings
in the following three parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1
a)
Part 1 General,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Part 2 Finance, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Part 3 Labour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers the aspects related to finance management.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard keeps in view the practices
in the field of building maintenance
management
in the country.
Assistance has also been derived from BS 8210:1986
‘Guide for Building Maintenance Management’, issued by
British Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given at Annex A,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS 2:
1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised
)’.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

allocation
of budget
funds.
These will involve
decisions regarding optimum repair reaction items and
the choice of the most appropriate method of execution
( directly employed labour or contract and the best
type of contract ).
This will lead to the need for
budgetary control during the course of the financial
year.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 2 ) provides guidance on
financial
management
concerning
building
maintenance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  REFERENCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standards given below contain provisions
which through
reference
in this text,
constitute
provisions of this standard. At the time of publication,
the editions indicated were valid. All standards are
subject to revision, and parties to agreements based
on this standard are encouraged
to investigate the
possibility of applying the most recent editions of the
standards indicated below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 It would be a good practice to carry out during
the following
financial
year, a technical
audit to
ascertain the extent to which value for money was
obtained from the funds expended in the previous year
and what improvements in management might be made
to improve cost benefits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

:  This includes certain
components
or items which, by virtue of
their extensive use or otherwise, need frequent
repairs. This involves heavy deployment of
human resources.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of this standard,
the following
definitions
and the definitions
given in IS 15183
( Part 1 ) shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

restore the structure, fittings and fixtures to operative
and acceptable standards.
These repairs are carried
out as a continuing programme.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Plinth area shall be calculated as per IS 3861.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

MANAGEMENT
IN BUILDING
MAINTENANCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The planning and control of finance is an important
aspect of maintenance management not only for the
control of maintenance
but also to demonstrate that
the owners are getting value for money and that the
maintenance proposals justifi
the funds requested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5  MAINTENANCE
BUDGETING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
Maintenance budgeting is directed to keeping
building inappropriate condition by the most economic
means and each aspect of maintenance policy bears
on cost. In maintenance budgeting, there are two prime
elements relating to what to budget for, and how to
assess its cost.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Financial considerations start with the development
of maintenance programmed and the preparation of
budget proposals.
They also include the preparation

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 The life of materials and rate of deterioration
of elements of buildings including electrical/mechanical
services are subject to many influences.
Efficient
maintenance management is an important factor but
loads to which buildings
services
are subjected,
intensity of use of internal finishes and severity of
climatic conditions are others. These factors may be
suitably considered while preparing the budget. Detail
guidance regarding factors affecting maintenance is
given in IS15183(Part

like PF, ESI, Bonus, etc, and other prevalentimandatory
regulations of the respective States/Union Territories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The scope of work should be realistically
established to determine its cost for budget purposes.
Realistic costing is needed not only in the interest
of accuracy but to retain the confidence of general
maintenance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
