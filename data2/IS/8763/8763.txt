FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 28 February
1978, after
the draft
finalized
by the Soil
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Undisturbed
sampling
of soil is a common
feature
in the field of soil
mechanics
and foundation
engineering
for finding
in situ characteristics
of soils.
In nature
soils are found
in variety
and
in different
states
of
compactness
and samplers
have been
designed
to collect
soils with least
disturbance
within
practical
limitations.
Cohesionless
soils
are still
problematic
as far
as undisturbed
sampling
is concerned,
and
hence
in situ  testing
is more common
for these soils.
Samples
of coarse or loose
sand readily
fall out when ordinary
sampling
equipment
with an open
end is used.
This guide has, therefore,
been prepared
to provide
guidance
in obtaining
undisturbed
samples
in sand
and \covers
two
important
techniques
of undisturbed
sampling
in
uncemented
sands,
namely,
stationary
piston
sampling.with
drilling
fluid
circulation
technique
and
compressed
air technique.
kowever,
even with these methods
the sample
obtained
may be considered
to be only
relatively
undisturbed.
These
samples
are generally
used
for the determination
of  in  situ density.
It
also briefly
mentions
the technique
of rotary
core drilling
in cemented
sands.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Special
techniques
in sampling
of sand
have
not been
covered
in
this guide
as these
techniques
are costly and
are employed
on a limited
scale in very special
cases.
Some of such techniques
in use are mentioned
in 0.3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 Freezing
or impregnation
form
special
techniques
beneficially
used in sampling
sands
under
favourable
conditions.
Freezing
ensures
solidification
of the lower part
of the sample
to retain
it in the sampler
tube.
Solidification
can also be achieved
in some cases by impregnating
a chemical
such as kerosene
at subzero
temperature
in place
of drilling
fluid,
mixing
alcohol
with
dry ice,
emulsified
asphalt
and
grout,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard
due
weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in this
fieid in this country.

General -
In this method,
partial
vacuum
is created
above
the
sample while withdrawing
the stationary
piston
sampler.
The
coating
of drilling
Auid at the shoe keeps the sand sample
intact
during
with-
drawal.
Since
the
piston
will
be at the shoe
of the
sampler
at the
beginning
of the
sampling
operation,
no shavings
can enter
the tube
during
sampling.
The
consistency
of the drilling
fluid shall
depend on
the

the

density
and
the

and
For fine sand, a drilling

gravity
of  1.05  will be satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Description
of Technique
and Procedure
of Sampling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1  &rural
-
In this technique
compressed
air is used
to keep the
ground
water
separated
from the sample
in order
to  avoid
dispersion
of
sampled
sand.
This is done by withdrawing
after sampling,
the sampler
tube
into
a bell
where
the ground
water
has been
displaced
by com-
pressed
air through
a continuous
pumping
process.
The
depth of water
in the drill holes govern
the pressure
of compressed
air.
The method
is
suitable
for sampling
sand under
water table.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.2
Procedure of Sampling<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.2.1
The
drill
hole
shall
be advanced
with
a suitable
boring
method
using
152 mm diameter
casing
down to the depth of sampling.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.2
Having
reached
the required
depth,
the sampler
shall
be
pushed
into soil by means
of a drill rod and the spacer block and ohackie
arrangement.
The
spacer
block
above
the
bell
limits
the length
of
sampling
stroke,
thus, avoiding
overdriving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.3  Tlie
drill
rod shall
then
be
withdrawn.
Compressed
air
shall be forced into
the bell
by means
of a foot pump.
The
air in turn
pushes
the diaphragm
of the relief
valve
so as to maintain
an
excess
pressure
of 140 kN/ ma ( 1’4 kgf/cm*
)  thus
closing
the diaphragm
check
valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.4
Having
expelled
the water in the bell,
as indicated
by the
rising
air bubbles,
the sampler
shall be withdrawn
into
the bell and the
entire
assembly
raised
to the surface
by
means
of a cable.
During
raising
of
the
assembly
to
the
surface,
water
should
be
poured
continuously
to keep
the
drill
hole
full.
The
foot
pump
shall
be
conrinuously
operated
during
withdrawal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.5
The
spacer
block
above
the bell shall
then
be removed
so
that
the sampler
is pushed
out of the bell and sampling
tube
disconnect-
ed.
A filter plug shall be placed
in the lower end.
The suction
created
by check valve
shall
then be released
and undisturbed
sample
obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 SIow
rotary
technique
using
core
barrels
may
be
used
to obtain
undisturbed
cores in cemented
sand.
If necessary,
drilling
fluid may be
used during
advancement
for stabilization
of the hole.
In certain
cases,
where
drilling
is susceptible
to cave in double
tube core barrels
may be
used.
If such cemented
sands exist
at shallow
depths,
preferably
block
samples
may be obtained,
by isolating
a 200-300
mm square column
of
soil followed
by covering
it by a slightly
larger hollow
box open
at top
and bottom.
The
annular
space
between
the rock
and box shall
then
be filled by paraffin.
The sample shall be trimmed
by a spade and then
covered
at top and bottom
also by paraffin
so as to preserve
its moisture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
