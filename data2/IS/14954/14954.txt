<<PARAGRAPH>>Dams and Reservoirs Sectional Committee, WRD 9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, afier the draft finalized by the Dams and
Reservoirs Sectional Committee had been approved by the Water Resources Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Conservation of water is the most important prerequisite for proper management of water resources and hence,
large number of earth and rockfill dams have been constructed in India, most of them afier’independence.
While
these dams have contributed to the development of the nation, some of them also pose as potential hazard because
of catastrophic damage which can take place if the reservoir water stored behind the dam is suddenly released due
to any failure or accident. The safety of the dam is thus of paramount importance and any deterioration or disorder
observed in the dam, therefore, warrants immediate suitable strengthening. Strengthening may sometimes be necessary
to restore the stipulated utility of the dam and reservoir.
Strengthening may-also be required for upgrading the
stability of the dam due to inadequacies in original design, deficiencies in construction, ageing, increase in storage/
spillway capacity/seismicity or modification in codal design requirement. However, remedial measures imply restoration
of original state and stability of dam after it has experienced some distress like breach, slope failure, settlements,
crack formation, piping, subsidence/upheaval
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main object of strengthening the dam through remedial measures is not only to improve its safety alone but
also to restore it fully to meet the designed requirements and estimated benefits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no 1S0 standard on the subject.
This standard has been prepared based on indigenous manufacturers’
data/practices prevalent in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the committee-responsible
for formulating this standard is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised
)’.  The number of Significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

measures for earth and rockfill darns. The distress and
remedial measures pertaining to concrete/asphalt faced

remedial measures for the works relating to increase
in spillway

<<HEADING level=3>>3  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The remedial measures best suited for a dam depend
upon many factors. The type of treatment should be
selected/adopted
on the basis of techno-economic
considerations
to ensure the safety and restoration
of embankment within stipulated period. The types
of treatments discussed in the standard are overall
and general and should be considered together with
specific instructions that might have been stipulated
during design, construction or maintenance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2  Loss of Shear
Strength<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Saturation of the soil may result in high value of pore-
pressure
and reduction

of the
foundation which create disorders in and the form of
downstream slips degradation of foundation material
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3

of the foundation itself or opening/cracks development

<<PARAGRAPH>>The main objective of treatment is to restore the water
tightness of the dam and foundation. The method of
treatment maydiffer for foundation, dams with upstream
membrane,
dams
with
impervious
core
and
homogeneous dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under-water observations with video equipment and
remotely operated vehicles ( ROV ) or divers for
inspecting inaccessible areas under-water may be used
for detecting
the deterioration
in foundation

<<PARAGRAPH>>Periodic and systematic measurements in respect of
seepage, phreatic level, uplift, pore pressure, turbidity,
horizontal displacement, vertical displacement and
rainfall may also be used indetecting the deterioration
in foundation and dam body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vepending upon the nature of rock, grouting maybe
done either from the upstream or top of the dam
ensuring the formation of continuous barrier in the
rock along with core. The grouting may be carried out
with
ordinary
portland
cement
or
chemicals
( see IS 6066 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Investigation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Test results on soil samples from dam and foundat~on
and chemical and physical analysis of seepage can
be used to investigate the deterioration in respect of
shear strength, seepage and internal erosion of the
foundation and dam body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Soil<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the service time of reservoir
it is usually
impractical to provide a positive cut-offor open partial

measure. However, a full cut-off maybe adopted by
way of providing any one of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 ‘REMED[AL MEASURES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.I Strengthening, repairs and remedial measures are
not amenable to standardization and should be carefully
selected
depending
upon (a) the risk element as
influenced by the height of the dam, reservoir volume
and potential loss to life and properties, etc, (b) the
economic value of water stored, (c)nature of foundation
stratum,
and (d) materials
and methods
used in
construction of the dam.
Measures generally used
are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The main cause of sand boils and slushy conditions
on the downstream of dam is the excess hydrostatic
pressure and seepage through deep pervious strata
underlying the dam. The severity of under-seepage
both in respect of excessive hydrostatic pressure and
seepage-flow
is dependent
upon head of water,
permeability of substratum and characteristics of the
upper strata of downstream portion. This problem may
be tackled by properly
designed and constructed
downstream
loading berm with suitable
inverted
filter, drainage trench, upstream clay blanket with or
without relief wells or their suitable combination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main aim of the remedial measure is to collect the
seepage water inside the dam and through foundation
and provide it a safe exit through the drainage system,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1
Perched
Water<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To drain the perched water or high phreatic lines at

places leading to local slushiness in the

may be adopted:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Constructing vertical drains inthe downstream

Before pumping any slurry, the cracks are washed with

appreciable shrinkage of the slurry due to drying, the
process is repeated. Finally the cracks should be sealed

of Dam Crest<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cuts, bulges, slope slides, settlement, unwarranted
human and animal activities etc. In such cases, a fresh
dam section bwed on IS 8826 and 1S7894, be evolved
and fitted over the existing
dam section in most
economical methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Raising of dam crest maybe required on free board
consideration. For raising a dam crest, strengthening
of the profile by downstream loading may be done.
While taking up the upstream strengthening for raising
the dam crest, necessary precautions should be taken
in respect of maintaining the reservoir outlet, removal
of embankment
protection,
possible
presence
of
sediments etc. In case of a zoned dam, the prolongation
and strengthening of the core should be given due
consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8  Upstream
Slope Stabilization
Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Following methods may be employed for upstream
slope stabilization:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flattening of the slope and/or reloading on
the upstream
toe. This may be done by
constructing large width rockfill berm at lower
level. Properly designed flatter slope can then
be constructed from this lower level berm to
the top of the dam,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For any.enlargement, alteration, rehabilitation, repair

<<PARAGRAPH>>If the rehabilitation would require substantial structural
modification or ifbaiic assumptions and environmental

have considerably changed, the whole structure should
undergo a new stability analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Designing of any part or whole of any component of
the embankment dam should be done as per current

should
be carefully
surveyed
