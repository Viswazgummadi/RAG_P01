<<PARAGRAPH>>unslaked
lime,
the
use of masonry
cement
is
quite
popular
in a number
of countries
abroad
and its use should
be-encouraged
in  this country
also.
The use
of masonry
cement
will not only
improve
the quality
of masonry
mortars
but will
also
meet
the
emergent
need
to increase
the
production
of
cement
by
better
utilization
of
available
resources
in
the
country.
Masonry
cement
is.
however,
not
intended
for use in
structural
“oncrete,
for flooring
and foundation
work
or for reinforced
and prestressed
concrete
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Second
Kevision
)
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on
3 October
1988,
after
the draft
finalized
by
the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional.
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Masonry
cement
is obtained
by
intimately
grinding
a mixture
of Portland
cement
clinker
and gypsum
with pozzolanic
or inert
materials,
and air
entraining
plasticizer
in suitable
propor-
tions, generally
to a fineness
greater
than
that
of
ordinary
Portland
cement.
Masonry
cement
is
chiefly
intended
for
use in masonry
mortars
for
brick,
stone and concrete
block masonry,
and for
rendering
and
plastering
work.
Because
of its
property
of producing
a smooth,
plastic,
cohe-
sive
and
strong,
yet
workable,
mortar
when
mixed
with
fine
aggregates,
masonry
cement
is
considered
superior
to lime mortar,
lime-cement
mortar
or cement
mortar.
Lime
mortars
are
relatively
weaker
in strength
and slower setting
and
they
sometimes
bleed
under
presstire.
Ordinary
cement
mortars,
although
fast setting
and
capable
of high
strength
development,
are
harsh,
non-plastic
and
non-cohesive
with
the
result that they cannot
take up the shrinkage
and
temperature
movements
in the masonry
and are
liable
to result
in
comparatively
wide
cracks
passing
right
through
the
bricks
or building
blocks
as compared
to a number
of evenly
distributed
hair cracks in the joints
which
occur
when
weaker
mortars
containing
lime are used.
Properly
proportioned
and
gauged
lime-cement
mortars
can
be
made
to possess
the
desired
pioperties
of a good
masonry
mortar
but
the
preparation
of
lime-cement
mortars
is time
consuming
and also unslaked
lime and magnesia,
when present
in such
mortars,
can cause delayed
expansion
and
consequently
defects
in
the
masonry
and
plaster
work.
In
order to avoid
the necessity
for mixing
cement
and lime,
and in
order
to minimize
the risk of trouble
from expan-
sion due
to the presence
of small
quantities
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

standard
was first issued
as an emer-

in 1966 to meet
the immediate
needs of the
