<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee, RVD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 17 ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had been approved by the River Valley
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In measurement of works of river projects, a large diversity of methods exists at present according to local
practices. Lack of uniformity creates complications regarding measurements and payments. This standard is
being formulated in various parts, covering each type of work separately. Part 17 is intended to provide a
uniform basis for measuring the work done in respect of hydromechanical and iron works for river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of measurement made in accordance with this standard, if the final value, observed or
calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
value (revised)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3 Weights shall be worked out to nearest 0.5 kg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following standard contains provisions which
through reference in this text, constitutes provision
of this standard. At the time of publication, the edition
indicated was valid. All standards are subject to revision,
and parties to agreements based on this standard are
encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying
the most recent edition of the standard indicated
below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3 GENEBAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Hydromechanical
works are not amenable to
simple measurement techniques for the purpose of
payment. The bill of quantities is framed in such a way
that measurement for the purpose of payment can be
done on the basis of completion of various stages of
work carried out in accordance with specifications and
approved drawings. As such the bill of quantities and
detailed scope of work is generally brought out in terms
of sets, or numbers, of equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 BILL OF QUANTITIES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Items of work shall fully describe the materials and
truly represent the work to be executed. For the purpose
of this standard the works shall be categorised into
the stages/activities
given in 4.1. The stages are
applicable to all components of hydromechanical works
including first and second stage embedded parts, gate
structures, stoplogs, bulkhead gates, lifting beams and
trash racks, hoists and appurtenances, pcnstocks and
pressure shaft liners, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Clubbing of Items<<HEADING_END>>

up of clubbed items is agreed to be on basis of detailed
description of items, stated in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
