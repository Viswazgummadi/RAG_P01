<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 2 ) ( Second
Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards on 31 August 1987. after the draft
finalized by the Structural Safety Sectional Com-
mittee had been approved by the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1  With the increased adoption of the Code,
a number of comments were received on the pro-
visions on live load values adopted for different
occupancies. Simultaneously  live load  surveys
have been carried out in America and Canada to
arrive at realistic live loads based on actual deter-
mination of loading ( movable and immovable )
in different occupancies. Keeping this in view
and other developments in the field of wind
engineering,
the Sectional Committee responsible
for the preparation of the Code has decided to
prepare the second revision of IS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Buildmg  Divi-
sion Council.
0.2 A building has to perform many functions
satisfactorily. Amongst these functions are the
utility of the building for the intended use
and occupancy, structural safety, fire safety;
and compliance with hygienic, sanitation, venti-
lation and day light standards. The design of
the building is dependent upon the minimum
requirements prescribed for each of the above
functions. The minimum requirements pertaining
to the structural safety of buildings are being
covered in this Code by way of laying down
minimum<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>:  875 in the
following five parts<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>:
Part<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1  Dead loads
Part 2 Imposed loads
Part 3 Wind loads
Part 4 Snow loads
Part<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>design  loads<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>which  have to be assumed
for dead loads, imposed loads, snow loads and
other external loads, the structure
would be
required to bear. Strict conformity to loading
standards recommended in this Code, it is hoped,
will not only ensure the structural safety of the
buildings which are being designed and construct-
ed in the country and thereby reduce the hazards
to life and property caused by unsafe structures,
but also eliminate the wastage caused by assuming
unnecessarily heavy loadings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5  Special loads and load combinations
Earthquake load is covered in a separate
standard, namely IS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1893-1984*   which should
be considered along with above loads.
0.3.2 This Code<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>)  deals with imposed
loads on buildings produced by the intended
occupancy or use.
In this revision, the following<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(  Part 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>importalit  changes have been made:
a) The use of the term ‘live load’ has been
modified to ‘imposed load’ to cover not
only the physical
contribution due to
persons but also due to nature of occu-
pancy, the furniture and other equipments
which are a part of the character of the
occupancy.
b) The imposed loads on floors and roofs
have been rationalized based on the
codified data available in large number
of latest foreign national standards, and
other literature. Further, these values
have been spelt out for the major occu-
pancies as classified in the National
Building Code of India as well as the
various service areas appended to the major
occupancies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This Code was first published in 1957 for the
guidance of civil engineers, designers and archi-
tects associated with the planning and design of
buildings. It included the provisions for the basic
design loads ( dead loads, live loads, wind loads
and seismic loads<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>)  to be assumed in the design
of buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In  its firs! revision in 1964, the
wind  pressure provisions were modified on the
basis of studies of wind phenomenon and its
effects on structures, undertaken by the special
committee in consultation with the Indian
Meteorological Department. In addition to this,
new clauses on wind loads for butterfly type
structures were included; wind<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>,pressure  coeffi-
cients for sheeted roofs, both curved and sloping,
were modified; seismic load provisions were delet-
ed ( separate code having been prepared ) and
metric system of weights and measurements was
adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Provision has been included for sign

the different loadings specified. for
different occupancies and to avoid possi-
ble misuse in view of conversion of
occupancies.
The value of loads on parapets and
balustrades have been revised with its

<<PARAGRAPH>>§The  loading in industrial buildings ( workshops and factories ) varies considerably and  SO  three loadings
under the terms ‘light’, ‘medium’ and ‘heavy’ are introduced in order to allow for more economical designs but
the terms have no special meaning in themselves other than the imposed load for which the relevant floor is design-
ed.
It is, however, important particularly in the case of heavy weight loads, to assess the actual loads to ensure
that they are not in excess of 10<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

loadings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
