<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft had been finalized by the Soils and
Soil
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With a view to establish uniform procedures
for determination
of different
characteristics
of
soils and also for facilitating
the comparative
study of the results,
an Indian
Standard
Method
of test for soils, IS 2720 has been published
in 41 parts.
This part covers the determination
of
the compressive
strength
of a specimen of saturated
cohesive
soil in the
triaxial
compression
apparatus
under conditions
in which the cell pressure is maintained
constant
and there
is no
change in the total water content
of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published in 1971.
In this first revision
apart
from
general
updation.
the three amendments
issued have been incorporated
and
the quantities
and dimensions
have
been given in SI units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with
the final value,
observed or
calculated,
expressing
the
result of
a test or
analysis, shall
be
rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(  revised )‘.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value
should
be the
same as that
of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 In this standard
the
term

is used
to
denote
th: soil submitted
to the laboratory
for
the
testing
and the term <specimen’
refers
to a portion
of the sample
upon which the test is performed.
2 The result
of any
test
made in accordance
with
this standard
requires
interpretation
in relatiaa
to
the nature
of the
soil

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1 The  most
convenient
method
of
recording
the
mode
of failure
is by
m:ans
of
sketch
indicating
the position
of
the
failure
planes.
The angle of
the failure
plan (s) to the horizontal
may be r;cor-
ded, if required.
These records
should
be comple-
ted without
undue delay to avoid
loss of moisture
from specimen.
2 Comparison
with the recorded
mass of the
speci-
men before
testing
provides
a check on the
imper-
meability
of the rubber
membrane
if water has been
used  as  th: operating
fluid in the cell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.4
The compression
modulus
of the rubber
membrane
cannot
be measured
directly
but
may be assumed
to
be
equal
to
the
modulus
measured
in extension.
The extension
modulus
of a circumferential
strip
( 25 )
mm wide
cut
from the
membrane
may
be
determined
by
means
of
the
arrangement
shown
in
Fig. 1.
The contact
faces between
the rubber
and
the
glass rods should
be dusted
with
talc
powder
to reduce
friction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to the procedure
given
in
this
standard
the
difference
between
the
initial
