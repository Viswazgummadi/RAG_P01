<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Third Revision ) was adopted by the Rureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft
firalized
by Watcrproofirg
ard Damp-Proofing
Sectional Commit tee had been approved
by
the Civil Engineerir g Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is the third revision of the stardard.
A number of standards
referred
in the second
revision
of the stardard
have undergone
revision since its publication
in 1976.
This
revision
is based on
further experience
gained in this work since its previous revision
and it takes
care of the latest
revision of the referred
standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen felt is extensively
used for damp-proofing
and waterproofing
purposes
both
in basement
and in roof finish.
The specification
for the material
is covered
in IS 1322  :  1982 and IS 7193  :
1974. IS 1346  :  1991 gives the guidance related to waterproofing
of roofs with bitumen
felt and the
general features relating to damp-proofing
and waterproofing
with regard to design
details, surface
preparation,
drainage, etc, are covered in IS 3067  :  1988.
This standard
is intended to cover only
the execution
part of the work relating to application
of bitumen felt to damp-proofing
treatment
to foundation,
walls and basement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage has been given to international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing in different countries in addition
to relating
to the
practices in the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1  SCOPE
6.2 Damp-Proofing Treatment Above  Ground
Level
1.1 This
standard
covers
the
methods
of
application
of bitumen
felts for damp-proofiing
treatment
to foundations,
basements
and walls
of buildings
to
prevent
the
penetration
of
moisture and water from an external
source at
or below ground level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The damp-proofing
treatment
for floors
and for
walls shall be as described
below.
If a bitumi-
nous
primer
has been recommended,
this shall
first be brushed
over the
roof
surface
and
allowed to dry.
Generally
a quantity
of 0’2 to
0’4 l/m* is recommended:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Heavy Treatment ( Three Layers of Felt ):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The site shall be kept
free of water
by
continuous
pumping till the whole
work
and the construction
of required structural
protection
for the damp-proofing
treat-

is
completed.
To
ensure
good
adhesion
between
structural
surface
and
damp-proofing
treatment,
suitable
methods
to
dry
the
surface
shall
be
adoptl:d,
where\ er necessary;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In spite
of the
best
arrangements
made
for pumping
out the water,
the horizontal
surface
on which
the damp-proofing
treat-
ment
is to
be laid
may
remain
wet.
Jn
such a case the first coat of bitumen
which
is laid hot on damp
surface
may not stick,
however,
the purpose
is served
if the
first
layer of felt adheres
to
the
bitumen
and
sufficient
care is taken
to ensure
that
the
overlapping
joints
are well stuck;

so
that the first course of the bitumen
shall

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3  Laying of Felt<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The felt shall be laid as mentioned
below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The felt shall be first cut to
required
lengths, brushed

clean surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the surface had been prepared
and
the cement
rendering
and
the
corner
fillets have set and a primer coat has been
applied,
the strip
of felt prepared
for
laying is rolled up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The laying shall commence
on the
floor
and shall be completed
before
treatment
is applied to the walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rolled up felt is laid on one end of
the floor
the
hot
bonding
material
is
poured on to the floor in front of it accross
the  fuli
width
of the felt which is then
unrolled gradually with a slight
pressure
to squeeze out the excess bitumen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the whole
floor
has been covered
and the overlapping
joints properly
sealed,
the felt is laid on the vertical
face of the
walls in a similar
manner.
In this case
the roll of felt is held at floor
level and
then gradually unrolled up the
wall face
as hot bitumen
is poured
between
the
roll and the wall face.
The minimum overlapping
joints at sides
and ends of strips shall be 100 mm; and
The subsequent layers of felt shall break
joint
midway
between
the joints of the
layer immediately
beneath it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 METHOD
OF LAYING DAMP-PROOFING
TREATMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The damp-proofing
treatment
shall be laid in
such a way so as to ensure
an effective
barrier
all over against water penetration.
For this pur-
pose,  the
damp-proofing
treatment
shall
be
continuous
throughout
and the overlap joints in
felts, wherever they exist, shall be correctly made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
