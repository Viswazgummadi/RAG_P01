<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 30 August 1985, after
the draft
finalized
by the Cost Analysis and
Cost Estimates
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Earthwork
excavation
is encountered
in foundation for various struc-
tures such as dams and power
houses and in quarries for fill materials
required for earthern dams embankments,
etc.
Since the quantities are
large and leads and lifts in most cases beyond
manual capacity use of
equipment in majority of cases cannot be avoided.
In order to estimate
the cost of equipment
as components
of cost of excavation the output of
equipment
has to be estimated.
The output of equipment will depend on
various factors, namely, capacity of equipment,
working speeds, working
conditions,
type of strata, leads and lifts involved, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expres-
sing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded offin accordance
with IS  :  2 - 1960”. The number
of significant
places retained
in the
rounded olff value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard lays down the norms
for various factors involved
in
estimating the output of machinery used in earthwork

(  Days  X  Months X Hours )

Double shift

Three shift
2 500 ( 25 x 8 x 12’5 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
Where 200 working days are not available
because
of peculiar
situ-
ation existing on account
of location
of sites
of works,
the scheduled
working
hours shall
be reduced
proportionately.
Similarly,
if more
than
200 days are
available
the number of hours shall be increased
proportionately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
For old machines
( after the first overhaul ) scheduled
working hours
shall be taken as 80 percent
of these given above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  STANDARD HOURLY PRODUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Standard hourly production
is the amount of earth excavated/moved
per hour and may be estimated as follows:<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>where
Q = standard hourly production

A =  production

Speed range for this type of equipment in operation
will generally range from 3 to 5 km/h forward and 5 to  7  km/h
in reverse.
Actual speeds shall however
be selected from the
manufacturer’s
specifications.
In the case of equipment fitted
with torque convertors,
the actual speeds shall be obtained as
given below:
1)  Bull dozer
Travel speed = Maximum speed  x  0’75
Return speed = Maximum speed  x  0’85<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>: 2) Dozer shovel and wheel loader
Travel
speed = selected speed  X  0’80
Return speed = selected speed  X 0’80<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Towed scraper
Travel speed = 3 to 5 km/h
Returnspeed
= 5 to 7 km/h
b)  Dump truck and motor scraper -
Depending
on the average
rolling
resistance
and average
grade resistance
of the haul
road, maximum
speed can be obtained from the travel perfor-
mance curve. This speed is the ideal speed and can be modified
by a speed factor
depending

for power shovel and diesel draglines
may be calculated as under:
Q = Qi  X  E x FAS
where
Q = standard hourly production
in cubic metres,
Qi = ideal hourly production
