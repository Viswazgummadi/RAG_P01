<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft finalized by the Hydroelectric
Power House Structures
Sectional Con;mittee had been approved
by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The generator
foundation
of a hydro-power
station takes various -forms depending mainly upon the
shaft arrangement.
In the case of vertical
shaft generator,
its foundation
is located
almost directly
over the spiral casing.
For horizontal
shaft generator,
the foundation
is in the form of rectangular
block with a recess in the middle for housing
the air coolers.
Design of foundation
of vertical
generator comparatively
is more complicated as it involves configuration
comprising more structural
elements as against that of the horizontal
generator which generally has mass concrete foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is virtually impossible to deal with all possible
variations
in generator
foundation
arrangement.
Hence use of general
procedures described in this standard
should be based on sound engineering
judyement of the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published
in 1974.
This revision
has been taken up in the light of the
comments received
from the members.
The major
modifications
made in this first revision are as
follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The hydraulic thrust has been included under necessary data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Important
design considerations
have been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) A separate paragraph on block-outs is included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2  :  1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised 1’.
The number
of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

F<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Generator Foundation Types<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
shape
and
configuration
of
generator
foundation
largely depends upon: ( a > the shaft
arrangement,
whether
the
shaft is vertical
or
horizontal,
and ( b) location of the thrust bearing.
The details
of foundations,
however,
may also
vary depending upon the design and configuration
of the
equipment.
For
the
purpose
of this
standard,
the
generator
foundation
is broadly
classified under the following categories:
a><<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5  SOME IMPORTANT DESIGN
CONSIDERATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4 Vertical load on lower bracket,
which may
comprise the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  Special care should be taken to avoid the
danage to foundations against vibrations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Weight of lower bracket, brakes and jacks;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 In
case of
use of
horizontal
jacks for
transferring
the load through the thrust bearings
at the top of the generator
to the barrel
around
location
of the jacks.
This portion
should be
designed as a ring to take hoop tension,
moments
and shears for worst combination
of loads during
normal
running
of machines,
at the
time of
erection and at the time of double short circuit of
the rotor windings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Load
while
lifting the
rotor
on jacks,
wherever applicable; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Weight of thrust bearing
generator
rotor,
shaft, turbine rotating
parts and hydraulic
thrust ( not applicable for suspended
type
generator  ) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.5 Torsional
load, which may comprise
the
following:
I<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6  LOADS AND FORCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Maximum
tangential
force at the stator
sole plate due to
short circuit in stator
winding; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The
generator
foundation
is to transfer
static as well as rotating forces due to stationary
and
rotating
parts.
Rotating
parts
generate
torsional
as well as radial
forces.
In case of
urn brella/semi-umbrella
machines,
these
static
and dynamic forces are transferred
down to sub-
structure
mass concrete
through
lower bracket
resting on the lower bracket
support end through
upper
bracket
( lower as well as through thrust<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Tangential force at lower bracket sole plate
due to braking or bearing friction
torque,
wherever applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.6 Radial
force, which
may
comprise
the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 7207  :  1992<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radial
force
on stator
sole
plate/RCC
generator housing due to one sided magnetic
attraction;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>during the machine in action from that of average
surrounding
tempeature.
However, a minimum
of 25 mm bars at 30 cm centre-to-centre
should
be provided on both the faces in both directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radial force on lower guide bearing due to
one sided magnetic attraction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.12 All possible
combinations
of forces and
loads should be examined for evaluation of critical
moments,
shears and
thrust
on the
generator
foundation.
However, the maximum radial force
due to one sided magnetic attraction
caused due
to short-circuiting
of half of the rotor poles need
not be considered alongwith seismic loads.
*<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.7 The loads on a horizontal
shaft generator
on
a common
bed
plate
may
comprise
the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Weight of stator,
rotor,
pedestal
bearing
and bed plate;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 EFFECT OF VIBRATJONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Weight of overhang exciter and runner;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 To take the effects df vibrations into account
guidance may be taken from IS 2974 ( Part 3 )  :
1975.
Further
in a hydro-electric
power station
foundation,
should be checked against the effects
of runaway speed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Maximum
vertical
force
due
to
short
circuit in stator;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Bearing reaction
due to unbalanced
jets;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Axial hydraulic thrust.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 BLOCK-OUTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.8  Forces Due to Eccentricity in Rotating Parts
Although each generator should be well balanced,
yet certain unbalanced
forces, caused by the fact
that the centre of gravity of rotating parts may not
exactly coincide
with the axis of rotation,
which
induce foundation
vibrations, should be accounted
for in the design of foundation
in consultation
with the manufacturers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Efforts should be made to provide
minimum
possible
number
of block-outs
in the concrete
barrels.
For supporting
purposes
steel plate/flat
embedments
be used for welding the supporting
brackets
instead
of providing
block-outs
for
grouting bolts.
For making block-outs
wherever
unavoidable, thermocole form-work be used which
gets dissolved in petrol
instead of wooden
one.
Provision of block-outs for tightening
the bolts at
both the ends be made for effective installation
of the bolts, wherever
possible,
well designed
non-shrink
grouts be used for grouting
of the
bolts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.9  Yibrations Due to Unequal Ground Settlement
Vibrations may also be induced due to change in
verticality
of the shaft as a result
of unequal
ground settlement which may take place over time
during the course of operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9 MATERIALS AND PERMISSIBLE
STRESSES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.10 The
generator
foundation
should
be
designed
for seismic loads in accordance
with
IS 1893 : 1984.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 Reinforced Concrete<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should conform to IS 456 : 1978.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Structural Steel<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.10.1 In case of generator
foundation
located
in seismic zones the sole plates for stator and
bottom
brackets
should be anchored
not only
vertically and transversely but also radially.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should conform to IS 800 : 1984.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 Permissible Stresses<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.11  Forces Due to Temperature and Shrinkage
Forces due to temperature
variation and shrinkage
in generator
foundation
should be catered for in
tht: design.
The temperature
variation should be
taken as the difference of temperature
developed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Permisible stresses should be taken in accordance
with IS 456 : 1978 and IS 800 : 1984.
9.3.1 Concrete
and steel stresses may be suitably
reduced
to
take
care
of
indeterminacy
of
loads/structure
and dynamic forces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
