0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the

Division Council and Textile
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Cotton tape impregnated
with bitumen-based
compound is used for

by this standard
are suitable for voltages up to
11 000  volts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or calculated,

ance with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant
places
retained
in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7. SAMPLING
AND CRITERIA
FOR CONFORMITY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Lot -In
any consignment,
all the rolls of the same width
and
belonging to the same batch of manufacture
shall be grouped together to
constitute a lot.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1 The conformity
of the lot to the requirements
of this specification
shall be ascertained
for each lot separately.
The number of rolls to be
selected for testing from each lot shall be in accordance
with Table
3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2  The rolls shall be selected at random from the lot and to ensure
randomness
of selection,
use shall be made of a random number table.
In case such a table is not available,
the following procedure is recom-
mended for use:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Starting
from any roll, count them as 1, 2, 3  , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,  etc,
up to r and so on, where r is the integral part of  .N/n ( JV  being
the
number of rolls in the lot and  n  the number-of rolls to be selected
for testing ).
Every rth roll thus counted shall be withdrawn
to
constitute the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.3 If, however,
the rolls in a lot are packed in packages,
then a
suitable number of packages subject to a minimum of 2 shall be selected
at random
and. then an equal number of rolls shall be taken from them
at random according to the procedure given in 7.1.2 so as to make up the
number required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
