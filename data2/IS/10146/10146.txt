FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
13 May
1082,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the Plastics
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Petroleum,
Coal
and
Related
Products
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Plastics
are
now
being
used
on
a large
scale
for
packaging
of
foodstuffs
and pharmaceuticals.
Where
direct
contact
occurs
between
the packed
commodity
and the plastics,
the high-molecular-mass
polymer
itself does not pose a toxic hazard
being inert
and essentially
insoluble
in
food.
There
is, however,
a likelihood
that
some
transfer
will occur of
polymer
additives,
adventitious
impurities,
such
as monomers,
catalyst
remnants
and residual
polymerisation
solvents and of low molecular
mass
polymer
fractions
from
the
plastics
into
the
packaged
material
with
consequent
toxic
hazard
to the
consumers.
The
occurrence
of acute
toxicity
due to plastics
materials
in contact
with food is most unlikely,
since
only trace
quantities
of potentially
toxic
materials
are likely
to
migrate.
However,
the accumulation
of these toxic
materials
with time
may lead to hazards
which may be serious.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Initially
the Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the
preparation
of
this standard
had prepared
three codes of practice
for safe use of polyvinyl
chloride
( IS  :  7288-1974*
), polyethylene
( IS : 7i77-19747
), and styrene
polymers
( IS  :  7961-1976$)
in contact
with
foodstuffs,
pharmaceuticals
and drinking
water.
Taking
cognizance
of the pressing
need
to monitor
the
quality
of plastics
intended
to come
in contact
with, foodstuffs,
pharmaceuticals
and
drinking
water
which
could
not be done on the
basis of standard
codes of practice,
the Committee
decided
to prepare<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Code
of practicr
for safe use of polyvinyl
chloride
( PVC ) and
its copolymers
in
contact with foodstuffs,
pharmaceuticals
and drinking

tical and drinking water.

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS  :  10171-1982
Guide
on suitability
of plastics for food packaging.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Eventually
the
three
codes
of practice
would
be withdrawn
with the
publication
of the
product
specification
along
with
the corresponding
positive list for the three plastics.
Standards
for other
plastics
for food
contact
applications
like polypropylene
and unsaturated
polyester
resins
which
are
under
preparation
are expected
IO follow
the same pattern,
namely,
a product
specification
with a corresponding
positive
list.
It is
hoped
that
this set of Indian
Standards
for plastics considered
safe for
food contact
applications
would
help the statutory
bodies
to effectively
monitor
the quality
of plastics for this end use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 It is emphasized
that these standards
need to be used in combination
to provide
a system of control
to the manufacturers
of plastics as well as<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the fabricators
of thermoplastic
packaging
materials
to derive
maximum
benefits.
Besides,
it may also serve as basis for official
agencies
to frame
suitable
legislation
to ensure effective
safeguards
for the safety and health
of consumers
where
thermoplastics
for
food
contact
applications
are
concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this

the
result
of a test

be
rounded

accordance

The number
of significant

retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
