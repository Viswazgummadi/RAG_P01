<<PARAGRAPH>>of individual
tests.
Further,
since publication
of
the original
standard
in
1968,
a
number
of
standards
covering
the requirements
of different
equipment
used
for
testing
of cement,
a brief
description
of which
was
also
covered
in the
standard,
had been
published.
In
this
revision,
therefore,
reference
is given
to different
instru-
ment specifications
deleting
the description
of the
instruments,
as it has been recognized
that repro-
ducible
and repeatable
test results can be obtained
only with standard
testing
equipment
capable
of
giving
desired
level
of accuracy.
This
part
( Part 12 ) covers determination
of air content
of
hydraulic
cement
mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
( Part 12  1 (  First Revi-
sion  )  was
adopted
by
the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 22 April
1988, after the draft
final-
ized
by
the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Standard
methods
of
testing
cement
are
essential
adjunct
to
the
cement
specifications.
This standard
in
different
parts
lays
down
the
procedure
for the tests to
evaluate
the
physical
properties
of different
types of hydraulic
cements.
The procedure
for
conducting
chemical
tests of
hydraulic
cement
is covered
in IS  :  4032-1985*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a parti-
cular requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be
rounded
off in
accordance
with
IS  :  Z-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in
the
rounded
off value should
be the same as that of
the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
Originally
all
the
tests
to
evaluate
the
physical
properties
of hydraulic
cements
were
covered
in one standard;
but for facilitating
the
use of this standard
and future
revisions,
it has
been
decided
to
print
the
different
tests
as
different
parts
of the standard
and accordingly,
this revised
standard
has
been
brought
out
in
thirteen
parts.
This
will also facilitate
updating

<<PARAGRAPH>>mixer at slow speed ( 140 f 5 rev/min ). Immedi-
ately determine the mass of 400 ml of mortar.
Place the mortar gently in the 400 ml measure in
three equal layers, spading
each layer
thoro-
ughly with the spatula around
the inner surface
of the measure.
In spading the first layer, do not
strike the spatula forcibly against the bottom
of
the measure.
In spading the second and final
layers, use only enough force to caust the spatula
to penetrate the surface of the previous
layer.
After the measure has been filled and spaded in
the above manner, tap the sides of the measure
lightly with the flat side of the tapping stick once
each at five different
points
at approximately
equal spacing around the’outside of the measure
in order to expel entrapped
air. Take care that
no space is left between the mortar and the inner
surface of the measure as a result of the spading
operation.
Then cut the mortar
off to a plane
surface, flush with the top of the measure,
by
drawing the straight edge with a sawing motion
across the top of the measure, making two passes
over the entire
surface,
the second pass be ing
made at right angles to the first. Take care
in
the striking off operation so that no loose sand
grains cause the straight
edge to ride above the
top surface of the measure.
Complete the entire
operation of filling and striking off the
measure
within one and a half minute. Wipe off all mortar
and water adhering to the outside of the measure.
Weigh the measure and its contents ( see Note ).
Record the mass of the mortar
in grams, after
subtracting the mass of the container.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Balance -
The
balance used
in weighing
materials shall conform to the following
require-
ments:
On balance in use, the permissible variation at
a load of I 000 g shall be f
1’0 g. The permis-
sible variation on new balance shall be one-half
of this value. The sensibility reciprocal shall be
not greater than twice the permissible variation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -  The sensibility
reciprocal
is generally
de-
fined as the change
in load required
to change
the
position
of
rest
of the
indicating
element
or the
elements
of  a  non-automatic
indicating
scale a definite
amount at any load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 .- Self-indicating
balance
with equivalent
accuracy may also be used.
5.3  Standard
Weights
-
The permissible vari-
ations
on weights
in  use  in  weighing the cement
shall be as prescribed in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
