<<HEADING level=3>>(  First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.  Scope -  Prescribes
two methods
for determination
of total cyanides
in water
and waste waters.
The total cyanides
after distillation
method
prescribes
the
determination
of
total
cyanides
which
distil
over on treatment
with
sulphuric
acid. This method is applicable
to the determination
of cyanide
in surface, waste and sea water.
The method
is suitable
for cyanide
concentration
to a lower
limit
of 20 pg/l.
The selective
electrode
method
is applicable
to solution
in the
concentration
range of
0’05 to 10 mg/l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  Determingtian
of Total
Cyanides
After
Distillation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Principle -
Distillation
of sample in the presence of sulphuric
acid converts
simple and complex
cyanides
into
hydrocyanic
acid.
The hydrogen
cyanide
gas is absorbed
in a solution
of sodium
hydroxide
and the cyanide
is determined
calorimetrically.

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 In the calorimetric
measurement,
the cyanide
in the sodium
hydroxide
solution
after
distillation
is converted
to cyanogen
chloride
by reaction
with
chloramine-T.
The cyanogen
chloride
then forms
a blue
dye
on
the
addition
of
pyridine-pyrazolone
reagent
and
the
absorbance
is measured
at 620 nm.
The reaction
may be expressed by the following
equations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cyanide refers to all the CN groups in cyanide compounds that can be determined
as cyanide
icn by the method used.
The great toxicity to aquatic
life of molecular
HCN
is well known,
it is
formed in solutions of cyanides by hydrolytic reaction of cyanide
ion with water.
After
removal of
interfering
substances, the metal cyanide is converted into
hydrogen
cyanide gas, which is distilled
and absorbed in sodium hydroxide solution.
The absorption liquid is analysed
by titrimetric,
colori-
metric or cyanilde ion selective electrode procedure.
