<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 1) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Rock Mechanics Sectional Committee, had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Physical planning and preparation of master plan for development of urban centres and multi-purpose
projects require considerations ofvarious natural hazards which lead to damage and collapse of structures
resulting in injury and death alongwith loss of investments and reduction of socio-economic fabric of the
inhabitants. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, river aeolian and glacial erosion, ground failures and other
geological hazards, vagaries of rain fall, floods, cyclones, tornadoes and other atmospheric disturbances
and procreated hazards resulting from mining and other excavations, unregulated and unplanned con-
structions, lack of awareness about natural hazards and oblivious of consequences of construction at sites
vulnerable to ground failures, rock falls and avalanches, debris movements, inundations and other risks,
cause damage to buildings in urban centres. In general these factors are not kept in view and haphazard
growth of urban centres takes place which result in disasters on exposure to natural and procreated
hazards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ground failures in hill sides in mountainous
terrains and in other adverse rock and soil conditions,
inundatibn of low-lying areas, along flood planes of rivers in alluvial terrains and coastal areas and on
exposure to earthquakes and extreme hydrometeorological
conditions give rise to large scale damage and
destructions resulting in devastation of urban centres. The main objective of microzonation
of urban
centres is demarcation of following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) Areas which in the prevailing local geomorphological,
geological and hydrological conditions are
unstable and undergo ground failures inundation or water-logging;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii) Areas which are potential sites for similar risks on exposure to earthquakes and other natural and
procreated hazards; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iii) Areas in which risks are negligible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thus planned land use with appropriate green belts, building complexes, transportation
systems and life
line structure sites is not likely to impose adverse effects on the environment. The strong ground motion
amplification due to local conditions and proximity of active faults, nature, type of ground failures and
their likely aerial extent and situation of inundations of specific land areas from external and internal
sources have to be assesed used so that areas where housing and office complexes and commercial and
industrial sectors constituting an urban centre can be sited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To minimize damage of buildings in the prevailing local conditions, it is necessary to provide guidelines
for microzonation
of areas of existing and proposed urban centres, selection of sites for housing,
commercial and industrial sectors within or close to an existing or planned urban centres and development
of building sites to ensure safety on exposure to natural and pretreated hazards. This code incorporates
guidelines for preparation of microzonation maps of areas of existing and proposed urban centres. Such
maps provide basic information for physical planning and preparation of land-use maps and master plans
for siting of buildings and development of such sites in urban centres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose,of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

desirable.
With
gradual reduction in relief smaller scale maps up
to 1  :  25 000 scale with contour intervals at 3 to 5m
intervals
may be used. For areas where such
topographic maps are not available, they should be
got prepared
as they form the base maps for
mappimg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This  Standard
provides guidelines for preparation
of microzonation map of a region to be used for an
urban centre or multi-purpose
project site for
regulating siting of housing and office complexes,
commercial and industrial sectors, community ser-
vices and other engineering structures to prevent
damage from natural
and procreated
hazards
resulting in ground failures and inundation of built
up areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 PRIMARY FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED
FOR MICROZONATION MAPS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The primary factors that govern the selection
of parameters
for microzonations
depend
on
regional geology, hydrological conditions and local
geology. The order, format and details in which
these should be considered are governed by local
conditions, the size of the urban centre and the type
and purpose of the building complexes in various
sectors of the urban centre. The hazards resulting
from human activities due to mining and other
excavations, constructions
disturbing the hydro-
logical regime, etc, often have adverse effects and
cause damage, water logging and related hazards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 GENERAL
(3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 If natural and procreated
hazards are not
evaluated
adequately
while considering
the
suitability of the site for existing and future urban
centres it may lead to large scale damage. Ground
failure and inundation
due to local conditions
result in damage to buildings even if suitable con-
struction
practices have been adopted. Lack of
structural safety of buildings in old and conjusted
localities, from their inherent poor construction or
dilapidated and weak conditions due to poor main-
tenance and repair add to the catastrophic effects
often blocking access, hinder rescue and relief
operations. Inundations fully or partially flooding
buildings and household good and failures of foun-
dations in adverse situations disrupts life lines in
addition to damage to property and loss of life.
Microzonation
maps should delineate areas which
are prone to ground failures of different types and
the areas which could be inundated during mon-
soons and extreme hydrometeorogical
conditions
as well as unplanned
drainage of domestic and
industrial discharge of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Regional Geology<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It  is necessary to consider overall geological setting
and history of natural hazards in order to encom-
pass all factors of significance and to account for
specific conditions such as earthquakes and floods
in the region. Such studies of regional geology
should cover the area around the urban centre to
evaluate the intensity of hazards which have a direct
bearing on characteristics ground failures and in-
undation. Study of regional geology should include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Identification
of physiography
including
landforms and drainage, and geology of the
region;
Geologic history of the region;
Description of geological formations rock
masses and surficial deposits/soil;
Description of geological and structural fea-
tures including folds, faults and fractures
and joint patterns;
Location and description of faults and shear
zones in which movements are taking place
or may generate earthquakes; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The microzonation
maps are required to be
prepared on scales based on:
i) size of the urban centre,
ii)
relief of the area,
iii)
nature of surficial soil and rock strata, and
iv) drainage pattern and its density.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>vi)
Hydrological conditions including the con-
figurations of the ground water table of the
region.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The materials present in the natural form includes
rocks, river terraces, alluvial fans, flood plains, al-
luvial deposits, glacial deposits, etc. The strength
parameters
of the materials
and the structural
weaknesses in case of rocks should be considered in
details for working out the stability. If the slopes
have already been subjected to failures, the same
may be identified and breaks in the ground profiles
are demarcated. Such areas are highly hazardous
for construction purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Local Geology<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Informations
on local geological
and geomor-
phological conditions is required to ascertain the
nature of ground failure expected at urban centres
and evaluate the potential for such failures on ex-
posure
to earthquakes,
inundation
and other
hazards. The data on local conditions is to be col-
lccted through
review of literature,
reports ap-
plicable to nearby engineering project sites, site
inspection, field exploration and material sampling
and testing. Data collected should include informa-
tion on the following:
i)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.1.1.2  Geomorphology<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Geormophology
of the area, a product of interac-
tion of geology, climate and erosion is to be studied
under:
i) slope characters, and
ii)
relative relief for purposes of terrain evalua-
tion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Geomorphology
of the area showing surface
slope characteristics, relative relief demar-
cating valley shape, areas of depression and
inundations, various types of land forms,
and drainage pattern and its density, loca-
tion of natural springs, land-use and land-
cover as well as rock outcrop areas;
Type, extent, thickness, mode of deposition
of formations and stability characteristics of
rock mass and soil deposits;
Hydrological
conditions
including water
table underground seepage conditions, and
permeability
characteristics
of surficial
materials;
Local geological and structural features in-
cluding folds, faults, joint etc,
Inventory
of effects of disasters - earth-
quakes and floods, that occured at or near
the urban centres in the past; and
Geotechnical
data for evaluation
of en-
gineering characteristics for rock mass and
surficial deposits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The five categories of slope gradient -very
gentle
(O’- l.Y), gentle
(15”-2.57,
moderately
sleep
(25 ‘- 307, steep (35”-45”) and very steep (>45”)
characterize the slopes. The relief or local relief
shall indicate the nature of scarp faces, valley shape,
depression zones, inundation areas, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iii)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.1.1.3  Hydrological conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It plays an important role as the pore water pres-
sure affect shear strength of the material, while
saturation increase the bulk weight of the mass.
Hydrological conditions may be studied by evaluating:
i) surface run-off characters,
ii) water spread,
iii)
marshy conditions,
iv) ground water tableiphreatic level, and
v) springs and ground water seepages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iv)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>“)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>vi)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface run-off characters are influenced by the
nature of the streams (perennial or seasonal). The
normal water levels, seasonal flood levels and 100
years flood levels should be considered for locating
the engineering
constructions
in the vicinity of
water sources. The inlet and outlet levels of run-off
water and the terrain features decide the water
spread characters. Water logging may lead to mar-
shy conditions, which in some situation may only be
seasonal. If seepages are seen on the slopes, they
may mobilize the slope materials and appropriate
weightage has to be given while evaluating stability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Causative Factors of Land Hazard<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hazards to engineering
structures of urban
centre are caused due to a number of factors which
may be classified into two major categories
i)
Ground failures, and
ii)
Floods and inundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1 Ground
failures result mainly due to in-
herent instabililties, instabilities caused due to ex-
ternal forces and instability due to human activites.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.1 The inherent instability is influenced by a
number of factors as given below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.2 Instabilities caused by external forces may
be broadly classified into five categories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.1.1.1  Material characteristics<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.1.2.1  Strong  ground motions -
may be caused
by earthquakes, blasting and rock burst.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It can be broadly classified into three categories:
i) Materials present in natural form,
ii) Materials disturbed due to ground failures,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.1.2.2  The

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 14243 ( Part 1)  :  1995<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cyclones and tsunamies, and collapse of upstream
water retaining structure&.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.3.5 The unstable foundations on the slopes
may lead to unequal settlements and failures. Often
constructions
are done on disposal dumps which
include solid waste disposal materials and filling by
mined out material. The dump areas may have
highly contagious materials with much of empty
spaces. Moreover if organic materials are present
in the dump, the decaying process over the years
may lead to unequal settlements on the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.2.3 The vicinity of lava eruptions may face
problems due to lava eruptions and the associated
debris flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.2.4 The debris flow from collapse and burst-
ing of debris dam in the upstream reaches should
be considered in relevant cases. The debris charged
with water may inundate the area all of a sudden in
the event of bursting of debris dam. Such debris may
consist of glacial-fill materials, rock debris on hill
slopes, or landslides debris generated by ground
failure on exposure to earthquakes
or extreme
hydro-meteorological
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2 Floods and inundations
are major hazards
which should be evaluated from past history. They
can be broadly classified into four categories:
i) Floods on rivers, that is, inland floods,
ii) Floods in deltaic areas,
iii)
Sea waves due to cyclones, and
iv) Excessive precipitations due to cyclones and
cloud bursts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.2.5 The avalanches
and landslides debris
within the area should be studied for detailed
evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In all cases the maxi&m
flood level has to be
estabilished from the past history so that the con-
structions can be restricted above that level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.3 Instabilities
due to human activities are
caused due to lack of planning and faulty execution
of works such as, mining and other excavations,
unplanned urban development, constructions lead-
ing to interference
with the existing drainage sys-
tems construction
in floor plains or close to shore
lines and constructions
on weak or unstable
foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 PROCEDURES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The topographic
map of the area of urban
centre on appropriate scale and contour interval as
indicated in 2.2 shall be prepared. This shall form
the base map for preparation
of other maps. A
slope map delineating
area of very steep slope
(>45”), steep slope (35”-45”),
moderate
slope
(25”-35”), gentle slope (15”-259) and very gentle
slope (c 157 shall be prepared. The details of geo-
logy of the area showing rock outcrop and surficial
deposits is prepared on the same scale. The land use
and land cover map of the area, and the hydrologi-
cal map shall be prepared showing the locations of
perennial and seasonal streams as well as irrigation
canals and open drains. The level of run-off of rivers
during normal period of  the  year and monsoons and
100 years floods should also be shown on hydro-
logical map along with ground water table contours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.3.1 Open cast excavations including mining
and road excavations should be properly planned
taking into consideration
the existing local condi-
tions of that the cut slopes do not face stability
problems. In adverse conditions the failure of cut
slopes may mobilize natural slopes leading to un-
stable conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.3.2 Unplanned urban development may lead
to excessive constructions in certain selected zones
thereby causing instability of slopes, while leaving
other potential
areas suitable for constructions
nearby.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Seismic hazard class based on peak ground
acceleration
(PGA) (refer Table 1) of the urban
centre shall be determined and design earthquake
evaluated
for design of structures
and stability
analysis of rock mass/soil formation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1.3.3 The existing buildings if not provided
with adequate and proper drainage facilities, may
cause excessive saturation of the sub-surface forma-
tions creating adverse conditions.
Moreover the
construction
of buildings should not obstruct the
existing surface drainage courses. During extreme
hydrometeorological
conditions
the floods may
play havoc and inflict severe drainage of the con-
structions in the flood plains of the river.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 From a perusal of the geological map, the areas
having more or less homogeneous lithology such as
hard rock terrain,
soft rock terrain,
surficial
materials categorized as terraces, fans, flood plains,
laccustrian
deposits,

demarcated.
Superimposing
the slope map and
hydrological map, the stable areas are identified. In
rocky terrain the areas having slope less than 25”
are in general
stable.
In terrains
of surficial
deposits, the dry slopes less than 20” are generally
stable. The remaining areas shall be studied in
detail to work out the factor of safety in the prevail-
ing local conditions for various slopes. The areas
showing high water table and fully saturated soils
shall be demarcated
and
studied for possible
liquefaction
and settlement
on exposure
to
earthquakes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7 In reclaimed and as solid waste disposal areas,
the long term effects due to settlements resulting

<<PARAGRAPH>>5 PRESENTATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The microzonation
maps portray areas likely to be
inundated during 100 years floods in the existing
streams within the area if any, and domestic and
industrial water discharges and areas likely to be
affected by ground failures indicating their nature
and type, due to inherent instability and/or ex-
posure to probable natural and procreated hazards
in the urban centre. The areas for location of build-
ing complexes and green belts, and other open
spaces, where the structures can undergo damage
resulting from ground failures shall be demarcated.
These informations
may be presented in a single
map or a series of maps depending on the com-
plexity of the data to be shown in such maps. These
maps will be accompanied by an explanatory text in
the form of a report incorporating the methodology
and procedures adopted for evaluating the nature
and type of ground failures shall be demarcated on
the map and the aerial extent of inundations in the
urban centre under various condtitions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
