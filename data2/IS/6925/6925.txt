FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards,
“I Institution
on 23 March
1973,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Various
types of concrete
admixtures
are being used in this country,
such as accelerators,
retarders,
water-proofers
and air entraining
agents.
Some of these
admixtures
are likely
to contain
water
soluble
chlorides
which
are likely
to cause
corrosion
of reinforcement
in the reinforced
concrete.
In fact the use of such
chlorides
containing
admixtures
has
been
prohibited
by IS  :  456-1964*.
However,
the option
of using
such
admixtures
is left to the engineer-in-charge
who has to use his discretion
on the basis of relevant
data in respect
of the admixtures.
As informa-
tion on the percentage
of water soluble
chlorides
in the admixtures
is of
vital imnortance
it is considered
necessarv
to bring out a standard
dealing
I
with
the
methods
of test
for determination
of water
content
in concrete
admixtures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the result of a test or analysis
made
in
this standard,
if the final value,

with IS :2-1960t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>’ 1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
specifies
the following
methods
of test for determina-
tion of water soluble
chlorides
in concrete
admixtures:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Volumetric
method,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Gravimetric
method,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Turbidimetric
method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>s  IS:69251973<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. SELECTION
OF METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  One of the three methods
may
be used appropriately
depending
on
the concentration
of the chlorides
in the admixtures
as per the declaration
of the manufacturer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The
volumetric
method
may be used when the chloride
concentra-
tion is nearly
1 percent
or above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The
gravimetric
method
may
be used
when
the
chloride
concen-
tration
is more than 2’5 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
The
turbidimetric
method
may be used when
the concentration
of
chloride
is as low as 2 ppm and above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Where
a choice
is open between
volumetric
and gravimetric
methods
volumetric
method
is preferable
as  it
is quicker
and
less
laborious.
Turbidimetric
method
may be adopted
when
the chloride
concentration
is very low.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
