<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian Standards
on 20 July 1989, after the
draft finalized by the Building
Construction
Practices
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No-fines cement concrete
has highly permeable
mass with large air spaces.
It is an agglomeration
of coarse
aggregate
particles
each surrounded
by a coating of cement paste, up to about 1’25 mm
thick.
As the aggregates
to be used is almost -single sized which results in formation
of enough
voids and thus preserve
its most important
properties
of light weight and
eliminating
rise of
dampness.
No-fines cement
concrete
can be used in foundation
as well as in floors in place of
lime concrete
where elimination
of rise of salt and moisture is desirable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No-fines
cement
concrete
has great
potentiality
as a substitute
for brick
masonry
where good
bricks
are
not
available
(specially
in black
cotton
soil or hill zone).
Further,
the thermal
conductivity
of a wall made of no-fines
concrete
with conventional
aggregates
and a wall of solid
brickwork
of the same thickness
is about
the same.
It may also be used in wall foundation
concrete,
concrete
under floors and in damp proof course.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960
‘Rules
for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised)‘.
The
number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3  Brick Ballast<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  REFERENCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No  under burnt bricks or  JHAMA
bricks shall
be used under any circumstances.
The
brick
ballast
should
be broken
preferably
at site of
work.
After
immersion
in
cold
water
for
24 hours,
absorption
shall

<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The Indian standards
listed in Annex A are
necessary
adjuncts to this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  For
the
purpose
of
this
standard,
the
definitions given in IS 4845  :  1968 and IS 6461
(Parts
1, 2, 5 to 10) shall generally
apply in
addition
to the following.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4  Stone Ballast<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be hard strong, dense, curable,
clean
and
of
proper
size and free
from
weather

to IS 269 : 1976,
IS
1489  :  1976
or
IS
455  :  1976
and
IS 8041  :  1978.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Soaking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The brick ballast shall be well soaked in clean
water for a period of at least six hours before
cement
is mixed.
The brick ballast
should be
skin dry
at the time
of mixing.
For
stone
ballast no soaking is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Aggregate<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1  Getural<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
aggregate
consists
of
crushed
stone
aggregate,
natural
single or brick ballast
from
slightly
over
burnt
bricks
or brick
bats.
It
should be homogeneous
in texture and roughly
cubical in shape.
The aggregate
to be used in
the concrete
should be uniformly
of the same
size.
The
aggregates
should
conform
to
IS 383  :  1970.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Quantity
of Water<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For a given aggregate
cement ratio there is only
one
water
cement
ratio
which
gives
the
maximum strength of concrete.
This  is  called
optimum water cement ratio.
()ptimum
water
cement
ratio
for various
mixes
arc given in
Table

The
proportions
of
cement
to
aggregate
and water should be selected so that
the aggregate
particles in the fresh concrete
are
coated
with cement
and water paste;
and the
paste should adhere
to the aggregate
and the
coated
coarse
aggregate
particle
should make
point to point contact
to ensure bonding of the
particles
to
meet
the
compressive

<<HEADING level=3>>6 FORM
WORK<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  No-fines concrete
practically
do not impart
hydrostatic
pressure on side shutters and, there-
fore,
shuttering
required
is
lighter
and
economical
as compared
to common
concrete.
Formwork
shookl
be designed
and should be
either
of
wooden
planking
with
or without
steel sheet lining
or of steel plates stiffened by
steel angles.
The formwork Aould be properly
fixed
and stiffened
to avoid
any chances
of
bulging.
Farmwork
should
have
smooth and
even surface
and joints.
It should not require
cutting,
fitting
and nailing
of timbers
on the
site, but should consist of wandard
and inter-
changeable
units
assembled
by bolts or metal
clips or other
fixings
which
can
be handled
quickly
by unskilled
labour
ad
reused many
times without deterioration.
The main purpose
of these requirements
is to obtain the speed of
building,
economy in form work, costs and ease
of erection
and
removal
by unskilled
labour
when concrete is poured  in-situ.  The completed
Sorm work shall be inspected
and approved by
engineer-in-charge
before
the work is started.
The surfaces
of timber
shuttering
that
would
come in contact
with concrete
shall
be well
set
and
coated
with
soap
solution
applied
before
concreting
is done.
Form
work may
normally
be removed after three days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1 The most appropriate
proportions
should
be determined
partly on the basis of experience
and partly on the compressive strength.
Unlike
normal
mncrete
the no-fines concrete
is very
sensitive
with
respect
to
water
content
and
therefwe
the correct
water
content
must
be
determined
by trial
mixes.
The brick ballast
being
water
absorbent,
the
effective
water
cement
ratio is thus variable
and not easy to
determine.
This may lead to excessively wet or
dry
mixes
being
used.
For
brick
aggregate
normally
33 percent water by weight of cement
may
be
added
to
the
saturated
skin
dry
sgregate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The mixer shall comply w&h IS 179.1  :  1968.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With drum mixer it is advisable
to pour some
water
into the drum before the dry material
is
added.
Thereafter
the measured
quantity
of
aggregates
(  thoroughly
soa’ked but skin dry in
case of brick ballast
only ) and cement shall be
poured
in
the
drum
of
mixer
while
it is
revolving.
The remaining
water
shall be added
slowly
up to the required
quantity
and wet
mixing
of the batch shall be continued
for at
least one minute till a uniform mix is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

except
where
expansion joints
are to be formed.
If vertical
construction
joints
are
permitted
near
an

these
will
seriously weaken the surface structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1  The
concrete
should be poured in hori-
zontal
layers
proceeding
continuously
around
the building.
Concrete
should not be allowed
to pile up at a slope in the form work while
awaiting
further
deliveries
since
this practice
results in a diagonal line of weakness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.1.2
Horizontal joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While
laying
care should be taken that cement

The
concrete
should
be placed
as soon as possible
after mixing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There
should be as few horizontal
construction
joints as possible, and in consequence
lifts should
be of full storey height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In forming
horizontal
joints,
the exposed face
of the site concrete should be cleaned thoroughly,
that is with
a wire brush and treated
with
a
neat cement slurry applied by means of a brush.
The
new concrete
should
be poured
imme-
diately.
Care should be taken
to ensure
that
voids
are filled at the foot of lift particularly
where joint ends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

There is
however,
the danger of water entering the wall
due to faulty detailing
of windows

or
through
cracks
in rendering
on
account of use of cement rich mix for rendering.
However
water entering
the wall through either
of these faults will drain towards the foot of the

deep holes.
These must be provided
above the damp proof
course
and kept clear of obstruction.
Where
lintels
intervenes,
these must be inclined
over
part of their surface
downwards
towards
the
out
side
face
of
the
wall and
the normal
precautions
of inserting
a damp
proof
source
must
be
taken,
otherwise
draining
water
is
likely to be diverted
to the inside of the wall.
The
damp
and
course
should not be wholly
sloped towards
the outer face and at least two
thirds of the area should from a level bearing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
cubes
are
cured
at 90 percent
relative
humidity
and at a temperature
of 27 f 2°C for
24 hours in the mould.
Cubes shall be demoul-
ded if sufficiently
strong,
otherwise kept in the
mould for a further
period of 24 hours.
After
demoulding,
the
cubes
shall
be marked
for
identification.
They shall be immersed in water
for just sufficient
time to ensure that they are
thoroughly
wetted.
After draining
they shall be
placed
in a polythene
bag which shall be sealed
to
prevent
loss of moisture.
They
shall
be
stored at a temperature
of 27 & 2°C until time
of testing.
The
cubes
shall
be tested as per
IS 516 : 1959.
Iffy is 28 day cube strength
of
no-fines
concrete,
the
7 days
and
90
days
strength
shall
be around
0’55 fc and 1’15 fr?
respectively.
A deviation
of f
10 percent
is
permissible
in these values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2 Provision of Reinforcement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
drying
shrinkage
of no-fines
concrete
is
about one half that of ordinary
concrete con-
taining
similar
coarse
aggregate.
Therefore
the placing
of
these
two
concrete
together
should be avoided in order to check the cracking
through differential
shrinkage
movements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2  Frequency of Sampling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall be in accordance
with 14.2.1
and 14.2.2
of IS 456  :  1978 as applicable
in case
of plain
and reinforced
concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since there is a concentration
of stresses at the
corners
of the
windows
and door
openings,
these spots in no-fines concrete
walls are after a
source of weakness.
Reinforcement
may there-
fore be placed
at wall openings.
It may even
be desirable
to
provide
ordinary
reinforced
lintels over such openings.
Wherever
reinfor-
cement is used, it should be coated with a thin
layer
of cement
slurry
to improve
the bond
strength and also to serve as means of protection
against corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3 Test
Specimen<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall
conform
to 14.3
of IS 456  :  1978 as
applicable
to plain and reinforced
concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.4  Test Strength of Sample<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test strength shall be average of the strength
of three specimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.5  Other Strength<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3  Concreting Under Special Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
other

of the no-fines
concrete
depends upon its 28 days cube strength.
These
are approximately
as f0lloWs:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Work in extreme weather conditions
during hot
