<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( First Revision  j  was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 20 June
1989, after the draft
linalized by the Fire Safety Sectional
Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The technical interpretation
of fire safety of buildings is to convey
the tire resistance of buildings in
terms of hours when subjected to a fire of known intensity.
The fire grading of the building itself’
enables the correct
amount
of storage
and class of materials,
or appropriate
‘fire load’ to be
apportioned
for that particular
application;
the converse
also holds good, thus, a building being
required to accommodate
a particular fire load for a given period would require
the shell or fabric
materials and construction
to be designed accordingly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Loss  of  life  in tires is mainly due to smoke and hot  gases  being inhaled by occupants
before
actural
flames have devclopcd
to a serious degree
within the room
concerned.
Smoke and hot gases
spread through doorways
and ventilators
which are normally
impossible
to keep closed.
The
essential
requircmenls
for lire safety
in so far as materials
and
details of construction
are
concerned,
arc that the flamr smoke and hot gases should not spread so rapidly as to give the
occupants insufficient time to escape.
Should a fire occur, the construction
should not further tend
to spread the fire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to reduce spread of fire, it is necessary that:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the fire should not spread
rapidly
from one room to another through the floors, partitions
between
rooms,
and particularly
between
rooms and passages and staircases,
that is, the
‘structural elements should have adequate fire resistance; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the naterials
which are exposed to possible ignition, that is, wall and ceiling linings should
not easily ignite, nor should the iire spread rapidly over the surface of the materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With a view to cover
these aspects, this standard dealing with details
of construction
was first
formulated
in 1960. This revision has been based on useful information collcctcd as a result of
research in the country and abroad over the past 23 years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions given in this standard are those which are necessary
at the time of construction
of
building new or addition
or alterations
for adopting
fire safety measures.
The provisions are
applicable
for all types of buildings including high rise buildings ( above 15 m in height ).
‘I&
standard
does not include othrr
fire sarcty measures
required
to be adopted in the  buildings
of
various occupancica in respect ot’ provision of first-aid, fire fightingmeasurzs.

systems, operation
of tire lifts, ctc; demils of which arc covered

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied
with, the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded ofi
in accordance with 1S 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding 017 numerical values (  revj&

The
number
of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 A separating
wall should be supported in a
vertical line by a similar separating wall through
all storeys below.
The separating wall should be
carried and bonded to the floor of appropriate
fire-resisting construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The
separating
walls
should
be carried
through the roof to a height of at least 60cm
above except
in the case of reinforced
brick/
concrctc
slab roof where it should be bonded
flash  ,with a top  level of the slab.
At the time
cjf designing openings, particular attention should
be paid to all such factors as will limit fire
spread through these openings.
Every
opening
in the wall should be protected
by fire resisting
doors having the fire rating of not less than
1  hour.
Similar protection
should also be done
in other
openings
like rope races, motor alley
ways, staircases.
etc.
of rating
not less than<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7 When a separating wall runs parallel
to the
axis of the north light opening
or gabled roof,
the screen wall should be carried
through,
and
60 cm above the top of the north light opening
except in cases where the screen wall becomes
of such a height that horizontal distance between
the north
light opening
and the roof of the
adjoining
building
and/or
compartment
or
between two sloping faces of the two consecutive
roofs at the level of the top of the screen wall,
is at least 6 m.
If, however, the separating wall is at right angles
to the axis of the north
light opening or the
gabled roof, the ‘saw tooth?
gaps should be
bricked up and screen wall extended
above
the
ridge of the north light or the gabled roof.
5.8 All separating
walls should
be built out
to extend 15 cm beyond
the eaves of the roof
so as to effectively
cut off the roofs of the
parts so separated.
The eaves should be cut
away on each side of this extension of the separat-
ing wall.
If there is an opening on both sides of
the separating wall within 3 m of the wall, those
on one side should be bricked up to full thickness
of wall, or an alternative should be provided
with
fire resisting doors of fire rating not less than of
2 hours for walls of 4 hours rating and 1 hour
for other rating.
5.9 Common
wooden
roof
members
(trusses,
joists and purlins)
should not pass through the
separating walls but they may be embedded there-
in provided they do not extend more than 22.5cm
into wall and are separated
from the similar
roof member in the adjoining building by at least
11 cm or solid wall material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2  hours. However, for Types 1, 2. 3 construction,
a doorway or opening in a separating wall of any
floor should be limited to 5.6  1112  in area
with a
maximum
height of 2.75 m al:d maximum
width
of 2 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 When building(s) and/or
c;mpartment(s)
are
separated
by separating
wall(s) and there is a
rerand~!/z 011  one or more sides of such building(s)
and/or
compartment(s),
it is necessary
that the
separating
wall should be built out across the
verandulz
and be carried
through
the roof of
the
same;
otherwise
the
building(s)
and/or
compartment(s)
should
be regarded
as having
internal communication
and, therefore,
subject
to danger of spread of fire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 When opening in walls are provided to allow
cable, etc, the space around cables and the wall
should be protected according
to the provision
given in IS 12459  :  1988.
However,
such space
in case of openings provided to allow plumbing/
gas,/stc~am pipes and similar services should be
sealed with iii!er material
of fire rating not less
than that of the walls in which these are situated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 Where openings are permitted,
they should
not exceed three-fourths
of the area of the wall
in case of an external wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
