<<HEADING level=1>>( Second Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 13 ) ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 28 August 1986, after the draft finalized by
the Soil Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establishing uniform procedures
for the determination
of various characteristics
of soils and also to facilitate comparative
study
of the results, this standard
is being published,
in various parts. This
standard ( Part 13 ) deals with the method for direct shear test of soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Depending upon
the application
of shear load, the direct shear test
is of two types, controlled
stress and controlled strain. The cootrolled
strain test is simpler and
provides
accurate
results
and is, therefore,
recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard was first published in 1965 and subsequently
revised in
1972. In this revision, provisions regarding the requirements for equipment
have been deleted as these have now been covered in detail in IS  :  11229-
1985%‘. Opportunity
has also been taken to make the requirements
up-to-
date in respect of procedure for the test, based on the experience gained in
the use of this test by various laboratories
in the past years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-196Ot. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard ( Part 13 ) covers the methods for determination
of shear
strength of soil with a maximum
particle size of 4.75 mm in undrained,
consolidated undrained and consolidated drained conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘NOTE -
The
undrained
test can be performed
only
for highly.impermeable
clays. When silty clays and silts are involved, partial drainage is inevitable.
This fact
should be recognized
while interpreting
the results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 For the purpose of this standard, definition of terms given in IS  :  2809-
1972* shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The shear box grid plates, porous stones, base plates, and loading pad
and water jacket shall conform to IS  :  11229-19857.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Loading Frame - It shall satisfy the following requirements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The vertical stress on the sample shall remain vertical and constant
during the test and there shall be arrangement

sion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The shear stress or strain can be applied in the dividing plane of the
two parts of the shear box.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>c><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall be possible to maintain a constant rate of increase in stress
during the test ( irrespective of the strain rate ) with arrangement
to
get different rates of stress increase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of a strain-controlled
apparatus,
the strain rate should
remain constant
irrespective
of the stress.
Suitable arrangement
shall be provided to obtain different strain rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No vibrations
should be transmitted to the sample during the test
and there
should
not be any loss of shear force due to friction
between the loading frame and the shear box-container
assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Undisturbed Specimens - Specimens
of required
size ( see 5.1 ) shail
be prepared in accordance with IS  :  2720 ( Part 1 )-1983*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Remoulded Specimens<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Cohesive
soils may be compacted
to the
required
density
and
moisture
content,
the sample extracted
and then trimmed to the
required
size. Alternatively,
the soil may be compacted
to the
required density and moisture
content
directly
into the shear box
after fixing the two-halves of the shear box together by means of the
fixing screws.
b) Cohesionless
soils may be tamped
in the shear box itself with the
base plate and grid plate or porous stone as required in place at the
bottom of the box.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The cut specimen
shall be weighed and trimmings obtained during
cutting shall be used to obtain the moisture content. Using this information,
the bulk dry density of the specimen in the shear box shall be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Undrained Test -

<<PARAGRAPH>>the top of the  specimen should be fitted into position
in the  load
frame.
The
w-rations
of lhc  grid plates should be at right angles  to  the  direction
of shear ( .wr Note ).  The  loading
pad should
be placed
on the top grid
plate.
The water jacket should be provided so that the sample does not get
dried during the test. The required normal stress should be applied and the
rate of longitudinal
displacement/shear
stress application
so adjusted that
no drainage cln occur  in the  sample during the test.  The upper part
of the
shear box should
be raised  such that a gap of about 1 mm is left between
the two parts
of the box. The test may now be conducted by applying
horizontal shear load to failure or to 20 percent longitudinal
displacement,
whichever occurs first. The shear load readings
indicated %y the proving
ring assembly and the corresponding
longitudinal
displacements
should be
noted at regular intervals. If necessary, the vertical
compression, iF any, of
the soil specimen may be measured
to serve as a check to ensure that
drainage has not taken place from the soil specimen. At the end of the
test, the specimen should be removed from the box and the final moisture
content
measured. A minimum
of three ( preferably four ) tests shall be
made on separate specimens of the same density.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nom -
As
porous
stones
are  not used for the undrained tests,  plain  plates  of
equal thickness should be substituted
in their place
so as to maintain
the shear plane
in the sample in the middle of its thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Consolidated
Undrained
Test -
The apparatus should be assembled fin
a  way  similar
to  that given in 4.1 except that instead of the plain grid
plates, perforated
grid plates and saturated porous stones should be used
at the top and bottom of the specimen. The procedure
is same as in 4.1
except that after the application of normal
stress, the vertical compression
of the soil with time should be recorded [ scc IS  :  2720 ( Part 15 )-1986* 1.
The shear test should be conducted
only after complete consolidation
has
occurred
under
the particular
normal stress. The rate of shear should be
such that water does not drain from the specimen at the time of applica-
tion of the shear load. At the end of the test, the specimen should be
removed from the box and the final moisture
content
measured.
A mini-
mum
of
three ( preferably
four  )  tests should be made on separated
specimens of the same density at different normal stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  Consolidated
Drained Test --  The shear box with sample and perforated
grid plates and porous stones should b~c fitted into the load frame as in
4.2. After application of ndrmal stress
which
is done in increments [ see
IS  :  2720 ( Part
15 )-1986* 1, the sample should
be allowed to consoli-
~date. When the consolidation
has completely
occurred,
the shear test
should
be done at such a slow rate that at least 95 percent pore pressure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>dissipation
occurs
during
the test in this calculated
time factor ( see
Appendix
A ). At the end of the test, the specimen should be removed
from the box and the final moisture
content measured.
A  minimum
of
three ( preferably four ) tests should
be made on separate
specimens
of
the same density at different normal stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 The normal
stresses to be selected for the test should correspond to
the field conditions and design requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. CALCULATIONS
AND REPORT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 All  Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  Results
of tests shall
be recorded
suitably. A recommended
proforma
for recording the results is given in Appendix B.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2 From the calibration
chart
of the proving-ring,
the loads corres-
ponding
to the load dial readings
obtained
during the test should be
calculated.
The loads so obtained divided by the corrected cross-sectional
area of the specimen gives the shear stress in the sample. The corrected
cross-sectional
area shall be calculated from the following equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrected
area = Ae (4)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A0 = iuitial area of the specimen in cm*, and
8 = displacement in cm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2.1 The longitudinal
displacement
at a particular
load may be
either noted
directly
from the strain dial readings
or calculated as the
product of the corresponding
time reading
and the strain rate, allowing
for the compression
of the proving-ring,
where applicable. The stress-
longitudinal
displacement readings should be plotted
and the
maximum
stress and corresponding
longitudinal displacement together with the normal
load applied during the test recorded ( see Note).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Tn general, failure in direct shear may be considered to take place
either at maximum shear or at the maximum obliquity of the  Mohr  failure envelope.
If the failure is assumed to take place at maximum shear and not at maximum
obliquity, the angle of shearing resistance thus obtained will be smaller,  giving an
error, if any, on the safe side. It should, however, be noted that differences in the
values of the angle of shearing resistance obtained by using the two criteria
mentioned above are more important for sands than for clays.
~6.1.2.2 The maximum shear stress and the corresponding
longitudinal
displacement
and applied
normal
stress should be recorded for each test
and the
results
should
be presented in the form of a graph in which the
applied normal stress is plotted as abcissa and the maximum shearing stress<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS

<<PARAGRAPH>>is  plotted
as ordinate
to
the same scale. The angle which the resulting
straight  line makes with the horizontal
axis and the intercept
which the
straight line makes with the vertical axis shall be reported as the angle of
shearing resistance and cohesion intercept respectively ( see Note ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N~IE -
The normal  stress-maximum
shear stress relationship
may not be a
straight line in all cases. In such cases, the shear parameters may be obtained by
drawing a tangent to the normal stress expected in the field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3  In the cast of the consolidated undrained and consolidated drained
tests, the load at which the specimen is consolidated
and the consolidation
characteristics
as determined
during the consolidation
part of the test
should also be reported.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.1  For sandy soils, a rate of strain of 0.2 mm/min may be suitable.
For clayey soils, a rate of strain
of 0.01 mm/min or slower may be used
but actual rate of strain suitable for the soil under test may be ascertained
as in  A-J.1.l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.1.1  From the consolidation
data collected,
the compression
dial
readings
should
be plotted
against the logarithm
of time and from this
curve, the value of coefficient of consolidation,
