<<HEADING level=3>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( First Revision) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1~0  March 1983, after the draft finalized by the
Dental Materials Sectional Committee had been approved by the Chemical
Division Council.
0.2 This standard was first issued in 1973 with considerable assistance
derived from<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO/R/1565-1970   ‘Dental silicate cement’. The IS0 docu-
ment had been revised to IS0 1565-1978 (E) ‘Dental silicate cement
(hand-mixed).
Consequently the committee decided to revise this standard
to align it with the latest IS0 Document.
0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded-off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>

If it is not possible to deliver all
the cement from the measuring device in a single operation, take the residue
with the tip of a clean spatula and place on the centre of the other glass
plate.
Position both glass plates relative to each other, without pressure,
in such a way that any cement on the second glass plate contacts centrally
the bulk of the cement on the first glass plate.
Sixty seconds after the end
of mixing, gently press the cement out between the two glass plates with the
force of 147 N ( 15<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>)  applied in a direction perpendicular to the lower
glass plate.
After the cement has set, measure the major and minor dia-
meters of the cement disc with an accuracy of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

mean.
If the two measurements differ by more than<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and repeat the test.
Make trial mixes of varying powder/liquid ratios until
the mean diameter calculated from the major and minor diameter measured
is 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

A-3.2  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  The total arsenic content may be determined using any
recognized analytical method of adequate sensitivity.
If the result of such
a determination shows the total arsenic content to be near the limit specified
in the Table 1, then a further determination shall be carried out using the
procedure described in IS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

After mixing to the standard
testing consistency, pack the cement, to a slight excess, into the split mould
within 1 min of the completion
of mixing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE— In order to consolidate
the cement and avoid trapping
air, it is advisable
to
convey the largest convenient
portions of mixed cement to  the mould
and apply
to one
side with a suitable instrument.
Fill the mould
to excess in this manner and then place
on  the bottom
plate with some pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Remove any bulk extruded cement, place the top metal plate  in
position and manually squeeze together.
Put the mould and plates in the
clamp and screw tightly together.
Not later than 2 min after the comple-
tion of mixing, transfer the whole assembly to the oven maintained at
37<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f  1°C.  One hour after the completion of mixing, remove the plates, and
surface the ends of the specimen plane, at right angles to its long axis.
Grind the ends flat and remove any excess cement by drawing back and
forth on a glass plate with a small amount of 350 mesh silicon carbide
powder, maximum particle size 45<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pm,  mixed with water. Keep both ends of
the specimen wet during the grinding and rotate about one quarter turn
every few strokes. Remove the specimen from the mould immediately after
surfacing and check for air-voids or chipped edges. Discard any such
defective specimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  -To facilitate the removal of the hardened cement specimen the internal
surface of the mould may be evenly coated, prior to filling, with a 3 percent solution of
micro-crystalline or paraffin wax in pure toluene.
Alternatively a thin film of silicone
grease or PTFE dry film lubricant may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Immerse each acceptable specimen in distilled or deionized water and

<<PARAGRAPH>>O-25
mm/min. Place each specimen with the flat ends between the platens<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-of
the testing apparatus so that the load is applied in the long axis of the
specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Record, the maximum load applied when the specimen fractures, and
calculate the compressive strength C, in megapascals, using the formula<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>=  maximum applied load, in newtons<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>;  and
d =  diameter of the specimen, in millimetres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If at least four of the fiveresults obtained are below the minimum strength
specified in the table, the material shall be deemed to have failed the test.
If at least four of the five results are above the minimum strength specified
in the table, the material shall be deemed to have passed the test.
In other
cases prepare a further 10 specimens and obtain the median result for all 15
specimens.
Round this value to two significant figures and record as the

A-7.3 Preparation of Test Specimen<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  Place the mould on a thin polyethy-
lene or cellulose acetate sheet backed by a flat plate.
Insert a convenient
tared length of wire or dental floss through the split ring so that at least
4 mm projects into the ring,
standard testing consistency.
Fill the split ring with cement mixed to the
Cover with a further plate faced with a sheet
or polyethylene or cellulose acetate, press firmly together and apply the
screw clamp.
Two minutes after the completion of mixing, place the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>mould,
plates and the screw clamp into the oven maintained at 37<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>f<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l”C,  and a
relative humidity of at least 30 percent.
After 1 h, remove the plates and
polyethylene or cellulose acetate sheets from the clamp and carefully
separate the cement disc and attached wire or dental floss from the split
ring. Remove any surplus cement from the edge of the disc and lightly
brush the surface to remove any loose material.
A-7.4 Preparation of Test Solution<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>-  Weigh the specimen and immediately
suspend it in 20 ml of water, contained in a polyethylene bottle, by means
of the wire or dental floss. Ensure that the<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>soecimen  does not touch the side
of the bottle. Close&the lid as tightly as &possible and store for 23 h at
37<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>f<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1°C.
A-7.5 Procedure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  After<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>~23  h, remove the specimen from the water and
determine the amount of phosphate in solution by the following procedure.
Carry out this determination in duplicate. Transfer the contents of each
of the polyethylene bottles to a 200 ml flask and dilute to the calibration
mark with water. Transfer 10 ml aliquot portions of these solutions to
50 ml volumetric flasks, and add 5 ml of reagent IV to each, the contents
then being diluted to the calibration marks and thoroughly mixed.
Treat<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10  ml of standard phosphate solution similarly by adding<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5  ml of reagent
IV and making the volume up to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>50  ml in a volumetric flask.
At the same
time also prepare a blank.
Allow these flasks to stand for 24 h and then
compare the solutions at 650 nm in a suitable spectrophotometer.
If no spectrophotometer is available, the sample solution may be
compared against suitable standard; 9 ml of the working standard solution<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
