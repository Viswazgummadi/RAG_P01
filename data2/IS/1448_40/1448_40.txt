<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
method
covers
the
determination
of
water
in
petroleum
products,
tars and products
derived
from tars.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1.1  The
specific
products
listed
in
7.1.1
represent
the
range
of
materials
considered
in developing
the details
of this method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  SUMMARY
OF METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The
material
‘is heated
under
reflux
with
a
water-immiscible
solvent
which
co-distils
with
the
water
in the
sample.
Condensed
solvent
and
water
are continuously
separated
in
a trap,
the
water
settling
in the graduated
section
of the trap
and
the solvent
returning
to the still.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The apparatus
comprises
of a glass or metal
still, a heater,
a refiux
condenser,
and
a graduted
glass trap.
The
still,
trap and condenser
may
be connected
by any
suitable
method
for producing
a leak-proof
joint.
Preferred
connections
are ground
joints
for glass 2nd O-rings
for
metal
to glass.
Typical
assemblies
are illustrated
in Fig.
1 to 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  Still -
A glass or metal vessel with a short neck and suitable
joint
for
accommodating
the
reflux
tube
of
the
trap.
Vessels
of
500,
1000
and
2 000
ml nominal
capacities
have
been
found
satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2
Heater -
Any
suitable
gas burner
or electric
heater
may be
used with the glass still.
A gas ring burner
with ports on the insidr
circumference
shall be used with the metal
still, and shall be of such
dimensions
that it may be moved up and down the vessel when testing
materials
which are liable to foam or to solidify in the still.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Dimensions
and
description
of typical
glassware
for use in this
method are given in relevant
Indian Standards
on glass apparatus.
A
straight
water-cooled
condenser
with
a
length
of
400
mm
is
recommended.
The
stills and
traps
should be chosen to cover
the
range of materials
and water content expected
( see Note ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  -Instead
of standardizing on a particular apparatus with respect to
dimensions and style, a given apparatus  will
be deemed
as
satisfactory
when
accurate
results
are obtained
by the standard
addition
technique
obtained  in  6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  SOLVENT-CARRIER
LIQWID<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Any suitable
hydrocarbon
boiling
in the range
of
100 to 200°C
may be used.
With residual
fuel oils and bitumens,
aromatic
solvents
are
desirable
in order
to avoid separation
of asphaltenes.
For the
determination
of water
in certain
lubricating
greases,
close boiling
range petroleum
distillate
( see 4.3 ) has been found to be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The following solvents have been found suitable:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Commercial  toluene -
industrial
grade,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Commercial
xylene -
industrial
grade, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Petroleum
distillate
fractions
in the boiling
range
of 100 to
200°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Petroleum
spirit in the boiling range
of 100 to 120°C.
Iso-octane
95 percent
purity or better.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CAUTION
-
Toluene
and xylene
are toxic,
volatile
hydrocarbons
which
are
absorbed
by inhaling
the vapour
or through
the skin by contact
with
the liquid.
Use adequate
ventilation
and avoid skin contact.

<<HEADING level=3>>5.  SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  The
portion
of the sample
used for the test shall be thoroughly

of the total sample.
If the material
is liquid, thoroughly<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>mix
the
sample
as
received,
warming
if
necessary,
to
ensure
uniformity.
Crush
the solid materials
that are sufficiently
brittle,
mix
t  Irorot!ghly,
and
take
a representative
sample
for
analysis.
When
there
1s doubt
as to the
uniformity
of the material,
run a number
of
samples
and average
the data.
Sampling
procedure
is described
in the
appropriate
clauses
of IS : 1447-1966*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2
A sample
size of 100 ml or 100 g is recommended.
Should
however
the
quantity
of
water
exceed
the capacity
of the largest
permitted
trap,
the quantity
of sample
may be decreased
or the trap fitted with a
stopcock
used, where
excess water may be withdrawn
into a graduated
cylinder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. STANDARDIZATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  A given assembly
of apparatus
wi!l be considered
satisfactory
when
accurate
readings
are
obtained
from
addition
of known
amounts
of
water
from
a calibrated
burette
or pipette
to a clear
hydrocarbon
oil
and tested
in accordance
with 7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The
readings
will
be
judged
accurate
if
conformity
to
the
permissible
limits
given
in Table
1 for the various
sized
graduated
traps are not exceeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tight.
If a metal
still with removable
cover
is used, insert
a gasket
of
heavy paper,
moistened
with solvent,
between
the still body
and cover.
The
condenser
tube
and
trap
shall
be chemically
clean
to ensure
free
drainage
of water
into the bottom
of the trap.
Insert
a loose
cotton
plug
in
the
top
of
the
condenser
to
prevent
condensation
of

moisture
inside
it.
Circulate
cold
water

Apply
heat
to
the
still,
adjusting
the
rate
of

so
that

distillate
discharges
from the condenser
at the rate of 2 to 5
drops per second.
If the metal still is used, start
heating
with the ring
burner
about
76 mm above
the bottom
of the still and gradually
lower
the burner
as the distillation
proceeds.
Continue
