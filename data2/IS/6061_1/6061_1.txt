FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standav-ds
Institution
on 18 March
1971,
after
the draft finalized
by the Building
Construction
Practices
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Floor
and roof construction
using
precast
reinforced
or
prestressed
concrete
joists
and hollow
cement
concrete
filler blocks
is advantageous
because
of the durability,
fire resistance,
thermal
insulation,
lower
dead
load and  high  speed of construction.
The construction
of floor or roof with
joists
and
hollow
concrete
filler
blocks
is simple
and
quick
and
also
eliminates
the use of shuttering.
This type of floor should not be used where
the floor is likely to be subjected
to impact
loads and/or vibration.
This
standard
is intended
to provide guidance
for construction
of floor and roof
with hollow cement
concrete
filler blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given
to
international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in
different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
This standard
is one of a series of Indian
Standards
on construction
of
floor and roof with joists
and filler
blocks.
The
other
standard
to be
published
in the series is Code of practice
for construction
of floor and roof
with joists and filler blocks  :  Part II PVith hollow clay filler blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

if desired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Strength
and Stability<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.1  The spacing
of the joists shall be at 600 mm centres
unless
other-
wise specified
( see  B-l -4  ) .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2  The maximum
span of joists shall not normally
exceed 6 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3. The design of precast reinforced
concrete
and prestressed
concrete
sections for joists shall be in accordance
with
the principles
laid down
in
IS : 456-1964*
and IS  :  1343-19607 respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.4
The joists and filler blocks shall be so shaped as to give a minimum
bearing
of 25 mm of the filler blocks on the joist.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.5
When
the
design
of the joists
provides
for T-beam
action
of
topping
concrete,
then the minimum
thickness
of concrete
shall be 50 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A-4. CASTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-4.1  The
mould
should
be made
of suitable
material
which
is rigid
enough to withstand
vibrations
during casting.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.2
The joists shall
be cast on a level platform
protected
from direct
sun as well as from the quick drying action
of strong winds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.3
Before filling concrete
in the moulds,
the inner surfaces of the mould
and the bottom
shall be thoroughly
treated
to aid the casting and removal
of the precast
unit without damage
and to ensure
a smooth
surface
finish
of the concrete.
The reinforcement
skeleton should be placed and secured
in the mould
in the correct
position
so as to ensure
proper
cover
of
concrete
over the reinforcement.
The
concrete
shall be gradually
filled
into
the
moulds
and kept
continually
filled and compacted
by suitable
vibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-Even
when the mould is full, the top ends of the stirrups
and the stirrup
holder bar are purposely left projecting
out the mould so that the joist will bond with
the reinforced concrete topping and function as T-beams.
A-4.4  Releasing
of the sides of mould shall not be done earlier
than
four
hours after casting.
The
mould
shall be very carefully
released
without
disturbing
or causing any shock to the casting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-5. CURING
AND MATURING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.1  After
removal
of the sides of the moulds,
the joists
shall be
kept
damp for 24 hours by spraying
water on them at the same location,
unless
adequate
arrangements
are
made
for
shifting
the
base
plate
without
disturbing
the joists.
After the concrete
has developed
sufficient
strength
to withstand
handling
stresses the joists shall be removed
to a curing
yard
and shall be kept continually
moist
for at least
7 days from
the date of
casting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.2
After the curing of the joists is completed,
these shall be stored
in a
shady place and allowed to dry gradually
for at least three weeks before
these are used in the construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

AND HANDLING
OF JOISTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-6.1  Lifting
of joists from
the platform
shall be done with care,
