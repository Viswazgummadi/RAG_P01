by the River Valley Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>River valley projects and other major civil engineering
works being undertaken
in the country may require,
for site investigation,
core drilling with diamond drills for sub-surface
exploration.
It is essential
that such
drilling
is carried out in the~best possible
manner to obtain maximum
possible data relating
to the substrata
and to obtain good cores for study. This standard has been prepared to provide necessary
guidance
for the
same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1973 and was based on the practices
being followed
by the various
construction
agencies
at that time.
This revised standard
has been prepared
based on the practices
being
followed
internationally
and which
have also been adopted
in this country.
In this revision
specific
guidance
has been provided
on operating
pump pressures
and
flow
rates. Further,
consequent
upon
the publication
of IS 10208  :  1982 ‘Specification

provision
has
been made in this
revision
that the equipment.
prescribed
for usage is in conformity
with those given
in IS  :  10208. Elaboration

Core Bit<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Core bits should be selected
from surface set with
diamonds, impregnated
with small diamond particles,
polycrystallined
diamond
bits (PCD bits), tungsien
carbide insert bits, all as iappropriate to the formation
being cored and with the concurrence
ofthe geologist
or engineer.
Nominal size of the bits are given
in
IS 10208  :  1982. Guidance
with regard to selection
of suitable
core drilling bit type is given
in Table 1.
For general relationship
of casing to core bit sizes and
metric barrel to casing nesting sizes reference should
be made to Fig. 1 and 2 respectively.
Core  barrels should conform to IS 1020%: 1982. The
design of the core barrels should be selected, keeping
in view the points given in 3.3.1 to 3.3.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3  Pump Flow Rntes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sufficient
flow rates should be ellsured for up-hole
velocity
of 1.5 m/s for water and 0.4 to O.Gm/s for
mud. These veldcities
will keep the cuttings moving
u~pward and will avoid blockages.
Higher velocities
will erode the walls of the hole. Table 2 shows the
flow rates ~required for various hole sizes
that may
vary from 8.00
l/min
to 50 l/min depending
upon
size of drilling

A hardened drive
shoe is to be used as a cutting
edge and
thread
proEection device on the bottom of the drive pipe or
casing.
The drive shoe inside diameter
should be
large enough to pass the tools intended for use, and
the shoe and pipe or casing should be free from burrs
or obstructions
(see IS 10208  :  1982).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5
PROCEDURE
FOR CORE DRILLING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
Core drilling
is done
where
the formation
encountered
is too hard to be sampled
by any soil
sampling
methods.
The switching
over from soil
sampling method to core drilling should be normally
done in accordance
with the guidelines
given
in
IS 2131  :  1981 and IS 2132  :  1986. However,
the
final decision should be ftaken ~by the geologist
and
engineer-in-charge
of the site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.7.2
Cusing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When necessary
to case through formations
already
penetrated
by the bore hole or when no drive casing
has been set, auxiliary
casing should be provided to
fit inside the bore hole to allow use of the next smaller
core barrel.
Casing bits have an obstruction
in their
interior and will not pass the next smaller casing size.
A casing shoe may be used, if additional
telescoping
casing is anticipated
(see IS 10208  :  1982).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1  Casing should be seated on bedrock or in a
firm formation
to prevent EraveIling of the borehole
and to prevent loss of drilling
fluid.
Surface of the
rock or hard formation
at the bottom of the casing,
should
be levelled,
when
necessary,
using
the
appropriate bits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
The core drilling
may be carried out by an
N-size double-tube
swivel-type
core barrel or any
other size
or type and the design approved
by the
engineer-in-charge.
Core drilling should be continued
until core blockage occurs or until the net length of
the core barrel has been drilled in. The core should
be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7.3  Casing Liner<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Plastic pipe or sheet metal pipe may be used to line
an existing
large-diameter
casing.
Liners, so used,
should
not be driven,
and care should be taken to
maintain
true alignment
Ehroughout the length of the
liner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8
Drill Rods<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3
The recovered
core should be placed in the
core box with the upper (surface) end of the core at
the upper-left corner of the core box. The cores with
proper markings should be placed into core boxes at
appropriate
spacings,
with blocks.
Soft or friable
cores, or those which change materially
upon drying,
should be wrapped in plastic film or seal in wax, or
both as required by the engineer.
Spacer blocks or
slugs properly marked should be used to indicate any
noticeable
gap in recovered cores which might indi-
cate a change or void in the formation.
The~fraclured,
bedded and/or jointed
pieces of the core should be
reassembled
in the sequential
order of their recovery
before keeping the same in the core box.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8.1
Drill rods of Tubular steel are normally used
to transmit,
feed, rotation and retraction forces from
the drilling machine to the core barrel. Drill-rod sizes
should conform to IS 10208  :  1982.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9
Auxiliary
Equipment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Auxiliary
equipment
should be used as required for
the work and should
include;
roller rock bits, drag
bits, chopping bits,boulder
busters, fishtail bits, pipe
wrenches,
core barrel wrenches,
lubrication
equip-
ment, core boxes, and marking devices. Other recom-
mended
equipments
include
core
splitter,
rod
wicking,
pump-out
tools or extruders and hand sieve
or strainer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10
Compatibility
of Equipment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4  Core drilling
should be stopped
when soft
materials are e&ountered
that produce less than 50
percent
recovery.
If necessary,
samples
of soft
materials
should be taken as per IS 2131  :  1981 and
IS 2132  :  1986 in consultation
with geologist
or
engineer-in-charge.
Diamond core drilling should be
resumed when hard formation
is again encountered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10.1
Whenever
possible,
core barrels
and drill
rods should
be selected
from the same letter-size
designation
to ensure
maximum
efficiency,
for
example NX core based with NW rod.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10.2
The combination
of pump, drill rod and core
barrel should be such that it yields uphole velocity of
more than 40 m/min to get a clean hole and clear
water.
Similarly
the combination
of air compressor,
drill
rod and core barrel should
yield uphole air
velocity of more than 920 &min.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5
Sub-surface
structures,
including
the dip of’
strata, the occurrence
of seams, fissures, cavities and
broken areas are among the most important
items to
be detected and described.
Special care should be
taken to obtain and record information
about these
features. If conditions prevent the continued
advance
of core drilling,
the hole should be cemented
and
redrilled, reamed and cased, or cased and advanced
with the next smaller-size
core barrel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 6926  :  l-996<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
A new bit should never be pushed to the bottom
of a hole. Since an old bit is usually under gauge, a
new bit should be stopped 5 to 10 cm from the bottom
and drilled.
When the bottom is reached, the new bit
should be run at a moderate rate and slow feed for 3
to 5 cm to give the diamonds
a chance to seat them-
selves.
This prevents
the sharp points from being
broken
off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.6
Drilling
mud or ceillellting/grouting
techni-
ques  should be approved
by geologist
or engineer-
in-charge
before their use in bore hole.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2
In soft, seamy,
or othenvise
unsound
rock,
where core recovery is poor, the Type B (M design)
or the triple tube core barrel with bottom discharge
bits may be employed.
In hard, sound rock, the single
tube
core barrel
may be employed;
if the core
recovery
is poor double tube core barrel should be
preferred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Wrench jaws should not be allowed to touch the
diamonds in a bit. This applies also to reaming shells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
When bits and shells are not in use they should be
wel! oiled over their entire surface and packed in a
separate
box used only
for this purpose.
Each
diamand-set
tool should be prdtected by waste, rags
or other soft packing
to prevent
damage
to the
diamonds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3
The core drilling observations
should be  done  in
accordance
with
IS 5313  :  1980, while the drilling
information
and core description
should be  done in
accordance
with 1s 4464  :  1985.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6
SELECTION
AND CARE
OF CORE BITS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
When drilling
through very hard, fine-grained,
siliceous
rock, the diamonds
may get polished
after
drilling only about a metre or more. When this hap-
pens the diamond bit cannot be expected to make any
further progress in that particular
kind of rock and
should
be
removed
from service and used later,
either in another hole or in that same hole in some
different
kind of formation.
Very often a slight
change in the grain or hardness of the formation
will
remove the polish from the stones and render the bit
useful for much additional
drilling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1
Rock Coring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are no strict rules for the use of bits at rock
drilling.
Type, size, speed, bit pressure and water
pressure
should be adopted to the prevailing
rocks to
make the drilling operation economical.
A choice of
these factors which gives the best core recovery com-
bined
with
good
progress
is the right one (see
Annex
A).
However,
fast progress and good core
recovery as a rule cannot
be cbmbined.

When  drilling  through highly abrasive rock, there
is a tendency
for the metal to wear away from the
diamonds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Bits with big
diamonds
(5 to 15 stones/carat)
are suited for soft
rocks and for fractured rocks of all types.

15 to 30 stones/ carat are intended for hard fractured
rock and bits with 30 to 60 stones/carat
are mostly<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In these cases when the diamonds
become exposed
approximately
one-third of their size, thebits
should
be removed and reset. After one-third

danger of further wearing away of the metal to the
point where the diamonds will drop out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>used in  hard solid rock. The diamonds
that may be
used for different
rocks types are given in Annex A
for guidance.
The bits~indicated
with a cross (X ) in
this Annex
should normally
be used. In some cases
other types of bits may be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
Burnt bits are sometimes caused by not tightening
drill rods before lowering into the hole and depending
on torque when starting to drill to do so. Because of
wash water escaping through the joints the bit may
run dry and hot in the mud and sludge at the bottom
of the hole. The bit will also get burnt if it gets into
the accumulated
sludge at the bottom of thr hole and
drilling is started witbout cleaning the hole bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2
The diameter of the bits should be decided by
the demands
of the drilling
programme;
bigger
diameters
give a better core recovery
and a
less
disturbed core.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Precnrrtions to be Tuken With New Bits<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Items containing
diamonds should be properly hand-
led and maintained
as any erroneous
use may easily
cause expensive
damage
to the equipment
arid/err
hamper drilling operations.
Diamond-set
bits have to be reset at intervals, that is,
the diamonds
are salvaged
and replaced
in a fresh
matrix. Bits should be checked after each run. Reset-
ting should be done on any of the following
indica-
tions:
a)
If the matrix is worn out to the extent more_than
30 to 40 percent of most diamonds exposed. This may
indicate that too soft matrix has been used; thebit may
be reset in a harder matrix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
It is preferable
to use an old bit to start a hole.
Experiments
have shown that in certain formations
the bits used only for starting
holes gave only 9
percent of the normal expected meterage.
It has been
stated that the-first 5 cm of a run takes as much out of
a bit as the next 6 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Speed and bit pressure
should be low to avoid
vibration
and loss of diamonds
(see a/so 8 and 9).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
As
tools
are lowered
near to bottom of the
hole, water circulation
should be started to wash out
settled
cuttings
which usually
extend
up some
distance
from the bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 6926  :  1996<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
If the cutting
sedges
of the diamonds
are
polished,
the ~diamonds have a glare and are shiny.
This is an indication
that the bit has been run with
insufficient
water pressure.
In such cases water
pressure
should be adjusted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7
CORE BARRELS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Single tube core barrels should be used only in
solid unfractured
rock and for the first 25 to 70 cm
when a new hole is started.&
fractured and/or soft
rock, the use of single tube core barrel will cause the
core to be ground, jammed or washed away. Double
tube’core barrels should always be used in fractured
and/or in soft rocks. In very friable rocks Type B core
barrels with bottom discharge bits should be used at
slow speed and low bit and water pressures.
Long
core barrels na-y be used in solid rocks and short ones
in fractured rock. The runs should never completely
fill the core barrels; leave a few centimetres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
If more than 30 percent of the diamond points are
broken,
this often occurs in highly fractured rock
where the diamonds
are exposed to impacts which
will break their points.
In hard rock, vibration= in the
rod string may have the same results.
In such cases
the spindle speed should be reduced or impregnated
bits should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Diamond-Set
Bits<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>High spindle
speed gives
rapid progress
but the
core recovery
will be hampered,
especially
in soft
rocks. The spindle speed should therefore
be regu-
lated
to the properties
of the rock.
At small
diameters
and holes down
to 180 m the spindle
speed may Feach but should
rarely exceed
1 500
rev/min while 100 to 200 rev/ruin is average at great
diameters
and for deep holes.
As an example,
spindle speed should be 100 to 750 rev/min
for NX
bits and 5 to 15 stones/carat;
and for small diameter
bits with 30 to 60 stones/carat,
spindle
speeds of
500 to 1 500 rev/min
are suitable.
The bit speeds
suitable
for various
types of rocks are given
in
Amlex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3
Impregnated
Bits<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These bits are self sharpening
and are designed to be
run to destruction.
They are mostly used in very hard
rock, for example,
hard granite,
gneiss, pegmatite,
hard sandstone,
quartzite,
and flintstone
(see &o
Annex A). In highly fractured rock the impregnated
bits are often more resistant
that diamond-set
bits.
The prerequisite
for the use of impregnated
bits is that
the drilled rock is abrasive,
that is, hard particles of
the sludge will wear away the metal of the matrix thus
exposing the embedded
diamonds.
Impregnated
bits
will become polished if used in wrong type of rock or
at low bit pressure
in comiectidn
with low spindle
speed.
In very hard and fine crystalline
rocks they
may get polished by using a too high spindle speed.
Impregnated
bits should never be run in rocks like
limestone,
marble,
dolomite,
or serpentine
which
create an adhesive
sludge without
any abrasive par-
ticles.
If an impregnated
bit does not cut, it can be
sharpened
by a gentle tapping of the cutting surface
with edge of a big file.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2
Impregnated
Bits<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The impregnated
bits can work within a large range
of spindle speeds and high speeds give more rapid
‘progress.
However, the spindle speed should never
be so high as to cause vibration
in the rods.
The
highest spindle speed should not exceed that giving
a periphery
speed of the bit equal to 2.3 m/s, which
gives maximum
speeds of 1 000 rev/min
for AX
bits, 700 rev/min
for BX bits and 550 rev/min
for

In this connection
the use of double tube or
triple tube core barrel with bottom discharge
bits
would
be found
useful
in ensuring
the maximum
possible core recovery in soft rock or fractured hard
rock.
Special drilling techniques
in such cases may
call for short runs of drilling and judicious
control of
water supply and speed ofdrilling.
Core  recovery
may be ruined by drilling too fast, overdrilling
a run,
or dropping core and grinding it, or not pulling out the
tools when the barrel is jammed and thereby grinding
the core. This also damages the bit. Vibration in the
drill string causes poor core recovery, diamond wear
and diamond
losses in bits and shells, wear and tear
on drills and loss of footage.
