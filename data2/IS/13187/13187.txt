<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Jcdian Standard was adopted by the Bureeu of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized by
the Chemical Engineering
Plants and Related Equipment
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Heavy Mechanical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The term 1iEl-t petroleum
products
includes ccmmercial
naphtha, gasoline,
kerosene-and
diesel oil
( aviation turbine fuel, fuel oil, lubricating oil, or any special petroleum
product is excluded from
the scope ).
The liquids considered
here for this purpose are to be stable at ambient conditions.
It excludes any unstable product,
LPG, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design of the road tanker including the tank, the vehicle and vehicle accessories, etc, shall meet
all requirements
laid down by Statutory
Authorities,
Indian Law ard Motor Vehicle Regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The objective of this standard is to set safe practice
for construction
of road tankers used for bulk
transportation
of light petroleum products in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be
rounded off in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values ( revised )‘.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

products
like aviation turbine fuel which require
special precautions
for purity
and heavy

ducts, such as lubricating
oils, fuel oils, etc, are
not covered
in this standard.
Also, unstable
products
and LPG are excluded from the scope
of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Tank  Capacity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1 The maximum liquid carrying capacity and
dimensions of a road tanker
are to be deter-
mined by the current Motor Vehicles Regulation
and by tank filling criteria
outlined in 4 of this
specification.
Both the requirements
shall be
satisEed. However, the maximum Liquid Carry-
ing Capacity shall not be more than 25 kilolitres
(kl) and maximum compartment
size shall not
be more than
5 kl with oil
tight
