FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 8 October
1974, after the draft finalized by the
Stones Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Building stones are available
in large quantity in various parts of the
country and to choose and utilize them for their satisfactory performance it is
necessary to know the various strength properties determined according to
standard procedure.
This
standard
had, therefore,
been formulated
to
cover the standard method for determining the durability
( soundness ) of
various stones.
This standard was published in 1957 and has been revised
based on the actual use of the standard
in the past 17 years and the
experience gained in testing of building stones for these properties in the
various research laboratories of this country.
This method of test is pres-
cribed so as to find out the capacity of stone to resist disintegration
and
decomposition.
0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,
it shall be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This
standard lays down the
procedure
for testing
the
durability
( soundness) of natural building stones used for constructional purposes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  SELECTION
OF SAMPLE
2.1  The sample shall be selected to represent a true average of the type or
grade of stone under consideration.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The sample shall be selected from the quarried stone or taken from
natural rock, as described in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and shall be of adequate size
to permit the preparation of the requisite number of test pieces,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1
Stones from Ledges or Quarries -
The ledge or quarry face of the stone
shall be inspected to determine any variation in diierent strata.
Differences
in colour, texture and structure
shall be observed.
Separate samples of
stone weighing at least 25 kg each of the unweathered specimens shall be
obtained from all strata that appear to vary in colour, texture and structure.
Pieces that have been damaged by blasting, driving wedges, heating, etc,
shall not be included in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Field Stone and Boulders-A
detailed inspection of the stone and
boulders over the area shall be made where the supply is to be obtained. The
different kinds of stones and their conditions at various quarry sites shall be
recorded.
Separate samples for each class of stone that would be considered
for use in construction as indicated by visual inspection shall be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 When
perceptible
variations occur in the quality
of rock, as many
sampIes as are necessary for determining
the range in properties
shall be
selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  TEST PIECES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The test pieces shall
be cylinders,
50 mm in diameter
and km high
cylinders.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Three test pieces shall be used for conducting the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The test pieces shall be dried for 24 h and weighed.
They shall then be
suspended in super saturated solution of sodium sulphate decahydrate for 16
to 1’8 h at room temperature 20 to 30°C.
These shall then be air dried for
half an hour and then be dried  in  an oven at 105 f  5°C  for 4 hours. These
shall then be cooled to room temperature
( 20 to, 30°C)
and the cycle of
operation shall be repeated for 30 cycles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The test shall be continued to complete 30 cycles.
After the completio
of the final cycle and after the test pieces have been cooled to room
temperature
( 20 to 30°C ), the test pieces shall be.thoroughly
freed of tht
sodium sulphate solution by repeated washing, if necessary, as determined by
the reaction of the wash water with barium chloride ( BaC12  ).
The test
pieces shall be weighed after every five cycles and the change in weight due
to disintegration noted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

test pieces
shall

the course of the test for
development
of cracks or spalling.<<HEADING_END>>

AND REPORT
OF TEST
RESULTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 If W’r is the original weight of the specimen
and WZ is the weight of the
specimen after completion
of 30 cycles of the test (see 4.2 ), the change
in
weight shall be reported as equal to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The
average
of the three
results shall be calculated
and taken as the
durability value of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  The durability
of the stone shall be expressed in percentage
as change
in the weight.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Identification

was taken and type of
stone shall be reported.<<HEADING_END>>
