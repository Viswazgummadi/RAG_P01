<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Increasing
number of thermal
power plants have been coming up in the country
and bringing
with them an acute environmental
problem
in the form of flyash.
Dumping of dry flyash on land
devours large areas of fertile land and also flies off in the air to places near the dumping around
making the
atmosphere
dusty
and unhealthy.
Wet dumping
with water creates
problems like
polluting
the ground water in addition to devouring
the land where this flyash slurry is disposed
off in ponds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To overcome these problem, many new uses for flyash have been found
out through research. One
such use is the use of flyash for making
building bricks in conjunction
with clay. This use of
flyash has the added advantage
of conserving
the fertile top soil in brick manufacturing
areas.
Further,
addition of flyash even improves the brick making qualities of certain types of soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The standard has been prepared on similar lines to the Indian Standard IS 1077  :  1992, Specification
for common burnt clay building bricks (fffh
revision ), keeping
in view the same end use to which
these two type of bricks are put.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Keeping
in view
the
advantages
of moduIar
co-ordination,
Indian
standards
specify
the
dimensions
of standards bricks in 100 mm module as the basis of all dimensional
standardization
in regard to building
components.
This is also in confirmity
with the decision of Government
of
India
to adopt
metric
system
in the country.
Considering
the various
issues regarding
the
manufacturing
and other practices
followed in the country,
the Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of this standard
had specified
modular
size of the brick. Advantages that a
modular brick has over traditional
brick are many, such as:
a) requires less drying area;
b) saving in space of floor area;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) economy in cost of brick masonry;
d) saving in labour cost;
e) less losses during handling etc; and
f) less consumption
of mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However,
it was brought to the notice of committee
that there
was sufficient
demand
for sizes
other than modular
sizes and that the manufacturers
were meeting such demands at present. this
had led to a situation
where bricks satisfying
other
reguirments
of the standard,
but not the
requirements
regarding
dimensions
were
classified
as not satisfying
the requirements
of the
standard. Therefore,
the Committee
has decided to include
the non-modular
size of the brick in
addition to the modular size. This relaxation
will be for a period
of four years from the publi-
cation of this standard
and it is intended that the manufacturers
and consumer organizatiqn
can
gradually
switch over within this period to the modular sizes, which are the preferred
sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed -or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall Abe rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical values (  revised )‘.  The number
of significant places retainffd in the rounded off value
should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of the Standard Mark is governed
by the provisions
of the  Bureau of Indian
Standards
Act, 1986  and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder.
The Standard Mark on
products
covered by an Indian Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply with the requirements
of that standard under a well defined
system of inspection,
testing and quality control which is devised and supervised by BIS and operated
by the pro-
ducer.
Standard marked products
are also continuously
checked by BIS for conformity
to
that standard as a further safeguard.
Details of conditions under which a licence for the use
of the Standard Mark may be granted to manufacturers
or producers
may be obtained-from
