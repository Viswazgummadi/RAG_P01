<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Third Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Bitumen, Tar and Their Products Sectional Committee
had been approved by the
Petroleum, Coal and Related Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was first published in 1951 and was subsequently revised in 1961 and 1981. In the
third revision, two types of road tar, namely, Type A and Type B have been mentioned
to cover the
requirements
of road tar for surface dressing, dense tar surfacings and for open graded premix carpets
with or without seal coat respectively. This has been done to utilize the crude tar produced as a by-product
of carbonization of coal, more specifically to get satisfactory performance of roads under different climatic
conditions prevalent in various parts of the country. The requirements
for specific gravity, equiviscous
temperature
(for RT-5), sofening point (R & B), distillation fractions, softening point (R & B) of pitch
residue of Type A tar have been modified and given in Table 1. The requirements of Type B tar have been
given in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Sectional Committee responsible for the preparation of this standard has taken into consideration
the views of producers, consumers and technologists and has related the standard to the manufacturing
and trade practices followed in the country in this field. Due weightage has also been given to the need
for international
co-ordination
among standards prevailing in different countries of the world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE
4 TYPES AND GRADES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers two types of tar each having
five grades of road tars with different viscosity ran-
ges suitable for different types of road construction
under the climatic conditions prevailing in various
parts of the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Road tars having pitch/anthracene
oil ratios of
3, 3.5, 4 and 5 can be used to give satisfactory
performance
for surface dressings and dense tar
surfacings. However, in case of open textured car-
pets with seal coat road tars of pitch/anthracene
oil
ratios of 3,3.5 and 4 shall be used. If no seal coat is
to be given then road tars of pitch/anthracene
oil
ratios of 3 and 3.5 alone are indicated. In view of
these requirements, road tar shall be of the follow-
ing two types:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

shall be in level with the end of the side tube open-
ing into the condenser. The air condenser
is in-
clined at an angle of 75” to the neck of the flask. The
heating is so adjusted that the distillation is con-
tinued at the rate of 5 ml per minute up to the
prescribed temperature rangewithout
interruption
(see Fig. 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
