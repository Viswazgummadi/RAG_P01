<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
which
is identical with
IS0
7706 : 1985
‘Road vehicles -
Commercial
vehicles -
Clearance envelope for power take-offs  (  PTO )’ was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards on 17 March
1990,
after the draft finalized by the Automotive Transmission Systems
Sectional Committee ( TED 3  )  had been approved by the Transport Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The text of IS0 standard has been approved as suitable for publication as Indian Standard without
deviations.
Certain conventions
are, however,
not identical
to those used in Indian Standards.
Attention is particularly drawn to the following  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) Wherever the words ‘International
Standard’ appear, referring to this standard, they should
be read as ‘Indian Standard’.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) Comma  ( , )  has been used as a decimal marker while in Indian Standards, the current
practice is to use point (  . )  as the decimal marker.<<HEADING_END>>

Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be appeciated that the requirements of this Inter-

the time of its preparation, but it is recommended that, in the
interest of interchangeability for the future, its provisions
should be adopted for new designs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
