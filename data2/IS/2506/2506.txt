FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Indian Stndards Institu-
tion on 30 September
1985, after the draft finalized by the Construction
Plant and Machinery
Sectional Committee had been approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The compaction
of concrete
by vibrations
has revolutionized
the
concept of concrete
technology,
making possible practical
use of low
slump, stiff mixes for production
of high quality
concrete with required
degree of strength,
density,
durability
and impermeability.
Concrete
vibrators of screed board type are essentially
suited for compaction
of
concrete roads,
runways,
floors,
pavements,
thin slabs, etc, where the
area to be compacted
is large or the thickness is too small to allow the
use of immersion
vibrators.
As is generally
known,
the strength of
concrete of stipulated
mix proportions
depends largely on the degree of
compaction
imparted to it in plastic stage.
Insufficient
compaction
results in formation
of voids in concrete
which,~in turn, reduces the strength.
If the void content is 10 percent,
the strength may be reduced by as much as 50 percent.
In such vibrators,
as research results of Central Road Research Insti-
tute, New Delhi and work abroad
have
established, reasonably
high
amplitude
of vibration
corresponding
to a matching
frequency
is of
primary importance for efficient compaction.
This standard has been prep_ared with a view to providing guidance
both in the manufacture
and purchase
of concrete
vibrators of screed
board type capable of giving satisfactory
performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The prime mover to be used with~the vibrator
shall be of sufficient
power to ensure
required performance.
The prime mover may be with
internal
combustion
engine or electric motor
conforming
to relevant
Indian
Standard.
It may be mounted on a suitable base.
A suitable
device for starting or stopping
the vibrator without
disconnecting
the
llexible~shaft from the prime mover may also be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2506 - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>03.1  The moving parts of the vibrator
shall be suitably encased and
appropriate
safeguards against accident
be provided.
Suitable earthing
and other safety
arrangements
shall also be provided for the electrical
motors and components
in accordance
with the provisions laid down in
relevant Indian Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This Indian Standard was first published in 1961. While reviewing
this standard in the light of the experience
gained during these years, it
has been decided to revise the standard
with modifications
in the perfor-
mance
characteristics
of screed
board
vibrators
and the title of the
standard has been changed to general requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 A mere measurement
of amplitude
and frequency
may not always
yield a firm basis for judging
the efficiency
of a screed board vibrator.
On the other
hand, a direct measurement
of the degree and uniformity
of compaction
of concrete
achieved
with such a vibrator would give a
more convincing and fairer appreciation
of its performance.
However,
in view of large number of variables
involved,
it has not been found
feasible as yet to prescribe in this standard, a simpleand practical method
of test for direct measurement
of compaction
characteristics.
Further,
the Sectional Committee has also appreciated
that even the requirements
in regard to amplitude and frequency
may considerably
vary from case
to case and, therefore,
the attempt in this standard has been to lay down
only the limiting rangesof the operational and performance
characteristics
besides the physical dimensions of the vibrators on the basis of available
technical
literature
on
the
subject,
experience
and
the
current
manufacturing
practices in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For
the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of
this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960”.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
