<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
4 May
1979,
after
the dralt finalized
by the
Sanitary
Appliances
and Water Fittings
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Surface
box is a deep metal frame with a lid fixed in the ground
with
the
lid
level at the surface to give access to underground
fittings,
such as
a valve or hydrant.
Surface
boxes are
made
in
different
patterns
and
sizes to suit stop valves, sluice valves, hydrant,
etc.
This standard
covers
the .requirements
for cast iron surface boxes for use with
sluice valves on
service pipes and water mains.
This standard
was first published
in 1966.
In this revision
the tolerances
on various dimensions
of surface boxes have
been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard
is one of a series of Indian
Standards
on water
fittings.
Other
standards
published
so far in the series are given on page 8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this

with,
the
final value, observed
or calculated,
ex-
pressing
the.result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of
significant
places
retained
in the
rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
