<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  This  Indian Standard ( Part V ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 22 March 1973, after the draft finalized by the Building Limes
Seo;titic;lxl Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Hitherto, methods of tests for assessing qualitative requirements of build-
ing limes were included in IS  :  712-1964.
For facilitating the use of these
tests it has been decided to print these tests as different parts of a separate
Indian Standard.
This part covers determination of unhydrated oxide of
building limes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this
standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it
shall be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The sample
shall be slaked at a specified temperature
of 25&2”C
[GC 2.3 of IS:  6932 (  Part III )-1973* 1, the quantity

sufficient to make a stiff putty.
The sample shall then be dried in vacuum
till its mass becomes constant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Before carrying out the analysis, the hydrated lime sample shall be dried.
For this purpose about 25 g of the sample shall be required to be kept in
vacuum until its mass becomes constant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1
Themobalance -
The thermobalance shall consist of an arrangement
wherein the sample can be heated, automatically’weighed at regular intervals
and the temperature of heating and the mass of the sample can be auto-
matically recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
The arrangement
for stopping the temperature rise at any point
shall be provided within this set-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3
Crucible -
The crucible shall be made of a material which does not
in any way react with lime up to 1 400°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.4
Su#jort -
The support over which the crucible is mounted before
sliding over into the furnace shall be made of sintered or fused alumina.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.5
Furnace -
The furnace should be such that its temperature can be
raised at a sufficient
controllable
rate
to 1 lOO’C, preferably
1 400°C.
This furnace may be raised and lowered as required with the help of a
chain arrangement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.6
Autoclave -
The autoclave shall be made of a high pressure steam
vessel provided with a thermometer well.
The autoclave cover lid shall be
equipped with an automatic pressure control and a safety valve device.
A
vent valve shall be provided on the lid of the autoclave so as to allow the
steam
to escape
out whenever
required.
The
pressure
gauge
shall
have a dial with 114 mm diameter and shall be graduated from 0 to 40
kg/cma with scale divisions of not more than O-5 kgkglcms. The heating may
be controlled such that pressure of 21 kg/cm’ can be obtained in  45  to  75
minutes.
The autoclave shall be designed to permit the gauge pressure to
drop from 21 kg/cm* to less than 1 kg/cmb in 1) hours after the supply has
been cut off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.1  Dry the hydrated magnesiun lime powder in a vacuum desiccactor
for 1 hour at a pressure of 10 mmHg ( O-0136 kg/c&  ) .  Accurately weigh<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>I*000 g  of the sample in a crucible and analyse thermogravimetrically at any
heating rate less than 200”C/h.
When the temperature reaches 380°C dis-
continue the heating programme and keep the temperature constant until
no further loss in mass takes place.
Restart heating after 10 minutes and
continue the programme until the mass finally becomes constant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2 Accurately weigh l-000 g portion from the dried hydrated magnesium
lime sample ( see 3.2 ) in a platinum crucible.
Cover this with another
loosely fitting crucible.
Place inside the autoclave.
Heat the autoclave
carefully to raise the pressure to 20.746 kg/cm8 in about 3 hours and keep
it constant for another hour.
Release the pressure gradually.
Dry the
crucible in vacuum, as previously, until the mass becomes constant.
Transfer
the contents of the platinum crucible into the small crucible quantitatively
and analyse thermogravimetrically
as before.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Alternative Method Based on Chemical Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6.0
The amount of unhydrated magnesium oxide in the sample may also
be determined by the following alternative procedure.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTB -
This method is being included in the standard primarily because it is felt
that the instruments required for the earlier
test method may not be immediately
available in the testing laboratories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.1  Principle of Method -
From the percentage of the loss on ignition,
calcium oxide, magnesium oxide [ see IS : 6932 ( Part I ) - 1973 ] *, carbon
dioxide [ see IS : 6932 ( Part II ) - 1973 ]t and sulphur trioxide, ( see 3.6.2 )
the value of unhydrated magnesium oxide may be calculated as given
in 3.6.2.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.2.3  Proteak -
Accurately weigh about 2.5 g of the sample, transfer
it into a beaker and add 10 ml of cold water.
Stir with a glass rod to ensure
that all lumps are broken.
Add 20 ml dilute hydrochloric acid and heat
carefiilly until the diosolution is complete.
Filter through a small filter
paper and wash the residue thoroughly with hot water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dilute the filtrate to about 250 ml.

Heat this solution carefully and
Add 10 ml of hot barium chloride solution drop by drop
with constant agitation.
Boil for further 10 minutes. Stir well and allow to
stand for overnight.
Filter through filter paper No. 42 Whatman or its
equivalent filter paper and wash with boiling water.
Place the filter paper
along with its contents in a weighed platinum crucible.
Slowly incinerate
the paper without inflaming.
Ignite to constant mass and weigh as barium
sulphate ( BaSO, ).
Multiply by O-343 to get SOs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Calculate the water
equivalent of the remaining calcium oxide by multiplying it with
