<<PARAGRAPH>>Introduction<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO
11568
describes
procedures
for
the
secure
management
of
the
cryptographic
keys used to protect
messages
in a retail banking
environment,
for instance,
messages
between
an acquirer
and a card acceptor,
or an acquirer
and a card issuer. Key management
of keys used in an Integrated
Circuit Card
(ICC) environment
is not covered
by ISO 11568 but will be addressed
in another
ISO standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Whereas
key management
in a wholesale
banking environment
is characterized
by the exchange
of keys in a relatively
high-security
environment,
this standard
addresses
the
key
management
requirements
that
are
applicable
in
the
accessible
domain
of
retail
banking
services.
Typical
of
such
services
are
point-of-sdle/point-of-service
(POS)
debit
and
credit
authorizations
and
automated’teller
machine
(ATM) transactions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Key management
is the process whereby
cryptographic
keys are provided
for
use between
authorized
communicating
parties and those keys continue
to be
subject to secure procedures
until they have been destroyed.
The security of the
enciphered
data
is
dependent
upon
the
prevention
of
disclosure
and
unauthorized
modification,
substitution,
insertion,
or termination
of keys. Thus,
key management
is concerned
with the generation,
storage,
distribution,
use,
and
destruction
procedures
for
keys.
Also,
by
the
formalization
of
such
procedures,
provision
is made for audit trails to be established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 11568 does not provide a means to distinguish
between
parties
who share common
keys. The final details
of the key management
procedures
need to be agreed
upon between
the communicating
parties concerned
and will
thus remain
the responsibility
of the communicating
parties.
One aspect of the
details to be agreed upon will be the identity and duties of particular
individuals.
ISO 11568 does not concern
itself with allocation
of individual
responsibilities;
this needs to be considered
for each key management
implementation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 9564 and ISO 9807 specify the use of cryptographic
operations
within
retail
financial transactions
for personal identification
number
(PIN) encipherment
and
message
authentication,
respectively.
ISO
11568
is
applicable
to
the
management
of the keys introduced
by those
standards.
Additionally,
the key
management
procedures
may
themselves
require
the
introduction
of further
keys, e.g. key encipherment
keys. The key management
procedures
are equally
applicable
to those keys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1  Scope<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
following
standard
contains
part
of ISO
11568
provisions
that,
through
reference
in
this
text,
constitute
provisions
of this part of ISO 11568. At the
time
of publication,
the edition
indicated
was valid.
All standards
are subject to revision,
and parties
to
agreements
based
upon this
part of ISO
11568
are
encouraged
to investigate
the possibility
of applying
the
most
recent
edition
of the
standard
indicated
below.
Members
of IEC and ISO maintain
registers
of
currently
valid International
Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 11568 specifies the principles
for the
management
of
keys
used
in
cipher
systems
implemented
within
the retail
banking
environment.
The retail banking
environment
involves the interface
between
a card accepting
device and an acquirer
and
between
an acquirer
and a card issuer. An example
of
this environment
is described
in annex B, and threats
associated with the implementation
ofthis standard inthe
retail banking environment
are elaborated
in annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
part of ISO
11568
applies
both to the
keys of
symmetric
cipher systems,
where
both originator
and
recipient
use the same secret key(s), and to the secret
and public keys of asymmetric
cipher systems,
unless
otherwise
stated.
The
procedure
for the approval
of
cryptographic
algorithms
used for key management
is
specified in annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 8908:1993,

<<PARAGRAPH>>3  Definitions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of ciphers often involves
control
information
other
than
keys,
e.g.,
initialization
vectors
and
key
identifiers.
This other information
is collectively
called
-“keying
material”.
Although
this
part
of ISO
11568
specifically
addresses
the management
of keys, the
principles,
services, and techniques
applicable
to keys
may also be applied to keying material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>For
the
purposes
of
this
part
of
ISO
11568,
the
definitions
given
in
ISO
8908
and
the
following
definitions
apply.<<HEADING_END>>

The
use
of
cryptography
to

Key  management objectives<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
primary
objective
of
key
management
is to
provide
the users with
those
keys that they
need to
perform the required
cryptographic
operations
and to
control the use of those
keys. Key management
also
ensures
that
those
keys
are
protected
adequately
during
their
life cycle. The security
objectives
of key
management
are to minim”ize the opportunity
for a
breach of security,
to minimize
the consequences
or
damages
of  a  security
breach,
and to maximize
the
probability
of detection
of any illicit access or change
to keys that may occur, despite
preventive
measures.
This
applies
to
all
stages
of
the
generation,
distribution,
storage,
use
and
archiving
of
keys,
including
those processes that occur in cryptographic
equipment
and those
related
to
communication

<<PARAGRAPH>>key. The encipherment
key of an asymmetric
cipher
may
be
mada
public
wtiile
the
corresponding
decipherment
key is kept secret.
The
keys are then
referred
to as the public
key and the secret
key. An
example
of an asymmetric
cipher system
is shown “in
figure 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 Cipher systems<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A
cipher
system
comprises
an
encipherment
operation
and
the
inverse
decipherment
operation.
Encipherment
transforms
plaintext
to
cipher-text
using an encipherment
key; decipherment
transforms
the ciphertext
back to plaintext
using a decipherment
key.
Retail
banking
applications
employ
cipher
systems
to protect
sensitive
cardholder
and financial
transaction
data. The data to be protected is enciphered
by the originator
and subsequently
deciphered
by the
receiver.
There
are
two
types
of
cipher
systems:
symmetric
and asymmetric.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 2 —  Example of an asymmetric cipher system<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
characteristics
of
asymmetric
cipher
systems
require that the recipient
hold a secret key with which
the
secret
data
may
be
deciphered.
A
different,
non-secret
(public)
key is used
by the
originator
to
encipher
the
secret
data.
Thus,
asymmetric
cipher
systems
are
unidirectional
ih nature,
i.e.
a pair
of
public
and secret
keys provides
protection
for data
transmitted
in one direction
only.
Public
knowledge
of the
public
key does
not compromise
the
cipher
systam.
When
protection
for
data
transmitted
is
required
in both directions,
two
sets of public
and
secret
key pairs are required.
One common
use for
asymmetric
ciphers is the secure distribution
of initial
keys for symmetric
cipher systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Symmetric
ciphers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A symmetric
cipher is one in which the encipherment
key and decipherment
key are equal or may be easily
deduced
from
one another.
The keys are kept secret
at
both
the
originator
and
recipient
“locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Possession
of
the
secret
key(s)
permits
secure
communications
between
the
originator
and
recipient.

However,
if a

system
is

with
appropriate
key management
techniques
coupled with
secure
cryptographic
devices,
it
may
distinguish
each end and support
unidirectional
key services.
If
the
same
set
of
keys
provides
protection
(e.g.
encipherment,
authentication,
etc. )
of
secret
data
transmitted
in
both
directions,
it
is
known
as
bidirectional
keying.
When
a different
set of keys is
used
for
protection
of
secret
data
transmitted
in
each direction,
it is known
as unidirectional
keying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 Cryptographic
environments<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For both symmetric
and asymmetric
cipher systems,
the confidentiality
of the secret keys and the integrity
of both public and secret keys during storage
and use
depends
upon
a combination
of the
following
two
factors :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>“
a) the security. of the hardware
device
performing
the cryptographic
processing and storage of the keys

security

Key management
services for symmetric
ciphers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A
secure
cryptographic
device
is
a
device
that
provides
secure
storage
for secret
information
such
as keys and provides
security
services
based on this
secret information. The characteristics and management
of such
devices
will
be addressed
in another
ISO
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Key
management
services
are
employed
with
symmetric
cipher systems to ensure compliance
with
the
key
management
principles
listed
in clause
5.
These
services
are
briefly
described
below.
(Techniques
used
to
provide
these
services
are

Physicallysecure environment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Separation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A
physically
secure
environment
is
one
that
is
equipped
with
access controls
or other
mechanisms
designed
to
prevent
any
unauthorized
access
that
would
result in the disclosure
of all or part of any key
or other secret data stored within the environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Key separation
ensures that cryptographic
processing
may operate only with the specific functional
key types,
e.g. message authentication
code (MAC) key, for which
it was designed.
Since keys are input to cryptographic
functions in enc”~hered form, or recalled
in clear form
from secure storage within
the cryptographic
device,
key separation
may be achieved by varying the process
under which they are enciphered
or stored.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Examples
of a physically
secure
environment
are a
safe or a purpose-built
room with continuous
access
control,
physical security
protection,
and monitoring.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A physically
secure
environment
shall
remain

until all keys or other secret data and useful residue
from
such secret data
have
been
removed
from
the
environment
or destroyed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Substitution prevention<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Key substitution
prevention
prohibits
keys that
are
appropriate
for use in a specific function
from
being
used
by parties,
or at times,
other
than

<<PARAGRAPH>>In principle,
there
is no need to provida
protection
to
prevent disclosure of public keys. However,
physical or
logical
protection
shall
be provided
to
prevent
the
unauthorized

of a public kay. In addition to
protecting against public key substitution, protection shall
be provided
to prevent tha unauthorized
disclosure
of
any secret data to be enciphered
undar a public key.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Key integrity
is ensured
by verifying
that the key has
not been altered.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.6
Confidentiality<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Key confidentiality
ensures that secret keys are never

in
addition
to
its
legitimate

unauthorized
abilities that might result in

<<PARAGRAPH>>In some
situations
it is not possible
or feasible
to
prevent
a security
compromise,
but adverse
results
from
the compromise
may

<<PARAGRAPH>>an acauirer.
The. card
acceDtor
takes
a transaction
authorization
from
the
acquirer
as
guarantee
for
payment.
The security
of the transaction
information
exchanged
with
the
acquirer
is important.
Security
features may include message authentication (see 1S09807)
andlor encipherment
of the PIN.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1  Introduction<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This
annex
presents
an
example
of
the
different
parties
involved
in the
retail
banking
environment.
Transaction
processing
systems
are
composed
of
subsystems
operated
by
one
or
more
of
these
parties.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.3
Acquirer<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This example
is included to provide additional
insight
into the key management
principles and requirements
discussed within this part of ISO 11568. The description
has been simplified
and may not apply to all national or
international
environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
transaction
acquirer
provides
transaction
processing
to card acceptors
and card
issuers.
The
acquirer
takes responsibility
for all or for part of the
transaction content according to business arrangements
with
card
issuers
or their
agents.
Thus,
for
some
transactions
the acquirer
may authorize
a transaction
acting as agent of a card issuer. In other cases (e.g.
the transaction
value
exceeds
a certain
threshold),
the transaction
information
is sent to A card issuer or
its agent for authorization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B. 1.1  Cardholder and card issuer<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
cardholder
has a contractual
relationship
with
the card issuer. The card issuer guarantees
payment
for transactions
or services
whenever
the cardholder
identifies
himself.
The
card
serves
to
identify
the
cardholder
and the card issuer. In addition,
the card
may carry other information
such as period of validity
(e.g. expiration
date) and security related information
(e.g. PIN offset). The cardholder
and card issuer may
agree on the method
of issuing the unique, secret PIN
(see ISO 9564-1)
to be used during transactions.
The
transaction
processing
system
has an obligation
to
maintain
the
PIN
secrecy
while
transporting
the
transaction
of
the
cardholder
between
the
card
acceptor
and
the
card
issuer.
The
card
issuer
maintains
the confidentiality
of sensitive
cardholder
data
(e.g.
PINs).
The
card
issuer
may
delegate
responsibility
for verification
of the PIN to an agent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the
acquisition
function,
the
acquirer
needs
facilities
that
provide
secure
processing
for
translation of enciphered PINs in node-to-node
systems,
‘message
authentication
for transaction
exchanges,
etc. For combined acquisition and authorization functions,
the
acquirer
needs
security
facilities
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of the card issuer that they represent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.4
Communications
provider<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The communications
provider delivers retail transactions
sent from card acceptors to acquirers and card issuers.
In some cases, the communication
services are limited
to data transmission,
whereas
in other
cases
more
complex conversion facilities are needed. For example,
the latter type of services maybe
offered by a switch in
an interchange
environment.
Such
a switch
needs
security
facilities
that
complement
and
satisfy
the
requirements
of all business
parties
involved
in the
electronic
delivery
of the transaction.
These
facilities
may provide
secure PIN translation,
PIN verification,
and message authentication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.2
Card acceptor<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The card acceptor
is the party that accepts cards as a
means
of
payment
for
goods
or services.
In
POS
systems,
this
may
be a retailer,
services
company,
financial
institution,
etc.
In ATM
systems
the
card
acceptor may be the same party as the acquirer. Rather
than accepting
the card as direct proof of payment, the
card acceptor
may forward
transaction
information
to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Active
threats
to a system
involve
the
alteration
of

in the system
or changes
to the state of

of the system.
Examples
of active

are a malicious
change
to the

;<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A masquerade
is where
one party
pretends
to be a
different
party.
A masquerade
is usually
used
with
some
form
of an active
attack
such
as replay
and
modification
of
messages
or
data.
For
instance,
authentication
sequences
may
be
captured
and
replayed
after
a valid
authentication
sequence
has
taken place. An authorized
party with
few
privileges
may use a masquerade
to obtain
extra
privileges

<<HEADING level=3>>Threats
may be classified
as accidental
or intentional
and may be active or passive.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.1
Accidental
threats<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Accidental
threats
are
those
that
exist
with
no
premeditated
intent.
Examples
of realized
accidental
threats
include
system
malfunctions,
operational
blunders
and software
bugs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.4.2
Replay<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A
replay
occurs
when
a
message,
or
part
of
a
message,
is repeated
to
produce
an
unauthorized
effect.
For
example,
a
valid
message
containing
authentication
information
may
be
replayed
by
another
party
in
order
to
authenticate
itself
(as
something
that it is not).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.2
Intentional
threats<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Intentional
th rests
may
range
from
casual
examination
using
easily
available
monitoring
tools
to
sophisticated
attacks
using
special
system
knowledge.
An intentional
threat,
if realized,
may be
considered
an “attack”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.4.3
Modification of messages<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Modification
of a message
occurs when
the content
of a data transmission
is altered
without
detection
and results in an unauthorized
effect.
For example,
a
message
“Allow John Smith to read confidential
file
named accounts” is changed to “Allow Fred Brown to
read confidential
file named accounts”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.3
Passive threats<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Passive threats
are those that,
if realized,
would
not
result
in
any
modification
to
any
information
contained
in the
system(s)
and
where
neither
the
operation
nor the
state
of the
system
is changed.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>C.2.4.4
Denial
of service<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Denial of service occurs when a party fails to perform
its
proper
function
or acts
in a way
that
prevents
other parties from
performing
their proper functions.
The
attack
may
be
general,
as
when
a
party
suppresses
all
messages
directed
to
a
particular
destination,
such as a security audit service or when a
party
generates
extra
traffic.
It is also
possible
to
generate
messages
intended
to disrupt the operation
of the
network,
especially
if the
network
has relay
parties
that
make
routing
decisions
based
upon
status reports received
from other relay parties<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d) bypassing
authentication
or
access

mechanisms
; and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>e) penetrating
a cryptographic
device to determine
the keys stored within
it.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.4.7
Trapdoor<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A trapdoor
is a
hidden
unauthorized
software
or
hardware
mechanism
that may be triggered
to allow
the ,system
security
features
to
be
bypassed.
The
trigger
may be an external
command
(e.g. a special
key sequence)
or an
internal
predetermined
event
(e.g.
a counter
or date/time
value).
For example,
a
password
validation
program
could
be modified
so
that
when
a specific
key sequence
is entered,
the
attacker’s password
is validated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.4.5
Insider attacks<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Insider
attacks
occur
when
legitimate
users
of
a
system
behave
in unintended
or unauthorized
ways.
Most
known
computer
crime
has
involved
insider
attacks that compromised
the security of the system.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.4.8
Trojan horse<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
a software
program
that performs
a legitimate
function contains a hidden unauthorized
function
that
exploits
the
legitimate
function,
the
unauthorized
function
is called
a Trojan
horse.
For
example,
a
program
that
legitimately
copies
secret
data
to
a
protected file could be modified
to also copy the data
to a file accessible
by the attacker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.4.6
Outsider
attacks<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Outsider
attacks may use techniques
such as :<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) wire tapping
(active or passive) ;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) intercepting
emissions
