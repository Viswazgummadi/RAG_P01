<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
(  Third-Revision
) was adopted
by the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by the Waterproofing
and Damp-proofing
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen
felt is one of the materials
used for waterproofing
of roofs.
felt is-adopted
not only in the case of buildings
and
structures,
Waterproofing
treatment
with bitumen
but also in the case of railway
coaches,
bus
bodies,
etc. This standard
is one of a series of Indian
Standards
dealing
with
damp-proofing
and water-
proofing
using bitumen
~felts and covers the laying
operation.
The general
features
relating
to damp-proofing
and
water-proofing
with
regard
to design
detail,
surface
preparation,
drainage,
etc,
are
covered
in
IS 3067  :  1988 and this
standard
is -intended
to cover
only
the
execution
part
of the work relating
to
application
of bitumen
felt in waterproofing
of roofs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is the third
revision
of the standard
which
was first published
in 1959. In this revision
relevant
clauses
of the standard
have been modified
and
new
clauses added
wherever
required
to take care of the slope of
the roof, drainage,
roof garden
and
external
fire and
in all the
treatments
other than floating,
a layer of
primer
has been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Waterproofing
treatment
to be efficient
and lasting,
has to be carefully
carried
out ~from the time the surface
is  prepared
to receive  the felt to the finishing
of the treated
surface.
Special
attention
and strict supervision
has necessarily
to be paid to proper
overlapping
of joints
in felts, treatment
around
drainage
opening
in the
roof and treatment
of the parapet
walls. The sticking
of the felt to the roof
by
means
of hot bitumen
also
requires &ill,  if the job is to be done economically
and to give good results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given to international
co-ordination
among
the
standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in
addition
to relating
it to the
practices
in the
field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The lower edge of the flashing
shall overlap the felt laid on the
Aat portion of
the roof and the upper edge of the flashing shall

<<PARAGRAPH>>The underlay or first layer
of coated felt shall be
secured by nails spaced at 100 to 150 mm centres
along overlaps and at 20 mm from the exposed
edges. In case of struck on treatment, the felt shall
be bonded with the timber roof in the same manner
as in the case of masonry roof
but with nailing
strips and back nailing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2.1
After all the
layers specified have
been
laid and the flashings properly bonded, the groove
shall be filled up with cement mortar
( normally
1  :  4 ), or lime mortar ( 1  :  3 ), or cement concrete
( 1  : 3 : 6 )  which when
set, will satisfactorily
secure
the treatment
to the wall. The
groove
filling shall be properly
cured
by watering for
at least 4 days after tilling to ensure satisfactory
strength and to avoid shrinkage cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.1

additional
nailing may be
provided

roofs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.2.2
It is essential to apply a cement
mortar
fillet of 1  :  4 along the wall and floor juncture.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3 In the case of a gabled roof, one single strip
of felt shall cover from gutter
to gutter,
over the
ridge.
If the treatment
consists of one layer of
felt
only,
as in
normal
treatment
( see 6.2 ),
an additional
layer
of felt shall be provided at
the ridge which shall cover a length of slope of
250 mm on both sides of the ridge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.3
Drain Mouths<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Drain
mouths with a bell mouth
entry shall be
fixed and properly set to allow the water to flow
into it. Felt shall generally be laid as on the other
portion of the roof and the treatment
shall be
carried inside the drain pipes overlapping at le&t
10
mm. Lf possible a grating cap should be pro-
vided.over
the drain
mouth to protect checking
caused by leaves, stonesetc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.4
Flashings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the parapet
is of masonry construction,
the
flashing shall be treated
in the same way as
in 7.2.2.
In case the roof butts against a vertical
timber wall, the flashings shall be continuously
bonded down over the felt turn up and angle
fillet.
Joints in the felt flashings shall be lapped
100 mm and sealed. The upper end of the flashing
shall be firmly secured
to the timber wall by
screwing down with a timber batten.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.4
Gutters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The treatment to be laid in the gutters shall pro-
vide for one layer of roofing felt more than is
provided on the roof proper.
Hence
atleast two
layers of felt shall be laid in the gutters even when
only one layer of felt has been specified for the
roof as in normal treatment  ( see  6.2 ). A priming
coat shall first be applied. Over this, the first layer
of felt shall be bonded with hot bitumen followed
by successive layers of felt securely bonded together<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Shell  Roofs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.1  In the case of shell roofs, an additional layer
of felts shall be provided for the valley gutter for
normal treatment and for other types of treatment,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 1346 : 1991<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-the number of felts in the valley gutters shall be
one layer extra.
The
treatment
on the valley
gutter shall be laid first and the height to which
the felt is to be taken shall be at least 150 mm
above the anticipated standing water in the gutter.
For normal treatment on pent roofs or shell roofs;
the felt shall be laid parallel to the direction of
the run off gradient.
The
felts in case of shell
roofs shall be laid from one edge of the valley
gutter to the other, that is, round the curvature.
In the case of northlight cylindrical
shells, it can
either start from the valley gutter
or from the
upper edge.
The
upper edge
shall be securely
anchored at the edge of the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 Expansion
Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Expansion
joints
shall be designed to suit the
requirements of each roof. Expansion joint cover-
ings may be of zinc or of lead sheet or of bitumen
felt.
In case of the latter, a minimum
of two
layers of bitumen
felt, Type 2, Grade 2 as speci-
fied in IS 1322  :  1982 or Type 2, Grade 1 as per
IS 7193  :  1974 shall be used with a top dressing
gravel or other suitable
finish, The
typical cases
are illustrated in Fig. 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - Where insulation has been specified, the insu-
lating material  shall be  applied
on the top of the shell
surface and plastered,  if necessary, with cement mortar
to provide adequate base for application of waterproo-
fing treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Treatment
of Bubble
Formation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>If ballooning occurs, the defect may be rectified as
given in 7.6.1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.1.1
When felt is laid parallel to the direction
of runoff gradient that is, round the curvature in
case of shell roof, side of overlap
should be 100
mm and overlap at the end should be 75 mm
( Min ) that is side overlap
and overlap
at end
should interchange with those as in the case when
felt is laid across the runoff gradient.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.1
Remove the gravel on the ballooned surface.
Then
cut open and squeeze out
the
trapped
vapour by firm pressure applied by hand. Seal the
bitumen felt so lifted, back on the surface by apply-
ing additional bitumen. Finally seal the cut with a
piece of bitumen felt with bitumen application and
reapply the gravel
finish over it to make the sur-
face look uniform with the rest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.2
Surface Finishing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Instead of the normal bituminous gravel finish the
surface may be finished as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
