<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydraulic Structures Instrumentation Sectional Committee, WRD 16<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 1 ) ( Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the drafl
finalized by the Hydraulic Structures Instrumentation Sectional Committee had been approved by the Water Resources
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When load is applied to a soi Imass, part of it is carried by the soil particle skeleton and remaining part by the air
and water entrapped
between
the soil particle
skeleton.
The load is distributed in direct proportion to the
relative stiffness of the individual phases. The pores between the soil particles are very small and may be partly
filled with water. Therefore,
the pressure in the air and water, which fills the pore space will be different. The
effective stress, related to these known stresses, is crucial
in soil engineering for analyzing
its deformation
behaviour. The porous tube piezometer is a device for measuring pore water pressures primarily in a foundation
though it can also be used to measure pore pressure in an embankment. It is more sensitive to foundation pressures
or ground water fluctuations and is more resistant to plugging due to silting than the conventional observation
well  which
it replaces.
The porous tube piezometer can
be installed at any location, being
an
independent
installation.
Since it can be installed after
completion of construction, there is no hindrance to the construction
of dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Proper installation of piezometers in earth fills and their foundations provide significant quantitative data indicating
the magnitude and distribution of pore pressure and their variations with time. It also helps to know the pattern
of seepage, zones of potential piping and effectiveness of seepage control
measures.
The data obtained from
such piezometers serves the following purposes :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)
It  indicates potentially dangerous conditions that may adversely affect the stability of a dam.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)
It  helps to monitor the post-construction
behaviour of dams and their foundations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
It provides basic data for improvement of design practices and criteria that will promote safer and more
economical design and construction of earth and rock fill dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
It enables evaluation of the effectiveness of grout curtain,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1974 and subsequently revised in 1992.
In this revision, description
of
equipments, installation procedure, correction for time lag and data sheet for porous tube piezometer readings
( Annex A ) have been modified in the light of experience gained over the years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There
is no 1S0 standard on the subject.
This standard has been prepared based on indigenous manufacturers
data/practices
prevalent in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given at Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard
is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated
expressing the result of a test or analysis, should be rounded off in accordance
with
1S 2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values ( revised)’.
The number of significant
places retained in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<HEADING_END>>

DESCRIPTION
AND
WORKING
OF THE
APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Standpipe<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is a durable rigid PVC pipe of an outside diameter
of 12 mm and wall thickness of 1.5 mm. Maximum
available lengths shall be used to minimize joints. In
case of water level sounder of 8 mm dia or more the
diameter of the tubing may be increased, provided
the consequent increase in response time is acceptable
for the intended use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The intake point of the piezometer consists of a
porous Carborundum/alundum tube of annular cross-
section. The bottom end of the porous tube is plugged
with a suitable rubber stopper. The porous tube is
set in a hole which is either drilled or jetted into the
foundation/embankment to a predetermined elevation.
The porous tube is surrounded
by sand and has a
riser pipe extended to the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5
Joints
for PVC Pipe<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The pressure of the pore water surrounding the
porous tube causes a flow of water through the pores
of the porous tube which rises in the riser pipe. The
elevation of water in the riser pipe is determined by a
suitable device lowered from the top of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These are required for jointing the available lengths
of  PVC  pipes. The joints should be of suitable type
to ensure no leakage and should be smooth and flush
inside to prevent lodging of air bubbles and smooth
passing of the sounder. The joiner or coupler for PVC
pip-esmay be made of rigid PVC having internal diameter
same as of the PVC pipes.
Suitable adhesive/resin
may be used for joining lengths of PVC tubing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 A typical assembly of the porous tube piezometer
is shown in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4 WATER LEVEL SOUNDER<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Porous
Tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 It comprises of two insulated wires passing through
a probe of 6 mm diameter of suitable material.
The
lower ends of wires shall be bare for contact with water.
The water level sounder is required to be lowered from
the surface intc the PVC tube with the help of the
connecting graduated cable for taking observations.
Suitable
markings
should be given on the cable
preferably at 0.5 m intervals with an arrangement to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is a porous Carborundum or alundum tube
of
annular cross-section, 37 mm outer dia  x  6 mm wall
thickness and about 60 cm long. It maybe of shorter
lengths also depending on the height of the structure.
The length of the porous tube and the sand backfill

of Porous
Tube
Assembly<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The assembled porous tube apparatus is then lowered
into the hole, maintaining a small positive. pressure
in the tank to cause an outward flow of water from
the tip. This will prevent movement of fines into the
porous tube. The original elevation at the middle point
of porous tube is then measured to the nearest 1 cm.
This will be the elevation at which pre-pressure reading
is planned ( see phase 4, Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5  INSTALLATION
PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  The various phases and steps involved in the

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1
Phase
1 — Advancing
and Cleaning
of Hole<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With the assembled porous tube assembly resting on
sand at the bottom of hole, the casing is withdrawn
approximately
30 to 60 cm above its top in small
increments, depending on the condition of the wall
of hole. The saturated sand is poured in to the hole
on each withdrawal upto a minimum of 30 cm above
the top of porous tube ( see phase 5, Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A minimum of 100mm diameter cased hole is advanced
to about 30 to 60 cm below the planned elevation of
the porous
tube
by jetting
or accepted
drilling
procedure. For a drilled hole, clean water is circulated
till the discharge from the hole becomes clear. For a
jetted hole, the jet pipe is pulled a few centimetres
from the bottom of hole to be used as intake.
The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.6  Phase
6 — Completion
of Installation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>casing
is tilled
by reversing
flow  of clear water until
the cloudiness disappears from the etlluent. The pump
is then stopped ( see phase 1, Fig. 2 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The casing
is then pulled
in small
increments,
approximately 1m or as the hole,permits. The hole is
backfilled with workable cement sand grout 1:4 which
is then puddled with tamping bar maintaining the stand
pipe at the center of hole during each increment. This
process is continued till about 125 cm length of casing
remains within the hole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2
Phase
2 — Backfilling
Below
Porous
Tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the hole is cleaned, the casing is raised by 30
to 60 cm depending
on the relative permeability of
natural soil surrounding the hole ( greater length for
lower permeability and  vice versa ).  The space created
should
be backfilled
with clean
saturated
sand
( excluding
silt ) satisfying the filter criteria with
respect to the surrounding soil. However, if there is
tendency
for sloughing/caving
in, the process of
raising and backfilling with sand should be in increments
of 15 cm or less. The backfilled sand should then be
tamped with a bar or pipe before installation proceeds
( see phase 2, Fig. 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The casing isthen cut-off about 15cm above the ground
surface. The annular surface between the stand pipe
and casing pipe is filled with grout to within 7.5 cm
of top of casing pipe. The stand pipe is cut flush with
top of casing pipe and is covered with the removable
metallic pipe cap. The concrete is then placed near
the top, all around the casing pipe.
The system is
protected against damage by means of tripod or fence
made of pipe sections or reinforcement steel and fixed
into the ground ( see phase 6, Fig.2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The porous tube is either soaked in warm water for
several hours or boiled in water for 15 min before it
is ready for installation.
The length of porous tube
along
with
the projecting
top adaptor/plug
is
measured.
The assembled apparatus
including the
stand pipe, after testing
against
leakage,
is then
immersed in the hole filled with clear water so that its
top is about 1 m below the water surface. The stand
pipe is then
connected to a small tank and using
reversible pump, water is drawn through porous tube
into the tank. The process is continued
till air is
completely
eliminated
from the system, taking care
that some depth of water remains over the top of porous
tube ( see phase 3, Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the filling and depletion of the reservoir, the piezometer
should be read for every 3 m rise or fall of the lake
level.
For the first five years after completion,
fortnightly observations
should be taken if the rate
of change of water level is slower than 3 m per fortnight.
After five years observations may be taken monthly.
During rainy seasons more frequent readings may be
recorded, if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 OBSERVATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 The casing pipe and then the plastic standpipe
are uncapped and the water level sounder is lowered
into the standpipe.
The depth, where the sounding
device gives indication of contact with ground water
should be read off from the marked cable. This is the
level up to which water is standing in the standpipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Distance between half metre marks on the cable could
be scaled off by a metre scale graduated to every
2  mm.  Knowing the distance from top of the installation
to the water surface in the standpipe, the elevation
of water surface can be determined.
The difference
of the elevation of the water surface and the elevation
of the mid-point of the porous tube gives the pore
pressure of water in metres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1
Every two months each standpipe should be
tested for any clogging. Clogging or sedimentation
can be controlled by raising the water level in the pipe
by adding air-fi-eewater from the top of the pipe thereby
allowing outward flow of water with sediments from
the periphery of the porous tube. Compressed air,
however, should not be used to revive a piezometer
as this would fill the pores of the tube with air, which
would be impossible to remove,
It is essential that
air should be prevented from entering the pores of
the tube at all times as the presence of air will lead to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2  All missing screw caps on tops of the standpipes
and casing pipes should be replaced with their original
numbers stamped.<<HEADING_END>>

The top levels of the standpipes
should be
checked by an accurate Ievelling instrument, in case
any change in levels is suspected.<<HEADING_END>>
