FOR DETERMINATION
OF
CARBOFURAN
RESIDUES
IN CROPS,
SOIL AND WATER<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 31 August 1984, after the draft final&d
by the Pesticides Residue
Analysis Sectional Committee had been approved by the Agricultural
and
Food Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Carbofuran formulations are extensively
used in agriculture
for the
control of many insect pests. Frequent
and increased
use of carbofuran
formulations
often result in harmful
effects due to toxic nature of residues.
Careful assessment of residues is, therefore, an important step in safeguard-
ing human health and in the establishment of sound regulatory policy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard will enable the health authorities and others engaged in
field to follow uniform test procedure
for the estimation
of carbofuran
residues in crops, soil and water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with
this standard,
if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1 .l  This standard prescribes spectrophotometric
and gas chromatographic
methods
for the determination
of carbofuran
(2, 3-dihydro-2, 2-dimethyl-
7-benzofuranyl methyl
carbamate),
3 hydroxy
carbofursn
and 3 keto-
carbofuran residues in crops, soil and water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.1  The spectrophotometric
method may be adopted as a limit test for
routine purposes and is generally applicable at 0’1 l&g ( 0’1 ppm ) residue
level, whereas,
the gas chromatographic
method
shall be the reference
method with the limit of detection of 0’02 pg/g ( 0’02 ppm ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.2  Though
no set procedure for Thin Layer Chromatography
(TLC )
is being prescribed,
standardized
TLC procedures may be followed,
if
necessary
for the purpose of clean up, identification and confirmation
of
carbofuran residues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. QUALITY OF REAGENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Unless specified otherwise,
pure chemicals
and distilled water ( see
IS  :  1070-1977* > shall be employed in tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
‘Pure  chemicals’ shall mean chemicals that do not contain impurities
which affect the results of  analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. SAMPLING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The representative samples for the purpose
of estimating
carbofuran

with 100 ml of mcth)lene chloride.
Do not allow the solvent to fall to

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2  Pour the concentrated
extract
obtained as in 4.4 slowly into the
column, followed by three washings with
10 ml portions

When the last
liquid has percolated into the column, add 100 ml of diethyl ether
and
dichloromethane
mixture (2:l  1  and collect the eluate at the rate of 2 ml per
minute. Add 3 drops of propylene glycol,and evaporate the solvent almost
to dryness in Kudrena Danish evaporative

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.53 This additional clean-up step is required
when the spectrophoto-
metric method
is adopted
for its determination.
Dissolve the
residue
obtained
as in 4.52 in 2 ml of acetone and transfer to a glass stoppered 50
ml test tube. Wash the evaporator twice with 2 ml portions of acetone and
transfer the washings to the test tube.  Add
7  ml of coagulating
solution,
shake, allow to stand  for 10 minutes, with occasional shaking and filter
through Whatman No. 42 or equivalent filter paper tube and proceed
for
determination
as given in 5.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Place the test tubes containing
6’5  ml of the cleaned up solution ( see 4.5.3 ) in an ice bath, add 2 ml of
methanolic potassium hydroxide solution and continue
the determination
as in standard curve preparation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.1  Preparation of the Standard Curve -
Pipette 0, 0’5, 1’0,  2’0,
3’0,
4-0, 5’0  and 6’0  ml  of the working standard ( 20 [*g/ml > solution of carbo-
fu:an into a series of glass stoppercd test tubes and adjust  the final volume
in all the tubes to 6 ml. Pipette 7 ml of the coagulating solution, allow to
stand for 10 minutes with occasional shaking.
Pipette 6’5  ml  aliquot from
each test tube to a second glass stoppered test tube, representing 0, 5, IO,
20, 30, 40, 50 and  60 pg  of carbofuran.
Place the tubes in an ice bath. Add
2 ml of methanolic potash solution, mix and allow to stand for 5 minutes.
Add 1 ml of cold chromogenic reagent and mix well. Read the absorbance
of this solution at 550 nm after
2 minutes,
against
a reagent
blank.
Prepare the standard
curve by plotting absorbance against micrograms of
carbofuran.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Expression
of Results -
Report carbofuran residues in the samples by
using the standard curve, in terms of pg/g ( ppm ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.  GAS  CHROMATOGRAPHIC
METHOD
6.1  Principle
-
The carbofuran
residue in the
extracts after clean up is
hydrolysed under alkaline conditions
to its phenol and is derivatized to its
2, 4-dinitrophenyl
ether using 1-fluoro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene.
The derivative
is extracted in n-hexane and estimated by gas chromatographic
using either
an electron capture or thermoionic
detection system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Apparatus<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  Gas Chromatograph -  A gas chromatograph
equipped with either
a thermoionic or an electron capture detector is operated under the follow-
ing  suggested parameters.
These parameters may be varied  as  per available
facilities provided standardization
is done.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
