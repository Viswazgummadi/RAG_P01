<<PARAGRAPH>>Environmental Protection Sectional Committee, CHD 012<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Environmental Protection Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) is the most important parameter to determine the degree of
pollution in lakes and streams at any time and their self purification capacities, assess the
biodegradable organic load of the wastewaters for design of wastewater management system and
thereafter to evaluate the efficiency of the same. As per definition BOD of a sample is defined as
the amount of oxygen required by the micro-organisms to oxidise the organic matter by aerobic
microbial decomposition to stable inorganic forms at some standard time and temperature. As per
recommendations of the Royal Commission of Great Britain standard conditions are laid down as
20°C and 5 days. The standard temperature of 20°C is based on the average aquatic temperature
of Great Britain and 5 days incubation period with an assumption that most of the carbonacious
organic demand is satisfied during this period. The BOD test is being carried out with these
standard conditions for nearly 3 decades throughout the world and our country is no exception.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, it is felt that 20°C is not a universal average temperature and particularly for a tropical
country like India where the temperatures of surface water in rivers, lakes, etc, vary from 20 to
35°C in different seasons and in different parts of the country. The average aquatic temperature in
our country is around 27°C. Hence, to be more realistic to the Indian aquatic environment the
technical committee responsible for formulation of this standard felt necessary to establish a
higher temperature and thereby lower incubation period which would yield BOD values
comparable to the standard conditions of 20°C and 5 days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) test uses standard laboratory procedures to determine the
relative oxygen requirements of waters, wastewaters, effluents, etc. There are a number of
variations to the oxygen demand test prescribed in this standard. These include using shorter or
longer incubation periods, higher temperatures, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, considerable assistance has been derived from Standard
Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater published by American Public Health
Association, Washington, USA, 16th edition. This standard supersedes Clause  12  of IS 2488
(Part 1) : 1966 Methods of sampling and test for industrial effluents, Part 1 and Clause  53  of
IS 3025 : 1964 Methods of sampling and test (physical and chemical) for water used in industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (October 2000). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final
value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2 : 1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

check is outside the range of 200 ± 37 mg/l,
reject any BOD determinations made with the
