has been adopted
so as to make Indian Standard
identical
with the International
Technical
Report. Therefore,
this standard
cancels
and replaces
1S/1S0 10013:1995.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The text of the ISO Standard
has been approved
as suitable
for publication
as Indian Standard
without
deviations.

conventions
are, however, not identical
to those used in Indian Standards.
Attention
is particularly
drawn to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wherever
the words ‘International
Standard’
appear
referring
to this standard,
they should
be
read as ‘Indian
Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this adopted
standard,

appears
to the following
International
Standard,
for
which an Indian Standard

General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
arrangement
of quality
management
system
documentation
typically
follows
either
the
processes
of the
organization
or the structure
of the applicable
quality
standard,
or a combination
of both.
Any other
arrangement
that satisfies
the organization’s
needs may also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The structure
of the documentation
used in the quality
management
system
maybe
described
as a hierarchy.
This
structure
facilitates
the distribution,
maintenance
and
understanding
of the documentation.
Annex
A illustrates
a
typical
hierarchy
of quality
management
system
documentation.
The development
of a hierarchy
depends
on the
circumstances
of the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The extent
of the quality
management
~ystem documentation
can differ from one organization
to another
due to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the size of the organization
and type of activities,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the complexity
of processes
and their interactions,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the competence
of personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
quality
management
system
documentation
may
include
definitions.
The
vocabulary
used
should
be
in
accordance
with standard
definitions
and terms, which are referenced
in ISO 9000 or in general
dictionary
usage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality

Types of work instructions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although
there
is no required
structure
or format
for work
instructions,
they generally
should
convey
the purpose
and scope of the work and the objectives,
and make reference
to the pertinent
documented
procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Whichever
format
or combination
is chosen,
the
work
instructions
should
be
in the
order
or sequence
of the
operations,
accurately
reflecting
the requirements
and relevant
activities.
To reduce
confusion
and uncertainty,
a
consistent
format
or structure
should
be established

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1
Responsibility
for preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quality
management
system
documentation
should
be developed
by those
persons
involved
with the processes
and
activities.
This
will
lead
to a better
understanding
of the
necessary
requirements
and
provide
a sense
of
involvement
and ownership
by personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
review
and utilization
of existing
documents
and references
can significantly
shorten
the quality
management
system
documentation
development
time,
as
well
as
being
an
aid
in
identifying
those
areas
where
quality

inadequacies
need to be addressed
and corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2
Method
of preparation
of quality
management
system
documentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organizations
that are in the process
of implementing,
or have
yet to implement,
a quality
management
system
should<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
identify
the processes
necessary
for the effective
implementation
of the quality
management
system,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
understand
the interactions
between
these processes,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
document
the processes
to the extent necessary
to assure their effective
operation
and control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Analysis
of the processes
should
be the driving
force
for defining
the amount
of documentation
needed
for the
quality
management
system.
It should
not be the documentation
that drives the processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
sequence
of
preparation
of quality
management
system
documentation
does
not
necessarily
follow
the
hierarchy
illustrated
in annex

procedures
and work
instructions
are often
prepared
prior to
finalizing
of the quality

and
to
limit
the
size
of
the
documentation,
reference
to
existing
recognized
quality
management
system
standards
or documents
available
to the document
user should
be incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
using
references,
specifying

avoided
in order
to
preclude

documents<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1
Review and approval<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to issue, the documents
should
be reviewed
by authorized
individuals
to ensure
clarity,
accuracy,
adequacy
and proper structure.
The intended
users should
also have the opportunity
to assess
and comment
on the usability
of the
documents
and
on
whether
the
documents
reflect
actual
practices.
Release
of documents
should
be
approved
by the
management
responsible
for
their
implementation.
Each
copy
should
have
evidence
of this
release authorization.
Evidence
of approval
of documents
should
be retained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2
Distribution<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
method
of distribution
of the
documents
by authorized
personnel
should
ensure
that
pertinent
issues
of
appropriate
documents
are available
to all personnel
who
will need
the
information
included
in the
documents.
Proper
distribution
and
control
may
be aided,
for example,
by using
serial
numbers
of individual
copies
of the
documents
for
recipients.
Distribution
of documents
sudh
as the
quality
manual
and
quality
plan
may
include
external
parties
(e.g. customers,
certification
bodies
and regulatory
authorities).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3
Incorporation of changes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A process for the initiation,
development,
review,
control
and incorporation
of changes
to the documents
should
be
provided.
The same
review
and approval
process
used in developing
the original
documents
should
apply
when
processing
changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4
Issue and change control<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Document
issue
and
change
control
are
essential
to ensure
that
the
contents
of the
documents
are
properly
approved
by the authorized
personnel
and that the approval
is readily identifiable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various
methods
may be considered
for facilitating
the physical
process
of making
changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A process
should
be
established
to
ensure
that
only
the
appropriate
documents
are
in use.
Under
cettain
circumstances,
the appropriate
document
to be used
may
not be the
latest
revision
of the document.
Revised
documents
should
be replaced
by the latest
revision.
A document
master
list with

to
assure the users that they have the correct
