<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the
draft
finalized
by
the
Dams
( Overflow
and
Non-overflow)
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the River
Valley Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Due to seepage problem
through
upstream
face of masonry
dams on account
of poor
workmanship,
non-availability
of skilled
workers,
etc, it has been felt of late to take certain
additional
measures
to minimise
this
seepage
and
bring
it down
within
permissible
limits.
The possible
measures
generally
taken to minimise
such seepage are: (1)  upstream  concrete
mantle,
(2) sandwitch
concrete
membrane,
and (3) guniting
upstream
face.
This
standard
covers only the guidelines
for guniting
upstream
face of masonry
dams to give necessary
guidance
in this respect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
covers the general
guidelines
to be
followed
for guniting
upstream
face of masonry
dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water
used
for
guniting
should
conform
to the
requirements
specified in IS 456 : 1978.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Admixtures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Admixtures
should
be
used
only
when
so
required.
Admixtures
when
used
should
meet
the requirements
of IS 9103 : 1979.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
Indian
Standards
listed
in
Annex
A
are
necessary
adjuncts
to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 TERMLNOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Admixtures
containing
chlorides
should
not be
used
in
gunite
exposed
to
water
containing
sulphates
or in gunite
which

depending
upon site conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Ordinary
Portland
cement
conforming

conforming
to IS 8041  :  1990; and
f) Sulphate
resisting
Portland
cement
conforming
of IS 12330 : 1988.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 SURFACE
PREPARATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 The
masonry
surface
where
guniting
is
required
to be done,
should
be made rough by
chipping
and raking
out mortar
joints.
Chipping
should
be done
by
using
chisels and hammers.
After
roughening
the
surface
and
raking
of
joints,
the face should
be cleaned
and
washed
by
air
and
water
jets
under
pressure.
It should
be
ascertained
that
no
loose
material,
dirt
or any
other material
is left on the face.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Before guniting,
the masonry
face
should
be
kept
clean
and
free from
oil,
dirt,
etc, as this
would prevent
the gunite
from forming
bond with
the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Sand<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sand for guniting
should
comply
with the require-
ments
given
in
LS 383  :  1970.
Sand
generally
conforming
to zone
2 or 3 grading
should
be
specified but coarser
sand may also be used.
The
actual grading
should
be decided
at the
site
after
making
trial
mixes.
Finer
sand would generally
result
in greater
drying
shrinkage
and
coarser
sand would give more rebound.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Arrangements
should
be made
for protecting
adjacent
surfaces
which are not to be gunited,
by
using waterproof
paper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Adjoining
face or bed which will be spoiled
by
guniting
due
to
rebound,
should
also
be
protected,
for
example,
intake
struture,
spillway
pier, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sand
should
not
contain
more
than
2 percent
dust
below
0’2 mm
as the dust tends to form a
harmful
coating
on
the
aggregate
particles.
Moisture
content
of sand
should
not be greater
than 5 percent,
otherwise
clogging
of the
hose
and nozzle may occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 Absorption
of water
from
the gunite, to the
underlying
masonry
is critical
as this might
result
in cracking
of the
gunite.
The
surface
to be
gunited
should
be properly
dampened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_4>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>\<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13645 : 1993<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2 Shooting
strips
should
be used
to ensure
proper
thickness
of gunite
and
to facilitate
the
forming
of straight
iines and sharp arrises.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 FIXING
OF WIREMESH<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The wiremesh
should
be fixed to the masonry
by
means
of wall
plugs
and nails placed about
750  mm apart.
Adjacent
sheets
should
be firmly
tied
together
with
wire at intervals
not exceeding
200 mm.
The
mesh
should
be placed
slightly
away
from
the masonry
( 12 mm minimum
) and
should
have
minimum
cover
according
to
IS 456  :  1978. The
minimum
wiremesh
spacing
should
be 50 mtn i< 50 mm
and
wiremesh
should
be lapped
one and a half squares
in all directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3 The nozzle should
be held in the
optimum
position
for
placement
at all times.
The nozzle
should
be held at a distance
of 0’6 to 1’2 m from
the receiving
surface and at right angles to it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.4 All vertical
surfaces
should be worked
from
the bottom
to the top.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.5 All
sand
pockets
should
be cut
out and
m;ide good during
the course of guniting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 GUNITING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.6 The
first
coat
should
be screeded
with a
sharp-edged
trowel
to
bring
the surface
true to
line and level.
Subsequent
coats
should
be shot
onto a hardened
wetted surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gunite
mix should
normally
consist
of 1 part
of cement
to 3 parts
of dry sand by mass and
conforming
to the requirements
given
in
14.
On
vertical
surface a thickness
of 25 to 38 mm
may
normally
be deposited
in one operation;
but, if
the weather
is wet, this may have
to be reduced
to
19 mm.
For
higher
thickness,
the
gunite
should
be built
up by successive
applications,,
the
previous
layer
being
allowed
to
set but
not
become
hard before the application
of subsequent
layer.
When successive
layers
are applied,
they
should, be of the same mix proportions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.7 With
the
last
mix
of the day, the work is
to
be tapered
OK to a fine edge., This edge is to
be wetted
and
cleaned
with
an
air/water
jet
before being joined
to the next day’s work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.8
Badly deteriorated
areas should
be cut back
to sound
material
and reinforced
with light
mesh
fixed into the sound
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.9 Corners,
re-entrant
surfaces
and
pockets
should
be filled first before guniting
the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2  Mixing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.10
Next layer of guniting
should
be allowed
after
the
first
layer
is set.
From
this layer all
loose materials,
rebound,
etc, should
be removed
by
brooming,
sand
blasting
or water
jetting.
Before t!le next layer is started,
the surface
should
be thorotlghly
sounded
by a hammer
for
hollow
:Irexs
resulting
from
rebound
pockets
or lack of
bond.
Such areas should
be cut out and replaced
with the next layer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1  The
equipment
used
for guniting
should
conform
to IS 6433 : 1972 and should
be capable
of discharging
the sand-cement
mixture
into the
delivery
hose
under
close
control
and it should
deliver a continuous
smooth
stream
of uniformly
mixed
materials
at the
proper
velocity
to the
nozzle.
The discharge
nozzle should
be equipped
with a manually
operated
water injection
system
for
directing
an
even
distribution
of
water
through
the
sand-cement
mixture.
The
water
valve
should
be capable
of ready adjustment
to
vary
the
quantity
of
water
and
should
bc
convenient
to the nozzle
man.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.11 The final coat, generally
3 to G mm
thick.
should
be applied
to the fresh, finished,
screeded,
lightly wetted
surface
of the gunite.
The
final
coat should
be a natrual
nozzle finish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2 The operating
air pressure
at th? gun
outlet
should
not
be less than
0’21N/mm”.
The water
pressure
s’iould
ba maintained
uniform
and bz
sufficient
to ensure
adeqtiate
hydration
at
all
times,
Hydration
is considered
to
be adequate
when
the gunite
exhibits
a silky and glistening
wet surface
as it
is placed.
The water pressure
should
exceed
the
operating
air pressure
at the
nozzle
by at least
0’1 N/mm2
so as to ensure
that
the
water
is intimately
mixed
with
other
materials.
At the nozzle
the
water
pressure
is
generally
not less than 0’4 N/mm’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.12
The finished
gunite
should
be completely
protected
from wind, draught,
rain,
sunlight
and
frost by suitable
means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8  AIR  SUPPLY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Properly
operating
air
compressor
of
ample
capacity
is essential
for
satisfactory
operation.
The compressor
should
be capable
of maintaining
a
supply
of
clean
and
dry
air
adequate
for
maintaining
sufficient
nozzle velocity
for all
parts
of work.
Air hoses should
be capable
of with-
standing
at least twice the operating
pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.3 In case of wet sand, the moisture
content
is
to be accounted
for
while
designing
the gunite
mix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9 WATER
SUPPLY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water is supplied
to the valve fitted to the
nozzle
through
a
light,
flexible,
high
pressure
line.
Wherever
possible,
this line should
be c3onnected
directly
to the
main
supply
provided
that
this
supply
has pressure
of not less than 0’4 N/mm’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3  Guniting
Operation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.1
Before
starting
the guniting
operation,
the
surface
should
be prepared
as described
in 5.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>\
IS  13645 : 1993<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>them for tests.
The thickness
should
be the same
as in the structure
except that it should
normally
be not less than
7’5 cm.
The
panels
are fabri-
cated by gunning
on to a back form
of plywood.
A separate
panel
should
be fabricated
for each
mix
design
being
considered,
and also for each
gunning
position
to
be
encountered
in
the
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10 REBOUND<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials
which rebound
and drop
down,
should
in no case be reused and
should
be immediately
removed
and disposed
OK.
The
guniting
should
be done in such a manner
that
waste
of cement
due to rebound
is minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I1 SUSPENSION
OF WORK<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1.3 Test cores should,
however,
be taken from
the structure
as often as necessary
to ensure
that
the control
tests
reflect
the
quality
of material
in the structure
by correlating
to the results
from
the tests made from panels ( see 14.1.2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>be suspended
in
to
high
winds,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1  Guniting

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2  At
the end
of
each
day’s
work
or
on
stopping
of
work
for
any
other
reason,
the
gunited
surface should
be sloped
to a thin
edge
and the work should
be resumed
after cleaning
the surface
( see 7.3.7 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1.4 The
cores
for
testing
should
have
a
minimum
diameter
of 7’5 cm
and
a length-
diameter
ratio of at least I.
The test
should
be
done according
to IS 5 I6 : 1959.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12 FINISHING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2 Permeability
Test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Natural
gun

is
preferred.
No
further
finishing
should
be carried
out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2.1 When
tested
according
to
the
method
described
in 14.2.2, SO mm thick gunite
specimens
should
show no water percolation
up to 0’7N/mm”
pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13 CURING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
finished
gunite
should
be
cured
by con-
tinuous
and uniform
water sprays
after
a period
of S h from placement
and for a period of 7 days.
The curing
water should
be of the
same
quality
as that of the mixing water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2.2 The
permeability
test
should
be carried
out
on
gunite
specimens
of
100 mm
dia
and
50 mm high
using
the
equipment
and
the
pro-
cedure
specified
in
IS 1727 : 1967,
