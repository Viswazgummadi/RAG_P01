FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian Standard ( Part II ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 21 February
1972, after the draft finalized by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Autoclaved
cellular
concrete
is a class of material,
which has been
developed commercially
abroad
and is in the process of development in
this country also.
A series & Indian
Standards
on cellular
concrete is
being formulated so as to provide guidance in obtaining
reliable products
in autoclaved cellular concrete.
The Sectional Committee has considered
it desirable
to issue a standard for the methods of test for autoclaved
cellular concrete products for the guidance of manufacturers
and users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the tormulation of this standard
due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices
prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For convenience
of reference,
‘Indian
Standard
methods of test for
autoclaved cellular concrete products’ has been grouped into the following
nine parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
( Part II ) covers the method
for determination
of dry-
ing shrinkage
of autoclaved
cellular
concrete
elements,
-measured
as the
length
change
during
drying
of prismatic
specimens
of autoclaved
cellular
concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TEST
SPECIMENS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1
Shape and ?3ize of SpeciFens
-
The
drying
shrinkage
shall be
determined
on
prisms
(  without
reinforcement
)  of 40  x  40  mm cross-
section
and
a length
to suit the length
of the measuring
apparatus,
but
in any case not less than
150 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Location
of Specimens
-From
each
sample
for which
the dr)
shrinkage
is to be determined,
three
test specimens
shall be taken
and
these shall form the test series.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Preparation
of Specimens-
The
specimens
shall
be cut from the
large
sample
piece
of autoclaved
cellular
concrete
by
rotating
carbo-
rundum
blades or similar
device.
All surfaces shall be clean cut and plane.
The largest
surface
shall
not deviate
from
the planeness
by more
than
0.1 mm if measured
diagonally
with a plane
edge.
The length
axis of
the prism specimens
shall be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) perpendicular
to the direction
of rise, if the height
of the sample
from which specimens
are prepared
is less than 24 cm; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) parallel
to the direction
of rise, if the height of the sample
( from
which specimens
are prepared
)  is 24 cm or more.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1ZA
lo-mm
deep hole shall be drilled
centrally
in each end surface
of the p;ism.
The diameter
of the holes shall be large
enough
to permit
the introduction
of spherically
shaped gauge
plugs
which
fit the concave
contact
points
in the measuring
apparatus
( see 3 ).
The
gauge
plugs
shall
be firmly
attached
to the specimens
by means
of cement
mortar,
plaster
of Paris, epoxy resin or other
equally
suitable
materials.

<<HEADING level=3>>3. APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Measuring Instrtiments -
Any suitable
measuring
apparatus
may
be used for measurement
of the length
of the
specimens
provided
the
following
requirements
are met:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Measurements
shall
be performed
with
an
accuracy
of 0.003
percent
of the length
of the specimens,
b) The
instrument
shall
have
sufficient
range
to allow
for small
variations
in gauge length,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Positive
contact
shall be established
with the gauge plugs attached
to the specimens
in order
to ensure
reproducible
measurements
of length,
and
d) Means
shall
be provided
for checking
the measuring
device at
regular
intervals
against
a standard
of reference.-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Gauge Plugs-
Gauge
plugs
shall
be made
of corrosion
resistant
metal
and shall
be shaped
in such a way that positive
contact
is ensured
with the measuring
device
used.
The
projected
part of the fixed gauge
plugs shall be lubricated
before
putting
into
water.
Other
devices such
as plates may be used provided
the conditions
described
in 3.1 are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Immersion
Tank -A
suitable
container
shall
be provided
for
complete
immersion
of the specimens
in water.
shall be held at 27 f
2°C.
The
water
temperature<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  Storage
Room
or Humidity
Chamber -
A suitable
room
or
container
shall
be provided
in which
the specimens
can be dried
at a
temperature
of 27 f 2°C
and
a relative
humidity
corresponding
with
equilibrium
conditions
over a saturated
solution
of potassium
carbonate
in water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.411 If potassium
carbonate
solutions
are used for the establishment
of the relative
humidity
the trays
containing
the saturated
solution
shall
contain
sufficient
solid
salt
so that
a saturated
solution
is maintained.
The solution
shall
be stirred
thoroughly
at least every
seven days in order
to prevent
formation
of lumps or a crust.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Water Saturation of the Specimens -  The ,prismatic
specimens
with gauge plugs at both ends shall
be immersed
in water
( in immersion
tank ) till it attains
constant
weight,
but in any case for not less than 72 h.
Initially,
the prisms will rise to the surface if their bulk
density
is below
1 g/cm’
and absorb
water through
capillary
suction.
After two hours the
specimens
are weighed
down
for complete
immersion
for the remaining
70 h or more,
if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>18:6441(hrtII)-1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Temting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1  The first length measurement
shall be made as soon as possible
but not later than half an hour after removing the samples from the water.
Prior
to placement
of the specimens
in the measuring device surplus
moisture shall be removed from the surface of the prisms, and the gauge
plugs wiped carefully in order to avoid the presence of a moisture film on
theu surface which can lead to faulty readings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2 The measurements
shall be carried out at a temperature
of 27
& 2°C.
The specimens shall always be placed in the measuring unit in
the same position.
After the first reading a second reading shall be taken
with the specimen turned 90” around its length axis.
If the results of
the two measurements
differ the average of the two readings
shall be
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3 Repeated
measurements
of length shall then be taken until the
prisms have obtained constant length.
This is considered to be achieved
when two consecutive
readings carried out a tseven days interval
are
within 0.007 percent of the length of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The drying shrinkage &’ of aerated concrete shall be calculated as the
difference in length between the first reading 11 and the final reading 1s
after constant length has been obtained. s shall be expressed as percentage
of the length L of the specimen:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SJk-+
x  100<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The shrinkage of each prism shall be stated to three decimal places, the
average of the three prisms to two decimal places.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  REPORT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>report shall include the following:
Code designation;
Identification
of product;
Date of manufacture;
Place, method and time of sampling;
Size and age of specimens at start of shrinkage test; and
