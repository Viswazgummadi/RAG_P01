FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
(Part V) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 4 November
1974, after the draft finalized by the Modular
Co-ordination
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Since the basic decision to adopt a IO-cm module has been taken, the
work connected with application of this module for different building com-
ponents, such as bricks, walling materials,
rooling materials
etc has been
done by diierent
committees
and dimensions
have been recommended
by these committees for such components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.1
However, it has been felt that some thought had to be given to the
need for dimensionally
co-ordinating
a particular
product, specially with
respect to the three dimensions -length,
width, height/thickness.
It was
-felt that in some cases such co-ordination
of dimensions May or may not be
necessary, while in other cases it is absolutely imperative.
To identify such
parameters
for individual components, it was felt that building as a whole
should be examined from the point of view of various components that go
into it and then decide on the need for dimensional
co-ordination
on an
individual basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.2
After such a decision has been arrived at, it will then be possible for
the relevant committees to adopt this principle in finally arriving at the nomi-
nal and work sizes for the individual components.
With this end in view the
building has been divided broadly into the following five functional groups  :
a) Functional group 1 -
Structure;
b) Functional
group 2 -
External envelope;
c) Functional group 3 -
Internal subditision;
d) Functional
group 4 -
Services and drainage;
and
e) Functional
group 5 -
Fixtures, furniture and equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 It was indeed very useful for the Modular
Co-ordination
Sectional
Committee
to have the views of various architects,
engineers and users in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>XS t 7564  (Part V) - 1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>arriving at a basic decision regarding the need for dimensionally co-ordina-
=ting some of these products so that the relevant committees could exercise
their mind on such items only.
Based on these decisions, it may be possible
to review the existing Indian Standards on different subjects where dimen-
sions have already been given and arrive at new dimensions where necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1
It  may  be noted that the words ‘co-ordination of dimensions’ instead
of ‘modular co-ordination’ have been used in the title of the standard with a
view to encouraging
the concept of establishing the correlation of two or
more products when juxtaposed together to perform a function.
If such a
function is not necessary or there is no function to be done, then it appears
there may not be a need for co-ordinating dimension in the products placed
together.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and -practices prevailing
~
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country.
This has been met by deriving assistance from the following  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

for the co-ordination
of

<<HEADING level=3>>0.5 This standard is one of a series of Indian
Standards
on modular
co-ordination.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard (Part V) lays down recommendations
for coordinating
dimensions of building components for functional group 5 -
fixtures, fur-
niture and equipment which comprises of the following functional activities  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Domestic living, commercial
and community
servicing,
teaching,
learning and research, production, farming, manufacture, distribution -
retailing and communication.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard the following definitions shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Element

functional part of a building cons-
tructed from buihling materials and/or building components.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Services -
The group of installations
each of which supplies one or
more  services to a building.

having specified sizes in three dimensions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Building
Section -
Building
material

to a definite
cross-
section but of unspecified length.
Sections are usually manufactured
by
a continuous process, such as rolling,
drawing,
extruding
or machining.
Examples are angles, bars, tubes, battens, sheet, plate, wire and cable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.9 Co-ordinating
Plane -A
plane by reference

component or assembly is co-ordinated
with another.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7 Chordinating
Space -
A space bounded
by co-ordinating
planes

to a component,
including
allowances
for tolerances
and joint
clearances.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8 Co-ordinating
Dimensions -
A dimension
of co-ordinating
space,
which defines the relative positions of two or more components in an assem-
bly, according to the characteristics
of the components which are relevant to
assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.9  Basic Size -
The size by reference to which the limits of size are fixed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. GRADING
OF COMPONENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Depending upon the relative importance,
the components shall be given
a grading A, B, or C as follows  :
Grading A -
Components
or assemblies
for which dimensional
CO-
ordination is essential.
Grading B -
Components or assemblies which in some situations need
to be dimensionally co-ordinated.
Grading C -
Components
or assemblies which do not require to be
dimensionally
co-ordinated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
