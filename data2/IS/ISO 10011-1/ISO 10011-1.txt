<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work
of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for
which a technical committee has been established has the right to be
represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO
collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are
circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International
Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting
a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standard ISO 10011-1 was prepared by Technical Committee
ISO/TC 176, Quality management and quality assurance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 10011 consists of the following parts, under the general title Guide-
lines for auditing quality systems:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ISO 9000 series emphasizes the importance of quality audit as a key
management tool for achieving the objectives set out in an organization's
policy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Audits should be carried out in order to determine that the various el-
ements within a quality system are effective and suitable for achieving the
stated quality objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 10011 provides guidelines for performing an audit of a
quality system of an organization. It allows users to adjust the guidelines
described to suit their needs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality system audit also provides objective evidence concerning the
need for the reduction, elimination and, especially, prevention of noncon-
formities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The results of these audits can be used by management to improve the
performance of the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Guidelines for auditing quality systems —<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>Part 1:
Auditing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
quality audit:  A systematic and independent
examination to determine whether quality activities
and related results comply with planned arrange-
ments and whether these arrangements are im-
plemented effectively and are suitable to achieve
objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 10011 establishes basic audit princi-
ples, criteria and practices, and provides guidelines for
establishing, planning, carrying out and documenting
audits of quality systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>[ ISO 8402 ]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It provides guidelines for verifying the existence and
implementation of elements of a quality system and
for verifying the system's ability to achieve defined
quality objectives. It is sufficiently general in nature to
permit it to be applicable or adaptable to different
kinds of industries and organizations. Each organiz-
ation should develop its own specific procedures for
implementing these guidelines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2
The quality audit typically applies to, but is not limited to,
a quality system or elements thereof, to processes, to pro-
ducts, or to services. Such audits are often called “quality
system audit”, “process quality audit”, “product quality au-
dit”, “service quality audit”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3
Quality audits are carried out by staff not having direct
responsibility in the areas being audited but, preferably,
working in cooperation with the relevant personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 Normative reference<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following standard contains provisions which,
through reference in this text, constitute provisions
of this part of ISO 10011. At the time of publication,
the edition indicated was valid. All standards are sub-
ject to revision, and parties to agreements based on
this part of ISO 10011 are encouraged to investigate
the possibility of applying the most recent edition of
the standard indicated below. Members of IEC and
ISO maintain registers of currently valid International
Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4
One purpose of the quality audit is to evaluate the need
for improvement or corrective action. An audit should not
be confused with “surveillance” or “inspection” activities
performed for the sole purpose of process control or prod-
uct acceptance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5
Quality audits can be conducted for internal or external
purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2
quality system:  The organizational structure,
responsibilities, procedures, processes and resources
for implementing quality management.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3 Definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this part of ISO 10011, the defi-
nitions given in ISO 8402, together with the following
definitions, apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6
The quality system should only be as comprehensive as
is needed to meet the quality objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7
For contractual, mandatory and assessment purposes,
demonstration of the implementation of identified elements
in the system may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

auditor (quality):  A person who has the quali-
fication to perform quality audits.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— to determine the effectiveness of the im-
plemented quality system in meeting specified
quality objectives;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— to provide the auditee with an opportunity to im-
prove the quality system;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8
To perform a quality audit, the auditor must be auth-
orized for that particular audit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— to meet regulatory requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9
An auditor designated to manage a quality audit is called
a “lead auditor”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— to permit the listing of the audited organization's
quality system in a register.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4
client:  A person or organization requesting the
audit.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Audits are generally initiated for one or more of the
following reasons:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 10
The client may be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— to initially evaluate a supplier where there is a de-
sire to establish a contractual relationship;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the auditee wishing to have its own quality system
audited against some quality system standard;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— to verify that an organization's own quality system
continues to meet specified requirements and is
being implemented;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
a customer wishing to audit the quality system
of a
supplier using his own auditors or a third party;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)

whether the quality system provides adequate control
of the products or services being provided (such as
food, drug, nuclear, or other regulatory bodies);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— within the framework of a contractual relationship,
to verify that the supplier's quality system contin-
ues to meet specified requirements and is being
implemented;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

against a quality system standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5
auditee:  An organization to be audited.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These audits may be routine, or may be prompted by
significant changes in the organization's quality sys-
tem, process, product or service quality, or by a need
to follow up on corrective action.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6
observation:  A statement of fact made during
an audit and substantiated by objective evidence.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7

to the quality of an item or service or to the existence
and implementation of a quality system element,
which is based on observation, measurement or test
and which can be verified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12
Quality audits should not result in a transfer of the re-
sponsibility to achieve quality from operating staff to the
auditing organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13
Quality audits should not lead to an increase in the
scope of quality functions over and above those necessary
to meet quality objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.8
nonconformity:  The nonfulfilment of specified
requirements.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>— determines the general scope of the audit, such
as what quality system standard or document it is
to be conducted against;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The need to perform an audit is determined by the
client, taking account of specified or regulatory re-
quirements and any other pertinent factors. Signif-
icant changes in management, organization, policy,
techniques or technologies that could affect the qual-
ity system, or changes to the system itself and the
results of recent previous audits, are typical of the
circumstances to be considered when deciding audit
frequency. Within an organization, internal audits may
be organized on a regular basis for management or
business purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

company members of the audit team;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a basis for planning the audit, the auditor should
review for adequacy the auditee's recorded de-
scription of the methods for meeting the quality sys-
tem requirements (such as the quality manual or
equivalent).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— provide all resources needed for the audit team in
order to ensure an effective and efficient audit
process;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— provide access to the facilities and evidential ma-
terial as requested by the auditors;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If this review reveals that the system described by the
auditee is not adequate to meet the requirements,
further resources should not be expended on the au-
dit until such concerns are resolved to the satisfaction
of the client, the auditor and, where applicable, the
auditee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Audit team assignments<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2.1 Collecting evidence<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each auditor should be assigned specific quality sys-
tem elements or functional departments to audit.
Such assignments should be made by the lead auditor
in consultation with the auditors concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Evidence should be collected through interviews, ex-
amination of documents, and observation of activities
and conditions in the areas of concern. Clues sug-
gesting nonconformities should be noted if they seem
significant, even though not covered by check-lists,
and should be investigated. Information gathered
through interviews should be tested by acquiring the
same information from other independent sources,
such as physical observation, measurements and
records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3 Working documents<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The documents required to facilitate the auditor's in-
vestigations, and to document and report results, may
include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the audit, the lead auditor may make changes
to the auditors' work assignments, and to the audit
plan with the client's approval and the auditee's
agreement, if this is necessary to ensure the optimal
achievement of the audit objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— check-lists used for evaluating quality system el-
ements (normally prepared by the auditor assigned
to audit that specific element);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the audit objectives appear to become unattainable,
the lead auditor should report the reasons to the client
and the auditee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— forms for reporting audit observations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— forms for documenting supporting evidence for
conclusions reached by the auditors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2.2 Audit observations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All audit observations should be documented. After
all activities have been audited, the audit team should
review all of their observations to determine which
are to be reported as nonconformities. The audit team
should then ensure that these are documented in a
clear, concise manner and are supported by evidence.
Nonconformities should be identified in terms of the
specific requirements of the standard or other related
documents against which the audit has been con-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Working documents should be designed so that they
do not restrict additional audit activities or investi-
gations which may become necessary as a result of
information gathered during the audit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

prietary information shall be suitably safeguarded by
the auditing organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
