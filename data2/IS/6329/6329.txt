<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
(First Revision)
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Fire Safety
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The premises
wherever
wood is sawn, cut, machined,
ground or otherwise
treated are associated
with considerable
fire hazards.
This is not so much on account
of processes,
but because of the combustible
nature of wood and its
wastes.
In certain types of factories
where wood is pulverized
or powdered
or flammable
liquids
are used either
for painting
or polishing
purposes
or for preservative
treatment,
the possibility
of explosion
also exists.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As fires occurring
in this type of factories
more often than not tend to be severe,
locating
the factory
where
ample water supply
for the fire fighting
purposes
is obtainable
is a great necessity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Committee
felt that the risk of fire in organized
well-engineered
industries
like plywood,
hardboard
and
chipboard
is comparatively
less than in saw mills and wood wofks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency
of outbreaks
of fire in this class of risk may be reduced
by observing
proper
care in respect
of
installation
and maintenance
of electrical
machinery,
housekeeping
and use of apparatus
and processes
involving
open flame and by providing
an adequate dust and chip extraction
system for wood working
machines.
In view
of the combustible
nature
of the contents,
provision
of elaborate
fire protection
system,
namely,
sprinkler
and
hydrant
system
is a great necessity
speciaIly
in case of large premises.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Code of practice
represents
a standard
of good practice
and, therefore,
takes the form of recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this code due weightage
has been given to international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in add]tion
to relating
it to the practices
in the
field
in this
country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
1S 2:
1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (revised)’.
The number
of significant
places
retained
in
the rounded
off value should be the same as that-of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
