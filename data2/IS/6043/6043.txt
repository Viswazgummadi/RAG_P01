<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.1 Preparation of Test Specimens  -The test specimen shall be
cylinders 12 mm in height and 6 mm in diameter.
The ends of the speci-
men should be flat, smooth, parallel to each other and at right angles to
the long axis of the cylinder.
An apparatus found convenient for forming
these test cylinders is shown in Fig. 3.
Place a cylindrical mould ( made
of hard rubber, glass, stainless steel or any other substance which will not
react with cement<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>),  12 mm high and 6 mm in diameter on a flat glass plate
and slightly overfill with cement of standard consistency within three
minutes after commencing the mixing. Press on top of the mould a second
flat glass plate.
small G-clamp.
Hold the mould and the plates firmly together with a
All apparatus should be at room temperature. The
moulds may be coated with a 3 percent solution of a microcrystalline wax
( melting point 91 to 86°C ) in benzene.
Three minutes after starting the
mix, transfer the mould and clamp to an atmosphere of 100 percent
relative humidity at 37°C.
Thirty minutes later, remove the specimens
from the, conditioned atmosphere and immerse them in distilled water at
room temperature.
Surface the ends of the cylinder plane at right angles
to the axis, by drawing the moulds containing the specimens back and
forth across a glass plate coated with an abrasive such as 75 micron silicon
carbide powder and water.
Rotate them about one-fourth turn every few
strokes. Keep the test specimens wet during the grinding. After surfacing,
remove the specimens from the mould by a screw jack ( see Fig. 3 ) and
immerse in distilled water till taken up for test.
Test after 7 days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-4.2  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  Insert the specimen, prepared according to A-4.1,

If the values for individual specimens
fall more than 15 percent below the average of the five, discard them and
report the average of the remaining specimens.
If more than two of the
specimens are discarded, repeat the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

bottle, less the weight of weighing bottle and the platinum wire, as the
weight of the specimens of cement.
Immediately submerge the specimens
by pouring 50 ml of distilled water into the weighing bottle which shall be
stored for 7 days at 37°C.
Then remove the specimens from the water.
There shall be no evidence of crystal growth on the surface of the speci-
mens. Evaporate the water from the weighing bottle at a temperature

<<HEADING level=3>>A-7. DETERMINATION OF ARSENIC<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  A suitable apparatus is shown in Fig. 5. The
generator consists of a 50 ml capacity wide-mouth bottle C which is fitted
with a perforated rubber bung.
Through the perforation is inserted a
vertical exit tube about 12 cm in overall length, about 1 cm in diameter
on its upper portion and constricted at its lower extremity to a tube about
4 cm in length and about 5 mm in diameter.
The small portion of the
tube shall extend to just slightly below the bung. This tube shall be packed
with glass wool as shown at  B.
Into the upper end of this tube shall be
placed a second glass tube 12 cm in length with an internal diameter of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>24-hour   old, that has been stored in a dry
air-tight container, to pass a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>75-micron   sieve. Digest the powdered sample
in 50 ml of distilled water on a steam-bath for one hour.
Use the filtrate
in the test for arsenic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  Transfer the filtrate, prepared in A-7.3, to the wide
mouth bottle ( Fig. 5<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-7.4  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>).
For the comparison standard place in a bottle of
a second generator ( Fig. 5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>)  48 ml of water and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2-O  ml of standard arsenic
solution.
Add to each bottle 5 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5  ml
of potassium iodide solution and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O-20   ml of stannous chloride solution.

<<HEADING level=3>>f<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.O”C.
During this 20-minute period moisten the glass wool in lower
tube<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B  with 10 percent lead acetate’ solution ( Note), and carefully centre
a dry mercuric bromide paper strip in the top tube A.
Crimp the upper
end of the paper strip so that<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10  cm will be in position in the tube. At the
end of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>20-minute   period add 5 g of granulated zinc to the solution in
each generator bottle, and put tubes  A  and  B  in place as shown in Fig. 5.
Return both generators to the water-bath for one and one-half hours
before comparing the stains.
Remove the strips and average the length of
the stains on both sides of the strip.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N OTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  The character of the stain is affected by the amount of lead acetate solution
used to moisten the glass wool.
If the wool is too wet, the stain, which appears on the
mercuric bromide paper soon after the zinc is added, will be partly washed out at the
end of the one and one-half hours.
For this reason, all tubes in a set of generators shall
be charged with equal amounts of lead acetate, and any excess shall be drawn off by
suction.

sampled, the sampling instrument and the containers for samples from
adventitious contamination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.4 To draw a representative sample, the contents of each container
selected for sampling shall be mixed as thoroughly as possible by suitable
means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.5 The samples shall be placed in clean, dry, air-tight glass or other
suitable containers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

drawn from a single batch of manufacture shall constitute a lot. If a
consignment is declared or known to consist of different batches of manu-
facture, the containers belonging to the same batch shall be grouped
