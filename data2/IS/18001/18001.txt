<<PARAGRAPH>>Industrial Safety Sectional Committee CHD 8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Industrial Safety Sectional Committee had been approved by the Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Health and safety is one of the most important aspects of an organization’s smooth and effective
functioning. Good health and safety performance ensures an accident free industrial environment.
With the continuous and untiring effort of various legislative authorities as well as NGOs, the
awareness of Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) has improved in the India considerably.
Organizations have started attaching the same importance to achieve high OH&S performance as
they do to other key aspects of their business activities. This demands adoption of a structured
approach for the identification of hazards, their evaluation and control of risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considering this fact and a great demand from the industry for a comprehensive framework for
OH&S, the Committee decided to formulate an Indian Standard on OH&S management systems.
This standard intends to assist the organizations to develop a systematic approach to management
of OH&S in such a way as to protect their employees and others whose health and safety may be
affected by the organizations’ activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard also intends to improve OH&S performance of an organizations by providing the
requirements and guidance for use. The OH&S management systems may be integrated with the
management of other aspects of business performance in order to:
a) minimize risk to employees and others;
b) improve business performance; and
c) assist organizations to establish a responsible image at the market place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no ISO standard on the subject.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In preparation of this standard considerable assistance has been derived from the following
publications:
a) BS 8800 : 1996 Guide to OH&S management systems; and
b) AS/NZS 4804:1997 OH&S management systems — General guidance and principles,
assessment and supporting techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While British and Australian/New Zealand documents are mainly guidelines, this standard
intends to specify the requirements of OH&S management systems for certification purpose. Due
consideration has been given in preparation of this standard for its use by certification bodies also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements of OH&S management systems have been prescribed in this standard. Annex A
of this standard provides the guidance for use and correct interpretation and Annex B gives a
comparison of requirements of this standard with those of ISO 9001 : 2000 and ISO 14001 : 1996.
It is expected that this comparative chart will help the users in understanding the standard in a
better way. Identification of hazard and assessment and control of risks form a major and
important part of OH&S management systems. A general guideline describing the principles,
approach and procedure of hazard identification and assessment and control of risks has been
given in Annex C of this standard. The Committee intends to formulate a detailed standard on
Code of practice for identification of hazard and assessment and control of risks in future to
provide more details on this important subject.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Compliance with this standard by an organization does not confer its immunity from its legal
obligations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Technical Committee responsible for formulating this standard is given in
Annex D.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (November 2002). Side bar indicates modification
of the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should
incorporate
hazard
identification, risk assessment and risk control
procedures. Appropriately competent people
shall be allocated clear responsibilities to meet
and verify health and safety requirements.
Where the newly evaluated hazard cannot be
eliminated or substituted for one that presents
lower risks, engineering controls shall be
adopted.
When
the

<<HEADING level=3>>ANNEX A
(  Foreword , and  Clause  1 )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>GUIDANCE FOR USE OF THE SPECIFICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Keeping this in mind, the management system
is best viewed as an organizing framework that
should
be
continually
monitored
and
periodically reviewed, to provide effective
direction for an organization’s OH&S activities
in response to changing internal and external
factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex gives additional information on the
requirements
and
is
intended
to
avoid
misinterpretation of the specification. This
Annex only addresses the OH&S management
system requirements contained in  4 .
The introduction of Occupational Health and
Safety (OH&S) management into the existing
overall
management
system
should
be
considered within a general management
system model that incorporates the following
principles (  see  Fig. 1 ).
Principle 1 Commitment and Policy  — An
organization should define its OH&S policy and
ensure commitment to its OH&S management
systems.
Principle 2 Planning  — An organization
should plan to fulfill its OH&S policy,
objectives and targets.
Principle 3
Implementation
and
Operation  — For effective implementation, an
organization should develop the capabilities
and support mechanism necessary to achieve
its OH&S policy, objectives and targets.
Principle 4 Measurement and Evaluation
— An organization should measure, monitor
and evaluate its OH&S performance and take
preventive and corrective action.
Principle 5 Management Review  — An
organization should regularly review and
continually improve its OH&S management
system, with the objective of improving its
OH&S performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As
organizations
grow
in
experience,
procedures, programmes and technologies can
be put in place to further improve OH&S
performance. As OH&S management system
matures, OH&S considerations should be
integrated into all its business decisions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2 COMMITMENT AND POLICY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.1 Leadership and Commitment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Everyone should be aware of the influence that
their actions and inaction can have, on the
effectiveness of the system. They can also
participate
in
the
establishment
and
maintenance of the OH&S controls, as well as
assisting in the planning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Successful change can be accomplished by
effective leadership in the areas of:
a) determining the organization’s current
position on OH&S;
b) resource
allocation
including
setting
budgets, responsibilities, authority and
accountability;
c) coordinated management planning and
agreed delegations; and
d) decisions
followed
through
and
performance assessed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Regular review of OH&S at senior management
level
reinforces
its
importance
to
the
organization’s
success
in
meeting
its
commercial and legal obligations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.2 Initial OH&S Review<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Every organization will find that it has some
elements of an OH&S management system in
place. What is less common is the linking of
these elements into a coordinated overall
system for improvement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A useful starting point is to critically compare
the basic intent of each element in this
standard with management practices and
procedures, which are currently being used in
the organization. Many organizations have
obsolete procedures and need to compare the
requirements of this standard with what
actually occurs in order to obtain a realistic
assessment of the implementation task.

disputes and the like may provide indirect
pointers
to
areas
of

OH&S
management.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2.1  Core elements which could be initially
focussed on:
a) clear
management
responsibility
for
OH&S;
b) identification
of
all
applicable
legal
requirements and their compliance;
c) hazard identification and risk assessment,
and what is being done about them;
d) documentation of critical procedures;
e) OH&S inspections of critical procedures
and plant; and
f) training.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.3 OH&S Policy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization’s OH&S policy is a public
statement signed by top management declaring
its commitment and intent to manage its
OH&S responsibilities. In publishing the policy
the organization is sending a clear message
that it has a vision for OH&S management
within the whole organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other
elements
can
be
progressively
implemented in accordance with organizational
needs and priorities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
policy
should
be
relevant
to
the
organization’s overall vision and objectives. It
should be dynamic and set the framework for
continual improvement, especially in decision
making. It should set out a programme of
action for the whole organization, ensuring
accountability and linking OH&S to the overall
organizational values objectives and processes.
The policy is implemented through planning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2.2  Some common techniques for initial
review include:
a) questionnaires;
b) interviews with employees;
c) checklists;
d) direct inspection and measurement;
e) assessments (internal and external);
f) review of records; and
g) comparison with similar organizations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This policy is intended to clearly tell employees,
suppliers, customers and interested parties
that OH&S is an integral part of all operations.
Management being actively involved in the
review and continual improvement of OH&S
performance
further
reinforces
this
commitment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2.3  External sources which may be able to
help include:
a) government agencies in relation to laws
and permits;
b) local or regional libraries or databases;
c) other
organizations
for
exchange
of
information;
d) industry associations;
e) larger customer organizations;
f) suppliers of equipment; and
g) professional help.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.3.1  The following questions can aid in
establishing or rewriting an organization’s
OH&S policy:
a)
Integration and relevance : Is the policy
integral
and
relevant
to
the
organization’s:
i) mission
statement,
vision,
core
values and beliefs;
ii) overall management system; and
iii) activities, products and services.
b)
Accountability : Does the OH&S policy
address accountability in terms of:
i) capacity to assign/delegate, deliver,
and
review
the
policy’s
commitments;
ii) inclusion of OH&S accountability in
all duty statements (reflecting the
degree of legal responsibility);
iii) setting of objectives and targets to
minimize incidents, injury, illness
and incidents; and
iv) allocation of adequate resources to
fulfill the aims of the policy.
c)
Consultation : Does the policy enable
consultation with:
i) employees;
ii) line managers;
iii) subcontractors;
iv) suppliers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2.4  Many organizations do not have a
complete
understanding
of
their
legal
responsibilities in relation to the many OH&S
statutes, regulations, standards, codes of
practice and guidance documents, which cover
their area of operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2.5  Useful sources of information include:
a) disease, incident and first aid records kept
by the organization or by industry
associations, governments and the like;
b) workers
compensation
experience.
Insurance companies are often able to
provide feedback on an organization’s
claims experience and the breakdown of
the components of the insurance premium
and
how
these
compare
within
an
industry group; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_12>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 18001 : 2000<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>programme. People are more likely to embrace
change if it is not imposed upon them.
At all levels of the organizations, people should
be:
a) Responsible for the health and safety of
those they manage, themselves and others
with whom they work;
b) Aware of the responsibility for the health
and safety of people who may be affected
by the activities they control, for example
subcontractors and public; and
c) Aware of the influence that their action or
inaction can have on the effectiveness of
the OH&S management systems.
A-3.1.2  Senior
management
should
demonstrate, their commitment being actively
involved in the continual improvement of
OH&S performance.
While ultimate responsibility for OH&S rests
with the employer, the following also need to be
ensured:
a) A person at the senior management level
should
be
assigned
particular
responsibility for ensuring that the OH&S
management system is implemented and
performs to expectations, in all locations
within the organizations;
b) To
recognize
that
knowledge
and
experience throughout the workforce is a
valuable resource and it should act to
encourage and delegate responsibilities
and authorities for the development and
implementation
of
the
OH&S
management system for all key functional
areas; and
c) A defined system of implementing and
communicating
any
change
of
responsibility and authority.
A-3.2 Identification of Hazard and
Assessment and Control of Risk<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>v) clients; and
vi) independent experts.
d)  Prevention : Has the policy adopted a
preventive approach (  see   4.5.3  ) ?
e)
Compliance : Does the policy include a
statement of commitment to compliance
or due diligence to be taken with :
i) relevant OH&S legislation;
ii) associated regulations; and
iii) other criteria that may not always
have legal compliance but have
evidentiary status.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3 PLANNING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
initial
review
(  see
4.2.2  )
of
the
organization’s position provides a planning
framework for the implementation of the
OH&S management system. While during
initial review all the hazards and risks are
identified, in the process of planning the
significant hazards and risks are recognized.
Objectives, targets and performance indicators
are established and plans are also made to
achieve them.
Planning needs to address schedules, resources
and
responsibilities
for
achieving
the
organization’s OH&S objectives and targets.
Such planning (and resulted plans) can cover a
number of areas. For example:
a) Plans to manage and control the initial
implementation of an OH&S management
system;
b) Specific
OH&S
plans
required
for
managing OH&S risks;
c) Contingency plans required as part of the
organization’s emergency preparedness to
meet foreseeable emergencies as well as
plans to mitigate their effects (that is
critical incident recovery, first aid and
clean up);
d) Plans required to meet objectives and
targets
in
measuring
performance,
undertaking audits and reviewing the
system; and
e) Response plans for dealing with corrective
action identified as part of the incident
investigation process or following the
identification of non-conformances.
The level and complexity of planning should
commensurate with the size, complexity and
nature of the organization and the risks it has
to manage. In smaller organizations many of
these types of plans may be combined.
A-3.1 Accountability and Responsibility<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hazard identification and risk assessment and
control should be taken into account when
plans are formulated to meet an organization’s
OH&S policy. All identified hazards are
assessed to determine the level of risk, which is
a measurement of the probability and possible
consequence of injury and illness resulting from
exposure to hazard. The final step involves risk
control where risk is treated to reduce its level.
A-3.2.1   Hazard Identification
Tools used to assist in the identification of
hazards include:
a)  Consultation  — People who may have
experience in aspects of the job that they
like least and may lead to hazardous
activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3.1.1  Improving health and safety is most
effective when people from all levels of the
organization are encouraged to participate in
the development and implementation of the<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_13>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 18001 : 2000<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>lead to different consequences depending on the
sequence of exposure events. Hence any risk
level needs to be assessed separately for each
chosen sequence of events.
To combine the following three components of
any risk in assessing its level :
a) Choose a specific consequence or outcome
severity for one possible sequence of
events
involving
the
hazard
under
consideration. Other possible sequences
with different possible consequences need
to be assessed separately. The number of
persons harmed and the nature of their
injuries/illness affects the estimation of
the consequence or outcome severity;
b) Determine the exposure for the chosen
sequence, that is how often (frequency);
how long duration of the affected persons
exposed to the particular hazard; and
c) Estimate the probability, likelihood or
chance that the chosen scenario will lead
to
the
specific
consequences
being
considered.
Every
scenario
that
is
considered for any particular hazard has
its own specific risk level. The integrity
and effectiveness of any existing risk
control measures will need to be included
in estimating probability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

solution and should be attempted in the first
instance. The hazard is either eliminated

a hazardous process or substance or the
substitution of a toxic substance with a less
toxic substance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE—For the purpose of identification of hazard and
assessment and control of risks a guideline has been
given in Annex C of this standard.
A-3.3 Legal and Other Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In maintaining regulatory compliance, an
organization should identify and understand
regulatory requirements applicable to its
activities, products or services. Regulations
cover several aspects such as:
a) those specific to the activity (for example
confined spaces regulations);
b) those
specific
to
the
organization’s
products or services;
c) those
specific
to
the
organization’s
industry;
d) general OH&S laws; and
e) authorizations, licenses and permits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.2.2   Risk Assessment and Control
In order to carry out risk assessment, the level
of risk is determined first.
Establishing the level of a risk requires clear
specification of the actual components of the
risk being considered, for example the specific
scenario of sequence of events including the
nature of consequences to be considered, the
exposure to the chosen hazard, finally the
probability or likelihood of that scenario taking
place. (In doing so the existing controls are
determined when exposure is assessed).
Any scenario involving particular hazard can<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>i) all levels of government;
ii) industry associations or groups;
iii) commercial databases; and
iv) professional services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To
facilitate
keeping
track
of
legal
requirements, an organization can establish
and maintain a list of all laws and regulations
pertaining to its activities, products or services
and the same should be updated on a regular
basis.
A-3.4 Objectives, Targets and Performance
Indicators<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When considering their technological options,
an organization may consider the use of the
best available technology where economically
viable, cost effective and judged appropriate.
A-3.5 Initial and On-going Programme<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The creation and use of one or more
programmes is a key element to the successful
implementation of an OH&S management
system. The programme should describe how
the organization’s objectives and targets will be
achieved, including time, skill and personnel
responsible for implementing the organization’s
OH&S
policy.
This
programme
may
be
subdivided to address specific elements of the
organization’s
operations.
The
programme
should include an OH&S review for new
activities.
The
programme
may
include,
where
appropriate and practical, consideration of
planning, design, production, marketing and
disposal stages. This may be undertaken for
both current and new activities, product or
services. For products this may address design,
materials,
production
processes,
use
and
ultimate disposal. For new installation or
significant modification of processes this may
address
planning,
design,
construction,
commissioning
operation
and
at
the
appropriate
time
as
determined
by
the
organization, de-commissioning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Objectives state what is intended to be
accomplished and targets define a performance
level timeframe.
Objectives should be aimed at broad level
improvements in the OH&S performance and
the targets should be qualified wherever
practicable in the following terms:
a)  Attributes—  things which are major
(handling
injuries
and
adequately
guarded machine);
b)  Scale — against which the attributes can
be measured;
c)  Goal — describing what is to be achieved;
and
d)  Time scale — in which it is to be achieved.
Performance indicators are the means by which
it is measured whether expected outcomes meet
objectives. There are measures such as rates,
ratios or indices which reflect how well the
OH&S management system or its elements are
performing.
Combining targets and performance indicators
produces
objectives
that
are
specific,
measurable,
achievable,
realistic
and
time-bound.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>harm or injury in their work environment
including
physical,
chemical,
ergonomic,
radiation, biological and psychological hazards.
They should have an understanding of these
hazards
as
they
relate
to
their
work
environment and be able to recognize and take
action to prevent work practices or activities
likely to leave to incidents.
A-4.1.2.2  OH&S competency standards should
be developed by:
a) using
existing
industry
competency
standard;
b) examining job or position descriptions;
c) analysing work tasks;
d) inspection
and
audits
of
hazards
identification and risk analysis; and
e) reviewing incident reports.
The organization should develop training
programme after the assessment of current
capability against the required competency
profile. An organization should also establish
and maintain documented procedures for
evaluation of training provided to its workers
and its effectiveness.
A-4.1.2.3  Generally
a
health
and
safety
training programme should cover but are not
limited to the following aspects:
a) Health
and
safety
policy
of
the
organization;
b) Way in which health and safety is
organized in the workplace;
c) Health and safety procedures in the
organization;
d) Specific hazards and risk controls;
e) OH&S legislation; and
f) Emergency procedures.
A-4.1.2.4  A training programme may need to
address a number of target groups including:
a) senior management;
b) line managers/supervisors;
c) employees;
d) those with specific responsibilities (first
aid, fire, elected health and safety
representatives);
e) subcontractors;
f) operators who require certificates under
legislation; and
g) site visitors.
A-4.1.2.5  Training records should normally
include:
a) information about those who have been
trained;
b) what the training course covered;
c) when the training took place;
d) who provided the training; and
e) feed back from trainees.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) make effective arrangements for the
provisions
of
specialist
advice
and
services;
e) make
effective
arrangements
for
handicapped, aged, visitors and Forcight
employees and/or special category of
employees; and
f) make effective arrangements for employee
concentration and active involvement.
A-4.1.1.2  The resource base, structure, and size
of organizations may impose constraints on
implementation. In order to overcome these
constraints
external
health
and
safety
resources may need to be utilized. Such
resources might include:
a) shared technology and experience from
larger client organization;
b) cooperative
approaches
to
develop
industry specific guidance material and
strategies;
c) support from industry and employer
associations or principal subcontractors
and owners;
d) assistance from government health and
safety organizations;
e) the use of consultants and the collective
engagement of consultants;
f) provision of advice and training from
suppliers;
g) assistance
provided
by
workers’
compensation insurance agents;
h) attendance at health and safety seminars;
and
j) manually
beneficial
support
from
universities and other research centers.
Organizations
should
focus
on
utilizing
cooperative
strategies
to
implement
and
maintain an effective OH&S management
system.
A-4.1.2   Training ,  Awareness and Competence
The effective implementation and maintenance
of an OH&S management system is dependent
on the competencies and training of an
organization’s people.
A-4.1.2.1  The
top
management
of
an
organization
should
demonstrate
its
commitment to OH&S through consultation
with and where appropriate, its employees and
other relevant individual(s) or groups in the
development,
implementation,
and
maintenance
of
its
OH&S
management
systems. The objectives and targets should be
understood and supported by the organization’s
employees and they should be encouraged to
accept the importance of their achievements
both in terms of the organization’s OH&S
performance
and
the
benefits,
to
the
environment in which they work. Employees
should be made aware of exposure to possible<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_16>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 18001 : 2000<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.1.2.6  OH&S training is typically provided
at certain key times in an operational cycle
including:
a) at induction for new employees;
b) when employees are transferred to new
jobs;
c) on
movement
into
managerial
or
supervisory positions;
d) on engagement of subcontractors;
e) when modification in the system is carried
out; and
f) after a time gap as a refresh.
A-4.2 Support Action<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Effective reporting should cover the positive
steps the organization is taking to identify
hazards and control risks and can include
reports:
a) of levels of conformance with procedures;
b) on performance against targets;
c) on improvements made;
d) on
underlying
reasons
for
incident
occurrences;
e) on results of safety inspections and audits;
f) on health monitoring; and
g) of work places monitoring.
A-4.2.3   Documentation
Documentation is an important element in
enabling an organization to implement a
successful OH&S management system. It is
also important in assembling and retaining
OH&S knowledge, but it is important that
documentation is kept to
the
minimum
required for effectiveness and efficiency.
A-4.2.3.1  Organizations should ensure that
sufficient documentation is available to enable
OH&S plans to be fully implemented and is
proportional to their needs.
A-4.2.3.2  Operational processes and procedures
should
be
defined
and
appropriately
documented and updated as necessary. The
organization should clearly define the various
types of documents, which establish and specify
effective operational procedures and control.
A-4.2.3.3  The existence of OH&S management
systems documentation supports employee
awareness of what is required to achieve the
organization’s OH&S objectives and enables
the evaluation of the system and OH&S
performance.
A-4.2.3.4  The degree and quality of the
documentation will vary depending on the size
and complexity of the organization. Where
elements of the OH&S management systems
are integrated with an organization’s overall
management system the OH&S documentation
should
be
integrated
into
existing
documentation.
The
organizations
should
consider
organizing
and
maintaining
a
summary of the documentation to:
a) collate the OH&S policy, objectives and
targets;
b) describe the means of achieving OH&S
objectives and targets;
c) document the key roles, responsibilities
and procedures;
d) provide
direction
to
related
documentation
and
describe
other
elements
of
the
organization’s
management system, where appropriate;
and
e) demonstrate that the OH&S management<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.2.1   Communication
Organizations should implement a procedure
for receiving documenting and responding to
relevant
information
and
requests
from
interested parties. The procedure may include
a
dialogue
with
interested
parties
and
consideration of their relevant concern. In some
circumstances, response to interested parties’
concerns may include relevant information
about the hazards and risks associated with the
organization’s operations. These procedures
should also address necessary communication
with public authorities regarding emergency
planning
and
other
relevant
issues.
Organizations should also have a system to
communicate
relevant
OH&S
information
including objectives and targets and any
change in delegation of responsibility to its own
employees.
A-4.2.1.1  Commonly used methods of internal
communication include:
a) bulletins;
b) news letters;
c) notice boards;
d) signage;
e) videos;
f) minutes/action notes of the meetings;
g) team briefings; and
h) hard copy or electronic mail.
A-4.2.1.2  Commonly used methods of external
communication includes:
a) annual reports;
b) publications;
c) inserts in industry publications;
d) paid advertising;
e) telephone inquiry services;
f) submissions to government; and
g) websites.
A-4.2.2   Reporting
Traditionally reporting has focused on lost-time
injuries and not the management system
established to control risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_17>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 18001 : 2000<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>system elements appropriate for the
organization are implemented.
A-4.2.4  Document Control
OH&S documents communicate standards and
regulate action. They should be current,
comprehensive and issued by an authoritative
source.
The organization should ensure that:
a) documents
can
be
identified
with
appropriate
organization,
division,
function, activity or contact person;
b) documents
are
periodically
reviewed,
revised as necessary and approved by
authorized personnel prior to issue;
c) the current version of relevant documents
are available at all locations where
operations
essential
to
the
effective
functioning of the system are performed;
and
d) obsolete documents are promptly removed
from all points of issue.
Documents can be in any medium as long as
they
are
accessible,
useful
and
easily
understood.
A-4.2.5   Records and Information Management
Records are a means by which the organization
can demonstrate compliance with the ongoing
OH&S management systems and should cover :
a) external (for example legal) and internal
(that
is
OH&S
performance)
requirements;
b) work permits;
c) OH&S risks and hazards;
d) OH&S training activity;
e) inspection, calibration and maintenance
activity;
f) monitoring data;
g) details incidents (of Reporting above),
complaints and follow-up action;
h) product
identification
including
composition;
j) supplier and subcontractor information;
and
k) OH&S audits and reviews.
The effective management of these records is
essential to the successful implementation of
the OH&S management system. The key
features
of
good
OH&S
information
management include; means of identification,
collection,
indexing,
filing,
storage,
maintenance,
retrieval,
retention
and
disposition of pertinent OH&S management
system documentation and records. OH&S
records should be legible, identifiable and
traceable to the activity, product or service
involved. OH&S records should be stored and
maintained in such a way that they are readily<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>retrievable and protected against damage,
deterioration or loss. Their retention times
should be established and recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-4.3 Operational Control<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important that OH&S, in its broadest
sense,
is
fully
integrated
across
the
organization
and
into
all
its
activities,
whatever the size or nature of its work. In
organizing for the implementation of the policy
and the effective management of OH&S, the
organization should make arrangements to
ensure that activities are carried out safely and
in accordance with arrangements and should:
a) define the allocation of responsibilities
and accountabilities in the management
structure;
b) ensure
people
have
the
necessary
authority
to
carry
out
their
responsibilities; and
c) allocate
adequate
resources
commensurate with its size and nature.
Some typical activities, which are covered
under operational control are:
a) production;
b) maintenance;
c) storage;
d) handling;
e) packaging; and
f) transportation.
However this list is not an exhaustive list and
may be suitably modified depending upon the
activities of the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.3.1   Design and Engineering
Engineering controls involve some structural
change to the work environment or work
process to place a barrier to, or interrupt the
transmission path between the worker and the
hazard. This may include machine guards,
isolation or enclosure for hazards, the use of
extraction ventilation and manual handling
devices.
Prospective hazard involving processes or
services may be identified at the design stage in
consultation with various professionals, for
example engineers, architects, doctors or health
and safety professionals. The risk associated
with these hazards may be controlled by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Appropriate design, siting and selection of
premises including :
i) proposed use, foreseeable uses and
future maintenance;
ii) construction
in
a
manner
incorporating best health and safety
practices; and
iii) checking
compliance
to
contract
specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_18>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 18001 : 2000<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>equipment and services; and
c) that
their
contract
binds
their
subcontractors to ensuring that OH&S
requirements will be met, and includes
verification provisions for inspections,
testing,
auditing,
reviewing
and
documentation.
A-4.3.2.4  The organization needs to ensure that
personnel responsible for reviewing OH&S
aspects of contracts for goods and services have
suitable OH&S skills and experience. The
review system should include procedures
verifying that purchased goods and services
conform
to
specified
requirements.
The
organization may also use the identification,
assessment and control approach and may
involve those directly affected employees,
OH&S
clients,
subcontractors
while
introducing goods and services into the
workplace.
Purchasing documentation should:
a) list preferred suppliers;
b) show
the
decision
making
process,
including risk assessment through to
receipt of purchased goods/services; and
c) be retained as part of the organization’s
records.
A-4.3.3  Contingency
Preparedness
and
Response
Emergency plans should include:
a) installation or availability of suitable
warning and alarm systems tested at
regular intervals;
b) emergency
organization
and
responsibilities;
c) a list of key personnel;
d) details of emergency services (for example
fire
brigade,
medical
services,
spill
clean-up services);
e) an internal and external communication
plan;
f) training
plans
and
testing
for
effectiveness;
g) emergency rescue equipment available
and maintained in good working order;
and
h) conducting emergency and fire drill
periodically for testing the effectiveness of
the plan.
A-4.3.4   Critical Incident Recovery Plan
The CIRP should cover:
a) responsibilities,
including
coordination
and initiation;
b) defusing where those involved in the
trauma can discuss the event immediately
afterwards in a confidential atmosphere;
c) de-briefing, designed to assist employees
use their own abilities to overcome
emotional effects of serious incidents;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Appropriate design and selection of plant
including :
i) the
compilation
of
technical
standards as well as human factors
relating
to
installation,
use,
maintenance, decommissioning and
dismantling and disposal (including
on-going waste disposal); and
ii) health and safety data collected when
plant is being selected for purchase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.3.2   Purchasing
The organization needs to ensure that a policy
has been developed for the employment of
subcontractors who undertake work on the
employer’s premises or assets, or who carry out
work under the supervision and control of the
employer.
The organization also needs to satisfy itself
that its policy, plans and procedures for
subcontractors have been communicated to line
managers, supervisors and other employees to
ensure they are aware of their role and
responsibilities
in
the
management,
supervision and control of subcontractors.
A-4.3.2.1  The organizations should maintain a
register of preferred subcontractors that have
established and maintained effective OH&S
systems and practices.
A-4.3.2.2  The
organizations
should
select
subcontractors on their ability to meet the
organization’s
OH&S
requirements.
A
subcontractor’s
ability
to
meet
these
requirements can be assessed in accordance
with:
a) their OH&S policy;
b) project workplans and work method
statements;
c) competency;
d) registration
and
licenses
(where
applicable);
e) agreement to comply with the employers
OH&S policy for subcontractors;
f) verification (by inspection and tests) that
work areas, work methods, materials,
plant and equipment comply with health
and
safety
legislation,
regulations,
standards and codes; and
g) identification and allocation of human,
technical resources adequate to meet
those requirements.
A-4.3.2.3  Organization should be capable of
demonstrating not only their own commitment
to OH&S and how they intend to ensure
compliance
with
the
organization’s
requirements, but also:
a) that their subcontractors and suppliers
are selected on the basis of their ability to
comply with OH&S requirements;
b) how
they
interface
with
their
subcontractors/suppliers
of
materials,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

required on an ongoing basis. Assistance
may also have to be provided to the
families of directly or indirectly affected
victims; and
e) legal and insurance requirement for
example
interference
without
loss
adjuster approval can invalidate the
insurance policy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-5.3 Non Conformance, Corrective and
Preventive Action<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In establishing and maintaining procedures for
investigating and correcting non-conformance,
the organization should include these basic
elements:
a) Identifying
the
cause
of
the
nonconformance;
b) Identifying
and
implementing
the
necessary corrective action;
c) Implementing
or
modifying
controls
necessary to avoid repetition of the
nonconformance; and
d) Recording
any
changes
in
written
procedures resulting from the corrective
action.
Depending on the situation, this may be
accomplished rapidly and with a minimum of
formal planning or it may be a more complex
and
long-term
activity.
The
associated
documentation should be appropriate to the
level of corrective action.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-5 MEASUREMENT AND EVALUATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-5.1 Inspection and Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An organization should measure, monitor and
evaluate its OH&S performance, and take
preventive and corrective action.
Where appropriate, monitoring schemes for
significant hazards should be in place. Broadly,
such hazards may be classified as being either
of the following:
a) Physical, for example noise, radiation,
extremes of temperature; or
b) Chemical, for example toxic, flammable or
explosive.
A-5.1.1  Monitoring may take the following
forms:
a) Environmental, for example flammable
gases.
b) Personal, for example noise dosimetry,
personal respirable dust sampling.
c) Biological, for example heavy metals in
blood or urine.
d) Measurement of health outcomes, for
example audiometry and spirometry.
Procedures should be in place for action when
results do not conform with exposure standards
or limits or show abnormal trends.
Due care should be taken and procedure should
be in place for calibration of inspection and
testing equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-6 MANAGEMENT REVIEW<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization shall review at appropriate
intervals the OH&S system so as to ensure
continuing suitability, adequacy and to ensure
continuing
suitability,
adequacy
and
effectiveness. The results of such review should
be documented as well as published if the
organization has a commitment to do so.
Management reviews shall generally include
but not limited to :
a) assessment of the internal audit results;
b) review of corrective actions;
c) review of suggested changes;
d) monitoring of the system; and
e) review of policy, objectives and targets.
Management review is a cornerstone of the
management system providing an opportunity
for senior management to regularly review the
operation of the system and its continuing
suitability in the face of change and to make
adjustments to build upon and improve its
effectiveness.
Typically the review would be conducted 3, 6 or
12 monthly.
Some organizations prefer to incorporate the
review into a regular senior management
meeting to build on the principle that OH&S
management should be integrated into line
management activities.
Some
organizations,
recognizing
the
importance of employee involvement in the
process, choose to use the mechanism of the
central workplace committee where senior
management and employee representative
members conduct the periodic review.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-5.2 Internal Audit<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The audit programme and procedure should
cover:
a) activities and areas to be considered in
audits;
b) frequency of audits;
c) responsibilities associated with managing
and conducting audits;
d) communication of audit results;
e) auditor competence; and
f) how audits will be conducted.
Audits may be performed by personnel from
within the organization and/or external persons
selected by the organization. In either case, the
persons conducting the audit should be in a
position to do so impartially and objectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

management review meetings, with suitable
participants, where no other business will
distract from the review process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>OH&S performance is gathered from employees

<<PARAGRAPH>>(  Clause  A-3.2.1 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>GUIDELINES FOR HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT
AND CONTROL OF RISK<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>OH&S risk assessments. Their main purpose is
to determine whether planned or existing
controls are adequate. The intention is that
risks should be controlled before harm could
occur.
For many years OH&S risk assessments have
been carried out usually on an informal basis.
It is now recognized that risk assessment are a
key
foundation
for
pro-active
OH&S
management and that systematic procedures
are necessary to ensure their success.
A risk assessment based on a participative
approach
provides
an
opportunity
for
management and the work force to agree that
an organization’s OH&S procedures:
a) are based on shared perceptions of
hazards and risks;
b) are necessary and workable; and
c) will succeed in preventing accidents.
C-2.3 Pitfalls and Solutions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-1 APPLICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All employers and self-employed people have a
legal duty to assess the risks from their work
activities. The risk assessment procedure
described in this standard is intended to be
used:
a) for situations where hazards appear to
pose a significant threat and it is
uncertain whether existing or planned
controls are adequate in principle or in
practice; and
b) by
organizations
seeking
continuous
improvement in their OH&S management
systems, in addition to minimum legal
requirements.
The full procedure described in this standard is
not necessary or cost-effective when it is quite
clear from preliminary study that risks are
trivial, or a previous assessment has shown
that, existing or planned controls:
a) conform to the legal requirements as well
as established standards;
b) are appropriate for the tasks; and
c) are, or will be, understood and used by
everyone concerned.
Here no further action is required other than to
ensure, that controls continue to be used.
Small, low risk organizations in particular
should be highly selective in the risks that they
choose to assess in detail.
Effort developed for assessment of trivial risks
or for evaluation of standard controls will lead
to collection of more information that can
possibly be used, and to situations where
important facts are lost in a mass of spurious
documentation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Poorly planned assessments, carried out in the
brief that they are bureaucratic impositions,
will waste time and change nothing. Moreover,
organizations may get bogged down in detail,
where completion of assessment proforma
becomes an end in itself. Risk assessment
should provide an inventory for action and form
the basis for implementing control measures.
Potential risk assessors may have become
complacent. People who are too close to
situations
may
no
longer
perceive
and
recognize hazards, or perhaps judge risks as
trivial because to their knowledge no one has
been harmed. The aim should be that everyone
tackles risk assessments with a fresh pair of
eyes and a questioning approach.
Risk assessment should be carried out by
competent people with practical knowledge of
the work activities, preferably with colleagues
from another part of the organization, who may
have
greater
objectivity.
A
worthwhile
approach, whenever possible, is to train small
teams to carry out assessments.
Ideally,
everyone
should
contribute
to
assessments that relate to them. For example,
they should tell assessors what they think
about the need for and feasibility of particular
risk
controls.
In
larger
organizations
a
competent person, usually from within the
organization, should coordinate and guide the
assessors’ work. Specialist advice may need to
be sought.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-2 OVERVIEW
C-2.1 Basic Steps<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
following
steps
are
followed
in
identification of hazard and assessment and
control of risk:
a) identify hazards;
b) estimate the risk (the likelihood and
severity of harm) from each hazardous
event; and
c) decide if the risk is tolerable (for this
purpose a tolerable risk criteria should be
evolved
which
should
take
into
consideration the legal requirements and
other norms in that activity).
C-2.2 Necessity<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE—Pitfall of simple risk concept is that it can not
distinguish high probability low consequence events
from low probability high consequence events.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 18001 : 2000<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3 PRINCIPLE
C-3.1  Figure 3 shows the principle of risk
assessment. The steps are outlined below and
described fully in clauses  C-4 ,  C-5  and  C-6 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE — The word ‘tolerable’ here means that risk has
been reduced to the lowest level that is reasonably
practicable.
C-3.3 Risk Assessment Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If risk assessment is to be useful in practice
organizations should:
a) appoint
a
senior
member
of
the
organization to promote and manage the
activity;
b) consult with everyone concerned; discuss
what is planned to be done and obtain
their comments and commitment;
c) determine risk assessment training needs
for
assessment
personnel/teams
and
implement
a
suitable
training
programme;
d) review adequacy of assessment; determine
whether the assessment is suitable and
sufficient; that is to say, adequately
detailed and rigorous; and
e) document
administrative
details
and
significant findings of the assessment.
It is generally not necessary to make precise
numerical calculation of risk. Complex methods
for quantified risk assessment are normally
required only where the consequences of failure
could be catastrophic. Risk assessment in major
hazard industries is related to the approach
required in other workplaces, but in most
organizations much simpler subjective methods
are appropriate.
The assessment of risks to health associated
with exposure to toxic substance and harmful
energies
may
require,
for
example,
measurements of airborne dust concentrations
or noise exposure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>F IG . 3 T HE  P ROCESS   OF  R ISK  A SSESSMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-3.2  The following criteria are necessary for
organizations to carry out effective risk
assessment:
a)  Classify work activities : prepare a list of
work
activities
covering
plant,
raw
materials/chemicals handled, premises,
people
and
procedures,
and
gather
information about them;
b)  Identify hazards : identify all hazards
relating to each work activity. Consider
who might be harmed and how; what
might be damaged and how;
c)  Determine
risk :
make
a
subjective
estimate of risk associated with each
hazard assuming that planned or existing
controls are in place. Assessors should
also consider the effectiveness of the
controls and the consequences of their
failure;
d)  Decide if risk is tolerable : judge whether
planned or existing OH&S precautions (if
any) are sufficient to keep the hazard
under
control
and
meet
legal
requirements;
e)  Prepare risk control action plan  (  if
necessary  ): prepare a plan to deal with
any issues found by the assessment to
require attention. Organizations should
ensure that new and existing controls
remain in place and are effective; and
f)  Review adequacy of action plan : re-assess
risks on the basis of the revised controls
and check that risks will be tolerable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-4 PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The subclause describes the factor that an
organization should consider when planning
the risk assessment. Attention is drawn to the
need to refer to relevant regulations and
guidance
to
ensure
that
specific
legal
requirements are met.
The risk assessment process described here
covers all OH&S hazards. It is better to
integrate assessment for all hazards, and not
carry out separate assessment for health
hazards, manual handling machinery hazards
and so on. If assessment is carried out
separately, using different methods, ranking
risk control priorities is more difficult separate
assessment
may
also
lead
to
needless
duplication.
The following aspects of risk assessment need
to be considered carefully at the outset:
a) Design of a simple risk assessment
proforma (  see   C-4.2  );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

relating to the work activity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-4.2 Risk Assessment Proforma<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organizations
should
prepare
a
simple
proforma that can be used to record the
findings of an assessment, typically covering:
a) work activity;
b) hazard(s);
c) controls in place;
d) personnel at risk;
e) likelihood of harm;
f) severity of harm;
g) risk level;
h) action
to
be
taken
following
the
assessment; and
j) administrative details, for example name
of assessor, date, etc.
Organizations should develop their overall risk
assessment procedure and may need to carry
out trials and continually review the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<IMAGE_5>>
[Image 5 contains text: C]S22{A MOLK ScqrArgie2]
<<PARAGRAPH>>A necessary preliminary to risk assessment is
to prepare a list of work activities, to group
them in a rational and manageable way, and to
gather necessary information about them. It is
vital to include, for example, infrequent
maintenance tasks, as well as day-to-day
production work. Possible ways of classifying
work activities include:
a) geographical areas within/outside the
organization’s premises;
b) stages in the production process, or in the
provision of a service;
c) planned and reactive work; and
d) defined tasks (for example driving).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Three questions enable hazard identification:
a) Is there a source of harm ?
b) Who (or what) could be harmed ? and
c) How could harm occur ?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hazards
that

possess
negligible
potential for harm should not be documented or
given further consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-5.1.2   Broad Categories of Hazard<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The above list is not exhaustive. Organizations
should develop their own hazard ‘prompt-list’
taking into account the nature of their work
activities and locations where work is carried
out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To help with the process of identifying hazards
it is useful to categorize hazards in different
ways for example by topic, for example:
a) mechanical;
b) electrical;
c) radiation;
d) substances;
e) fire and explosion;
f) toxic release; and
g) natural calamities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C-5.1.3   Hazard Prompt-List<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A complementary approach is to develop a
prompt-list of questions such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During work activities could the following
hazards exist ?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The risk from the hazard should be determined
by estimating the potential severity to harm
and the likelihood that harms will occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Slips/falls on the level;
b) Falls of persons from heights;
c) Falls of tools, materials, etc, from heights;
d) Inadequate headroom;
e) Hazards
associated
with
manual
lifting/handling of tools, material, etc;
f) Hazards
from
plant
and
machinery
associated with assembly, commissioning,
operation,
maintenance,
modification,
repair and dismantling;
g) Vehicle
hazards,
covering
both
site
transport, and travel by road;
h) Fire and explosion;
j) violence to staff;
k) Substances that may be inhaled;
m) Substances or agents that may damage
the eye;
n) Substances that may cause harm by
coming into contact with, or being
absorbed through, the skin;
p) Substances that may cause harm by being
ingested (for example entering the body
via the mouth);
q) Harmful energies (for example, electricity,
radiation, noise, vibration);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-5.2.2   Severity of Harm<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Information obtained about work activities (  see
C-4.4  ) is a vital input to risk assessment.
When seeking to establish potential severity of
harm, the following should also be considered:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Part(s) of the body likely to be affected;
b) Nature of the harm, ranging from slightly
to extremely harmful:
i) Slightly harmful, for example:
— superficial injuries; minor cuts and
bruises; eye irritation from dust;
— nuisance and irritation (for example
headaches);
ill-health
leading
to
temporary discomfort;
ii) Harmful, for example:
— lacerations; burns;
— contussion; serious sprains;
— minor fractures;
— deafness; dermatitis; asthma;
— work related upper limb disorders;
and
— disorders;
ill-health
leading
to
permanent minor disability;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>— acute fatal diseases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-5.2.3   Likelihood of Harm<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When seeking to establish likelihood of harm
the adequacy of control measures already
implemented and complied with needs to be
considered. Here legal requirements and codes
of practice are good guides covering controls of
specific hazards. The following issues should
then typically be considered in addition to the
work activity information given in  C-4.4 :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table
1
shows
one
simple
method
for
estimating risk levels and for deciding whether
risks
are
tolerable.
Risks
are
classified
according to their estimated likelihood and
potential severity of harm. Some organizations
may wish to develop more sophisticated
approaches, but this method is a reasonable
starting point. Numbers may be used to
describe risks, instead of the terms ‘moderate
risk’, ‘substantial risk’, etc. However using
numbers does not confer any greater accuracy
to these estimates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Number of personnel exposed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Frequency and duration of exposure to the
hazard;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Failure of services for example electricity
and water;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-6.2 Risk Control Action Plan<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Failure
of
plant
and
machinery
components and safety devices;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Exposure to the elements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Protection afforded by personal protective
equipment and usage rate of personal
protective equipment; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Unsafe
acts
(unintended
errors
or
intentional violations of procedures) by
persons, for example, who:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) may not know what the hazards are;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii) may not have the knowledge, physical
capacity, or skills to do the work;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iii) underestimate risks to which they are
exposed; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An approach, again suggested as a starting
point, is shown in Table 2. It shows that control
measures and urgency should be proportional
to risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iv) underestimate the practicality and
utility of safe working methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important to take into account the
consequences of unplanned events.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The outcome of a risk assessment should be an
inventory of actions, in priority order, to devise,
maintain or improve controls. A procedure for
planning the implementation of necessary
changes following risk assessment is described
in  C-6.4 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These
subjective
risk
estimations
should
normally take into account all the people
exposed to a hazard. Thus any given hazard is
more serious if it affects a greater number of
people. But some of the larger risks may be
associated with an occasional task carried out
just by one person, for example maintenance of
inaccessible parts of lifting equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Controls should be chosen taking into account
the following:
a) If possible, eliminate hazards altogether,
or combat risks at source, for example, use<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>25<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_28>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 18001 : 2000<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a safe substance instead of a dangerous
one or reduce inventory level of hazardous
substance;
b) If elimination is not possible, try to reduce
the risk for example by using a low voltage
electrical appliance;
c) Where
possible
adapt
work
to
the
individual for example to take account of
individual
mental
and
physical
capabilities;
d) Take advantage of technical progress to
improve controls;
e) Measures that protect everyone;
f) A blend of technical and procedural
controls is usually necessary;
g) The
need
to
introduce
planned
maintenance of, for example, machinery
safeguards;
h) Adopt personal protective equipment only
as a last resort, after all other control
options have been considered;
j) The need for emergency arrangement; and
k) Pro-active measurement indicators are
necessary to monitor compliance with the
controls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The action plan should be reviewed before
implementation, typically by asking:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Will the revised controls lead to tolerable
risk levels?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Are new hazards created?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Has the most cost-effective solution been
chosen?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) What do people affected think about the
need for, and feasibility of, the revised
preventive measures ?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Will the revised controls be used in
practice, and not ignored in the face of for
example, pressures to get the job done ?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-6.4 Changing Conditions and Revising<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk assessment should be seen as a continual
process.
Thus,
the
adequacy
of
control
measures should be subject to continual review
and
revised
if
necessary.
Similarly,
if
conditions change to the extent that hazards
and risks are significantly affected then risk
assessments should also be reviewed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(  Clauses  C-4.1  and  C-6.1 )<<HEADING_END>>
