<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
In&n
Standards
Institution
on 21 May 1957, on approval
by the Building
Division
Council of the draft finalized on 13 December, t’954, by the Structural Steel
Sectional Committee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  This code is meant to serve as a guide to the industries using
the  resistance welding process in the fabrication of light mild steel assem-
blies.
Since sheet and strip steel will now be available
from local
production in India, increased use of thE retice
welding process would
naturally follow.
This code will; there&ore; help to ensure that develop-
ment of spot welding in India takes pl&ce along proper lines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For a particular weld design to be efficient, safe and satisfactory, the
designer should be conversant with the possibilities and limitations of the
welding processes which are available for use.
It is only in recent years
that sufficient information and data regarding resistance welding processes
have become available to give designers the necessary confidence to use
resistance spot welding in assemblies where strength and safety are of
importance.
It is possible
now to indicate
procedures
and suggest
formuh
for the design of such assemblies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The decision of the Government of India to introduce uniform weights
and measures throughout the country based on metric system has been
taken
into
consideration
in the formulation
of this code.
In order
to assist the users in the changeover
to the new system, values in
the metric s_ystem of weights and measures have been given in the code
with
equivalents
in the ft-lb
system.
It is proposed
to eliminate
the values in ft-lb units in future revisions of this code and it is empha-
sized that the users of this code should familiarize themselves with the
use of the metric units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1 Conversion from ft-lb units to metric units has been done accord-
ing to IS: 787-1956 Guide for Inter-Conversion
of Values From
One
System of Units to Another.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  In
the
formulation
of
this standard,
the
Sectional
Committee
has derived assistance from Messrs Ramseyer & Miller Inc, Consultants
to the Iron & Steel Industry, New York.
This assistance was made avail-
able to the Indian Standards Institution by the Technical Co-operation
Mission to India of the Government of United States of America under
their technical assistance programme.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 Taking
into
consideration
the
views
of
the
producers,
con-
sumers,
technologists,
etc,
the
Sectional
Committee,
responsible
for
the preparation
of this code felt that it should be related to
the
trade practices followed in the country in this field.
Furthermore, due
weightage
had to be given to the need for international co-ordination
between standards prevailing in different countries of the world.
These
considerations have led the Sectional Committee to derive assistance from
the following standards  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The first three
factors
in Table
I relate
to the welding-machine
itself
and
the .quality
of weld
among
other
things
depends
upon
the
correct
s:tting
of these variables.
In  every
case, setting
of the machine
is to
be
done
by
actual
trial
with
the
material
to be welded,
taking
into
consideration
the
manufacturer’s
recommendation.
Recommended
design
data
for machine
settings
for spot welding
of mild steel in metric
units
are given in Tabie II and in foot-pound
units in Table IIA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.1
The
pressures
indicated
in
Table
II
(or IIA)
for different
electrode
tip
diameters
are
calculated
on
the
basis
of
a
recom-
mended
minimum
pressure
of
700 kg/cm*
(or 10 000 lb/in2)
up to and
including
8 mm
(or fk in) electrode
tip diameter
and
1 000 kg/cm2
(or
15 000 lb/in’)
in the case of 9 mm (or 3

the total area equivalent to the specified weld size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Material Indentation -  The indentation caused by any tip of the
electrode after the weld has been made shall be not greater than 10 percent
of the thickness of the sheet with which the tip is in contact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  ROUTINE TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  To ensure consistent spot welds, the following tests shall be carried
out in accordance with the procedure laid down in Appendix A  :
a)  Slug test
I$ Shear test
c) Visual examination
d) Microscopic examination<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1 Slug tests shall be carried .out whenever assemblies are made by
spot welding except that they are optional in cases where shear tests are
carried out.
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2 Shear tests shall be carried out where spot welds are designed
for strength or where joints are highly stressed.
Shear tests may be
conducted
instead of, or in addition
to, the slug tests as agreed, to
between the purchaser and the fabricator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.3 Visual examination shall be carried out whenever assemblies are
made using spot welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.4 Microscopic examination
shall be carried out if so required by
the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. DESIGN<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.1  Design of spot-welded
assemblies shall take into consideration
the possibilities of the failure of the joint by:
a) failure of the weld by shear,
b) failure of the weld by tearing out of the blate (plug failure), and
c) tearing of the plate itself.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2  Shear and Plug Failwe -
It may be assumed that strength per
unit area of each weld remains reasonably constant whether the welds are
arranged singly or in groups or whether they fail purely in shear or by tear-
ing out of the plate (plug failure).
The design of spot welded assemblies
against shear and plug failure shall be based on the shear strength of welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 819 - 1957<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the parent metal under consideration in this code ultimate shear stress
of the welds has been specified at a minimum of 31.5 kg/mm* (or 20.0 tons/
ins).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.3  In spot welded assemblies, although the welds themselves have
very little ability. to deform under load due to their cast structures, the
welded joints have certain amount of ability to yield under stress.
When
the weld size is sufficient to carry the direct stresses, considerable bending
of the plates takes place before the weld can fail.
This ability of the joint
to yield is assumed as sufficient to distribute the load to all the spot welds
.
in the assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.4 Failure by the tearing of the plate is avoided by maintaining suffi-
cient edge distances for the welds.
The recommended
minimum edge
distance of 1-S times the diameter of the weld (see 8.5) normally ensures
that welds shear rather than the plates tear along the plate edges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2  Size of Weld -  Thesize
of a spot weld shall be based on the thick-
ness of thinner of the two sheets in the assembly.
The size of the weld
should bc according to the minimum weld diameter indicated in Table II
(or IIA) unless there are special reasons for adopting a larger diameter.
The weld diameter should approximate to the initial tip diameter of the
electrode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3  Permissible
Stress -The
permissible shear stress in a spot weld
shall be taken as 800 kg/cm2 (or 5.00 tons/in2).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 Minimum
Pitch of Welds.  -
The’.distance between centres of spot
welds shall be not less than 3 times the diameter of the-spot weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.1 In assemblies designed for strength, the .maximum straight line
pitch
should
be
not
greater
than
12 times
the thickness
of
the
thinnest plate in the assembly in the case of single rows of spot welds or
18 times the thickness of the thinnest plate in the assembly in the case of
staggered rows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5 Minimum
Edge Distance -  The minimum edge distance of spot
welds shall be not less than 1-S times the diameter of the weld and shall
preferably be as sh;wn in Table II (or Table HA).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.6 Design
Data -Table

lays
down
the
procedure
for
preparation
of
test specimens and carrying out slug test, shear test, visual examination
and microscopic examination
of spot welds.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2. PREPARATION
OF TEST SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.1  Test pieces shall be made :<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) at the commencement
of the daily work period and as soon
as practicable at the beginning of each shift,
b) whenever the diameter of one of the electrode tips has increased
to the maximum specified under C-3.4,
c) whenever new electrode tips are fitted to the machine, and
d) whenever any of the machine settings are varied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1.1
In case foot operated machines without an interlock are used,
one percent of the total output shall be selected at random in addition to
the samples selected in accordance with‘ A-2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2
As far
as possible
the
test
pieces
should
consist
of welded
components.
If this is not practicable
the test pieces should be made as
follows :
a) Test pieces shall be prepared out of pieces of the same material
and
dimensions
as
the _’ work
piece
and
welded
under
the
same conditions at the minimum spot spacing specified;
b) When the workpiece is of large dimensions, one of the following
procedures may be adopted  :
A jig which is a model of the workpiece shall be prepared using
the same material
as the workpiece;
to this
a test
piece of
the same material
may be attached so that -it is welded with the
maximum amount of material in the throat of the machine, at the
minimum spot spacing and under the same machine settings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>OR<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A test

and under the same machine settings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2.1
The test pieces shah comply with the following requirements:
a) No test piece shall he made with less than three spot welds,
b) When
a series of welds are being made, a minimum of six
spot welds shall be made on the test piece,
c) The order of making the weids shall be clearly marked on the test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) %rtest

<<HEADING level=3>>A-3. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3.1 Slug Test-The
test
piece
shall
be prized
apart
or one part
peeled
off from
the
other
(see Fig. 3) so that slugs of metal_ tend to be
pulled out from one or the other of the sheets.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>FIG. 3 TEST PIECE FOR SLUG TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1.1  The third or the last weld made on the test piece shall pull out
a slug of a mean diameter
equal to the diameter
specified
on the drawing
or equal to the initial
electrode
tip diameter
as obtained
from the formula
under
C-3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_16>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  819 - 1957<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mean diameter shah be the average of two diameters measured
at right angles, one of which is the apparent minimum.
The diameters
shall be measured at the original interface.
The edges of the slugs shall
be bright and free from evidence of hot cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
When slug tests are made on spots on thin sheets, the slug obtained
may appear
sound,
but only
the
outer
ring
may
be welded.
Care
should,
therefore,
be taken
to ensure
that
the weld is sound.
r
A-3.2 Shear Test -All
welds in the test piece, except the last two,
shall be drilled out or cut away.
The test piece shall then be tested to
destruction
on a tensile
testing machine.
The effect of eccentricity
in
the pulls on the two sheets may be disregarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.2.1
The ultimate
strength per spot shall be taken as one-half the
maximum load required to break the joint in the test piece.
The ultimate
shear stress so calculated on each weld shall be not less than 31.5 kg/mm*
(or 20.0 tons/ins).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3.3
Visual
Examination
-  The test
piece
shall
be  f  visually
ex-
amined for alignment,
spacing and pitch of the weId.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.4
Microscopic
Examination
-The
third weld on the test piece
shall be sectioned across its diameter and the cut-section shall be polished,
etched
and then
cxamincd
under a microscope
with a magnification
of not less than x 10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.4.1
The microscopic
examination
of the spot weld cross-section
shall show that the desired quality of weld is being maintained and that
no harmful defects are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Maintains the flow of the prerset value of current for preset
time,
these
remaining
within
the
limits
which
do not
affect
the
weld strength
(as determined
in .accordance
with the methods
prescribed
under 7 and in Appendix A) and the welding pressure

flowing,
d) Cuts,off the welding current at the end of the pre-set time,
e) Causes the welding pressure to be maintained
for a minimum
of O*OS second (the forging time).
Where no interlock is provid-
ed the forging time shall be controlled by the operator (see A-2.1  .l),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The forging time required increases
as the material thickness increases,
e.g. approximately
one-tenth
of a second is sufficient when welding l-6 mm (or
16 SWG) thick material
whereas at least one second is needed to weld a 3.2 mm
(or 4 in) thick
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Allows the welding pressure to be released at the end of this time,
and allows the machine to be returned to a condition where it is

For heavy duty cycle and continuous operation,
the electrode material should have a minimum of 150 VPH (when
made from hard-drawn rod) and have a softening temperature
not
lower
than
500°C.
Forged

SIZE AND SHAPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.1  The
shank
diameter
of
the
electrode
should
be
so. chosen
that there is no softening due to overheating.
It is recommended
that
the shank diameter should be at least thrice the tip diameter and prefer-
ably not less than 13-O mm (or 050 in).
The electrode taper should be
such as to enable ease of removal and ensure good electrical contact.
A
taper with
5” included
angle has been found
to be convenient
for
most purposes;
No. 2 Morse taper is also used in many cases where
the pressure is not too high.
The length of the tapered portion shall be
not less than l-250 in the case when the thrust is in line with the shank
and not less than  W  in the case of electrodes with eccentric loading;  D

the diameter
of the electrode
at the large end of the taper
of the shank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3.
TIP SIZE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h-3.1  The size of the spot in the weld depends on the size of the
tip.
Table II (or IIA) contains recommendations
regarding tip size for

<<PARAGRAPH>>C-3.4 The diameter of at least one of the tips shall not be allowed to
increase by more than 20 percent of the initial electrode tip diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-3.5 The supervisor or operator shall from time to time check the size
of the tip by means of a gauge  ;  when its size has increased to the maxi-

ANGLE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-4.1 The included angle of the truncated
cone which is twice the com-
plement of the rake angle has a bearing on the life of the electrode.
For
tip diameters up to and including 2.5 mm (or fk in) an included angle of
120” is recommended.
For tip diameters greater than 2.5 mm (or & in)
an included angle of 140” is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-5. COOLING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-5.1 In order to avoid softening of the electrode it shall be water-cooled.
The water hole diameter should be not greater than %D:but preferably  &D,
D  being the diameter of the electrode at the large end of the taper of the
shank.
The maximum distance between the end of the water cooling hole
and the tip of the electrode shall be not more than 13.0 mm (or 0.50 in).
The distance between the tip of water inlet tube and the blind end of the
water hole shall not exceed
13.0 mm (or 0.50 in),
The arrangement
should be such as to allow a minimum quantity
ofi 7: litres (or I-5 gal) of
water to pass per minute through each circuit of each ma&ire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>D-l.1
It is required to spot weld together two plates, each 2.5 mm thick
to obtain the full strength from the joint (see Fig. 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS: 819 - 1957<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-l.2 Diameter
of Weld -  From Table 11  the weid diameter is taken
as 8.0 mm for a plate thickness of 2.5 mm.
D-l.3 Number
of Welds
Required
per cm Width of Joint - Safe
load per weld at 800 kg/cm2 on the area corresponding to 8.0 mm diameter
is 400 kg  (see  Table II).
Safe load in tension of 1 cm width of plate at 1250 kg/cm2 on the area
1 x 0.25 cm2 is 315 kg.
To develop full strength of plate, number of welds required per cm<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>D-l.4 Spacing of Welds and Edge Distance - (see  Table II and 8.4)
minimum Ditch = 3  X  8-O mm
=24mm
TWO rows of welds at a pitch of 25 mm give a little over 0.79 welds
per cm and are satisfactory.

Minimum  edge distance =  1.5 x 8.0 mm = 12 mm (see 8.5).
But<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>as  per Table ‘II minimum  edge  distance will have to be 12.5 mm.
