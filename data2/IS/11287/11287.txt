<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution on 26 February
1985, after the draft finalized by the Electrical
Measuring Instruments
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Electrotechnical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
deals with the hand generator type insulation testers
with bridge facilities which is a very convenient instrument
for- measure-
ment of (a) insulation
resistance,
(b) loop resistance
of cables or coil
resistance, (c) localization
of fault in the cables.
It comprises of a hand
generator, one or more
moving
coil instrument(s)
and
a Wheatstone
bridge with loop facilities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 It is recognized
that for bridge insulation testers for use in hazardous
and stringent environmental
conditions,
special
provisions
concerning
environmental
testing may be necessary.
It is recommended
that in such
cases these requirements
should be additionally
specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the preparation
of this standard,
assistance
has been derived from
the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

DUST
CHAMBER<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.1
A schematic
layout
of a typical chamber recommended
for use
for the dust cycle is shown in Fig. 1.
It is designed
to ensure
uniform
and reproducible
distribution
of dust. The system is completely
enclosed
and
does not become congested during operation.
A  circulating
fan  F
(  low pressure, high volume, ventilating
pattern ) blows air over the pile
P  where
the dust is picked up and carried
along into the chamber C.
The air velocity decreases in the chamber so that much of the dust falls
back
into the hopper  H  from where it returns to the pile, while the air
is fed back into the fan through the top of the chamber.
The dimensions
of the hopper
tube
are so proportioned
that whatever the head of the
dust pressure may be, the pile  P  never completely
fills the main air duct.
Consequently,
the air flow carries away, more or less, a constant
amount
of dust from a pile which all the time is being replenished.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
