FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the
Indian
Standards
Institution on 24 September 1982, after the draft finalized by the Public
Health Engineering Equipment Sectional Committee had been approved
by the  Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A series of Indian Standards covering various types of equipment
used in waste water treatment are being formulated to give guidance to
local bodies, public health engineering departments and others in setting
up treatment plants. l’his standard covers the requirements for clarifiers
which
are normally provided
for the removal  of  suspended  solids from
waste  water.
The location of clarifier tanks with respect to other units
in the treatment plants shall be determined by the type of process adopted
and flow sheet employed for treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
settling characteristics
vary from waste to waste, and in some
industry one waste stream to another or combined waste.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 The waste after neutralization
when applied
to clarifiers,
can
have higher over flow rate than that for the sewage ( as the chemical
sludges usually have higher settling rate ). Therefore, the over flow rates
for different industrial waste can be arrived at after having conducted
laboratory
settling columns studies, and the values may be modified
taking into account the actual prototype. Recommendations
given below
for overflow rates, min’mum side water depth, detention time, weir load-
ings, bottom slopes, etc, are only for general guidance
and indicate the
basis of preparation of this specification:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>15-35<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>vi) Secondary settling tank for extended aeration
8-15<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Minimum  sick water  defith -
The minimum
side water depth in
rectangular or circular horizontal flow tanks shall not be less than
2.0 m.
For clarification
after activated
sludge process, the
minimum depth shall be 2.60 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Detention fimG -
For  sewage
treatment, the detention period in
primary sedimentation
tanks 2 to 21 hours and in secondary
sedimentation
tank la to 2 hours will produce the optimum
results.
Longer detention may be necessary in case of industrial
wastes with or without chemical precipitation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Weir
loadings -
For
primary,
intermediate
and
secondary
sedimentation
tanks except
in case of
secondary
tanks for
activated
sludge process, weir loading not greater than 100 ms/
d/m for average  flow  is recommended.
For secondary
settling
tank in activated
sludge or its modifications, the weir loading
shall not exceed 150 mydIm.
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) %ottoQn slopes -
The floars of settling tank shall be provided
with
sludge
collection
hoppers and the sludge scrapping mechanism
shall be arranged to collect the settled solids from the entire floor
area and deliver it to the collection hopper.
The floor shall be
sloped towards the centre in the case of hopper bottom tanks and
to a central sludge pocket.
The floor slope shall be of the order
of 1 in 12 or steeper for circular
and square tanks and one
percent or less for rectangular tanks.
Flat bottom tanks v$th
continuous sludge removal may be used for secondary
settling
tank only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For vertical flow tanks, the slope of the hopper should not be less
than 60” to the horizontal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All sharp corners of the clarifiers should be rounded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Typical
sketch showing the details of settling tank is given in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international coordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to reIating it to the practices in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing the result of ‘a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accord-
ante with IS  :  2-196W  .  The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Sludge
scrapping
is done
by inclined
steel
plates
known
as scraper

fitted
to the structural
steel rake arm of frame.
Blades
shall be
inclined
to the axis of the frame
or rake, so as to push the sludge towards
centre.
Blades
are
normally
straight
or
curved
inward.
Ho izontal
projection

blades
shall overlap
each other.
The
scrapping
blades are provided
normally
for 4 or full diameter
of
the tank
depend-
ing on its size and
also considering
peripheral
speed
of the
scrapping
arm.
This scrapping
arm is either attached
to a rotating
bridge by means
of vertical
supports
or attached
to a centre drive cage. Rotating
bridge
is
driven
by a motor,
reduction
gear box, etc, at the periphery
and
centre
drive cage is driven by the same method at the centre
of the tank.

at the centre
of
the tank.
For large size tanks that
is  55 m diameter
or above,
the bridge
sometimes
extends
to the full diameter
driven
at both ends and scrapers
are attached
