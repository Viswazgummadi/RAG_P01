<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
( Part XX)
(Third
Revision
) was adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 27 February
1981, after the draft
finalized
by the
Civil
Works
Measurement
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
a very
important
place
in the planning
and
execution
of any civil engineering
work, from the time
of first
estimates
to the final com.pletion
and settlement
of payments.
The methods
being
followed
for measurement
are not uniform,
and considerable
differences
exist between
the practices
followed
by different
construction
agencies
and
also by various
central
and state government
departments.
While
it is recognized
that
each
system
of measurement
has to be specifically
related
to the administrative
and financial
organization
with
the depart-
ments
responsible
for the work,
a unification
of the
various
systems
at the technical
level has been accepted
as very desirable,
specially
as it
permits
a wider circle of operation
for civil engineering
contractors
and
eliminates
ambiguities
and misunderstandings
arising
out of inadequate
understanding
of the various
systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Among
the various
civil engineering
items,
measurement
of building
had
been
the first  to  be taken
up  for standardization
and this standard
having
provisions
relating
to building
works,
was first published
in
1958 and was revised
in 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In
the course
of usage
of this
standard
by various
construction
agencies
in the country,
several
clarifications
and
suggestions
for modi-
fications
were received
and as a result of study,
the technical
committee
responsible
for this standard
decided
that
the scope
of this
standard
besides
being
applicable
to building
should
be expanded
so as to cover
method
of measurement
applicable
to civil engineering
works
like in-
dustrial
and river
valley project
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1200 ( Part XX ) - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  Since measurement
of one type of trade is not related
to that
of
another
one,
and also to facilitate
the second revision
of IS : LZOO-
1964*, the Sectional
Committee
decided that each type of trade as given
in IS  :  1200-1964*
be issued separately as different parts.
This will also
be helpful to the specific users in various trades in using the standard.
This part covering the method of measurement
of laying of gas and oil
pipelines,
including
appurtenant
items applicable
to bulding as well as
civil engineering
works, was therefore, issued as the secdnd revision
in
1969.
The third revision
has been done so as to keep the provisiol)rin
line
with
method of
measurement
now
followed
by
majority
of
organizations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard is complied
with, the final value,
observed or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960t.
Th e nu’mber of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
