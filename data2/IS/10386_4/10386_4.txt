Committee,

<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Safety
in
Construction,
Operation
and
Maintenance
of River
Valley
Projects
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the River Valley Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With large scale increase
in construction
activity
of river
valley
projects,
the
number
of major
accidents
have increased.
Further,
increased
construction
activity
has
created
certain
hazards
for
persons
working
on the projects.
The degree of safety achieved
in project
constructions
has a direct
bearing
on the amount
of effort expanded
to avoid accidents
by those
who
control
the
conditions
and practices
on the project.
In order to avoid accidents
it should
be the
overall
responsibility
of
the project
authorities
to provide
measures
for the safety of all persons
working
on the projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are number
of aspects
that need to be kept in mind when the safety norms
of an
entire
river
valley project
are envisaged.
To this end, various
aspects that need consideration,
from
the view-
point
of safety, are dealt with in various
parts
of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers the safety aspects to be kept in view during
handling,
transportation
and
storage
of explosives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Explosives
play a vital role in~the construction
of different components
of modern
river valley projects.
Proper
handling,
transportation
and storage of explosives
is as essential
from the view point of safety
as selection
and judicious
use of proper
kind and quality
of explosive
is for
successful
and
efficient
progress
of every job.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hazards
arising
out of mishandling
of explosives
are lrkely to result in accidents
which may endanger
the life of workers
and inhabitants
in the vicinity
and
also
endanger
the safety
of buildings
and
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>protection against moisture,
provided
the cases
remain unopened. Stock should always he  used  in the
sequence of the date of manufacture, which is marked
on the cases. This avoids any accumulation of old
stock and helps to make sure that the material is in the
best condition. Once a case is opened the contents
should he used as early as possible, if all the
explosives are not used during the same day, the
original packing should be folded over and the case
should
be
closed
to
give
the
maximum
possible protection to the contents. Tbe storage of
explosives s ball be done as  per  provisions  of the Indian
Explosives Act, 1884 and rules made thereunder and
conditions given in the licence to be issued by the
competent authority as laid  down  in the act.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This part lays down requirements regarding
storage of different classes of explosives, selection of
site for magazine, maintenance and operation of
magazine, transportation of-explosives, their handling,
loading, unloading and inspection as well as pre-
cautions to be taken therein.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The  use of’explosives
is very essential in bard
ground tunneling, shaft sinking and other excavation
operations of river valley projects. Selection dnd
judicious use of proper kind and~quality of explosive
is very essential fc., safe and speedy execution of
various components of such projects. All operations
I  involved in transportation, handling and use ofexplo-
sive should he as pet the Indian Explosive Act 1884
and should also conform to the pmvlsiom made therein.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Selection  of Site for Magazine<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The  magazine should he kept away from residential
buildings, railroads or highways, transmission lines,
dams and their appurtenant works.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Proper storage of explosives and accessories is
important to ensure LLat these materials are kept out of
reach of unauthorized persons to reduce the hazard of
accidental explosionand also to maintain themingood
condition for use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1 Tbe safe distance required under the Explosives
Rules 1940 depends upon the storage capacity of the
magazine and may he carefully planned taking into
account the rate of consumption and the frequency of
replenishment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Gelatine tends to stiffen if exposed to low
temperature fora  long  duration.  Thereforesome times,
it may he desirable to p1ac.e explosives in a warm room
for several hours ‘hefore use to enable them to soften
and make them easier to prime and tamp in bore holes.
In no case should the gelatine he placed close to a fire
to thin or soften it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2 Tbe best site for a magazine is on well drained
sloping ground.  The selected site should he accessible
by road and it is advisable to make sure that the
existing tracks are usable throughout the year. If-there
are overhead power transmission lines in the selected
area, the distance between these and tbc magazine
building should not he less than 92 me&es.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  STORAGE OF EXPLOSIVES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3 The construction and approval of the magazine
shall he based on Standard Indian Practice as governed
‘by the Indian Explosives Act 1884 and Explosives
Rules 1940, as amended from time to time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Effect of Storage on Explosives and Accessories<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Explosives
and accessories
are pcrl$bable goods
which are liable to deteriorate aft?! prolonged storage,
especially
if subjected
to lrilrb temperature and
humidity. If kept in a moist place the compounds
contained in the explosives may lose tbeir power. It is
due to this reason that underground magazines are
not preferred on river valley projects. On the other
hand, explosives should also not he stored in a very
dry place, because they may lose the moisture they
naturally contain and thus their speed of explosion
may change.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Storage of Different Class of Explosives<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under the Explosive Rules, the various explosives and
accessories are classified under separate headings as
