<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Pesticide Residues
Analysis Sectional Committee had been approved by the Food and Agriculture Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Phorate, 0,0-dimethyl S-ethylthiomethyl phosphorodithioate, formulations are extensively used in agriculture for the
control of many insect pests. This standard will enable the food, health authorities and others engaged in the field to
follow uniform test procedure for the estimation of residues of phorate in agriculture and food commodities, soil and
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In preparation of this Standard due consideration has been given to the limits of phorate residues which have been
laid down under the provisions of  Prevention
of Food Adulteration
Act,
1954  and Rules firmed thereunder and
Standards
of Weights and Measures (Packaged
Commodities)
Rules,  1977.  The  specified test method is sensitive to
the prescribed level of residues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value, observed
or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised
)’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Calculate the parts per million of residue 9 pg/g in
sample by comparing the response (peak area) obtained
for an unknown to the response obtained for a known
amount of phorate or oxygen analogue standard carried
through the procedure from the oxidation step. The
standard is a composite of both compounds, but parts
per million in the unknowns are calculated separately
using the corresponding
standard
peak, because
chromatography response is slightly different for the
two compounds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dissolve the sample residues from the previous step
in 2 ml of acetone.
Add 5 ml of 20 percent (w/v)
magnesiumsulphate solutionand 25 mlof 0.5 N KMnOd
solution, washing down the sides of the flask during
the addition.
Mix and let stand for 30 min with
occasional swirling for 30 rein, making sure that there
is an excess of permanganate the entire time. Transfer
the oxidation chloroform and add this to separator
funnel containing the oxidation mixture.
Shake the
separator
fmnel for 30s to extract, allow the phases
to separate (centrifuge
if necessary), and drain the
lower phase through 15to 20 g of powdered, anhydrous
sodium sulphate retained in a powder funnel with a
loose plug of glass wool.
Collect the filtrate in a
250-ml round bottom flask. Repeat the above extraction
twice more with fresh 25 ml portions of chloroform.
After the final extraction, rinse the sodium sulphate
with 20 ml of chloroform.
Evaporate the combined
extracts just to dryness on a rotary vacuum evaporator
at 40”C. Remove any lasttraces of solvent with a stream
of dry air at room temperature.
Dissolve the residue
in ethyl acetate and analyze by GLC as the sulfones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
