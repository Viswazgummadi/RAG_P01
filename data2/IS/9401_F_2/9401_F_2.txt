<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement
of Works of River Valley Projects
Sectional Committee,
RVD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Part 15/Section
2 ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after
the draft finalized by the Measurement
of Works of River Valley Projects
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the measurement
of works of river
projects
a large diversity
of methods
exist
at present
according
to local practices.
This lack of uniformity
creates complications
regarding
measure-
ments and payments.
Keeping in view the large amount
of financial
outlay
involved
in river
valley projects
and also the fact that the authorities
responsible
for
completing
these projects,
are of the state level or national
level, it is felt
that
a suitable
methodology
is needed for
adopting
uniform practices
towards the measurement
of works so that the scope of complica-
tions and misinterpretation
of items of work is reduced,
as far as possible.
This standard
is
being formulated
in various parts
so as to cover
each type
of work separately.
This part is
being formulated
in two sections.
Section 1 Covering
bore
hole drilling, and Section 2 Explo-
ratory drifting.
This standard
is intended
to provide
a uniform basis for measuring the work
done in respect of exploratory
drifting
for River Valley Projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied with
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test
or analysis,
shall be
rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 bRules for
rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
