<<PARAGRAPH>>Fire Safety Sectional Committee, CED 36<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
after the
draft
finalized
by the Fire Safety Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covering essential requirements of fire safety of godowns and warehouses
was first
issued in 1967.
Based on the experience gained during its implementation,
the standard
has now
been revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fires in storage
buildings
and warehouses account for a great percentage of total number of out-
breaks in industrial occupancies and almost invariably
assume serious proportions.
If fire starts
when the godown
is closed, it often
remains undetected
for sometime and by then, it assumes
serious proportions.
The principal causes of outbreak of fire in a godown are careless smoking,
electrical sources, spontaneous ignition,
falling of sparks/embers
from external source, carrying out
of dangerous operations, like welding, cutting, spray painting, etc, either in the godown
building
or in buildings
communicating
with the godown, use of naked lights for cooking, faulty electrical
installations, storage of different goods which would be hazardous in combination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The three primary considerations,
in providing adequate and reasonable
fire protection
and safe-
guards for storage occupancies are, the fire behaviour of stored materials,
their storage arrangement,
and the type of building
itself.
Once a fire occurs in a storage building the fire propagation and
duration depend primarily on these factors.
The earlier a fire is detected,
controlled
and extin-
guished, the lesser the damage will result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Frequency
of fire outbreaks
and losses suffered as a result, may be considerably reduced if proper
attention is paid to various aspects affecting fire safety, such as fire resistive construction,
compart-
mentation, proper layout, size and height of the building,
provision of smoke and heat ventilation,
drainage
arrangements,
regulating
the quantity
and type of stocks in any particular
godown,
segregation
of stocks having a varying
fire risk, size and height of piles, provision of adequate
aisles, separation of storage and process activities, minimising exposure hazards by proper layout of
the building, etc.
Automatic fire detection,
alarm and protection
arrangements
are of utmost
importance
because warehouses
are normally
occupied
only by comparatively
less number
of
people during working hours and hardly any or at all during non-working hours.
When the value
in a fire area is extremely
high, it will be desirable to sub-divide it by one or more structurally
independent fire walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cold storage warehouses are used primarily for extended storage of food products
at low tempera-
tures which prevent
or retard spoilage.
Depending on the products or processes, temperatures in
cold storage range from -5°C
to 20°C.
Despite such low temperatures,
cold storage warehouses
are not immune to fire hazards.
In fact, the low temperatures present unusual fire prevention and
control problems which may assume serious proportions
when such premises are located
outside
municipal
limits.
Combustible
materials
in such warehouses
include cork or expanded plastic
insulation, wood dunnage,
pallets,
boxes, fireboard
and paper containers
and wrappings,
etc.
Although
fire frequency
in such premises, is relatively low, considering the presence of large fire
potential, the fire protection arrangements for the cold storage warehouses have to be of the same
standard as for the normal storage occupancies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many combustible materials such as grains, sugar, starch, flour, etc, are handled and stored in bulk.
These are generally stored in bulk in silos, bins, etc.
Such special storage practice are not covered
under this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provisions of this Code are supplementary
to the relevant statutory
requirements
as laid down in
Indian Factory Act, Petroleum Rules, Gas Cylinder Rules, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
