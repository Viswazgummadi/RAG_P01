FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 19 .July 1969, after the draft finalized by the Stone Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The property of toughness of stone is resistance to failure under impact.
Stones of low toughness are apt to fail when exposed to rough usage, as
occurs on steps, flooring of factories, stories, warehouses, godown, etc. This
standard provides a method for measuring toughness of stones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailin
in
different countries in addition to relating it to the practices
in the fiel f in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded OR,
it shall be done in accordance
with IS:2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard lays down the procedure for determination
of toughness
of natural building stones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. SAMPLING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The
sample shall
be selected
by the -purchaser
or his authorized
representative
from the quarried
stone or taken from the natural rock as
described in 2.2 and 2.3 so as to represent a true average of the type or
grade of stone under consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  Stone from  Ledges
or Quarries-The
ledge or quarry face of the
stone shall be inspected
to determine
any variation
in different
strata.
Differences
in colour and structure shall be observed.
Separate samples of
stone weighing at least 25 kg each of unweathered
type shall be obtained<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

values

<<PARAGRAPH>>from all strata that appear to vary in colour and structure.
I’iec,cs that have
been damaged
by blasting
shall not be included
in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Field Stone and Boulders --A
detailed
inspection
of tlla dqjosits
of
field stone and boulders,
over the area where the supplv is to IW obtained,
shall
be made.
T11r different
kinds
of stone and th6ir coudilion
in the
various
deposits shall be recorded.
Separate
samples
shall be selected
of
all classes
of stone
that
Ivould
be considered
fi,r use fin construction
as
indicated
by visual insprrtion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4
When
perceptible
variations
occw
in the quality ol‘rock,
the purchasing
shall select as many samples as are necessary
for dcterminine;

properties.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. TEST
SPECIMENS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Three
test specimens
shall constitute
a test set.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
One
set
of spec.ilnens
shall
IJO tlrill~~cl perpendicular
and
anotllt’r
parallel
to tile plane
of structural
weaknrss
of thcb stolle,
if suc~h plane
is apparent.
11‘  SIIC:II plant

one sclt shall be drilled
at
random.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 The specimen
sllall be cut from the samples
with core drills or in any
other way which
will not induce incipirnt
fYac:ture: but shall not be chipped
or broken off with a hammer.
After sawing,
the ends of the specimens-shall
be ground
plane with  ivater
and carborundum
nr  emery, on a cast iron lap,
un;il the cylinders
are  nf the size mentioned
in 3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5 The  ends
of the cylinders
shall
be plane
surfaces
at right
angles
to the
axis  of the cylinders.<<HEADING_END>>

Machine -
The
toughness
test shall be carried
out in a machine

to the requirements
descrillcd
in
Appendix
A.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5;  TEST
PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The cylindrical
test specimen
shall be securely held in the anvil with-
out rigid lateral
support,
and under
the plunger
in such a way that
the
centre of its upper surface shall, throughout
the test, be tangential
to the
spherical end of the plunger at its lowest point.
The hammer
shall be given
a free fall of 1 cm for the first blow;
‘2 cm for ~the second
blow, and an
increase
of 1 cm fall for each
succeeding
blow until failure
of the test
specimen occurs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

toughness
of the three specimens
in each

when no plane of structural
weakness
is apparent.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 Any peculiar
condition
of a test specimen
which might effect the result,
s~~rh as the presence
of seams,
