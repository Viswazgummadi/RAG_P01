b) effective thread engagement is at least 0.6 times nominal diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2  This standard does not define corrosion or oxidation resistance in particular environments. It
does specify grades for fasteners made from corrosion resistant stainless steels. Some have
mechanical properties allowing use at temperatures down to – 200°C in air. Some have oxidation
resistance allowing use at temperatures up to +800°C in air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.3  Acceptable corrosion and oxidation performances and mechanical property values allowing use at
elevated or sub-zero temperatures shall be the subject of agreement between the user and the
manufacturer wherever appropriate to the proposed service environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Designation System  — The designation of the stainless steel threaded fasteners is given in
Table 1. The steel grades and property classes are designated by a four-character identifier
consisting of a letter followed by three digits. The letter indicates the general composition groups of
steels as follows:
A — for austenitic steels
C — for martensitic steels
F — for ferritic steels<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The first digit following the letter indicates the type of alloying elements present for the particular
Group A, C or F. The last two digits indicate the property class (metallurgical condition).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The marking shall include the steel grade and property class and also the manufacturer’s
identification mark (  see  Fig. 1 ). Additional marking can be applied at the option of the
manufacturer or at the specific request of the purchaser. This additional marking should not be
liable to cause confusion with any other standardized marking or identification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Studs and Other Fasteners  — Marking of studs and other fasteners shall be agreed between
the user and the manufacturer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Nuts  — Nuts shall be marked with the steel grade and with the manufacturer’s identification
mark in the case of nuts of M5 thread diameter and greater (  see  Fig. 2 ), where this is technically
possible for the manufacturer. Marking of one nut face is acceptable and shall be by indentation
only when applied to the bearing surface of the nuts. Alternatively marking on the side of the nuts
is permissible. Property class marking and designation of nuts is necessary where the nuts do not
meet the minimum proof load stress of the highest property class for the steel grade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Packages and Containers  — Marking of the designation is mandatory on all packages or
containers of all sizes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Finish  — Unless otherwise specified, stainless steel fasteners shall be supplied clean and

<<PARAGRAPH>>At the discretion of the manufacturer, fasteners may be manufactured from all steels
corresponding to the grade required, except where the user specifies steels covered by particular
national specification. Alternative steels may be used provided that they give the physical and
mechanical properties to the required steel grade and property class and have equivalent corrosion
resistance. When alternative compositions are used, consultation between the manufacturer and
the user may be necessary in order to ensure suitability for the intended application. Only when
all these conditions are met parts shall be marked and/or described according to the designation
system described in  2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Austenitic steel fasteners of grades A2 and A4 shall not show any grain-boundary carbide
network and shall be resistant to inter-crystalline corrosion tests as defined in IS 10461 ‘Method
for determination of resistance to intergranular corrosion of austenitic stainless steels : Part 1
Corrosion test in nitric acid medium by measurement of loss in mass (Huoy test), and Part 2
Corrosion test in sulphuric acid/copper sulphate medium in the presence of copper turnings
(Monypenny Strauss test).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grade A1 fasteners can also be supplied resistant to inter-crystalline corrosion subject to prior
agreement with the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

LOAD-EXTENSION CURVE FOR STRESS AT 0.2 PERCENT
PERMANENT STRAIN (  R p0.2  )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The clamping length from which  R p0.2  is calculated is taken as the distance  L 3  between the
under-side of the head and the threaded adapter (  see  Fig.  3  ). A value equal to 0.2 percent of  L 3  is
then applied to the horizontal (strain) axis of the load extension curve,  OP , and the same value is
plotted horizontally from the straight line portion of the curve as  QR . A line is then drawn through
P  and  R  and the intersection,  S , of this line with the load-extension curve corresponds to a load at
point  T  on the vertical axis. The load, when divided by the thread tensile stress area
(  see  Appendix A ), gives the stress at 0.2 percent permanent strain (  R p0.2  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The component under test shall be screwed into a hardened threaded adapter to a depth of one
diameter (  see  Fig. 3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The value of extension is determined between the bearing face of the bolt head and the end of
the adapter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4  Determination of Total Extension at Fracture  (  A L  ) — The extension test shall be carried out
on bolts, screws and studs in the finished condition. It is applicable only to fasteners with lengths
equal to three times the diameter ( 3 d  ) or longer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The component under test shall be screwed into the threaded adapter to a depth of one diameter
(  see  Fig. 3 ). After the bolt or screw has been fractured in accordance with the tensile testing
procedure, the two broken pieces shall be fitted closely together and the overall length (  L 2  )
measured again (  see  Fig. 5 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total extension at fracture shall then be calculated using the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A L  =  L 2  –  L 1
The value obtained shall exceed the minimum values of the appropriate property value tables.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If this test is required on machined samples, the test values should be specially agreed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5  Determination of Breaking Torque  (  T m  ) — The screws shall be tested in a clamping device as
shown in Fig. 6. At failure under the applied torque, the minimum torque given in Table 5 shall be
exceeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The shanks of the screw shall be clamped in a mating split blindhole die in order that at least
two full threads project above the clamping device, and a length equivalent to one nominal
diameter, exclusive of the point, shall be held within the clamping device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For this breaking torque test, a calibrated torque-measuring instrument shall be used with a
measuring range not exceeding five times the specified minimum value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accuracy of the torque-measuring device shall not be worse than ±7 percent of the minimum
specification value for the screw diameter to be tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1961 and subsequently revised in 1967. As a result of
International agreements arising from the work of ISO/TC 2, the ISO Committee on fasteners,
extensive alterations have come about, which have necessitated a thorough revision with
substantial additions to the 1967 edition. For technical and drafting reasons the standard has
been split up into various parts. The different parts are listed in Part 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers the requirements of stainless steel threaded fasteners and is in conformity with
ISO 3506 - 1979 ‘Corrosion-resistant stainless steel fasteners — Specifications’ issued by the
International Organization for Standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 3.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (May 1991). Side bar indicates modification of
