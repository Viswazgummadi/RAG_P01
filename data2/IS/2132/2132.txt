<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution
on 30 January 1986, after the draft finalized by the
Soil Engineering
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Undisturbed
samples of soil are required for a number of soil test,
such as unconfined compression
test, consolidation
test, permeability test
and triaxial compression test.
It has been recognized that it is not practi-
cable to obtain a truly undistrubed
sample but if certain procedures and
precautions are observed it is possible to get relatively undisturbed
samples
which may be considered sufficient keeping in view the nature of tests to be
performed on these samples. This code deals with the method of obtaining
such samples using thin walled tube samplers with sampler heads (with and
without check valves).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 This standard was first published in 1963 and revised in 1972. In
this revision, requirements
regarding specifications for sampling tubes have
been reviewed based on indigenous availability taking into consideration
the general practice in the country, the sampling tubes have been restricted
to four sizes only.
The detail specification of sampling tubes and sampler
head are covered in separate Indian Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In very loose saturated
sandy and silty, soils and clays the use of a
piston sampler may often be necessary to secure a suitable undisturbed
sample, the details of which are covered in IS : 10108-1982*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS ;2-19607.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This Standard describes the method for obtaining relatively undisturbed
cohesive and C-4
soil samples suitable for laboratory
tests, using a thin-
walled matal tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 For the purpose of this standard, the definitions given in IS  :  2809-1972*
shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. EQUIPMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Drilling Equipment -  The equipment used shall provide a reasonably
clean hole before insertion of the thin-walled tube, shall not disturb the
soil to be sampled, and shall effect a rapid penetration of the tube into the
soil to be sampled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - Where casing is used, the equipment
shall be capable
of driving
and
removing
the casing and shall include a pressure pump for clean-out
operations.
Where drilling fluid is used, a suitable mud pump is required.
Where augers are used
for clean-out purposes no special equipment
other than that for sampling is generally
required.
The hole may be cleaned with a bailer with a flap valve but this should not
be used in sandy soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Sampler Head - It shall conform to IS  :  11594-19857.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Thin-Walled Tubes - It shall conform to IS: 11594-19857.
These may
be of Stainless Steel and Copper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Sealing Material - Any wax that does not have appreciable shrinkage
or does not permit evaporation
of water from the sample shall be permitted.
A mixture of paraffin wax and bees wax in the proportion
4: 1 has also been
found to be suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 Miscellaneous Items - Lables, data sheets shipping containers, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Driving the Casing - Where casing is used it shall not be driven below
the sampling level, and casing pipe should be in such a way that it does
not disturb the soil to be sampled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Cleaning the Hole<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1  The hole shall be cleaned to sampling elevation using whatever
method is preferred
that will ensure that the soil to be sampled is not
disturbed.
In saturated sandy and silty soils the drilling equipment should
be withdrawn slowly to prevent loosening of the soil around the hole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2 Where casing is used, the hole shall be cleaned out to the bottom
or just below the casing. A clean-out auger should be used to clean the
bottom of the hole, when necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3 Bottom discharge bits shall not be permitted for clean-out purposes;
side or upward discharge bits may be permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4 The water level in the hole should be maintained
at or above the
ground water level, especially in soils that might be disturbed by the flow
of ground water into the drill hole such as sandy and silty soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Obtaining Soil Sample<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1  The depth of bottom of the casing, if used, below ground level and
the water level in the bore hole should be noted.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2 Sampling shall be done as soon as possible after the clean-out
operation
and shall not be done after an interval, for example, where a
hole has been cleaned-out and left overnight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>4.3.3 The assembled sampling tube should be lowered to the bottom  of
the hole, and the following information
should be noted.
a><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depth of bottom of bore hole below ground level;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The sampling tube shall then be pushed into the soil by a continu-
ous and rapid motion.
In no case the tube shall be pushed farther than
the length provided for the sample.
About 50 mm shall be allowed for
cuttings and sludge.
A clearance of 10 to 20 mm shall be allowed below
the sampled head in the tube.
also be noted.
The depth of penetration of the tube shall
Before pulling out the tube, at least 5 min shall be allowed
to elapse after pushing the tube after which the tube shall be turned at
least for two revolutions to shear the sample off at the bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - In case the equipment used for SPT is also used for driving the sampling
tube, then the length of penetration
shall be limited to 50 blows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  2132 - 19S6<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.5  Samples shall be taken, by repeating the sampling procedures,
at
every change in stratum or at intervals not more than 1.5 m, whichever is
less.
Samples may be taken at lesser intervals
if specified
or found
necessary.
The intervals be increased to 3 m if in between vane shear test
or SPT is performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.6  Field Observations -  Water-table
information
including
ground
water level, elevations at which the drilling water was lost, or deviations at
which water under excess pressure was encountered should be recorded on
the field logs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Preparation for Shipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1  Upon removal of the sampling tube, the length of the sample in
the tube and the length between the top of the tube and the top of the
sample in the tube shall be measured and recorded.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2 The disturbed
material in the upper end of the tube shall be
completely removed before applying wax for sealing.
The length and type
of the sample so removed should be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.3 The soil at the lower end of the tube shall be reamed to a distance
of about 20 mm. After cleaning both ends shall be sealed with wax applied
in a way that will prevent wax from entering the sample. Wax used for
sealing should not be heated to more than a few degrees above its melting
temperature.
The empty space in the samplers, if any, should be filled
with moist soil, saw dust etc, and the ends covered with tight fitting caps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.4 If it becomes necessary to keep the samples at the site for some
time, they shall be kept  in  the shade.
They should be kept over a bed of
sand, jute bags, saw dust, etc and covered over on top with similar material
( sand, jute bags, saw dust, etc).
The bed and top cover should be kept
moist.
Such bedding and top cover may also be provided at the time of
shipment of the samplers with samples ( see 4.4.3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Labelling and Shipping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1  Labels giving the following information
