<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on
13 February
1989, after the draft finalized
by the Welding
Application
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Structural
and Metals Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published
in 1977, deriving
assistance
from DIN
4099 ( Part 1 )-1972
‘Welding
of
reinforcing
steel -
Requirements
and tests’,
issued by the
Deutsches
Institut
fur Normung and keeping in view the practices prevailing in the conutry at that time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In view of the experience gained over the years
in the welding
of cold-worked
steel bars, the
Committee has revised this standard by effecting the following major modifications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Resistance but welding of cold-worked
bars has been deleted since it is no longer in use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A reference to gas pressure welding of cold-worked
bars has been made.
This technique
although being extensively
used in some foreign countries,
is relatively new and yet to be
commercially
used in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard incorporates
the provisions for the welding of cold-worked
steel bars conforming
to
Grade Fe 415 and Fe 500 of IS 1786  :  1985.
For welding
micro
alloyed
steel bars, a reference
may be made to IS 9595  :  1980 in regard to the provisions relating to carbon
equivalent
establish-
ing welding procedures
and other relevant details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the welding of thermo-mechanically
treated bars, the provisions
would be covered
at a later
date on necessary experience
and data becoming available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provisions for welding of mild steel bars for reinforced
concrete construction
have been covered in
IS 2751  :  1979.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.2.3  If the capacity of butt welding machine
or the available power is not sufficient
to take
the load for welding from cold, welding may be
done after preheating.
By making and breaking
of the contact arc repeatedly,
heat can be made
to spread over the entire
cross section
of the
bar.
The number
of
short-circuits
( contacts
and reversing > should be kept to the minimum
possible so that the welding time and spread
of
heat in the longitudinal
direction
in the bar is
minimum.
Satisfactory
joints with only
slight
reduction in original strength of the bar can be
achieved with a current density up to 25 A/mm’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>operation.
Deviations
from the nominal
value
or large fluctuations
during
the operation
may
lead to gross defects in welding.
Wherever
pos-
sible, welding should be done
during
day time
when the total load on the network
is fairly
balanced.
10.3 Butt-Welding
by
Shielded
Metal
Arc
Welding Process<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.1  General
Butt-welds
by metal arc welding
process
are
normally adopted to join bars of thickness
more
than 20 mm.
10.3.2  Preparation
for
Welding
10.3.2.1
The preparation
of the edges of the
rods shall be as shown in Fig 1. The edges shall
be prepared
by shearing,
machining,
or oxy-
acetylene flame cutting.
Bevelling may be made
by machining,
grinding
oxy-acetylene
cutting.
The fusion faces and the
surrounding
material
shall be free from scale, dirt, greases, paint, rust
and contaminants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.2.4 In automatic
machines,
the flash rate
should be so set that a continuous
flash without
interruption
can be achieved.
If the rate is set,
too high additional
short-circuits
are required
leading to heat spread.
If the rate is too low,
the flash will be interrupted
and consequently
air penetrating
into the joints will form
oxides.
If the machine is hand-operated,
the flash should
be maintained
to avoid interruption.
Too
long
flashes lead to generation
of large quantities
of
heat thus removing the effect of cold-working
in
the bar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.2.2 When it is not possible
to rotate
the
bars for carrying out all welding in flat position,
the edge preparation
shall be such that welding
is done on both sides in the vertical position.
10.3.2.3 All the bars to be butt
welded
should
be aligned and set up in position with their axis
in one straight line.
This may be done in a jig
or by means of a clamp
or by using guides.
Rotation of the bars should
be avoided until
they are adequately
welded
so that no distur-
bance to the alignment is caused and no twist
is
introduced
in the bars during
the process
of
welding.
The joints may not be out of align-
ment by more than 25 percent of the thickness
of the thinner material for material
up to and
including 12 mm thick, or by more
than 3 mm
for thicker material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.2.5 For bars with sheared ends, a burn-off
( flash-off)
length of about 5 to 7 mm is requir-
ed (this length is practically
independent
of the
bar diameter >. Very short
burn-off
lengths
lead to defective welding because all the impuri-
ties may not have been removed from the place
of welding.
Increase
in the
burn-off
length
will spread
heat along
the length
of the bar
thus reducing the strength of the bar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.2.6 The up-setting should
result
from
the
burning
off, that is, without interruption
in the
rain of sparks.
The
electric
supply
should be
switched off about l/3 to 1 second after the start
of the up-setting
or in the case of automatic
machine after 1 to 3 mm of up-set travel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.4.2 In the case of non-rotatable
bars, the
beads 1 to 4 should be made as explained
in
10.3.4.1.
The welder then moves to the other
side and beads 5 to 7 are similarly
made.
It is
difficult to deposit a uniform
top bead for non-
rotatable bars and it may be necessary to make
two or more separate
annular runs so that the
joint
is approximately
axisymmetric
and
has
sufficient reinforcement
as shown in Fig. 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>recommended
for
better
results
depending
on the size of the bar to be welded.
Storage
of
the latter
type
and their
drying
immediately
prior to use must be strictly in accordance
with
the recommendation
of the electrode
manufac-
turer.
10.3.3.2 The size of electrodes depends upon the
position of the bead and thickness of the bar to
be welded.
The root
runs should
be made
with electrodes of size not exceeding
2’5 mm.
For successive beads, the size of the electrodes
should be progressively
increased so that in the
top bead, the electrode size does not generally
exceed 3’15 mm for 20 mm bars and 5 mm for
40 mm bars.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4  Butt
Welding
by
Gas Pressure
Welding
Process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.4.1
Gas pressure welding
is basically
a hot
forging process of joining the two bars end to
end.
The bar ends are heated by a multi-nozzle
burner using oxy-acetylene
flame and fused by
forcing
the two bar ends against
each other
under pressure to effect a solid phase
welded
joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.3.3 Concentration
of heat shall be avoided
by proper welding sequence and manipulation
of
electrodes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.4  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.4.2 Recommendations
in regard
to the pre-
paration
for welding procedure
and equipment
are given in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.4.1 The sequence of welding beads is shown
in Fig. 2.
The runs
1 to  4  are made in the
position of welding best suited for the quality
of the weld.
Besides the interruption
in weld-
ing required for cleaning of each bead, a pause
shall be made after every
second
bead and the
bar is allowed to cool.
The temperature
of the
bars at a distance
of about
one bar diameter
from the joints shall not exceed 300°C immedia-
tely after the bead is made.
Before commencing
the next bead, the temperature
shall not exceed
250°C. The temperature
may be checked approxi-
mately
by using temperature
indicating
cray-
ons.
However, in the absence
of temperature
indicating devices, the bar may be allowed to
cool down to handhot
temperature
before
the
next bead is deposited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5  Lap Weldiug
of Cold-Worked
Bars<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.5.1
General
Lap joints may be made in cold-worked
bars of
all sizes.
They are preferred
when
access for
welding is from one side only,
and while con-
necting prefabricated
units.
Use of electrodes
with flux covering
of Type
3 or Type
6 of
IS 815  :  1974 are recommended
for better results
depending
on the size of bar being
welded.
Storage of the latter type and their
drying
im-
mediately
prior to use must be strictly in accor-
dance with the recommendations
of the electrode
manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After completing
bead 4, the bars are turned
through 180” and the beads 5 to 7 are made in
the same manner as described
above.
The top
bead 8 is deposited as the joint
is continuously
rotated and the size of the reinforcement
should
be approximately
as indicated in Fig.  2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5.2  Preparation for Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Edge preparation
is not necessary for lap welds.
The joint
faces and the surrounding
material
shall be free from scale, dirt, grease, paint,
rust
and contaminants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>core, and (d) a variable flux linkage transformer.
Being essentially
a single-phase
load,
welding
transformers
when connected to 3-phase
supply
mains may cause slightly unbalanced
load condi-
tions.
Condensers of adequate rating may also
be connected across the input lines for improv-
ing the power factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-l GENERAL
B-l.1  The methods
of welding
covered
in this
annex are:
a) Flash butt welding, and
b) Shielded metal arc welding
with covered
electrodes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.1.1.2  Rotary
machines,
such
as,
motor
generators suitable for use on alternating-current
mains give a direct current output of the requir-
ed characteristics.
They have the
advantage-
that they impose
a balanced
load
on 3-phase
supply mains. They are, however, initially more
expensive
and require
more
maintenance
than
transformers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2 FLASH BUTT WELDING
EQUIPMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.1 The efficiency
of the flash butt welding
equipment, manifested by its corrjunctive efftcien-
cy for cold-worked
steels should
be
about
8 kVA/cm” of the cross sectional are2 of the bar
in order that sufficient cold weld may be accom-
plished.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.1.2 Where the mains supply is direct current,
a motor
generator
designed
for direct current
mains use has to be selected.
B-3.1.3 Rectifier welding sets which are relative-
ly high in initial cost, require
very
little
main-
tenance because of elimination
of most moving
parts.
They also impose
a balanced
load on
3-phase supply. mains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.2 The jaws for clamping
the  bars  should
preferably
be long and pin shaped
in order
to
assume  2  rectilinear central
feeding
of the bar
ends.
The joint should preferably
be of copper
to assume a smooth and uniform flow of current
from the jaws into the bar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.1.4 For work at sites where mains

Such
machines are often mounted on trailers for easy
pormbility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

There is little to choose
between
them
for work involving mild steel welding.
Electri-
