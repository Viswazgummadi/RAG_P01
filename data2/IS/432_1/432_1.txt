<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian

( Part I ) ( Third

Institution
on 31 March
15’82, after the draft finalized
by the Joint
Sectional

had
been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council
and
the Structural

Division

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
was
first published
in 1953 and subsequently
revised
in 1960 and 1966.
The
present revision
hay been taken up with
a view
to modifying
the
earlier
provisions
in the light of the experience
gained
during
the use of this standard
by both manufacturers
and
users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard
adopts
SI

in specifying
the
various
physical
requirements.
Further,
some of the provisions
have been revised

such
as IS  :  22G-ltr75*,
IS  :  961-1975t,

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Elongation
-
Increase
in length
of a tensile test piece under
.stress.
The elongation
at fracture
is conventionally
expressed
as a percentage
of
the original
gauge
len-,th of a standard
test piece.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5
Nominal
Size -
The
nominal
size of a bar shall be the
dimension
of the diameter
of round bars and side of square
bars.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Parcel -
Any quantity
of bars whether

Yield
Stress
-
Stress
( that
is, load per unit cross-sectional
area )
at which elongation
first occurs
in the test
piece
without
increasing
the
load during
tcn;ile
test.
In the case of steels with no such definite yield
point, the yield stress is the stress under the prescribed
testing
conditions
at \v!lich
the
ohserv-ed increase
in the gauge length
is l/200 of the gauge
length
when the rate
at
which
the
load
applied
is not
more
than
5
N/mm’js
when approaching
the yield stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
