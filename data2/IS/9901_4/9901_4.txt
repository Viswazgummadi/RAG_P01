SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
( Part IV ) specifies field methods
for measuring the
airborne
sound insulation
properties
of interior walls, floors land doors
between two rooms under diffuse sound field conditions in both rooms and
for determining the protection against sound afforded to the occupants of the
building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose
of this standard, the terms and definitions given in
IS  :  1885 ( Part III/Set 8 )-I9747 shall apply in addition to the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Average Sound Pressure Level in a Room -Ten
times the common
logarithm of the ratio of the space and time average of the sound pressure
squared to the square of the reference sound pressure, the space average
being taken over the entire room with the exception of those parts where the
direct radiation of a sound source or the near field of the boundaries
( wall,

takes into account
that is dwellings
the reverberation
time -has been
found
to
be - nearly
independent
of the volume and of frequency equal to 0.5 s.
With this
standardizing?
D,,T  is dependent
on the direction
of the sound transmission
if the two
rooms have drfferent volumes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>L<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The standardizing
of the level difference to the reverberation
time in the
receiving
room
of To = 0.5 s is equivalent to standardizing
the level difference with
respect to an equivalent absorption
area of:
A0 = 0.32 V<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
A, is the equivalent
absorption
area, in square metres;
V is the volume of the receiving room, in cubic metres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Apparent Sound Reduction Index  :  Appareot Transmission  Lass-Ten
times the common logarithm of the ratio of the sound power  WI  incident on
a partition
under test to the total sound power  W,  transmitted
into the
receiving room.
This quantity is denoted by  R’ :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R’ =  10 log,, w w1 dB
3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, the sound power transmitted into the receiving room consists
of the sum of the following components:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>WDd
which has entered the partition directly but is radiated from it
directly;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>WDf
which has entered
the partition
directly but is radiated from
flanking constructions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>WFd
which has entered flanking constructions and is radiated
from
the partition directly;<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>WFf
which has entered flanking corrstructions and is radiated from
blanking constructions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F$&ak which has been transmitted (as airborne sound ) through leaks,
ventilation ducts, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under the assumption
of diffuse fields in the two rooms, the apparent
reduction index may be evaluated from the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R’ =  L1 -
L, +  lo  log,,
A  ?- dB
. . . . . . .  ,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S is the area of the test specimen, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A is the equivalent absorption area in the receiving room.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of a door in a wall, S is the area of the free opening in which
the door including the frame is mounted.
It must be proved that the sound
transmission through the rest of the wall is negligible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>In the case of staggered
rooms, S is that part of the area of the
partition common to both rooms. If, however, the common area is less than
10 ma, the measurement results cannot be expressed as  R’.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
In the apparent sound reduction index, the sound power transmitted
into
the receiving
room
is related
to the sound power incident on the common partition
irrespective
of actual conditions
of transmission.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The parent sound reduction index is independent
of the measuring direction between
the rooms if the sound fields are diffuse in both rooms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9901( Part IV) - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
When determining
the sound insulation
properties
of a building
element,
the apparent
reduction
index is used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

TEST ARRANGEMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  For the test arrangement
to be used in the field, it is not possible to
standardize the area of the test specimen and the volume and shape of the
rooms.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Measurements
between empty rooms with equal dimensions
should
preferably be made with diffusers in each room.
Diffusing elements shall be
sufficiently isolated from the building, for example, by placing them on pads
of resilient material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.
TEST PROCEDURE AND EVALUATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Generation of Sound Field in the Source Room<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  The sound generated in the source room should be steady and have
a continuous spectrum in the frequency range considered.
Filters with the
bandwidth of at least one third-octave may be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2 If the sound source contains more than one loudspeaker
operating
simultaneously,
the loudspeaker
shall be contained in one enclosure, the
maximum dimension of which shall not exceed 0.7 m.
The loudspeakers
should be driven in phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3 The loudspeaker enclosure shall be so placed as to give a sound field
as diffuse as possible and at such a distance from the test specimen that the
direct radiation upon it is not dominant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Measurement of the  Average Sound  Pressure Level<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1 The average sound pressure level may be obtained
by using a
number of fixed microphone positions or a continuously moving microphone
with an integration of  P2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 When  in any frequency
band the sound pressure level in the receiving
room in less than 10 dB above the background
level, the background
level
shall be measured just before and after the determination of sound pressure
level due to the sound source and a correction as given in the Table 1 shall
be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3 The above corrections,
if -any, are to be made to the individual
readings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  Frequency Range of Measurements<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1  The sound pressure level should be measured using third-octave
or
octave band filters.
The discrimination characteristics of the filters shall be
in accordance with IS  : 6964-1973*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2 Third-octave
band
filters having at least the following
centre
frequencies shall be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>100,  125, 160, 200, 250, 315, 400, 500, 630, 800, 1 000, 1 250, 1 600,
2 000,2 500 and 3 150  Hz.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
Use of lower
frequency
is dependent
on the distribution
of natural
frequency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The~minimum reverberation times for the empty room  are adjusted to a
volume
180 m3.
For other volumes,
these times shall be multiplied by the factor
( V/180 )ljs ( V being the volume of the room expressed in cubic
metres )  except at
high frequencies,
where the air~absorption is the predominant factor influencing the
decay rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.3 If octave band filters are used, as a minimum the series beginning
with centre frequency 125 Hz and ending at 2 000 Hz should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.1  The
correction
term of equation
(6)  containing
the equivalent
absorption
area may be preferably evaluated from the reverberation
time
measured
according
to  IS : 82251976*
and evaluated

<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A is the equivalent absorption area, in square metres;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V is the receiving room volume, in cubic metres; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>T  is the reverberation time, in seconds.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.2 The alternative method of taking the equivalent absorption area into
account is to measure the average sound pressure level produced
by a
sufficiently stable sound source the power output of which is known.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the test specimen ( but not directed at -it ) such that with 6 microphone
positions randomly distributed throughout
each room 3 can have readings
taken for each loudspeaker position using an averaging time of 5 s in each
frequency band at each position.
The loudspeaker is fed with white noise in
one third-octave band.
In the microphone
channel one third-octave
band
filter is used as well.
No microphone position shall be nearer than 0.5 m to
the room boundaries or diffusers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.3  As an alternative, the sound field .sampling procedure can be carried
out using a rotating microphone device, having a minimum sweep radius of
O-7 m.
In this case, the plane of the traverse is inclined in relation to the
room boundaries and the device shall have an averaging time equal to the
traverse time, which shall be a minimum of 30 s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>MEASUREMENT
OF FLANKING
TRANSMISSION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-l. If  the flanking transmission has to be investigated, this may be done in
either of the following ways.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.1  By covering the specimen on both sides by additional
flexible layers,
for example 13 mm gypsum board on a separate frame at a distance which
gives a resonance frequency of the~system of layer and ~airspace well below
the frequency
range of interest.
The airspace should contain
absorbing
material.
With this measurement WDd,  WFd  and  WDf  are suppressed, and
the measured apparent reduction index is determined by  WFf.  Additional
flexible layers, over particular flanking surfaces, may permit identilication of
the major paths.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.2 By measuring the average velocity levels of the specimen and the
flanking surfaces in the receiving room.
The average surface velocity level
LV  of the specimen in decibels is 10 times the common logarithm
of the
ratio of the average of the mean square normal surface velocity of the speci-
men to the square of the reference velocity:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The vibration transducer used shall be well attached to the surface and
its mass impedance
shall be sticiently
low compared
with the point
impedance of the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the critical frequency of the specimen or the flanking objects is low
compared with the frequency range of interest, the power wk radiated from
a ~particular element  k  with area Sk in the receiving room may be estimated
from the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>+k is the spatial average of the mean square of the normal surface
velocity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>crk  is the radiation
efficiency, a pure number of about 1 above the
critical frequency; and<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>PC
is the characteristic impedance of air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the power radiated from the flanking constructions
is determined in
this way, the measurement can be used to calculate, for instance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>CHECKING THE LOSS FACTOR qtotal OF THE PARTITION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-l.  For the frequency region above the critical frequency, the total loss
factor of the partition is important for its sound reduction index.
The total
loss factor is influenced by the boundary conditions and may be checked
by measuring
the reverberation
time of the partition
as a function
of
frequency.
The partition
should then be excited by a shaker driven by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
