<<PARAGRAPH>>Irrigation Canals and Canal Linings Sectional Committee, RVD 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Irrigation Canals and Canal Linings Sectional Committee had been
approved by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lining of canals is considered as an important feature of irrigation projects as it not only
minimises the loss of water due to seepage, but also results in achieving considerable economy in
the use of cultivable land which would otherwise be prone to water-logging due to rise in water
table. Further, the water thus saved can be usefully employed for the extension and improvement
of irrigation facility. Lining of water courses in the area irrigated by tubewells assumed special
significance as the pumped water supplied is relatively more costly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Further, lining of canals permits the adoption of high velocities resulting in proportionate savings
of the cross-sectional areas of the canal and land width required with corresponding saving in the
cost of excavation and masonry works which in certain cases may offset completely the extra cost
of lining. Also, the lining improves stability of channel sections thereby reducing the
maintenance/cost. The benefits that accrue from lining of canals generally justify the initial capital
cost and because of this, there is now better appreciation of the need for lining of canals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Judicious selection of serviceable and economical lining at the first instance and subsequently
proper execution of the work while in laying the canal lining contributes considerably in achieving
overall economy in the project. Guidance with regard to the selection of canal lining for any
particular canal is given in a separate standard IS 10430 : 1982 ‘Criteria for Design of lined canals
and guidance for selection of type of lining’. One of the methods of cement concrete lining is by
using precast cement concrete tiles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been formulated to cover specification of precast cement concrete tile which are
compressed mechanically at the time of manufacture so as to achieve higher strength stipulated in
this standard. This standard was issued in 1983. The revision covers additional sizes besides
incorporating strength requirements and method of test thus covering requirement of
IS 3860 : 1960 ‘Specification for precast cement concrete slabs for canal lining’ and IS 4969 : 1968
‘Method of test for determining flexural strength of precast cement concrete slabs for canal lining’
(except of non-provision of bevelled sides type, with tongue and groove arrangement which are not
used due to breakage in handling).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.2 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (June 1992) and Amendment No. 2
(September 2000). Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of the
amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>TEST FOR FLEXURAL STRENGTH OF MANUFACTURED TILE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2  The specimen shall be placed horizon-
tally on roller bearers 150 mm apart with their
length parallel to bearers. The load shall be
applied at mid-stand by means of steel bar
parallel to the bearers. The length of the
bearers and that of the loading bar shall be
longer than the length of the specimen and
their contact shall be rounded to a diameter of
25 mm. A plywood packing 3 mm thick and
25 mm wide shall be placed between the
specimen and the bearers and between the
specimen and the loading bar. The loading bar
and the bearers shall be self-aligning (  see
Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-1 SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-1.1  For ascertaining the conformity to the
requirements for flexural strength test, one tile
from each lot of 500 shall be selected at random
and tested.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.2  Lot shall be considered conforming to the
requirements of the flexural strength test if the
sample passes the requirements of the test. In
case it fails to satisfy the requirements of the
test, two more tiles shall be selected at random
from the same lot and tested for the
requirements of flexural strength. If any of
these two tested fails to satisfy the strength
requirements the lot shall be rejected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.3  Starting from zero, the load shall be
increased steadily and uniformly at a rate not
exceeding 2 kg/cm length (measured along with
the bearers) per minute up to the load specified
in  7 , which shall be maintained for at least 1
minute. There shall not be any visual crack in
the tile.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2 TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.1  The specimen shall be immersed in
potable water for 24 hours and then taken out
and wiped dry.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of the Standard Mark is governed by the provisions of the  Bureau of Indian
Standards Act, 1986  and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder. The Standard Mark on
products covered by an Indian Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply with the requirements of that standard under a well defined system of inspection,
testing and quality control which is devised and supervised by BIS and operated by the
producer. Standard marked products are also continuously checked by BIS for conformity to
that standard as a further safeguard. Details of conditions under which a licence for the use of
the Standard Mark may be granted to manufacturers or producers may be obtained from the
