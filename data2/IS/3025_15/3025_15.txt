<<PARAGRAPH>>(Incorporating Amendment No. 1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. Scope  — Prescribes a gravimetric method for the determination of total residue. This method is
applicable to all types of water and waste water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Principle  — The sample is evaporated in a weighed dish on a steam-bath and is dried to a
constant mass in an oven either at 103-105°C or 179-181°C. Total residue is calculated from increase
in mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Note  — In general, by evaporating and drying water samples at 179-181°C values are obtained which conform more
closely to those obtained by summation of individually determined mineral salts.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. Interferences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Highly mineralized waters containing significant concentration of calcium, magnesium, chloride
and/or sulphate may be hygroscopic. These may require prolonged drying, desiccation and rapid
weighing. However, prolonged drying may also cause loss of constituents, particularly nitrates and
chlorides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  A large amount of residue in the evaporating basin may crust over and entrap water preventing
its evaporation during drying. For this reason, the volume of the sample should be adjusted so that
the residue left after drying should be about 100 to 200 mg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Evaporating Dish  — of 90 mm diameter, 100 ml capacity made of platinum, nickel, porcelain,
silica or borosilicate glass. Platinum is suitable for all tests. Nickel is satisfactory if residue is not to
be ignited. Porcelain, silica and glass may be used for samples with a  p H value less than 9.0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Steam-Bath
4.3  Drying Oven  — drying oven with thermostatic control for maintaining temperature up to
180 ± 2°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  D esiccator  — Provided with a colour indicating desiccant.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Analytical Balance  — 200 g capacity and capable of weighing to nearest 0.1 mg.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6  Magnetic stirrer with teflon coated stirring bars.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Sample Handling and Preservation  — Preservation of the samples is not practical. Analysis
should begin as soon as possible. Refrigeration or chilling to 4°C, to minimize microbiological
decomposition of solids is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Heat the clean evaporating dish to 180°C for 1 hour. Cool, desiccate, weigh and store in desiccator
until ready for use.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Select volume of the sample which has residue between 25 and 250 mg, preferably between 100
and 200 mg. This volume may be estimated from values of specific conductance. To obtain a
measurable residue; if necessary, add successive sample portion to the same dish after evaporation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Stir volume of sample with a magnetic stirrer or shake it vigorously. Pipette this volume to a
weighed evaporating dish placed on a steam-bath. Evaporation may also be performed in a drying
oven. The temperature should be lowered to approximately 98°C to prevent boiling and splattering of
the sample. After complete evaporation of water from the residue, transfer the dish to an oven at<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

weighings is less than 0.5 mg. Drying for a long duration (usually 1 to 2 hours) is done to eliminate
necessity of checking for constant mass. The time for drying to constant mass with a given type of
sample when a number of samples of nearly same type are to be analysed should be determined by
trial.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Weigh the dish as soon as it has cooled avoiding residue to stay for long time as some residues
are hygroscopic and may absorb water from desiccant which may not be absolutely dry.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. Calculation  — Calculate the total residue using the following equation:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Total residue, mg/l

<<PARAGRAPH>>where
M  = mass in mg of total residue, and
V  = volume in ml of the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. Report  — Report in whole numbers for less than 100 mg/l and above 100 mg/l to three
significant figures. Report the temperature of determination also.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. Precision and Accuracy  — The precision of the mathod is about 5 percent. Accuracy cannot
be estimated for total residue as determined by this method as it is a quantity defined by the
procedure followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Total residue is the term applied to the material left in the vessel after evaporation of a sample
of water and its subsequent drying in an oven at a definite temperature. Total residue includes
non-filterable residue (the portion of the total residue retained by a filter), and filterable residue
(the portion of the total residue which passes through the filter).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
