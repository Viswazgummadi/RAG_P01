This method is\napplicable to all types of water and waste water.\n2.Principle \u2014 The sample is evaporated in a weighed dish on a steam-bath and is dried to a\nconstant mass in an oven either at 103-105\u00b0C or 179-181\u00b0C. Total residue is calculated from increase\nin mass.\nNote \u2014 In general, by evaporating and drying water samples at 179-181\u00b0C values are obtained which conform more\nclosely to those obtained by summation of individually determined mineral salts.\n3. Interferences\n3.1Highly mineralized waters containing significant concentration of calcium, magnesium, chloride\nand/or sulphate may be hygroscopic. These may require prolonged drying, desiccation and rapid\nweighing. However, prolonged drying may also cause loss of constituents, particularly nitrates and\nchlorides.\n3.2A large amount of residue in the evaporating basin may crust over and entrap water preventing\nits evaporation during drying. For this reason, the volume of the sample should be adjusted so that\nthe residue left after drying should be about 100 to 200mg.\n4. Apparatus\n4.1Evaporating Dish \u2014 of 90mm diameter, 100ml capacity made of platinum, nickel, porcelain,\nsilica or borosilicate glass. Platinum is suitable for all tests. Nickel is satisfactory if residue is not to\nbe ignited. Porcelain, silica and glass may be used for samples with a pH value less than 9.0.\n4.2Steam-Bath\n4.3Drying Oven \u2014 drying oven with thermostatic control for maintaining temperature up to\n180\u00b12\u00b0C.\n4.4Desiccator \u2014 Provided with a colour indicating desiccant.\n4.5Analytical Balance \u2014 200g capacity and capable of weighing to nearest 0.1mg.\n4.6Magnetic stirrer with teflon coated stirring bars.\n5.Sample Handling and Preservation \u2014 Preservation of the samples is not practical. Analysis\nshould begin as soon as possible. Refrigeration or chilling to 4\u00b0C, to minimize microbiological\ndecomposition of solids is recommended.\n6. Procedure\n6.1Heat the clean evaporating dish to 180\u00b0C for 1hour. Cool, desiccate, weigh and store in desiccator\nuntil ready for use.\n6.2Select volume of the sample which has residue between 25 and 250mg, preferably between 100\nand 200mg. This volume may be estimated from values of specific conductance. To obtain a\nmeasurable residue; if necessary, add successive sample portion to the same dish after evaporation.\n6.3Stir volume of sample with a magnetic stirrer or shake it vigorously. Pipette this volume to a\nweighed evaporating dish placed on a steam-bath. Evaporation may also be performed in a drying\noven. The temperature should be lowered to approximately 98\u00b0C to prevent boiling and splattering of\nthe sample. After complete evaporation of water from the residue, transfer the dish to an oven at",
