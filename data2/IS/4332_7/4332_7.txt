FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
(  Part VII)
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 16 February
1973, after
the
draft
finalized
by
the Soil
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Soil
stabilization
is the chemical
or mechanical
treatment
designed
to increase
or maintain
the
stability
of mass of soil
or otherwise
to
improve
its engineering
properties.
There
are several
methods
of stabi-
lization
and
these
may
be broadly
classified
on the basis of treatment
given
to the soil (for
example,
dewatering
and
compaction
),  process
involved
( for example,
thermal
and
electrical
), and
additives
employed
( for example,
asphalt
and cement).
The choice
of a particular
method
depends
on the characteristics
of the problem
on hand and
on the nature
of soil type encountered.
For studying
in the laboratory,
the methods
and
effects of stabilization,
certain
standard
methods
of test for the evaluation
of properiies
of stabilized
soils and
their
analysis
are
required.
The
required
standards
on methods
of test for stabilized
soils are being
pub-
lished in parts and this part lays down the method
of test for determining
cement
content
of cement
stabilized
soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and
practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.
