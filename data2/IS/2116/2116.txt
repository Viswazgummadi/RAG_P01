FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 September
1980, after the draft
finalized
by
the
Building
Construction
Practices
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
was first published
in 1965.
The
revision
has been
prepared
in the light
of experience
gained
in the use of the
standard
during
course of these years.:
A number
of modifications
in the provisions
of the standard
have been
made,
important
among
which
is the particle
size grading
of sand for masonry
work.
The grading
has been made more
practicable
by specifying
only
one limit
of grading
for both
reinforced
and unreinforced
masonry
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 The performance
of masonry
mortars
is characterised
by properties
like strength,
volume change,
water retentivity,
workability,
etc. The role of
sand in the mortar
is to obtain
these properties
in the mortar
to the
best
extent as would be possible with the amount
of binder
materials,
such as
cement,
lime, etc, that are used in the mortar.
It is not widely
apprecia-
ted that sand for use in masonry
mortar
has got certain
essential
require-
ments
to satisfy,
namely,
freedom
from
detrimental
impurities
and
particle
size distribution
within
specific limits of grading.
Quite often sand
is specified
naming
the localities
from which
it should
be procured
and
probably
it is the experience
in many
places that sands
so available
give
satisfactory
performance
in normal
construction
work.
While it would not
be practicable
often to change
existing
practice
completely,
there
is room
for improvement
in the light
of research
and
some
of the basic require-
ments
for sand
to serve
as an
ingredient
in masonry
mortar
can be
specified,
by choosing,
if need
be, better
sources
of supply
and also by
proper
blending
of sands from different
sources.
This
standard
specifies
the basic requirements
for sand for use in masonry
mortars.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3  In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been
given
to
co-ordination
among
the standards
and
practices
prevailing
in different<<HEADING_END>>

to relating
it to the practices
in this field in
the country.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4 This standard contains clause 7 which requires the supplier to furnish
some  technical information at the request of the purchaser.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of &ciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied x’X1, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS  :  Z-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of ‘the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the requirements of naturally occurring sands,
crushed stone sands and crushed gravel sands used in mortars
for
construction of masonry.
.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard, the following definitions shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Sand -
A fine aggregate which is either natural
sand or crushed
stone sand or crushed gravel sand.
2.2  Natural
Sand -  A fine aggregate produced by the natural disinte-
gration
of rock and which has been deposited by streams or glacial
agencies.
2.3  Crushed
Stone Sand and Crushed
Gravel
Sand -
A fine aggre-
gate produced by crushing stone  or  natural gravel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  QUALITY
OF SAND<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 General
-  The sand shall consist of natural sand, crushed stone sand
or crushed gravel sand or a combination of any of these.
The sand shall
be hard, durable, clean and free from adherent
coatings
and organic
matter and shall not contain the amount of clay, silt and fine dust more
than specified under 3.3 (a).
3.2  Deleterious
Material
-
The sand shall not contain
any harmful
impurities
such
as iron
pyrites, alkalis, salts, coal or other organic
impurities, mica, shale or similar laminated materials, soft fragments, sea
shells in such form or in such quantities as to affect adverseIy the harden-
ing, strength or durability of the mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Limits
of Deleterious
Material
-
Unless found satisfactory as a
result of further tests as may be specified by the engineer-in-charge,
or
unless evidence of such performance is offered which is satisfactory to  him,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
