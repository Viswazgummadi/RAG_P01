<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part I ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 22 March 1973, after the draft finalized by the Building Limes
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Hitherto,
methods of tests for assessing qualitative
requirements
of
building limes were included in IS  :  712-1964.
For facilitating the use of
these tests it has been decided to print these tests as different parts of a
separate
Indian
Standard.
This pa.? _covers determination
of chemical
properties of building limes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this
standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it
shall be done in accordance with IS : 2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
