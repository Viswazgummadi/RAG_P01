<<PARAGRAPH>>3.  Subrack
Description
-  For the purpose of this standard a typical subrack comprises horizontal
members, secured between two side plates as shown in Fig. 2.
The side plates have right-angled
flanges equivalent
to the extremities
of the panels shown in IS  : 9606-I
980.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Subrack
Basic
Dimensions
-
Subrack basic dimensions
are given in Fig. 2.
The following
notes and Table 1 are to be read with Fig. 2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Note
1 -  81 x 5.08 ( mm ) is permissible
for case mounting
or for  uss  with telescopic
slides.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note
2 -
In designing
to this dimension,
it should
be noted that the distance
between
rack uprights
specified
in IS  : 9606-1980
is 450 mm minimum.
Earlier racks could
have an aperture
of 447 mm minimum
as specified
in IS  ; 9606-
1980.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The guidance
dimension
Hg
shall
be derived
from the printed
board height Hb according
to 3 of
IS  :  11719  (  Part 2/Set
2 )-I986
‘Dimensions
of mechanical
structures
of the 482.6 mm series:
Fart 2 Subracks
and
associated
plug-in

Section
2 Plug-in
units’.
Adequate
engagement
and
interchangeability
shall
be maintained
between
plug-in
units and guide rails.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note
5 -
The position
of the centreline
of the first printed
board will depend
on the
connector
chosen.
The
preferred
dimensions
of A is 3.27 mm unless found to be impracticable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note
6 -
Side plates may be extended
by 60 mm beyond
the
rear attachment
plane.
The
rear edge
of a
non-extended
side plate need not coincide
with the rear attachment
plane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Note
7 -DC
and C dimensions
and tolerances
are dependent
on the
chosen
connector

<<PARAGRAPH>>Note
8 -The
detail
shown
in item Z for recessed
panels
is preferred
for future
designs.
Item Y shown
in
Fig. 1 of IS : 11719 ( Part P/&c
2 )-I986
should
be consrdered
when designing
the horizontal
members.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note
9 -The
range
of four
depths
stated
are those which
are preferred.
If necessary
manufacturers
can
increase
the depth In increments
of 60 mm.  Ds
is a preferred
dimension
for the depth of subracks when subracks
are supplied
without
mounting
brackets
for PB-connectors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note  10 -
The manufacturers
of subracks
shall define the fastening
dimensions
and tolerances
so that they
are compatible
with the dimensions
of the plug-in
units given
in Fig. 1 and 2 of IS : 11719
( Part 2/Set
2 )-I986
such that interchangeability
is guaranteed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
