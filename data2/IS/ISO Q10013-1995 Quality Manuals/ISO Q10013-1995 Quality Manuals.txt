Foreword
(This foreword is not part of American National Standard ANSI/ISO/ASQC Q10013-1995, Guidelines for Developing
Quality Manuals.)
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies ISO mem-
ber bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each
member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented
on that committee. International organizations, governmental and nongovernmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in
the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of elec-
trotechnical standardization.
Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publi-
cation as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the member bodies casting a vote.
International Standard ISO 10013 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 176, Quality management and quality
assurance, Subcommittee SC 3, Supporting technologies.
The United States Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to ISO/TC 176 is active in all activities of this committee. It seeks to en-
sure that all standards written by ISO/TC 176 are consistent with U.S. interests. This is done by representative membership
on the U.S. TAG, by circulating drafts of proposed standards widely in the United States for comment, and by ensuring that
these comments are considered by the appropriate ISO/TC 176 working group. By these means, most new or revised Inter-
national Standards can be adopted readily as American National Standards. Although there are editorial changes to incorpo-
rate American language usage and spelling, the American National Standards are equivalent to the corresponding ISO Stan-
dards. To demonstrate this equivalence, the numerical designation of the American National Standards is the same numerical
designation as the corresponding International Standard with a prefix such a Q, in this case Q10013.
Annexes A, B, C, and D of this American National Standard are for information only.
Comments concerning this standard are welcome and will be considered in future standards development and revision.
They should be sent to the Standards Administrator, American Society for Quality Control, 611 East Wisconsin Avenue,

<<HEADING level=1>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  IS0  9000  family  of  International Standards includes requirements for quality systems which can be used to achieve
common interpretation, development, implementation, and application of quality management and quality assurance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The IS0  9000  family  of  Internationai Standards requires the development and implementation  of  documented quaiity  sys-
tems, including the preparation  of  quality manuals.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ANSMSOJASQC A8402-1994,  Quality Management and Quality Assurance-Vocabulary,
defines a quality manual  as  a
document stating the quality policy and describing the quality system of  an  organization.  This  may relate to an organiza-
tion‚Äôs  total  activities or to  a  selected part  of  those activities; for example, specified requirements depending upon the nature
of  products  or  services, processes, contractual requirements, governing regulations, or the organization itself.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important that the requirements and content  of  the quality system and quality manual address the quality standard they
are intended to satisfy.  This  American National Standard provides guidelines  for  developing such quality manuals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Documented  quality  system  procedures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This  American National Standard provides guidelines for
the development, preparation, and control of quality man-
uals tailored to the specific needs of the user. The resultant
quality manuals will reflect documented quality system
procedures required by the  IS0  9000 family of interna-
tional Standards. Detailed work instructions, quality plans,
brochures and other quaiity systems related documents are
not covered by  this  American National Standard.  (See  an-
nex A, level  C.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Documented quality system procedures should form the
basic documentation used for the overall planning and ad-
ministration  of  activities which impact  on  quality.  in  ac-
cordance with the  IS0  9000  family, these documented
procedures should cover all the applicable elements of the
quality system standard. They should describe (to the de-
gree  of  detail required for adequate control of the activities
concerned) the responsibilities, authorities, and interrela-
tionships of the personnel who manage, perform, verify, or
review work af√≠ecting quality, how the different activities
are to  be  performed, the documentation to be used, and the
controls to  be  applied.  (See  annex A.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  1  This  American National Standard may be used
to develop quality manuals relating to quality system stan-
dards other than the  IS0  9000 family.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1  proceduralscope<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 NORMATIVEREFERENCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each documented procedure should cover a logically sep
arable part of the quality system, such  as  a complete qual-
ity system element or part thereof, or a sequence of inter-
related activities connected with more than one quality
system element. The quantity  of  documented procedures,
the volume of each, and the nature of their format and pre-
sentation are to be determined by the user of  this  American
National  Standar4  each usually reflects the complexity of
the facility, organization, and nature of business. Docu-
mented quality system procedures should not,  as  a rule,
enter into purely technical details of the type normally
documented in detailed work instructions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following standard contains provisions which,
through reference in  this  text, constitute provisions of this
American National Standard. At the time of publication,
the edition indicated was valid. All standards are subject
to revision, and parties to agreements based on  this  Amer-
ican National Standard  are  encouraged to investigate the
possibility of applying the most recent edition of the stan-
dard indicated below. The American National Standards
Institute and members of IEC and IS0 maintain registers
of currently valid American National Standards and Inter-
national Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.2  Consistent  approach<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>By arranging each documented procedure in the same
structure and format, the users will become familiar with
the consistent approach applied to each requirement and
so  improve the likelihood of systematic compliance with
the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  DEFINITIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of  this  American National Standard, the
definitions given in ANSVISOASQC A8402-1994 apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 DOCUMENTATION  OF  QUALITY SYSTEMS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Quaiitymanuais<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex A describes a typical quality system documentation
hierarchy. The order  of  development of  this  hierarchy  in  an
individual organization  is  dependent on that organization's
circumstances, but usually  starts  with development of the
organization's quality policy and objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A quality  manual  should consist of,  or  refer to, the docu-
mented quality system pnxedures intended  for  the overaU
planning and administration of activities which impact on
quality within an organization. A quality manual should<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>cover  ail  the applicable elements of the quality system  stan-
dard required for an organization. It should describe,  in  ade-
quate detail, the same control aspects mentioned  in  subclause
4.1.  In  some situations, the related documented quality sys-
tem procedures and  some  sections of the quality  manual  may
be identical. However, some degree of tailoring is usuaUy  re-
quired  to  ensure that only approfiate documented  proce-
dures (or sections them0 are selected for the specific pur-
poses  of the quality  manual  being developed. The contents of
quaiity manuals  are  addressed  in  detail  in  clause  7.  Docu-
mented procedures relate√∫  to  the quality system, not dealt
with  in  the selected quality system  standad  but necessary for
the adeqm control of the activities, should  be  added  to  the
quality  manual  or  be  referenced  as  necessary.  (See  annex  B.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the methods of assuring that the subject matter is
adequately addressed and located would be to key the sec-
tions of the quality manual to the quality elements of the
governing quality system standard. Other approaches,
such as structuring the manual to reflect the nature of the
organization, are equally acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  3  For system clarity and assessment purposes,  the
intentional omission of any quality system element from
the quality manual compared to  the  governing quality sys-
tem standard should  be  explained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The simple term ‚Äúquality manual‚Äù  is  used  when the same
manual is employed for both quality management and
quality assurance purposes.  This  usage is the most com-
mon application  of  a quality manual. However, in situa-
tions where an organization believes that a distinction of
content or usage is needed, it is essential that manuals de-
scribing the same quality system are not in conflict.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Any quality manual should identify the management func-
tions, address or reference the documented quality system
and procedures, and briefly cover  all  the applicable re-
quirements of the quality system standard selected by the
organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

quality manual, it should convey accurately, completely,
and concisely the quality policy, objectives, and governing
documented procedures of the organization (see clause  6).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6 PROCESS  OF  QUALITY MANUAL APPROVAL,
ISSUE,  AND  CONTROL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>process should begin with assignment of the coordination
task to a management-delegated competent body, which
may  be  an  individual  or  a group  of  individuals from one  or
more functional organizations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Final  review  and  approval<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior  to issuing  the  manual, the document should  be  sub-
jected to review by responsible individuals to ensure clar-
ity, accuracy, suitability, and proper structure. The in-
tended users should  also  have the opportunity to assess and
comment  on  the usability of the document. Release  of  the
new quality manual should be approved by the manage-
ment responsible for its implementation. Each copy should
bear evidence of this release authorization. Electronic  or
other methods of release  of  the manual are acceptable, if
evidence of approval is retained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The actual writing activity should be performed and con-
trolled from within the delegated competent body  or
from within various individual functional units, as appro-
priate. The use of existing documents and references can
significantly shorten the quality manual development
time, as weil as being an aid to identifying those areas
where quality system inadequacies need to  be  addressed
and corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The competent body may initiate the following actions as
applicable:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Distribution of the manual<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) establish and list existing applicable quality system
policies, objectives, and documented procedures, or de-
velop plans for such;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method of distribution of the authorized manual,
whether  in  total or by sections, should provide assurance
that all users have appropriate access. Proper distribution
and control can be aided, for example, by serialization of
copies for recipients. Management should ensure that indi-
viduals are familiar with those contents  of  the manual ap-
propriate to each user within the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) decide which quality system elements apply according
to the quality system standard selected;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) obtain data about the existing quality system and
practices by various means, such as questionnaires
and interviews;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Incorporation  of  changes<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Document issue and change control are essential to ensure
that the content of the manual is properly authorized. The
authorized content should be readily identifiable.  Various
methods may  be  considered for facilitating the physical
process of  making  changes.  To  ensure that each manual is
kept up to date, a method is needed to assure that  all
changes are received by each manual holder and incorpo-
rated into each manual.  A  table of contents, a separate re-
vision-status page,  or  other suitable means may  be  used to
assure the users that they have the authorized manual.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Use  of  references<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wherever appropriate, and to avoid unnecessary document
volume, reference to existing recognized standards or doc-

<<HEADING level=3>>7.5  Quaiity  policy  and objectives<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The title and scope of the quality manual should clearly
define the organization to which the manual applies.  This
section of the quality manual should also define the appli-
cation of the quality system elements. To ensure clarity
and avoid confusion,  the  use of disclaimers (e.g., what is
not covered by a quality manuals and situations where it
should  be  applied) may also  be  appropriate. Some or all of
this information may also be located on the title page.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This  section of a quality manual should state the organiza-
tion‚Äôs quality policy and objectives.  This  is where the or-
ganization‚Äôs commitment to quality is presented and
where the organization‚Äôs objectives for quality  are  out-
lined.  This  section should  also  describe how the quality

<<PARAGRAPH>>Subsections within this section or in a referenced system

sibilities, authorities, and hierarchy of all functions which
manage, perform, and verify work affecting quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The resultant quality manual will then reflect the organiza-
tion‚Äôs unique methods and means of satisfying the require-
ments stated in the selected quality standard and its quality
system elements. The methods and means by which the or-
ganization makes a commitment to meet requirements
should  be  clear to the users of the manual.  (See  annex C.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7  Elements  of  the quality  system<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8  Definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The remainder of the quality manual should describe  all  the
applicable elements of the quality system. The description
should  be  divided into logical sections revealing a weli-co-
ordinated quality system.  This  may  be  done by inclusion of,
or reference to, documented quality system procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a definitions clause is considered necessary in a man-
ual, it is usually located immediately after the ‚ÄúScope
and field of application.‚Äù Aithough it is recommended,
when practical, to use standard definitions and terms
which are referenced in recognized quality terminology
documents or in general dictionary usage, this section of
a quality manual should contain the definitions of terms
and concepts that are uniquely used within that quality
manual. Special attention should be given to words that
have a different meaning to different people or a specific
meaning to specific sectors of businesses. The definitions
should provide for a complete, uniform, and unambigu-
ous understanding of the contents of the quality manual.
The use of references to existing concepts, terminology,
definitions, and standards (e.g., ANSI/ISO/ASQC
A8402- 1994) is highly recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A quality system and a quality manual  are  unique to each
organization;  as  such,  this  American National Standard is
not intended to define a unique structure, format, content,
or method of presentation for the description of quality
system elements which can be applied to all (or even
some) products, including services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requirements for elements of quality systems are provided
by the IS0  9√ª√ª√ª  family of International Standards or the
applicable standard used by the organization. It is recom-
mended that, whenever applicable, the description  of  the
elements of the quality system  be  in a sequence similar to
that in the selected standard. Other sequencing or cross-ref-
erencing,  as  appropriate  to  the organization, is acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9  Guide  to  the  quality manual<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After selecting the appropriate standard, each organization
determines the quality system elements which  are  applica-
ble and, based upon the requirements of those elements in
the standard, defines how the organization intends to ap-
ply, accomplish, and control each  of  the selected elements.
In  determining the most suitable approach for the organi-
zation, consideration should  be  given  to  such aspects  as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consideration may  be  given to the inclusion of an index or
a section giving a cross-reference between a subject and
key words to the section or page numbers, or another such
quick guide to ‚Äúwhat and where in the quality manual.‚Äù A
guide may also provide a description of the organization  of
the quality manual and a short abstract of each of its sec-
