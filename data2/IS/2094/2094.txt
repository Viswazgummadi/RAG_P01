<<PARAGRAPH>>Construction Plant and Machinery Sectional Committee, HMD 18<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Construction Plant and Machinery Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Heavy Mechanical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Construction Plant and Machinery Sectional Committee had published the following Indian
Standards:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 2093 : 1974
Specification for distributors for hot tar and bitumen (  first revision  )
IS 2094 : 1996
Heaters for bitumen (tar) and emulsion — Specification (  second revision  )
IS 4198 : 1967
Specification for emulsion spraying machine for roads<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The above standards are related to the same subject and, therefore, the Sectional Committee while
revising IS 2093 and IS 4198 decided that the revision of these standards be made as Part 2 and
Part 3 respectively of IS 2094 and the existing IS 2094 : 1996 be treated as Part 1 of IS 2094. As
per the decision, the standards now covered under IS 2094 shall be as under:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 2094 (Part 1)
Heater for bitumen (tar) and emulsion — Specification : Part 1 Bitumen heaters
IS 2094 (Part 2)
Heaters for bitumen (tar) and emulsion — Specification : Part 2 Bitumen
sprayers
IS 2094 (Part 3)
Heaters for bitumen (tar) and emulsion — Specification : Part 3 Emulsion<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The increasing application of the tar and bitumen heaters in the construction and maintenance of
black-top roads has necessitated formulation of a specification for these heaters and this standard
was first published in 1962 and was revised in 1974. The present revision has been taken up to
incorporate modifications found necessary as a result of experience gained during the use of these
standards and the latest thinking on the subject. Some of the important modifications made in the
standard include provision of a ladder, pressure gauge for air tank. The requirement of volume
indicator has been made mandatory in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard includes a number of requirements which are at the option of the purchaser. For the
sake of convenience to the purchaser and the supplier, requirements to be specified by the
purchaser while making an enquiry or placing an order for hot tar and bitumen heaters have been
listed in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 3.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (March 2000). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
