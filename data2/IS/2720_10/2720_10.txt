<<HEADING level=3>>FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thii Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by Soils
and Soil Engineering Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With a view to establish uniform procedure for determination
of different
characteristics
of aoils, Indian
Standard methods
of test for soils ( IS 2720  )  covering  each propmty  in separate parts have been brought
out.
This Part deals with method for determination
of unconfined
compressive
strength
of soils.
For the
determination
of shearing
strength a specimen
may or may not be subjected to a lateral pressure
during
the test.
When
it is not, the test is known as unconlined
compression
test.
The purpose of this test is to
obtain a quantitative value of compressive
and shearing strength of soils in an undrained
state.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This standard was first published in 1964 and revised .in 1973.
In this second
revisioo,
the major modi-
fications made are:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) More details for the apparatus used for the test incorporated,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) The method of preparation of specimen elaborated,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c) Procedure based on the experience gained in the use of this test in the past 15 years
elaborated,
and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d) Various fbrmulae and valuer expreued
in SI units.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Remoulded
Specimen<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The

specimen
or from
a disturbed
soil sample.
In
the
case of failed
undisturbed
specimen,
the material
shall be wrapped
in a thin
rubber
membrane
and
thoroughly
worked
with
the fingers to assure
complete
remoulding.
Care
shall
be taken
to avoid
entrapped
air,
to obtain
a uniform
density,
to
remould
to the same
void
ratio as that of the undisturbed
specimen,
and to
preserve
the natural
water content
of the soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3
Undistdrbed
Specimens<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Undisturbed
specimens
shall
be
prepared
from
large
undisturbed
samples
or samples secured
in
accordance
with
IS 2132  :  1986.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Compacted
Specimen<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1
When
samples
are pushed
from
the drive
sampling
tube the ejecting
device shall be capable
of ejecting
the soil core
from
the
sampling
tube
in
the
same
direction
of travel
in
which
the
sample
entered
the
tube
and
with
negligible
disturbance
of the sample.
Conditions
at the time
of removal
of the sample may dictate the direction
of removal,
but the principal
concern
should
be
to keep the degree
of disturbance
negligible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
compacting
disturbed
material,
it shall be
done
using a mould of circular
cross-section
with
dimensions
corresponding
to those
given
in 5.3.
Compacted
specimen
may
be prepared
at
any
predetermined
water content
and density.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.1
After the specimen
is formed, the ends shall
be trimmed
perpendicular
to the
long axis and
removed
from the mould.
Representative
sample
cuttings
shall be obtained
or the entire
specimen
shall
be
used
for
the
determination
of water
content
after the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Three specimens
obtained by trimming and carving
from undisturbed
soil samples shall be tested.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2
When the sample
is  ejected
horizontally,
a curved
plate
may be provided
to butt against the sampling
tube such that the ejected specimen slips over it freely,
This ~111 avoid bending of the specimen
and facilitate
bringing
specimen to vertical
position in many cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1
The
initial
length,
diameter
and weight
of
the specimen
shall be measured
and the specimen
placed on the bottom
plate of the loading
device.
The upper plate shall be adjusted to make contact
with the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2
The
specimen
shall be handled
carefully
to
prevent
disturbance,
change
in cross section,
or
loss of water.
If any type of disturbance
is likely
to be caused
by the ejection
devicq
the sample
tube
shall
be
split lengthwise
or be cut off
in
small
sections,to
facilitate
removal of the specimen
without
disturbance.
If possible carved specimen
should
be prepared
in a humid room to prevent,
as far as possible,
change
in water content
of the
soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The deformation
dial gauge shall be adjusted
to a suitable
reading,
preferably
in
multiples
of
100. Force
shall be applied so as to produce
axial
strain at a rate
of 0.5
to 2 percent
per minute
causing
failure
with 5 to 10.
The force
reading
shall be taken
at suitable
intervals
of the defor-
mation
dial reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
-
Up to 6q/, axial strain force, readings may be
taken at an interval of 0.5 mm of the deformation
dial
reading.
After
6% axial
strain,
the
interval ma’: be
increased to 1.0 mm and,
beyond
12qb axial
strain it
may be increased even further.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.3
The specimen
shall be of uniform
circular
cross-section
with
ends perpendicular
to. the axis
of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.4
Specimen
of required
size may
be carved
from large undisturbed
specimens.
When
sample
condition
permits
use of a vertical
lathe,
which
will arcommodate
the total sample,
the same may
be used as an aid in carving
the specimen
to the
required
diameter.
Tube
specimens
may be tested
without
trimming
except for squaring
of ends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
