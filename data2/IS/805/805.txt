<<HEADING level=3>>CODE OF PRACTICE FOR

TANKS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institu-
tion on 4 November
1968, after the draft finalized by
the
Structural
Engineering
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Structural
and Metals Division Council and the Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2’ This code lays down the recommended practice for the design, fabri-
cation and erection of steel gravity water tanks, either elevated, or con-
structed on concrete or earthy foundations. It is designed to provide the
user with tanks with adequate safety and reasonable economy which can
be built in any size to meet the required capacity.
It was considered not
necessary to include the sizes or capacity of the tanks and the dimensions
and details of the appurtenances.
0.3 Taking into consideration the views of producers and consumers, the
Sectional Committee
felt that it should be related to the manufacturing
and trade practices followed in the country in this field.
Furthermore,
this consideration led the Sectional Committee
to derive assistance from

<<PARAGRAPH>>28.1  At all fillet welds,
the lapped
plates
shall be held in close contact
during
welding.
Plates in which the vertical joints
are to be butt welded
shall
be accurately
matched
and
retained
in position
during
welding.
Tack
welds
may
be
used to hold
the edges in line provided
they
are
entirely
removed
so that they do not form a part of the main weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>28.2
When
assembled
for welding,
corresponding
plate edges in butt joints
shall not have
an offset from
each
other
at any point
in excess of one-
fourth
the thickness
of the thinnest
plate.
Bars, jacks,
clamps,
wedges,
or other appropriate
tools may be used to hold the edges to be welded
in
line.
All shell plates shall be truly cylindrical
and plumb,
free from local
irregularities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>28.3
If erection
bolts
are used for ~holding lap joints
in line,
they
shall
be removed
before
welding and
replaced
by light tack welds.
The holes
for erection
bolts,
as well as the holes used
for
lifting
the
plates
into
position,
shall be sealed by full-formed
rivets having heads seal-welded
or by
plugging

WELDING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>29.1 General
-
The
dimensions
and shapes of the edges to
be joined
shall be such as to allow thorough
fusion and complete
penetration.
On
butt joints,
where the width of the gap at the f&e
of the weld is greater
than
12 mm, the weld metal except the .final surface layer shall be peened
to relieve
shrinkage
stresses.
This
will improve
the effectiveness
of the
finished weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>28.2
The
sequence
of welding
shell plates shall
be such
that
shrinkage
stresses are effectively
reduced
by accommodating
the contraction
about
the weld as it cools, thus avoiding
rigidity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>31.1 Tank
shell, tank
bottom
on grillage
beams,
or large

be
tested
by filling
with
water
and constantly
inspecting
all visible joints
carefully.
If any leaks or other
defects are discovered,
the water
level
shall
be
lowered
immediately.
Welded
joints
shall
not be tested by
hammering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>31.2
A flat bottom
tank on a solid foundation
shall be tested after the
lowest ring of the shell, including
the circumferential
joint at the bottom,
has been completely
welded followed
by welding of the contraction
seams
in the bottom.
The outside
of the shell should be sealed to the ground
or other
foundation
with wet clay and then air forced
underneath
the
bottom
until the plates are raised a few inches.
A U-tube
near the centre
of the bottom
is used for the air collection.
The
seams are tested with
soap solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>31.3
The inspector
may judge
the quality
of welds by visual inspection
or by chipped out sections with a cold chisel or by having trepanned
plugs
removed
from
welds
and
etched,
and
the
holes
properly
repaired.
Rewelding
shall be paid for by the purchaser
unless the welds are found
defective,
in which case all defective welding shall be cut out and replaced
at the expense of the fabricator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>32.  REPAIRS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>32.1
Repairs
of welding
by hammering
of welded
joints
shall
not
be
attempted
while
the tank is full.
Welded
joints
shall be repaired
only
after lowering
the water at least 60 cm below the joint to be repaired,
or
after
completely
draining.
Repair
shall consist
of chipping
or melting
out of all defective metal and rewelding
to give full strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>32.2
