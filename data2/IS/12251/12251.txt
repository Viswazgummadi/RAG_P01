<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the
Bureau of Indian Standards on 20 November
1987,
after the draft finalized by the Water Su
P
ply and
Sanitation
in Buildings
Sectional
Comm ttee had
been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Pivision
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Generally,
the
bottom
of the
basement
is
invariably lower than the adjoining
road where the
municipal services run to which the drainage of the
basement has got to be connected.
The entry to the
basement is ramped down from
the main or side
road. During rain, surface runoff
from the adjoin-
ing area and roads-may
enter
the basement down
this ramp.
Secondly, during
monsoon period, the
sub-soiI
water or water from
the side walls may
enter
the
basement
and
cause
damages
to the
building
and
equipment.
During
floor
wash or
car wash,
in case
of
basement
being
used for
parking, water accumulated
need to be drained off.
This standard
is being prepared
with a view to
give guidance for providing
proper
collection apd
disposal
of storm
water
and
sewage
in
the
basement.
0.5 It is recommended
that basement
walls should
be designed for water pressure
even in sites where
subsoil water level
is much below the basement
assuming
water table exists at
one-third
of the
depth of the basement
above
the basement
floor
level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Generally,
in all multistoreyed
buildings, there
are basements
which are used
for parkings, for
having
the plant room
or other utility purposes.
The
garbage
chute
installed
in
multistoreyed
buildings
also
terminates
in
the
basement.
Sometimes common toilets are also situated in the
basement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In hotels
and theatres,
the basement
plays a
very important
part because
the
equipment like
airconditioner,
machinery
and
other
ancillary
equipment
is placed
in the basement.
In hotels,
the basement
has got
much
more
importance
because their godowns, grocery,
confectionery
and
other
offices
are
also
situated in the
basement
besides the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>connecting to the outlet of the pump, shall remain
fixed in the wall above
the sump where the outlet
of portable pump is connected.
The water shall be
pumped to the municipal
sewer, and silt and sand
trap shall be provided
before joining the municipal
sewer.
Non-return
valve
shall be provided in the
discharge pipe just after the pump.
2.3 Below the terminating
point
to
the
chute,
generally a trolley is kept and the chute is periodi-
cally washed with the result that the water accumu-
Ted
at the bottom
creates
unhealthy
conditions.
‘Therefore,
a cast iron
deep seal gully trap covered
with a grating shall be installed below the terminat-
ing point of the chute so that the water accumulated
by periodical washing of the chute can be connected
to the sump.
2 4 An automatic
electric
changeover
system is
desirable for the pumps
installed
on the sump so
that in case one pump fails, the second should start
automatically.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  The standard
covers
methods
for basement
drainage both for sewage and storm water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Water
may be prevented
from remaining
In
contact
with basement
walls or floors
for
lo
3
periods
by installing
a system of drainage roun
the wall footings
or beneath
the floor
or both
together.
The provision
of drainage around
the
perimeter of the basement is recommended
for any
site where the ground
water table is likely to rise
above the top of the footing.
These drainage should
be placed beside the wall footing
and should be
graded to an open outlet
or storm
water sewer or
to a sump within
buildings
where
pumps
are
provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 A sump shall be constructed
where the base-
ment waste water is connected.
The sump shall be
water tight and the water from
the sump shall be
pumped off either by a portable
pump in case of
area with less frequency of rainfall or by permanent.
