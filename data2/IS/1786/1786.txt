FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
( Third Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 1 May
1985,
after
the draft finalized by the
Joint
Sectional
Committee
for
Concrete
Reinforcement
had
been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Deformed bars for concrete  ‘reinforcement
are being
produced
in
the country for many years, the main processes being hot rolling
or hot
rolling followed by cold twisting.
In the past decade there has been an
increasing
demand for higher strength deformed bars ( 415 N/mmz,  Min,
yield
strength/O.2 percent
proof stress being the most common  j.
This
high yield strength
was being
first achieved
by raising
carbon
and
manganese
and to a great extent by cold twisting.
In addition IO this,
there
has been
considerable
demand
for larger
diameter
bars
with
similar strength, elongation,
weldability
and bendability
as that of small
size bars.
Along with this, the;e is also a need for these steel bars
to
be welded
and
fabricated
on the site easily.
For this, strength and
ductility have to be achieved
at the lowest possible carbon content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
Technological
advances during the last few years in the field
of
deformed
bar
production
have helped in meeting all the above require-
ments together.
Microalloying
with Nb, V, Ti and B, in combination
or individually,
and thermomechanical
treatment
process
are worth
mentioning in this field.
With these two processes higher strength values
could be achieved at low carbon levels even in large diameter bars.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Two
Indian
Standard
specifications,
namely,
IS  :  1139-1966
‘Specification
for hot rolled mild steel, medium tensile  steel  and high yield
strength steel deformed
bars
for concrete reinforcement
(  revised )’  and
IS  :  1786-1979 ‘Specification
for cold-worked steel high strength deformed
bars for concrete reinforcement
r  second revision )’  covered
deformed
bars<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1786 - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>for
concrete
reinforcement,
To
take
advantage
of the technological
changes,
it is thought
necessary
to merge
these two
specifications
giving
:IEE? option
of the manufacturing
process to the producers
so as to meet
nlZ the requirements
of the specification.
Hence
the revision
of IS  :  1139-
1966
and
IS : 1786-1979
has
been
prepared
combining
them
into a
single specification
with modified
designation
and title.
In this
revision
the
requirements
of chemical
composition
have been modified,
a new
strength
grade
Fe 550 has been introduced,
Fe 250 and Fe
350
strength
grades
have
been
deleted,
requirements
of modified
bar geometry
have
been made applicable
to hot-rolled
bars in addition
to cold-worked
bars;
further
4,
5 and 7 mm
nominal
sizes have been introduced;
and a few
other changes
found necessary
as  a result of experience
gained
have been
incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4
For the purpo.qe of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accor-
dance
with
IS : 2-1960*.
The
number
of significant
places retained
in
the rounded
off value shoilld be the same as that
of the
specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
