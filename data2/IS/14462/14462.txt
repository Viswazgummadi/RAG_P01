<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Surface
Covered Cultivation Structures Sectional Committee had been approved by the Food and Agriculture
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Development of greenhouse technology in India is of recent origin. Greenhouse
technology permits the
cnhancemcnt
of horticultural
crop productivity particularly those of vegetables and flowers. This tech-
nology requires a considerable energy input for environmental
control. It is, therefore essential that
adcquatc guidclincs for the layout, design and construction of greenhouse structures and climate control
system should bc laid down. This standard has, therefore, been prepared with aview to providing necessary
guidance in this area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In preparation
of this standard, assistance has been derived from ASAE EP 460  - 1995  Commercial
Greenhouse
Design and Layout, Published by American Society of Agricultural Engineers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in
Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values @vi.&)‘. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The gutter-connected
keeps all growing
space inside one building, and a central
heating plant can easily serve all areas. A
minimum area of 1 000 m2 should be con-
sidered
to efficiently
use materials
and
equipment. It may not be as easy to expand
or contract space use as with single span
greenhouses.  A  headhouse may be attached
to the end or sides, or in large operations a
central location reduces travel distances for
plants and personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5  SITE SELECTION AND LAYOUT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Selection of Site and Location<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  site shall be located away from industrial and
vehicular pollution to prevent plant injury from
possible pollutants and to ensure light levels. The
functional and environmental operation of a green-
house structure may be affected by the building site
selected. Ground slope for drainage of water is
important and may be provided. Greenhouses shall
be’ placed on gravel base 150 mm to 300 mm above
grade. Swales between greenhouses structures are
necessary to direct the water from the area. A
topographic map of the area will indicate surface
drainage routes. The ideal greenhouse structures
site would have a slightly southern facing slope(less
than 3 percent) for good winter light and protection
from northern winds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Planning process provisions shall be made for ex-
pansion. Land shall be available for additional
greenhouses and headhouse area. Water, electrical,
and environment control systems shall be installed
to allow for expansion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Orientation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ridge in either single span greenhouse struc-
tures or gutter-connected
range shall be east-west
in areas above 40’ north latitude to transmit maxi-
mum winter sunlight to the plants. Gutter shading
the same area during each day may result in uneven
growth in some plants. Uneven growth in cast-west
ridge orientation
is a trade off against general
reduction in winter light, if the ridges run north-
south.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Location with respect to highways shall be con-
sidered. Location on near a highway and residential
area may increase business for a retail operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Site  Layout<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following
points should be considered
in
developing a layout for greenhouse structure:
locate the head house to the north of the
greenhouse to reduce shading;
locate windbreaks at least 30 m away to the
side of the prevailing winter winds to reduce
energy consumption;
separate
supplier
and customer
traffic.
Provide for convenient consumer parking  ;
locate and screen any residcncc to insure
privacy;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Headhouse  and Storage Facilities<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A headhouse
should be built to house the office,
utilities, work areas, employee arcas, storage, and
dispatch. The size of the hcadhousc
can be ap-
proximated from Table 4. This value should bc
adjusted depending on the indoor storage needed
and the amount of mechanization
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Benches improve labour efficiency, permit more
effective’display and inspection, and assist air cir-
culation. Bench arrangement
depends on dimen-
sions of the greenhouse, walkways, and doors and
on materials handling and heating system type and
location.Total
aisle space should be less that 25
percent of the total area. Longitudinal
arrange-
ments with benches extending the length of the
house permits continuous runs of water lines, heat
pipes, and plant support systems. Width of bench
can be up to 0.9 m for tending from one side and
2 m when aisles are on both sides. Minimum aisle
width should be 500 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Although it is often impractical to store ahgrowing
media under cover. It is convenient to have some of
it protected from rain and snow. The amount of
space needed is determined by the type of opera-
tion, kind of media being used, and the local
climate. Calculate space requirements based on the
amount that is needed for one crop or a specific
time period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A peninsular arrangement
with one main center
aisle extending the length of the greenhouse and
perpendicular
side aisles usually results in more
growing space. A main aisle width of 1.0 to 1.5 m
and side aisles of about 500 mm is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Locate the storage area for bulk materials and truck
loads where there is good access by all weather road.
Allow adequate space for trucks for shunting. The
storage should be located close to the work area to
reduce handling time and costs. Provide drainage
in the storage area. Materials stored without cover
should drain quickly, provide a paved area for han-
dling with a bucket loader or fork lift. A clear span
storage building allows freedom of movement for
tractors
and trucks and allows arrangement
of
equipment
to be easily changed.
For ease in
maneuvering tractors and trucks, a minimum width
of 7.0 m is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Movable benches allow the use of all the area ex-
cept one or two work aisles. Bench tops are sup-
ported on rollers and allowed to move sideways 500
mm to provide a work aisle. Connections for water,
heat, and electrical systems that are attached to the
bench must be made flexible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 CONSTRUCTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Foundations<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pier foundation
may be adequate
for primary
greenhouse frame, consisting of hoops spaced one
meter or more. A curtain wall can be used to close
the area between the piers. If primary frame mem-
bers are spaced less than 1.2 m, a continuous
masonry or poured concrete wall should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once the layout within the building has been estab-
lished, service and peTnne1
doors can be located.
Service doors should be a minimum of 0.5 m wider
than the largest piece of equipment and the ceilings
a minimum of 3.5 m or higher. Headroom should
be a minimum of 3.5 m with higher ceilings, if
bucket loaders are to be used. For convenience,
locate a personnel door next to an overhead door.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The footing should be set below frost level or to a
minimum depth of 600 mm below the ground sur-
face whichever is greater. Consult SP 7 building
code for local requircmcnts. It should rest on level,
undisturbed soil, or adequately compacted fill. In-
dividual pier footings should bc sized to fit the load
and soil conditions.The
pier may be of reinforced
concrete, galvanized steel, treated wood, or con-
cretc masonry. The wall between galvanized piers
can be poured or precast concrete, masonry, fibre
reinforced cement panels, aluminium clad insulat-
ing board, or any moisture
and decay resistant
material. A continuous foundation wall should be
set on a poured concrete footing. The wall can be
concrete or masonry. A 150 mm wall is usually
sufficient for building spans up to 7.5 m. USC a 2(K)
mm wall for wider building spans. Typical founda-
tion construction arc shown in Fig.  1  Pier footing
dimensions given in Table 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concrete floors inside the building and paved areas
outside make movement ofvehicles easy in all types
ofwearher. Elevate building floors at least 150 mm
above outside grade, and slope the ground surface
away from the walls or the doorways. Provide
drainage for roof gutters and snow melt.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Interior Tuyout<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The choice between production on the floor or on
the benches depends on the crop and the produc-
tion schedule. Benches are usuaIly provided for pot
plant production.
Bedding plants are generally
grown on the floor. Beds, either ground or raised
arc needed for cut flowers. Benches may be fahri-
catcd of wood, mctai, or plastic with a either solid
or mesh bottom. Benches should be placed at a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>frames. Steel and aluminium are used for posts,
beams, girts, purlins, trusses, and arches. Both
materials shall be protected
from direct contact
with ground to prevent corrosion. White paint on
either material will improve the light reflection in
a greenhouse
structure.
The rate of heat loss
through steel or aluminium is much higher than
through wood, so metal frames may need special
insulation. To avoid such heat loss through steel or
aluminium,
composite
materials are sometimes
used, such as a trussed beam of wood and steel or a
member made of fibreglass reinforced plastic may
be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Covering Materials and Glazings<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Light is responsible for plant growth, therefore,
light transmittance
of glazing materials should be
high. In most of the materials the transmitted light
is direct, but in some materials such as fibreglass
reinforced plastics a high percentage
is diffused.
Structural
support
reduce

values. Glazing materials
do not
transmit all wavelengths equally and this can affect
plant growth and flowering. Thermal
radiation
transmittance
is important in evaluating heat loss
from a greenhouse during cold weather.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.51  Material Selection and Glazing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 Structural
Forms<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The  various glazing materials to cover the green-
house structures are recommended
to be used as
mentioned below.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.1  Gable Type<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  greenhouse structures with a straight sidewall
and a gable roof is the most common shape and has
advantages in framing and space utilization. Post
and beam, post and truss, and arches are used to
form the gable structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.1.1  Glass<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This traditional
long life material has been im-
proved by increasing pane size and strength. Con-
struction costs have been reduced through use of
extruded glazing bars, bar caps and strip caulking.
Double and triple glazing may be used to reduce
heat loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.2  Quonset Type<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the quonset type shape, the part of the circle
arch is easily formed from rolled sections of steel or
aluminium or from glue laminated wood. It makes
better structural use of frame material than a gable
building, but in some applications there is unused
space because of the curvature of the sidewalls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.1.2  Acrylic structural sheet<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Extruded double skinned sheets contain an internal
rib and two surfaces providing some additional
thermal insulation. Sheet sizes of 1.2 m x 12 m
and several thicknesses may be used. Installation is
made by using extruded attachment components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.3  Gothic Type<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Gothic frame may be formed from metal sec-
tions or glue laminated wood. With proper design
it may provide adequate sidewall height wIthout
loss of strength. Any of the forms may be used to
build a single span greenhouse or a large range of
gutter-connected
units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.1.3  PO&carbonate structured sheet<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is similar in configuration and installation to the
acrylic material. Sheets as wide as 2.4 m may be
used. To resist yellowing and light transmission,
coated or treated material is recommended.
The
coated side shall face to the outside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.4  Gutter-Connected<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.1.4  Fibreglass reinforced plastic<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ridge and furrow or gutter-connected
green-
house structure
consists of several single span
houses connected together. The advantages include
greater uninterrupted
interior growing space and
lower heating costs per unit area covcrcd. Heat
should be provided immediately below the gutter

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 Watering<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1 The amount of water needed depends on the
water requirement of the cultivation medium, area
to be irrigated, crop grown, weather conditions, and
whether the heating and/or ventilating system is
operating. The maximum requirement
during the
summer is about 2 000 litre per 100 m* per watering
(see Table 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Utility lines should be buried to improve ap-
pearance,
avoid damage, and reduce hazards.
Electric, phone, and fuel lines should be buried at
least 500 mm deep to avoid damage from surface
traffic. Location
of the utility lines should bc
recorded
on
a map for future
reference. For
distribution
system
within
the greenhouse
structure,
the National
Electrical Code may be
taken in account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2 The  water system for the greenhouse should
have the capacity to supply the total daily needs in
a 6 hour application period. This allows the plants
to be watered during the morning and early after-
noon and with time for the foliage to dry before
sunset.
7.3.3  Ground water is usually the most reliable
source of water. It is available from drilled wells,
dug wells, etc. Surface water ponds, lakes and
streams may also be used, but precautions shall be
taken to insure against contamination
injurious to
the plants. For greenhouse
crops pH of irrigation
water shall be between 6.5 to 7.5. Irrigation water
may contain impurities that adversely affect the
growth of the plants. Therefore, quality of the water
shall be ensured before irrigation. Micro irrigation
system is the most suitable method for irrigation to
the greenhouse
groups.The
quality of irrigation
water shall conform to IS 11624.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cooling of the greenhouse
is necessary wherever
the outside temperature goes beyond 30°C and also
when temperate crops are to be grown. Depending
upon the glazing material and the ventilation, once
the greenhouse
structures are covered the inside
temperature
may be at least 5 to 10°C higher than
the outside temperature,
if it is not cooled. In order
to create better growing conditions, it is necessary
to cool the greenhouse structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heating
required
in places where the winter
temperature
is very low. Similarly, in places where
the climate is extreme cold and warm, both cooling
and heating are required
at higher elevations,
where temperatures
do not normally go above
30°C, cooling may not be necessary, only providing
proper ventilation will serve the purpose. However,
these places may require heating during winter for
successful crop production.
