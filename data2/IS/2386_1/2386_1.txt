<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
(&rt
I) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 22 August 1963, after the draft finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Building
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 One of the major
contributing
factors to the quality of concrete
is
the quality of aggregates
used therein.
The
test methods
given in this
standard are intended to assist in assessing the quality of aggregates.
In
a given situation,
for a particular
aggregate,
it may not be necessary
to
assess all the qualities and therefore
it is necessary
to determine
before-
hand the purpose for which a concrete is being used and the qualities
of
the aggregate
which require to be assessed.
Accordingly,
the relevant
test methods may be chosen
from amongst
the various tests covered in
this standard.
For the convenience
of the users, the test methods
are
grouped into the following
eight parts of Indian
Standard
Methods of
Test for Aggregates
for Concrete
(  IS  :  2386-1963 ):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation’
of this
standard has taken into consideration
the views of the concrete
special-
ists, testing authorities,
consumers and technologists
and has related the
standard to the practices
followed in this country.
Further the need for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of the world has also beenrecognized.
These
considerations
led
the Sectional

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular

of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.2  Each
sieve shall be shaken
separately
over a clean
tray until not
more than a trace passes,
but in any case
for a period
of not less than
two minutes.
The
shaking
shall be done
with
a varied
motion,
back-
wards and forwards,
left to right,
circular
clockwise
and anti-clockwise,
and with frequent
jarring,
so that the material
is kept
moving
over
the

changing
dirkctions.
Material
shall not
be
forced
through
the
sieve
by hand
pressure,
but on sieves coarser
than
20 mm,
placing
of particles
is permitted.
Lumps
of fine
material,
if
present,
may be broken
by gentle pressure
with
fingers
against
the
side
of the sieve.
Light
brushing
with a soft brush on the under
side
of the
sieve may be used to clear the sieve
openings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.3
Light
brushing
with a fine camel
hair brush may be used on the
150-micron
and 75-micron
IS
Sieves
to prevent
aggregation
of powder
and blinding
of apertures.
Stiff
or worn out brushes
shall not be used
for this purpose and pressure
shall
not
be applied
to the
surface
of the
sieve to force particles
through
the mesh.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.4
In
order
to prevent

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.1  In some cases the sieve analysis
of .all-in-aggregate
can be carried
out in accordance
with the procedure
given in 2.4.
Frequently,
however,
this will result in heavy
overloading
of the finer sieves.
In such
cases
it
will be necessary
to make a preliminary
separation
of the all-in-aggregate
into two fractions,
coarse
and fine,
using
for this purpose
a convenient
sieve for example,
a 3.35mm
or 4.75mm
IS Sieve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.2
If the amount
of either
the coarse
or fine aggregate
obtained
as
above
is substantially
less than
that
required
for testing
in accordance
with Table
IV, another
sample
shall be taken
which
is sufficiently
large
to produce
an adequate
sample
of both the coarse
and the fine aggregate.
If the amount
of either
the coarse
or the fine aggregate
thus obtained
is
substantially
greater
than that required
for testing,
it shall be reduced
by
quartering
or by means
of a sample
divider.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Reporting of Results -  The results
shall be calculated
and
reported
as:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the cumulative
percentage
by weight
of the total
sample
passing
each
of
the
sieves,
to
the
nearest
whole
number
(see
Note
under 2.6.1);
or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the percentage
by weight
of the total sample
passing
one
sieve
and retained
on the next smaller
sieve, to the nearest
0.1 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6.1  Graphical Method

may be recorded
graphically
on

number of coarse aggregate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1  -
Angulsrity
or absence of rounding of the particles of an aggre-
gate is 8 property which is of importance because it 8ffeCts the ease of handling
of n mixture of aggregate and binder, for example the workebility of concrete,
or the st8bility of mixtures thet rely on the interlocking of. the perticles.
It
is emphesixed that this is e laboratory method intended for comparing the proper-
ties of different aggregetes for mix ,design purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
Since considersbly more effort is used then in the test for bulk
density end voids [ see IS  :  2336 ( Part III )-1963 1, the results of the two tests are
different.
Also weeker 8ggreg&es may be orusbed during compection, end the

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5  Test Procedure  -The
scoop shall be filled and
heaped
to ovcr-
flowing with the aggregate,
which
shall be placed
ir: the cylinder by
allowing it to slide gently off the scoop from the least height possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.1 The aggregate
in the cylinder shall be subjected
to  100  blows of
the tamping rod at a rate of about 2 blows per second.
Each blow shall
be applied by holding the rod vertical with its rounded end 5 cm above
the surface of the aggregate
and releasing
it so that it falls freely.
No
force shall be applied to the rod.
The 100 blows shall he evenly dis-
tributed over the surface of the aggregate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.2 The process of filling and tampirlg
shall
be repeated
exactly as
described
above
with a second and third
layer of aggregates;
the third
layer shall contain just sufficient
aggregate
to fill the cylinder level with
the top edge before tamping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.3 After the third layer has been tamped, the cylinder shall be filled
to overflowing, and the aggregate
struck off level with the top using the
tamping rod as a straight edge.
,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.4 Individual
pieces shall then be added
and
‘rolled-in’
to the
surface by rolling the tamping rod across the upper edge of the cylinder,
and this finishing
process
shall
be continued as long as the aggregate
does not lift the rod off the edge of the cylinder
on either side.
The
aggregate shall not be pushed in or otherwise forced down, and no down-
ward pressure shall be applied
to the tamping
rod, which shall roll in
contact with the metal on both sides of the cylinder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.5 The
aggregate
in the cylinder
shall
then be weighed to the
nearest 5 grams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.6 Three
separate
determinations
shall
be made, and the mean
weight of aggregate
in the cylinder
calculated.
If the result of any one
determination
differs from the mean
by more than
25 grams,
three
additional
determinations
shall
immediately
be
made
on
the same
material and the mean of all the six determinations
calculated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6 Calculation
-
The angularity
number shall
be calculated
from the
formula:
loo
W
Angularity
number = 67 -
CG
A
where
W =  mean weight in g of the aggregate in the cylinder,
C = weight of water in g required to fill the cylinder, and
G, = specific gravity of aggregate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
