metal valve-core
depressor
for
automatically
unseating
the tyre valve.
There
shall
be a hard fibre
gasket at the
junction
of the two members of the connector

of 175 to 180 mm by foot.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 The angle between
the horizontal
line and the line joining
the lever pivot with
the face of the
foot plate shall be between
55” and 65”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 The inflator
shall be capable of resisting
shocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 A provision
shall be made for the fitment

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  Drop
Test -The
inflator
unit shall be dropped
3 times from
a height
of 1 metre on to a hard
concrete
surface
so as to strike the base.
After this test there shall be no cracks in the body of the
‘inflator
unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2  Leakage
Test  -The
inflator
skirt,
rubber
hose and fittings
shall
be immersed
in water
and
compressed
air at a pressure
of 700 kPa in case of truck type and 530 kPa in case of car type inflators
shall be passed through
them.
No part shall show any leakage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3  Displacement
Test  -The
inflator
shall be capable of developing
a pressure
of 700 kPa in case
of truck type and 530 kPa in case of car type by the application
of normal force on theinflator
pedal
by an average
man.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.4  Performance
Test -
The
inflator
shall
