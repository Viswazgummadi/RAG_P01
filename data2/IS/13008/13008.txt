<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee, CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Bureau of Indian Standards has formulated a number of Indian standards on asbestos cement
products. Of late asbestos cement corrugated sheets with shallow corrugation are also finding
their use in this country. Therefore, it is felt necessary to bring out a specification for this product.
This specification covers the dimensional requirements, physical and mechanical characteristics of
asbestos cement corrugated sheets with shallow corrugations. Requirements for standard
corrugated and semi-corrugated sheets are covered in IS 459 : 1970 ‘Unreinforced corrugated and
semi-corrugated asbestos cement sheets (  second   revision  )’. Guidance regarding laying and fixing
of such sheets is given in IS 3007 (Part 1) : 1964 ‘Code of practice for laying of asbestos cement
sheets : Part 1 Corrugated sheets’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to international co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing in different countries in addition to relating it to the
practices in the field in this country. In the formulation of this standard, assistance has been
derived from ISO 393/1-1983 Asbestos cement products — Part 1 Corrugated sheets and fittings
for roofing and cladding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given in
Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (September 1997). Side bar indicates modification
of the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
