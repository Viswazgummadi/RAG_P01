From this, determine the amount in the\nsample. Subtract this value from each of the analysis of the sample plus known added substance.\nThe resulting amount of substance divided by the known amount added multiplied by 100 gives\npercentage recovery. This method can be applied not only to colorimetric and instrumental\nmethods, but also to titrimetric, gravimetric and other types of analysis. Generally intricate and\nexacting procedures for trace substances that have inherent errors due to their complexity may\ngive recoveries that would be considered poor and yet, from the practical view point of usefulness\nof the result, may be quite acceptable. Poor results may reflect either interference present in the\nsample or real inadequacy of the method of analysis in the range in which it is being used.\nAnalytical skill is required to assure the validity of the methods. Recovery using colorimetric\nmethods can be particularly deceptive, depending on the nature of the sample, its pretreatment\nand the concentration of the constituents being measured. Most analytical methods have\nsatisfactory precision and accuracy over a limited range, with the lower range limit being\ncontrolling in trace analysis. A known addition to a sample may bring the concentration into the\nrange where the method is reliable, if the addition is too large the apparent precision and accuracy\napply at the higher concentration, and not the concentration originally present. Natural waters\nfrequently contain complexing materials that combine with metals to the extent that the\ncomplexed metals will not react in some colorimetric methods. If nearly all of a metal is complexed,\na known addition may be recovered completely but the method will still not recover the metal\noriginally present in a complexed state. In such cases pretreatment to destroy the complex is\nnecessary. The analyst must account for such pitfalls in designing recovery procedures.",

This standard has now been revised and published in various parts, each part\ncovering a particular characteristic. This standard (Part 3) covers the precision and accuracy of the\nphysical and chemical test methods employed for water and wastewater. IS : 3025-1964 had not\ncovered this aspect earlier, and it has been introduced now as a new method.",

Terminology\n2.1The definitions given in IS : 7022 (Part I)-1973 \u2018Glossary of terms relating to water, sewage and\nindustrial effluents\u2019, Part I; and IS : 7022 (Part 2)-1979 \u2018Glossary of terms relating to water, sewage\nand industrial effluents\u2019, Part 2, and the following shall apply:\nPrecision\u2014Closeness of agreement among the results obtained by applying the test procedure\nseveral time under prescribed conditions. The precision can be quantitatively measured with the\nhelp of the standard deviation.\nAccuracy\u2014Closeness of agreement between the true value and the results obtained by applying\nthe test procedure very large number of times. The accuracy can also be measured with the help of\nthe standard deviation. But with the difference that the deviations of the test results are\ncalculated from the true and not from the average.\nRepeatability\u2014Closeness of agreement (as indicated by the corresponding standard deviation)\namong the successive results obtained by the same method on identical test material and under\nthe same conditions (same operator, same apparatus, same laboratory and almost the same time).\nIt is defined as that difference between two such single and independent test results as would be\nexceeded in the long run in only one case in twenty in the normal and correct operation of the test\nmethod.\nReproducibility\u2014Closeness of agreement (as indicated by the corresponding standard deviation)\namong the test results obtained by the same method on identical test material but under different\nconditions (different operators, different apparatus, different laboratories and/or different times).\nIt is defined as that difference between two such single and independent results as would only be\nexceeded in the long run in one case in twenty in the normal and correct operation of the test\nmethod.\n3. Determination of Precision and Accuracy\n3.1A method may have very high precision but recovery may be poor due to poorly standardized\nsolutions, inaccurate dilution techniques, inaccurate balance-weights or improperly calibrated\nequipment. Likewise a method may be accurate but may lack precision because of low instrumental\nsensitivity, variable rate of biological activity or other factors beyond the analysis control.\n3.2It is possible to determine both precision and accuracy of a test method by analysing samples to\nwhich known quantities of standard substances have been added. It is possible to determine\nprecision, but not accuracy of methods, such as suspended solids, BOD and numerous physical\nparameters because of the unavailability of standard substances that can be added in known\nquantities on which percentage recovery is based. Care should be taken to see that sensitivity of\nmethod and instruments are at least ten times higher than the specified values.\n3.3Test for recovery can be done with the sample analysis. Recovery methods are only tools to\nremove the doubt about the applicability of a method. The recovery procedure involves applying the\nmethod to reagent blank, to a series of known standards covering the expected range of concentration\nof the sample, in duplicate run and to recovery sample, prepared by adding known quantities of the\nsubstance to separate portions of sample, each portion equals the same volume (standard addition)",
