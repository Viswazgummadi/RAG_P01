METRIC STEEL SCALES FOR ENGINEERS
( First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.
F O R E W O R D<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 11 May 1970, after the draft finalized by the
Optical and Mathematical Instruments Sectional Committee had been
approved by the Mechanical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.2  This standard was first published in 1961 and is now being revised
for metricization due to complete changeover to metric system in India.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3  In this revision the scales have been classified as end-measuring
and edge-measuring scales and five different types have been included.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4  This edition 2.2 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (March 1983) and
Amendment No. 2 (March 1990). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS : 2 - 1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the requirements for metric scales made of
steel for the use of engineers.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. TYPES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  Metric scales for engineers shall be of following types:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Type A
— End measuring scale, graduated on one edge in
millimetres, every cm graduation marked (  see
Fig. 1 ).
b) Type AA— End measuring scale, graduated on both edges in
millimetres, on same face, every cm graduation
marked (  see  Fig. 1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1481 - 1970<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Type B
— End measuring scale, graduated on one edge in
millimetres, 0 to 5 cm graduated in ½ mm, every cm
graduation marked (  see  Fig. 2 ).
d) Type BB— End measuring scale, graduated on both edges in
millimetres on same face, 0 to 5 cm graduated in
½ mm, every cm graduation marked (  see  Fig. 2 ).
e) Type CC— Edge measuring scale, graduated on both edges in
millimetres on same face, 0 to 5 cm graduated in
½ mm, every cm graduation marked (nominal size
100 only) (  see  Fig. 3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. MATERIAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The scale shall be made of good quality rust-resistant spring steel
or manganese spring steel having 0.55 to 0.65 percent carbon and 0.60
percent manganese, minimum or suitable grade of stainless steel. The
coefficient of expansion of steel shall be (11.0±1.5) × 10 –6   mm per
degree Celsius within the range 0 to 60°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  The blanks shall be cut from sheets or strips and shall be free from
seams, flaws, scales, burrs or other defects. They shall be uniform in
thickness and width throughout the entire length. They shall be
suitably hardened and tempered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. DIMENSIONS AND GRADUATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The principal dimensions of the scales shall be as given in Table 1.<<HEADING_END>>

[Image 4 contains text: aka]
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3  Each scale shall be legibly and indelibly marked with the maker’s
name, initial or recognized trade mark.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.1  Scales may also be marked with the ISI Certification Mark.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — The use of the ISI Certification Mark is governed by the provisions of the
Indian Standards Institution (Certification Marks) Act, and the Rules and
Regulations made thereunder. Presence of this mark on products covered by an
Indian Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced to comply with
the requirements of that standard, under a well-defined system of inspection, testing
and quality control during production. This system, which is devised and supervised
by ISI and operated by the producer, has the further safeguard that the products as
actually marketed are continuously checked by ISI for conformity to the standard.
Details of conditions, under which a licence for the use of the ISI Certification Mark
may be granted to manufacturers or processors, may be obtained from the Indian
Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9. PRESERVATIVE TREATMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1  The scales shall be smeared with a thin coating of mineral jelly or

paper.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10. PACKING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1  The packing of scales shall be as agreed upon between the
manufacturer and the purchaser.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Review of Indian Standards
Amendments are issued to standards as the need arises on the basis of comments. Standards are also
reviewed periodically; a standard along with amendments is reaffirmed when such review indicates
that no changes are needed; if the review indicates that changes are needed, it is taken up for
revision. Users of Indian Standards should ascertain that they are in possession of the latest
amendments or edition by referring to the latest issue of ‘BIS Catalogue’ and ‘Standards : Monthly
