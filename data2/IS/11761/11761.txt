<<PARAGRAPH>>Paper and Pulp Based Packaging Sectional Committee, CHD 016<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Paper and Pulp Based Packaging Sectional Committee had been approved by the Chemical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Paper sacks are good substitute for the conventional jute bags since they are free from seepage and give
better protection from moisture and air. However, care has to be taken for handling them during filling,
storage, and transportation
because the use of hooks is strictly prohibited in this case. Pelletization
of
filled paper sacks during their handling and transportation
gives them an added advantage over the jute
bags.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 19S6. At that time the cement industrywas at experimental stage with
these sacks and only valved-sewn-gussetted
type paper sacks were of use in the country. Over the years
technology has been devclopcd and other type of sacks also now manufactured in the country for packing
cement. In this revision requirements
for sacks with pasted end have been included. Depending on the
development invarious fields requirements of materials, adhesives and drop test have also been modified
in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A scheme for labelling environment
friendly products known as EC0 Mark has been introduced at the
instance of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF), Government of India. The EC0 Mark would
be administered by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) under the  BISAct,  1986 as per the Resolutions
No. 71 dated 21 February 1991 and No. 425 dated 28 October 1992 published in the Gazette of the
Government
of India. For a product to be eligible for marking with EC0 logo, it shall also carry the IS1
Mark of BIS besides meeting additional environment
friendly requirements.
For this purpose, the
Standard Mark of BIS would be a single mark being a combination of the IS1 Mark and the EC0 logo.
Requirements
to be satisfiicd for a product to qualify for the BIS Standard Mark for EC0 friendliness, has
been included in this revision based on the Gazette Notirication No. 364 dated 7 September 1995 for
packaging material/package (Part I Paper Board and Plastics  excluding  laminates) as environment friendly
products published in the Gazette of India.These requirements will be optional; manufacturing units will
be free to opt for the IS1 mark alone also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall he rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (,rlV.~ed)‘. The number of significant places
rctaincd in the rounded off value should bc the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

strength and stretch in the cross and machine direc-
tions by the method detailed in 12.3 of IS 1060
