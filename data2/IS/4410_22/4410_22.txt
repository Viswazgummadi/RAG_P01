<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the
draft
finalized
by
the Terminology
Relating
to River Valley Projects
Sectional
Committee,
had been approved
by the
River Valley Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A large number
of Indian
Standards
have already
been
printed
covering
various
aspects
of river
valley projects
and some more similar
standards
are in the process of formulation.
These standards
include
technical
terms, and precise definitions
for these
are
required
for
avoiding
ambiguity
in
their interpretation.
To achieve
this
aim,
the
Terminology
