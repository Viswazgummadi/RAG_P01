FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian
Standard ( First Revision)
was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 8 October
1974, after the draft finalized by .the
Stones Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Building stones are available in large quantity in various parts of the
country and to choose and utilize them for their satisfactory performance it
is necessary to know the various strength properties determined according to
standard procedure.
This standard had, therefore, been formulated to cover
the standard method for determining the specific gravity, apparent and true
porosity of various stones.
This standard was first published in 1957 and is
being revised based on the actual use of the standard in the past 17 years and
the experience gained in testing of building stones for these properties in the
various research laboratories of this country. In this revision only the property
of true specific gravity has been covered as apparent specific gravity and true
porosity have been covered in IS  :  1124-1974*.
It  is further clarified that
the property of true specific gravity is generally not used for selecting stones
for construction purposes and for this generally apparent specific gravity as
covered in IS  : 1124-1974*  is followed.
However, for research work and
also for certain specialized river valley projects where it is important to know
the total porosity of stone, this property may be needed and hence it has
been retained in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,
it shall be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard lays down the procedure for determining
true  specific
gravity of natural building stones used for constructional purposes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  SELECTION OF SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The sample shall be selected to represent a true average of the  type of
grade of stone under consideration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The sample shall be selected from the quarried stone or taken from  the
natural rock, as described in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and shall be of adequate size to
permit the preparation of the requisite number of test pieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1
Stones from Ledges or Quarries  -The
ledge or quarry face of the
stone shall be inspected
to determine
any variation
in different strata,
Differences
in colour,
texture and structure
shall be observed.
Separate
samples of stone weighing at least 25 kg each of the unweathered specimens
shall be obtained from all strata that appear to vary in colour, texture and
structure.
Pieces that have been damaged
by blasting,
driving wedges,
heating, etc, shall not be included in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Field Stone and Boulders -
A detailed inspection of stone and boulders
over the area shall be made where the supply is to be obtained,
The
different kinds of stone and their condition at various quarry sites shall be
recorded.
Separate samples for each class of stone that would be considered
for use in construction as indicated by visual inspection shall be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 When
perceptible
variations
occur
in the quality of rock, as many
samples as are necessary for determining
the range in properties shall be
selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  TEST SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  From the specimen as selected in 2, take 05 kg of stone.
Thoroughly
wash to remove dust and other coatings from surface and dry the pieces.
Crush the pieces between hardened steel surfaces to a maximum of 3 mm
size particles, thoroughly mix and reduce to a test sample of 50 g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The entire 50 g sample shall be ground in an agate mox&r to such
fineness that it will pass 150-micron
IS Sieve.
Any magnetic material
introduced in crushing or grinding shall be removed by a magnet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

4.5 Weighing Bottle and Desiccator<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 The 50 g  sample shall be placed in a weighing bottle and dried to a
constant weight at 105 to 110°C and cooled in a desiccator.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The
specific gravity bottle with the stopper shall be cleaned, washed
and dried to constant weight at 105 to 1 10°C and cooled in a desiccator and
weighed in an analytical balance ( Wr ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1 The stopper of the specific gravity bottle is removed and about 15 g
of the dried stone powder from the weighing bottle is introduced in the
bottle.
The specific gravity bottle is closed with the stopper and weighed
with the sample ( W, ).
The stopper shall be removed again and distilled
water shall be poured to fill the bottle to about three-fourths of its volume.
Entrapped air shall be removed by boiling gently the contents of the bottle
for at least 10 minutes while occasionally
rolling the bottle to assist in
the removal of the air. The bottle shall then be cooled to room temperature
and then filled fully with distilled water, stoppered and then outside of the
bottle cleaned and dried with a clean dry cloth.
and contents shall then be weighed ( Ws  ) .
The bottle with its stopper<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>then be emptied, cleaned and washed.
The specific gravity bottle shall
It shall then be filled fully with
distilled water, stoppered and weighed at room temperature
(  Wa ).
The
room
temperature
( t )
during
the
test
shall
be
recorded
from
the
thermometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  EVALUATION
AND REPORTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The true specific gravity shall be calculated from the following formula:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>True specific gravity at
PC = -
w, - WI
(w4-w,>-(u’s-w,>
where
t =  room temperature;
WB -  weight in g of the bottle with stopper and powder;
WI  = weight in g of the empty specific gravity bottle with stopper;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>w4
’ =  weight in g of the bottle with stopper filled with distilled
water at room temperature; and
W3 =  weight in g of the bottle with stopper, powder and distilled
water to fill rest of the bottle at room temperature.
6.2 The true specific gravity shall be expressed as a numerical value and
shah be based on average of three determinations.
6.3 Identification
of the sample, date when sample was taken and type of
stone shall be reported.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
