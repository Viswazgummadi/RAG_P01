<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft
finalized
by
the
Housing
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerable
shortage
of houses
in
the
country,
which
is also
increasing
continuously,
has led to
increasing
stress being
laid in the development
programmes
of Central
and
State
governments,
on
facilitating
speedy
and economical
construction
of houses.
Problem
of housing
being
gravest
amongst
the lower income
groups,
both
rural and urban,
the greatest
stress
is being
laid
on
housing
for
these
target
groups.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This calls for development
and standardization
of new building
materials
and
construction
techniques
which are simple
and economical,
commensurate
with structural
and hygienic
safety
and
durability,
in
order
to ensure
speedy
and economical
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
is one of a series of standards
being
processed
by BIS on new materials
and techniques
of
roof/floor
construction
which,
when
implemented,
are likely
to result
in substantial
savings
in materials
and cost of construction,
in addition
to achieving
speedy
construction.
The other
standards
in the series
are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The reinforced
concrete
channel
units
are channel
( inverted
trough
) shaped
precast
beams
which
can
be used
for intermediate
floors and roofs supported
on walls or RCC beams.
There
shape
ensures
more
area of concrete
in compression
zone where it is required
and less area on tension
side
and
thus
they
have an efficient
section.
Further,
being
precast,
use of these units
also
saves
the
cost
of
shuttering,
ensures
better
quality
control
on concrete
and speeds
up construction
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The recommended
width
of the channel
units has been selected
keeping
in view
the
requirements
of
modular
co-ordination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerable
assistance
has been rendered
in the preparation
of this
standard
by the Central
Building
Research
Institute,
Roorkee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard
is given at Annex
B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules

retained
in the rounded

<<PARAGRAPH>>8 TESTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tests shall be conducted
on samples of the units as
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3 The concrete shall be placed in the flange portion
of the unit in such a way as to avoid segregation up to
such a height that it achieves a thickness equal to the
flange of the unit after compaction.
The concrete shall
then be compacted with.a plate vibrator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9 CRITERIA
FOR CONFORMITY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 If four out of the five samples satisfy the dimen-
sional requirements given  in  4.2, the lot represented by
the sample shall be deemed to have passed the dimen-
sional requirements.
If more than one unit fails to
satisfy the dimensional
requirements
given in 4.2, the
lot represented by the sample shall be rejected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4 The trough frame, applied with a bond release
agent on the outer surface (that is, the surface facing
concrete) shall then be kept inside the outer frame and
the flange concrete shall be levelled by moving the
trough to and fro. Afterwards the trough shall be fixed
in position with outer frame.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 In the deflection recovery test as per Annex A, if
the deflection 24 hours after the removal of the imposed
load is at least 75 percent of the deflection
under the
load for 24 hours, the unit shall be deemed to have
passed the test. If the deflection recovery is less than
75 percent, the lot represented
by the unit shall be
rejected.
If the maximum
deflection
in mm shown during 24
hours under load is less than 40  12/D,  where 1 is the
effective span 1 in mm and  D, the  overall depth of the
section in mm, it is not necessary
for the deflection
recovery to be measured and the recovery provision
mentioned in this clause earlier will not apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.5 The web (leg) portion of the channel unit shall
now be filled with concrete, compacted by vibration
with a plate vibrator/needle
vibrator and finished level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.6 The trough frame may be removed gently after
about an hour (depending
upon the weather) after cast-
ing. The outer frame may also be stripped offafterabout
three hours (depending
upon the weather) after casting.
The units shall be left undisturbed
for about 48 hours
and shall be kept wet during this period by occasional
sprinkling
of water or by covering by wet gunny bags.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3  Curing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 In the failure load test as per Annex A, the unit shall
carry a load at least equal to 1.33 times the charac-
teristic load to pass the test. If the load at failure is less
than twice the characteristic load, the lot represented by
the sample shall be rejected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After about 48 hours the units shall be turned upside
down so that the flange is brought to the top. The units
shall then be transported to curing yard by supporting
near the ends and stacked with the trough (flange)
facing up. The units shall be cured for at least 12 days
by keeping
the trough filled with water and further
air-cured.
for another 14 days before placing it in
position in a building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 All the precast reinforced concrete units of the same
size, manufactured
from similar materials and under
similar

7.2 Five units shall be selected at random out of a lot
consisting of 300 units or less. For lots bigger than 300
units 5 units shall be selected for every 300 units or part
thereof. In order to ensure randomness
of selection,
procedure given in IS 4905  :  1968 may be followed.
7.3 The sample shall be marked for future identifica-
tion of the lot it represents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of conditions under which a licence for the use of the
Standard Mark may be granted to manufacturers

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.1 The  unit, which

test. Loading shall be done uniformly through loading
blocks or through hydraulic jacks and a set of beams to
distribute the load. If loading is done through
blocks,
sufficient gap shall1 be provided between adjacent tiers
of blocks to ensure that they do not touch each other
even at the final stages of loading, to prevent transfer
of load to supports
of units through
arch action.
Loading shall preferably be done from an independent
scaffold as a safety preca:ltion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

RECOVERY TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1  One unit selected at random out of the units
which have satisfied dimensional requirement as per  4.2

The precast unit shall be simply supported with a bear-
ing of 75 mm on either end of the unit over concrete
walls with a 6 mm thick M.S. steel plate fried in level
at top of the wall as shown in Fig. 4. Design dead load
other than due to self weight of the unit shall be applied
uniformly over the units through loading blocks or by
other means. A dial gauge having a least count of 0.02
mm or less and a range of 50 mm or more shall be fixed
at midspan of the unit. The dial gauge shall be adjusted
to indicate zero reading under self weight of the unit
and applied dead load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

that the limiting deflection is not exceeded, a steel marker
