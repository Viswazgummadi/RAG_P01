<<PARAGRAPH>>1.  scope
-
Prescribes
the potentiometric
and indicator
methods
for
determination
of alkalinity.
These methods
are applicable.to
determine
alkalinity
in water and wastewater
in the range of 05 to
500 mg/l alkalinity
as CaCO,.
The upper range may be extended
by dilution
of the original
sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Principle
and  Theory
-
Alkalinity
of water is the capacity
of that water to accept protons.
It may
be defined as the quantitative
capacity
of an aqueous
medium to react with hydrogen
ions to pH 8.3
(phenolphthalein
alkalinity)
and then to pH 3.7 (total
alkalinity
or methyl
orange
alkalinity).
The
equation  in its simplest
form is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>CO,-+
H+ = HCO, -
(pH  8.3 )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>From pH 8.3 to 3.7, the following
reaction
may occur:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>HCO, + H+ = HPCO,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. lnferferences
-
Free available
residual
chlorine
markedly
affects the indicator
COlOUr response.
The addition
of minimal
volumes of sodium thiosulphate
eliminates
this interference.
Substances
such
as salt of weak organic
or inorganic
acids present
in large amount
may interfere.
Oils and greases
may  also
interfere
by coating
the electrode.
Coloured
or turbid
samples
may interfere
in end
point.
Analyse  such samples by potentiometric
titration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. Sampling
and Storage
-
Sampling
and storage shall be done as prescribed
in IS:3025 (Part l)-
1986 ‘Methods of  sampling
and test (physical
and chemical)
for water and wastewater:
Part 1 Sampling
(  first revision )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. Sample
Preparation
-
The sample  aliquot
used for analysis
should
be either  free from turbidity
or should be allowed
to settle prior to analysis.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.  Reagents<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Distilled Water -
Distilled
water  used should have pH not less than 6-O. If the water has  pH less
than  6.0, it shall be freshly boiled for  15 minutes
and cooled
to room temperature.
Deionized
water
may  be used provided
that it has a conductance
of less than 2 ).&/cm and a pH more than 6.0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2  Sulphuric Acid -
Dilute
5.6  ml of concentrated
sulphuric
acid  (  relative density l-84) to one litre
with distilled water.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  indicator Method -
Pipette 20 ml or a suitable
aliquot
of sample-into
loo-ml
beaker.
If the pH of
the sample
is over 8.3, then add 2 to 3 drops of phenolphthalein
indicator
and titrate
with standard
sulphuric
acid
solution
till
the pink
colour
observed
by indicator
just
disappears
(equivalence
of pH 8.3).
Record the volume
of standard
sutphuric
acid solution
used.
Add 2 to 3 drops of mixed
indicator
to the solution
in which
the phenolphthalein
alkalinity
has been determined.
Titrate
with
the standard
acid to light pink colour
( equivalence
of pH 3-7 ).
Record the volume of standard
acid
used  after phenolphthalein
alkalinity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.  Potentiometer
Method -
Pipette
20 ml or a suitable
aliquot
of sample
into a loo-ml
beaker and
titrate with standard
sulphuric
acid to pH 8.3 and then to pH 3.7, using a potentiometer.
No indicator
is
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9. Calculation
-
Calculate
alkalinity
in the sample as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Phenolphthalein
alkalinity
(as mg/l of CaCO,)
=
AxNx50000
w<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Total alkalinity
( as mg/l CaCO,  ) =
(A+B)
x N x !5oooO
V<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A  =  ml of standard
sulphuric
acid used to titrate
to pH 83,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B  =  ml of standard
sulphuric
acid used to titrate from pH 8.3 to pH 3.7,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N = normality
of acid  used, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I/ = volume in ml of sample taken for test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alkalinity
of water or wastewater
Is its quantitative
capacity
to react with
a strong.acid
to  a
designated
pH.
Alkalinity
is significant
in many uses and treatments
of natural
and wastewaters.
Alkalinity
measurements
are used in the interpretation
and control
of water and wastewater
treqtment
processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
