<<HEADING level=3>>1.
Scope. -  Prescribes  four methods for determination
of silica as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Gravimetric
method,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Molybdosilicate
method,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Heteropoly
blue method, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d) Automated
method  for molybdate-reactive
silica.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.1 Gravimetric method determines total silica.
Other methods determine molybdate reactive silica.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  Gravimetric
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Prjncjp/e -
Hydrochloric acid decomposes silicates and dissolved silica, forming silicic acids that
are  precipitated
as partially
dehydrated
silica
during
evaporation
and baking.
Ignition
completes
dehydration
of silica,
which
is weighed
and then
volatilized
as silicon
tetrafluoride,
leaving
any
impurities
behind
as non-volatile
residue.
The residue is weighed
and silica is determined
as loss on
volatilization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 /n/arference
-Glassware
contributes
silica and hence avoid its use as far as possible.

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.1.2 First fikrafion -
Add 5 ml of I : 1 hydrochloric
acid, warm
and
add 50 ml of hot distilled
water.
While
the  mixture
is hot,
filter
through
an ashless
medium
textured

as possible.
Wash

and
then
with

until
washings
are chloride-free.

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.1.3
Second
filtration
-
Evaporate
filtrate
and washings
from the above
operation
to dryness
in
the
original
platinum
dish.
Bake
residue
at 110°C
in an oven
or over
a hot
plate
for
30 minutes.
Repeat
steps given
in 2.5.1.2.
Use a separate
filter
paper
and
rubber
policeman
to aid in transferring
residue
from dish to filter.
Take special
care with
porcelain
dishes
because
silica
adheres
to the dish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.1.4
Ignition
-Transfer
the two
filter
papers
( one,
if dehydrated
by 2.5.2 ) and
residues
to a
covered
platinum
crucible
dry at 1IO’C
and ignite
at 1 2OO’C to constant
mass.
Avoid
mechanical
loss
of residue
when
first charring
and burning
off paper by gradual
heating
at minimum
temperature.
Too
rapid
heating
may
form
black
silicon
carbide.
Cool
in desiccator,
weigh
and
repeat
ignition
and
weighing
until
constant
mass is attained.
Record

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.1.5
Volatilization
with hydrofluoric
acid-Thoroughly
moisten
weighed
residue
with
distilled
water.
Add 4 drops
of 1  : 1  sulphuric
acid, followed
by IO ml of hydrofluoric
acid, measuring
the latter
in a plastic
graduated
cylinder.
Slowly
evaporate
to dryness
over
an air bath or hot plate
in a hood
and
avoid
loss
by splattering.
Ignite
crucible
to constant

at 1 2OO’C.
Record

acid
dehydration
-
Follow
procedure
as
given
in 2.5.1.1
until
all but  50  ml of
sample
has been evaporated.
Add 5 ml of perchloric
acid and evaporate
until
dense
white
fumes
appear.
Continue
dehydration
for 10 minutes
Cool,
add 5 ml of 1  I  hydrochloric
acid and 50 ml of hot distilled
water.
Bring to boil
and filter
through
an ashless
quantitative
filter
paper.
Wash thoroughly
ten times
with
hot distilled
water
and proceed
as directed
in  2.5.1.4
and  2.5.1.5.
For many
purposes,
the

Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Principle
-Ammonium
molybdate
at pH about
1’2 reacts
with
silica
and any phosphate
present
to
produce
heteropoly
acids.
Oxalic
acid is added
to destroy
molybdophosphoric
acid.
Even if phosphate
is known
to be absent,
the
addition
of oxalic
acid
is must
in this
method.
The
intensity
of  yellow
colour produced
IS proportional
to concentration
of molybdate
reactive silica.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In at least one of its forms, silica does not react with
molybdate
even though
it is capable
of
passinq
through
the
filter
paper
and
not noticeably
turbid.
It is not known
to what
extent
such
unreactive
silica
l~ccurs
in waters.
Molybdate
unreactive
silica
can be converted
into molybdate
reactive
form by heating
or fusing with alkali.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Procedure
-
Set up manifold
as shown
in Fig. 1 and follow
the instructions
prescribed
by the
manufacturer.
Determine absorbance
at 660 nm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6  Calculation
-
Prepare standard curves by plotting
peak heights of standards processed through
the
manifold
against silica (  as  SiOz ) concentration
in standards.
Compute samples of SiO, concentratibn
by comparing
sample peak height with standard  curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Silicon
ranks next to oxygen
in abundance
on earth’s crust.
The silica
content
of natural
waters is in the range of 1 to 30 mg/l.
Silica
in water
is undesirable
for a number
of industrial
uses
because
it forms
difficult
to remove
silica
and silicate
scales
in equipment,
particularly
on high
pressure steam turbine
blades.
It is possible to convert various forms of silica to the molybdate
reactive
form for determination
by methods
given in this standard.
Gravimetric
method determines
more than
one
form
of
silica.
It will
determine
all dissolved
silica
and some colloidally
dispersed
silica.
Gravimetric
method
may be used to standardize
sodium
silicate
solutions
used as standards
in other
methods for determination
of silica.
Molybdosilicate
method is recommended
for relatively
pure waters
having 0.4 to 25 mg of SiO, per litre and gravimetric
method is not recommended
when samples contain
less than 20 mg SiOs/l.
The range can be extended
by diluting,
concentrating
or by varying
light path.
Interferences
due to tannin,
colour
and turbidity
are more severe with
this method
as compared to
hetropoly
blue method.
The yellow
colour produced
has a limited
stability
and attention
to timing
is
necessary.
The colour
developed
in molybdosilicate
and hetropoly
blue methods are affected
by high
concentrations
of salts.
Hetropoly
blue method
is recommended
for low range, from 0’04 to 2 mg
SiOz:l.
Hetropoly
blue method shall be the refree method,
This standard supersedes
30 of IS : 3025
1964 ‘Methods
of sampling
and test ( physical
and chemical ) for water used in industry’.
In the pre-
paration
of this standard, considerable
assistance
has been derived
from
Standard
Methods
for the
Examination
of
Water
and Wastewater,
published
by the American
Public
Health
Association,
Washington,
USA, 16th Edition,
