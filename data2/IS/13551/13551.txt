<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>adopted by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft finalized by
t  Dissipaters
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the River Valley<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was
Spillways Including Energy
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spillway piers are erected over the crest profile and are provided to divide the spillway into number of
bays so as to control the flow over the spillway by installing gates between two piers. Piers are also used
to support the bridge over the spillway for the movement of gantry crane and normal traffic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is prepared to guide the designers,
for the structural
design of spillway pier and crest,
based on the practices being followed in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied
with, the
final values, observed or calculated,
expressing the results of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised)‘.
The number of  signi-
ficant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the
specified
value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The pier should be designed for the most critical
loading
combination.
When one of the spillway
gate is open and the adjacent
is closed, the
transverse
horizontal
force
on the pier will be
maximum.
Thereforr+.the
forces
should be cal-
culated for this condrtton.
Longitudinal
horizon-
tal forces would be maximum
when both
the
gates adjacent
to the pier are in closed position
( however,
this condition
generally would not
be critical ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Zone 3 -. In this zone,
there
are no major
forces,
therefore
minimum
reinforcement
of
25 mm diameter @ 30 cm c,‘c may be provided.
However,
minimum reinforcement
should not be
less than either 25 percent of the reinforcement
in Zone 1 or 50 percent of the reinforcement
in
Zone 2. Maximum
reinforcement
obtained
out
of the above three
conditions
should be provi-
ded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On account
of the geometry of spillway cre:,t
profile, tensile stresses are developed in the crest
because of the loads acting over it. Reinforcc-
ment needs to be provided
to take care of these
tensile
stresses.
The
minimum
thickness
of
structural
concrete
provided
for spillway_erest
is l-5 m, measured
normally.
However this has
to be suitably
increased
to accommodate
the
anchorage
below the piers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2 The pier reinforcement
should be designed
according
to IS 456  :  1978, assuming the pier as
an eccentric
column
for the vertical
and hori-
zontal
loads as calculated
in 3.3 and bending
moments
as calculated
in 3.4.1. The stress in
steel and concrete
should
be ensured to be in
permissible
limits
( see Fig. 3 for typical rein-
forcement
detail ). The
permissible
stress
in
steel reinforcement
may be t.aken as 80 percent
of the value specified in TS 456  :  1978.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The tensile stresses are also developed below the
pier and, therefore,
horizontal
as well as vertical
anchorages
are required
to be provided.
The
details
of design of anchorage
are given in
IS 12720  :  1992 and design aid for anchorages

<<PARAGRAPH>>ix) Thermal loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under normal cases, a major portion of the end
pier may be resting
against
the non-overflow
dam adjacent
to the spillway. Therefore,
only a
nominal reinforcement
on the spillway face of
the pier may be provided,
which
should not be
less than
25 mm diameter
@ 30 cm c/c,
The
reinforcement
for the portion of the pier which
is not resting
against
the
non-overflow
dam
should
be designed
according
to 3.3 and 3.4
( see Fig. 4 and
5 for typical
reinforcement
details ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Design Loading Condition<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The spillway crest
should be designed
fJr
~he
tensile stresses set up near the crest due to loads
acting
over it as mentioned
in 4.2. For the
purpose
of design
the
critical
tensile
stres,,
should
be calculated
for
the
worst
loading
combination
as given in 4.1 of IS 6.512 : 1984.
However,
these
should bc calculated
for the
following three regions as shown in Fig. 6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
