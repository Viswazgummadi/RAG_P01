<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau af Indian
Standards
after the
draft finalized by the Building Lime and Lime Products
Sectional
committee
had been approved by the
Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lime-pozzolana
mixture concrete
is found to have many desirable properties
advantageous
for use in
road and building
construction.
The values of drying
shrinkage
of lime-pozzolana
mixture concrete
have been observed to vary from 0.019 to 0.040 percent which comperes favourably
with values of 0.024
to 0,038 percent
and O-043 to 0.058 percent
respectively
for plain
cement
and pozzolana
cement
concrete
of 1  :  5 and 1  :  6 nominal
mix proportions.
The drying
shrinkage
values of lean
cement
concrete
of mix proportions
1  :  16 and 1  :  20 are of the order of 0.06 to O-09 percent.
From these, it is
seen that lime-pozzolana
mixture concrete
undergoes
only negligible
volume change after setting and
initial shrinkage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Well compacted
lime-pozzolana
mixture concrete is also found to be less permissible because
it is more
cohesive and plastic in nature than cement concrete
of.equivalent
strength. The bond strength
between
lime-pozzolana
mixture concrete
and cement concrete
is found to be of the order of l-5 to 2.0 MPa
when the time interval between laying of two layers in road and other pavement
work is not more than
one hour.
Because of this characteristic,
it is found that
lime pozzolana
mixture
concrete
can be
advantageously
employed as a bonded underlay under thin cement
concrete
surfacing to obtain a com-
posite, economical
rigid pavement
wherein the shear stresses
developed at the inter-face
of the two
layers are taken care of by the bond strength developed
between the two layers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1970. This revision has been prepared
with a view to incorporate
the modifications
and improvements
found necessary
in the light of experience
gained during the use
of this standard. In addition to giving reference
to the latest
Indian Standards, this revision also incor-
porates the details of lime-pozzolana
mixture concrete
made with quick setting lime-pozzolana
mixture
according to IS 10772  :  1983 ‘Specification
for quick setting lime-pozzolana
mixture’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.  The number of sign&
cant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

only where the
strength

to exceed
those specified for different

<<PARAGRAPH>>Properly
prepared,
compacted
and laid lime-
pozzolana
mixture
concrete
is durable
under
normal
exposures.
Such
concrete
possesses
considerable
resistance
to sulphate
attack and
can be used in foundations,
and in areas where
the soil contains considerable
amount of soluble
sulphate and sub-soil water table is high.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 When
properly
prepared
and laid, lime-
pozzolana mixture concrete applied as roof finish
serves as an efficient
water-tight
material
and
does not usually need any further finishing treat-
ment thereon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 STRENGTH
CHARACTERISTICS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Mix Proportions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Lime-pozzolana
mixture
concrete
pos>esses
compressive
and flexural
strengths
comparable
to those of lean cement
concretes.
For deter-
mination
of compressive
and flexural strength of
lime-pozzolana
mixture
concrete,
the methods
applicable
for lime concrete,
given in IS 2541  :
1974 may be used.
The tests shall be made at
28 days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guidance
about the mix proportions
to be used
in the preparation
of lime-pozzolana
mixture
concrete
for different
situations
of use may be
obtained from Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Workability<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of very good water retention
properties
of lime-pozzolana
mortars,
the workability
of
lime-pozzolana
mixture
concrete
will be found
satisfactory
with normal
conditioning
of con-
crete.
The
lime-pozzolana
mixture
concrete
mixes generally appear to be dry, but are found
workable
during
compaction.
Lime-pozzolana
mixture
concrete
with slumps as low as 15 mm
have been found to be satisfactory
in practice
for a wide range of use. It is desirable to arrive
at suitable
mix proportions
of lime-pozzolana
concrete
taking
into
account
the details
of
requirements
of work and facilities for compac-
tion available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Lime-pozzolana
mixture
concrete
has rea-
sonably high flexural and ultimate strain-taking
capacity.
In view of these properties,
it cau be
used with advantage
to  lay  road bases or bonded
underlays, foundations
and, floor concretes,
etc.
Compared to crushed stone
bases, lime-pozzo-
lana mixture
concrete
base course spread the
load over a much larger
area due to its flexural
rigidity in the same manner as a rigid base does,
thus reducing
the
stress
on the subgrade and
inducing smaller deflection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 The bond strength
between
lime-pozzolana
mixture concrete
and cement
concrete
is of the
order of I.5 to 2-O MPa, when the time interval
between laying the two layers is not more than
one hour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Rate of Hardening and Setting Time<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hardening of lime-pozzolana
mixture
con-
crete will depend on the lime reactivity
of the
pozzolana
and in general be slower than that of
cement concrete but will be satisfactory
for most
of the normal uses to which it is put in building
and road works.
Higher the lime reactivity
of
the pozzolana
the quicker
will be the rate of
setting
and hardening
of the lime-pozzolana
mixture
concrete.
In case of structural
lime-
pozzolana
mixture
concrete
subjected to loads,
such as in foundations,
the work of superstruc-
ture shall not be started
earlier
than a period
of seven days after concrete
has been laid and
consolidated.
This condition
is however
not
.applicable in case of composite
rigid pavement
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.2
Hand Mixing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2.1
Mixing shall be done ‘on a clean, water-
tight
platform
of
sufficient
-size to
provide
sample mixing
area.
The
platform
shall have
tight close joints so that there is no leakage of
water or mortar
through
them
and the mixing
tool does not strike the
joints
while in opera-
ti0fI.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3 Heavy rammers shall be used and ramming
shall be continued
until a skin of mortar covers
the surface and completely
hides the aggregate
( iron rammers weighing 4.50 to 5.50 kg and not
more
than
30 000 mm2 in area are
generally
found satisfactory
). Square rammers are helpful
for compaction
of edges. No water shal1 be
added during ramming. Where joints in the same
layer
are unavoidable,
the end of each layer
shall be sloped at an angle of 30° and made
rough to ensure proper
bond with new concrete.
The surface of each completed
layer
shall be
watered, roughened
and cleaned by wire brush-
ing or any other suitable
means before the next
layer is laid over it. Where vertical joints occur
in an upper and a lower layer they shall be at
least 600 mm apart horizontally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2.2 The coarse
aggregate .shall first be stac-
ked on an even
surface
on the
platform.
The
required quantity
of fine aggregate and the lime
pozzolana
mixture shall then be dry mixed by a
shovel separately.
This mixture
shall be evenly
spread over the coarse
aggregate and the whole
thoroughly mixed. The required quantity of water
shall be applied
with a sprinkler
over the top
surface and mixing
shall be done by turning it
over several
times, until
all the particles
of
aggregates are covered
with mortar
and con-
crete of uniform
appearance
and consistency
is
obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.4 The mixing and ramming shall go on con-
tinuously when once started,
relief parties being
provided to avoid stoppage.
This may be achie-
ved by arranging workmen in one or more lines
across the width of the concrete,
with a lateral
space of not more than
450 mm per man. Suffi-
cient labour and materials
shall be employed to
make up the concrete
foundations,
layer
by
layer,
simultaneously
throughout
the
whole
building when this is not practicable,
unfinished
layers of concrete
shall break joints as described
in 8.2.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.3  Machine Mixing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Saturated
surface dry coarse aggregate shall first
be fed into
the mixer.
The
quantities
of sand
and lime-pozzolana
mixture shall then be added
to the mixer. Part of the water shall thereafter
be added and the contents
mixed.
The remain-
ing quantity
of water shall then be finally added
and the contents~mixed
well. The total time of
mixing shall not
be less than
2 minutes,
and
should be sufIicient to ensure uniform mixing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 LAYING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.5 For large areas, where the thickness of the
foundation
concrete to be laid and compacted
is
150 mm or more, a needle vibrator shall be used
to compact the mass of concrete
till wet mortar
just-appears
at the top
surface of the layer to
be compacted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Only that
much
quantity
of concrete
shall be
mixed which can be laid in position within two
hours after mixing. The concrete shall preferably
be placed in position
immediately
after mixing
has been completed.
Laying and compaction
of
concrete
shall be completed
within four hours
of adding water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
Generally
concrete
laid
in 200 mm thick
layers gives thoroughly
compacted
layer of 150 mm
thickness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.6  Curing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2  Lime-pozzolana Mixture Concrete in Founda-
tions and Under Floors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.6.1 After laying and compaction
has been
completed,
lime-pozzolana
mixture
concrete
shall be cured for the first
48  h by covering
it with wet hessian and for a further
period of
not less than
10 day by spreading wet sand or
gunny bags and watering frequently
in moderate
quantities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.1  The bed of ground where concrete isto be
laid shall be properly wetted and rammed before
concreting
is started.
Guidance
about the mix
proportions
