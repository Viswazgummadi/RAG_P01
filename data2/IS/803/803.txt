MILD STEEL CYLINDRICAL WELDED
OIL STORAGE TANKS
( First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
F O R E W O R D
0.1  This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 27 September 1976, after the draft finalized by
the Structural Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Structural and Metals Division Council and Civil Engineering
Division Council.
0.2  This code has been prepared with a view to providing the petroleum
industry with tanks of adequate safety and reasonable economy which
can be built in any size required to meet the needs of the industry subject
to limitations given in the code and also to establishing uniform practice
for design, fabrication, erection, testing and inspection of oil storage
tanks.
0.3  This code does not present nor it is contemplated to establish, a fixed
series of allowable tank sizes; but it is intended to promote the selection
by the purchaser, of the size of tank that may be required to meet his
particular need.
0.4  This standard was first published in 1962. The following
modifications have been made in this revision:
a) The use of steel conforming to IS : 226-1975*, IS : 2002-1962†,
IS : 2041-1962‡ and IS : 961-1975§ has been permitted in addition to
steel conforming to IS : 2062-1969 || .
b) Provisions regarding design of various members of the tank have
been elaborated, an appendix dealing with the alternate design for
tank shell has been included.
c) Provisions regarding radiographic inspection of shell joints have
been made.
d) An appendix dealing with the normal and emergency venting
requirements of the tanks has been added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>e) An appendix furnishing the design and construction requirements of
pontoon type, double deck type floating roof tanks has also been
included in this code.
0.5  This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (November 1984).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of
the amendment.
0.6  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
code is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS : 2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in this code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This code covers materials, design, fabrication, erection and testing
requirements for mild steel cylindrical welded oil storage tanks in various
sizes and capacities, for erection above ground, of the following designs:
a) Fixed roof tanks (  see  Fig. 1 ) having no internal pressure or nominal
internal pressure where the resultant upward force does not exceed
the nominal weight of metal in tank shell, roof and any framing
supported by the shell or roof; and
b) Open top tanks (  see  Fig. 2 ).
1.1.1  This code specifies the use of only butt welded shells and includes
reference to appurtenances and mountings.
1.2  This code is complementary to IS : 800-1962† and IS : 816-1969‡.
Provisions regarding permissible stresses, design, fabrication and
erection as included in IS : 800-1962† shall apply unless specified
otherwise in this code.
1.3  This code is intended to guide both purchasers and manufacturers of
petroleum products storage tanks. Provisions of this code may also be
applied to design and construct tanks for storage of water, acids and
chemicals. In such cases, special considerations regarding lining,
corrosion allowance and foundation shall be made while designing the
tanks for the intended service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. DEFINITIONS AND SYMBOLS
2.1  For the purpose of this code, the definitions for welding terms
employed in this standard shall be according to IS : 812-1957§.
2.2  Symbols for welding used on plans and drawings shall be according to
IS : 813-1961 || .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Design of Shell Plates
6.3.1   Loads
6.3.1.1  Stresses in the tank shell shall be computed on the assumption
that the tank is filled with water of specific gravity 1.00 or the liquid to be
stored, if heavier than water. The tension in each course shall be
computed at 30 cm above the centre line of the lower horizontal joint of
the course in question.
6.3.1.2  Isolated radial loads on tank shells, such as caused by heavy loads
from platforms and elevated walkways between tanks, shall be
distributed appropriately, preferably in a horizontal position.
6.3.1.3  Wind and internal vacuum loads shall be considered together to
check the stability of tank shells. Wind loads shall be as specified in
Fig. 1A of IS : 875-1964*. Internal vacuum in the tank shall be specified
by the purchaser; however, a minimum of 500 N/m 2  (50 kg/m 2 ) vacuum
shall be considered.
6.3.2  Joint Efficiency Factor  — This shall be taken as 0.85 for double
welded butt joints, to determine the minimum thickness of shell plates
computed from the stress on the vertical joints, subject to all vertical and
horizontal butt welds being spot radiographed as recommended by this
code. Where welds are not to be so examined by radiography, the joint
efficiency factor considered for design shall be 0.70.
6.3.3   Plate Thicknesses
6.3.3.1  The minimum thickness of shell plates shall not be less than that
calculated from the following formula or as specified in  6.3.3.2  whichever
is greater:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3.3  The nominal thickness of shell plates refers to the tank shell as
constructed and is based on stability rather than stress. Any required
corrosion allowance for the shell plates shall be added to the calculated
thickness of  6.3.3.1 , unless otherwise specified by the purchaser.
6.3.3.4  The maximum nominal thickness of tank shell plates shall be
40 mm, except that insert plates up to 75 mm thickness inclusive shall be
permitted for material conforming to IS : 2002-1962* Grade 2B and
IS : 2041-1962† steels.
6.3.3.5  The width of the shell plate shall be as agreed to between the
purchaser and the manufacturer, but preferably should not be less than
1 500 mm.
6.3.3.6  Stability of tank shells against external loads shall be checked by
determining the maximum height of the shell from the tap curb angle or
wind girder that does not buckle under this loading and providing
stiffening to the shell if required.
The maximum height of unstiffened shell, in metres, shall not exceed

p
= sum of all external pressures acting on the tank shell, that is,
wind pressure and internal vacuum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An initial calculation shall be made using the thickness of the top shell
course. Further calculations shall be made by considering the weighted
average thickness of the top course and part or all of the next lower
course, or courses, till the value  H 1  equals or is less than the height of
shell used in determining the average thickness.
When such a value of  H 1  is obtained, an intermediate wind girder shall
be provided on the shell at a distance below the top wind girder of curb
angle, equal to or less than the height of shell used in determining the
average thickness.
Minimum distance from this girder to the nearest horizontal joint in
the shell shall be 150 mm. The required minimum section modulus in
cubic centimetres of this girder shall be determined by the equation:
Z  = 0.059  D 2 H 1
This formula is applicable for total external pressures up to 1 470 N/m 2
(150 kgf/m 2 ). For greater external pressures  P , required minimum section
modulus of this girder is computed by multiplying above equation by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P

----------<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or
where  P  is in N/m 2  or kgf/m 2  respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thereafter, the rest of the shell below this intermediate girder shall be
checked in the same manner considering this girder as the top of the tank.
If value of  H 1  continues to be greater than the height of shell used in
determining the average thickness, the shell is considered stable against
the external loads that are considered and no intermediate girder is
required.
6.3.4   Shell Plate Arrangement
6.3.4.1  The shell shall be designed to have all courses truly vertical. The
centre-line of each course shall be on top of the centre-line of the course
immediately below or alternatively the inside surfaces of offset horizontal
butt joints shall be kept flush, as desired by the purchaser. The system of
construction to be followed should be specified in the order.
6.3.4.2  Vertical joints in adjacent shell courses shall not be in alignment
but shall be offset from each other as large a distance as possible but in no
case less than a distance of 5 t ,  t  being the plate thickness of the thicker
course at the point of offset.
6.3.5   Shell Joints
6.3.5.1  Vertical and horizontal joints  — All vertical and horizontal joints
shall be of double-welded butt construction with complete penetration and
fusion through the full thickness of the parent plate. Suggested forms of
joints are shown in Fig. 6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.7   Circular Shell Openings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.7.1  Opening in tank shells larger than 64 mm in diameter shall be
reinforced. The minimum cross-sectional area of the reinforcement shall
be not less than the product of the vertical diameter of the hole cut in the
tank shell and the shell plate thickness required under  6.3.3.1 . The cross-
sectional area of the reinforcement shall be measured along the vertical
axis passing through the centre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.7.2  If a thicker shell plate is used than is required for the hydrostatic
loading and corrosion allowance (  see   6.3.3.3  ), the excess shell plate
thickness, within a vertical distance, both above and below the centre-line
of the hole in the tank shell plate, equal to the vertical dimension of the hole
in the tank shell plate, may be considered as reinforcement, and the thickness
T  of the opening reinforcement plate may be decreased accordingly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.7.3  All effective reinforcements shall be made within a distance, above
or below the centre-line of the shell opening, equal to the vertical<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>dimensions of the hole in the tank shell plate. The reinforcement may be
provided within a vertical distance, both above and below the centre-line
of the hole in the shell, equal to the vertical dimension of the hole in the
tank shell plate by any one, or by any combination, of the following:
a) The reinforcing plate;
b) The portion of the neck of the fitting which may be considered as
reinforcement according to  6.3.7.4 ; and
c) Any excess shell plate thickness, beyond that required under  6.3.3.1 ,
and corrosion allowance.
6.3.7.4  The following portions of the neck of a fitting may be considered as
part of the area of reinforcement:
a) The portion extending outwardly from the outside surface of the
tank shell plate for a distance equal to four times the neck wall
thickness or, if the neck wall thickness is reduced within this
distance, to the point of transition;
b) The portion lying within the shell plate thickness; and
c) The portion extending inwardly from the inside surface of the tank
shell plate for a distance as specified under  6.3.7.4 (a).
6.3.7.5  The aggregate strength of the weld attaching a fitting to the shell
plate, or to an intervening reinforcing plate, or to both, shall equal at least
the proportion of the forces passing through the entire reinforcement
which is computed to pass through the fitting considered.
6.3.7.6  The aggregate strength of the weld attaching any intervening
reinforcing plate to the shell plate shall at least equal to proportion of the
forces passing through the entire reinforcement which is computed to
pass through the reinforcing plate considered.
6.3.7.7  The attachment welding to the shell, along the outer periphery of
the reinforcing plate, shall be considered effective only for the parts lying
outside the area bounded by vertical lines drawn tangent to the shell
opening. The outer peripheral welding, however, shall be applied
completely around the reinforcement. All the inner peripheral welding
shall be considered effective.
The strength of the effective attachment welding shall be considered as
its shear resistance at the stress values given for fillet welds under  5.2 .
The outer peripheral weld shall be of a size not less than 0.5  t min  where
t min  is the smaller of 20 mm or the thickness less corrosion allowance of
either of the parts joined by a fillet weld or groove weld; except that when
low type nozzles are used with the reinforcing plate extending to the tank
bottom, the size of that portion of the peripheral weld which attaches the
reinforcing plate to the bottom plate shall conform to  6.2.4 . The inner
peripheral welding shall be large enough to sustain the remainder of the
loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_34>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figures 11 and 12 show acceptable methods of attachment. For
convenience fillet sizes for one type of attachment are given in Table 9,
and Table 10 respectively for manholes and nozzles. For other types of
attachments, fillet sizes shall be determined according to  6.3.7.5 ,  6.3.7.6
and  6.3.7.7 .
6.3.7.8  When two or more openings are located so close that their normal
reinforcing plate edges are closer than ten times the thickness of the
thicker reinforcing plate with a minimum of 150 mm, they shall be
treated and reinforced as follows:
a) All such openings shall be included in a single reinforcing plate,
which shall be proportioned for the largest opening in the group;
b) If the normal reinforcing plates for the smaller openings in the
group, considered separately, would fall within the area limits of the
solid portion of normal plate for the largest opening, the smaller
openings may be included in a normal plate for the largest openings
without increase in size of that plate; provided, however, that if any
opening intersects the vertical centre-line of another, the total width
of the final reinforcing plate along the vertical centre-line of either
opening shall be not less than the sum of the widths of the normal
plates for the openings involved; and
c) If the normal reinforcing plates for the smaller openings, considered
separately, would not fall within the area limits of the solid portion
of a normal plate for the largest opening, the group reinforcing plate
size and shape shall be such as to include the outer limits of the
normal reinforcing plates for all of the openings in the group.
Change of size from the outer limits of the normal plate for the
largest opening to the outer limits of that for the smaller opening
farthest therefrom shall be by uniform straight taper unless the
normal plate for any intermediate opening would extend beyond the
limits so fixed, in which case uniform straight tapers shall join the
outer limits of the several normal plates. Provisions under  6.3.7.8
(b) with respect to openings on the same or adjacent vertical centre-
lines shall also apply in this case.
6.3.7.9  Reinforcement for non-circular openings shall be given special
consideration.
6.3.8   Design of Wind Girders for Open-Top Tanks
6.3.8.1  Open top tanks shall be provided with stiffening rings to maintain
roundness when the tank is subjected to wind loads. Stiffening rings shall
be located at or near the top course, and preferably on the outside of the
tank shell.
6.3.8.2  The required minimum section modulus of the wind girder shall
be determined by the following formula:
Z  = 0.059  D 2 H<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>30<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_35>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Z  = section modulus in cm 3 ,
D  = normal diameter of tank in m, and
H  = height of tank shell in m including any ‘free board’ provided
above the maximum filling height as guide for the floating roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stiffening ring having a section modulus given by the above formula is
adequate for external pressures (wind + vacuum) up to 1 470 N/m 2  (150
kgf/mm 2 ). For greater external pressure  P , required section modulus of
the stiffening ring shall be computed by multiplying above equation by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P
1 470
---------------
P
150
----------<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(or
where  P  is in kgf/m 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.8.3  The section modulus of the stiffening ring shall be based upon the
properties of the applied members and may include a portion of the tank
shell for a distance of 16 plate thicknesses below and, if applicable, above
the ring shell attachment. When curb angles are attached to the top edge
of the shell ring by butt welding, this distance shall be reduced by the
width of the vertical leg of the angle. Section modulii values for typical
ring members are given in Table 7.
6.3.8.4  Stiffening rings may be made of either structural section, formed
plate section, or sections built-up by welding, or of combinations of such
types of sections assembled by welding. The outer periphery of stiffening
rings may be circular or polygonal. Built-up stiffening rings using flats
and bars are permitted subject to purchaser’s approval.
6.3.8.5  The minimum size of angle for use along, or as component in a
built-up stiffening ring, shall be 60 × 60 × 6 mm. The minimum nominal
thickness of plate for use in formed or built-up stiffening rings shall be
6 mm.
6.3.8.6  When stiffening rings are located more than 0.6 m below the top of
the shell, the tank shall be provided with a 60 × 60 × 5 mm top curb angle
for 5 mm shells, and with a 75 × 75 × 6 mm angle for shell greater than
5 mm. Other rolled sections of equivalent section modulus may also be
used.
6.3.8.7  Rings of such design that liquid may be trapped thereon shall be
provided with adequate drain holes.
6.3.8.8  Stiffening rings or portions thereof, which are regularly used as a
walkway, shall have a width not less than 0.6 m clear of the projecting
curb angle on the top of the tank-shell, shall be located preferably 1 m
below the top of the curb angle, and shall be provided with a standard
railing on the unprotected side and at the ends of the section so used.
6.3.8.9  When a stair opening is installed through a stiffening ring, the
section modulus of that portion of the ring outside the opening, and including
the transition section, shall conform to the requirements of  6.3.8.2 . The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_36>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>shell adjacent to such opening shall be stiffened with an angle, or bar, placed
horizontally. The other sides of the opening shall be stiffened with an angle,
or bar, placed vertically. The cross-sectional area of these rim stiffeners
shall be at least equivalent to the cross-sectional area of that portion of
shell included in the section modulus calculations of the stiffening ring
(  see  6.3.8.8  ). These stiffeners, or additional members, shall furnish a
suitable tee board around the opening. The stiffening members shall extend
beyond the end of the opening for a distance equal to or greater than the
minimum depth of the regular ring section. The end stiffening members
shall frame into the side stiffening members and shall be connected to them
in such a manner as to develop their full strength.
6.3.8.10  Supports shall be provided for all stiffening rings when the
dimension of the horizontal leg or web exceeds 16 times the leg or web
thickness. Such supports shall be spaced at intervals as required for the
dead load and vertical live load that may be placed upon the ring.
However, the spacing shall not exceed 24 times the width of the outside
compression flange.
6.3.8.11  Continuous seal welds of about 3 mm shall be used for all joints
which, because of their location, may be subjected to corrosion from
entrapped moisture or cause rust markings on the tank shell. Full
penetration butt welds shall be used for jointing ring sections.
6.3.9  An alternate method for design of tank shells is dealt with in

<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Designs of Roof<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1  Definitions  — The following definitions shall apply to designs of
roofs.
6.4.1.1  Supported cone roof  — A roof formed to approximately the surface
of a right cone, with its principal support provided by either rafters on
girders and columns or rafters on trusses with or without columns.
6.4.1.2  Self-supporting cone roof  — A roof formed to approximately the
surface of a right cone, supported only at its periphery.
6.4.1.3  Self-supporting dome roof  — A roof formed to approximately a
spherical surface, supported only at its periphery.
6.4.1.4  Self-supporting umbrella roof  — A modified dome roof so formed
that any horizontal section is a regular polygon with as many sides as
there are roof plates, supported only at its periphery.
6.4.2   General
6.4.2.1  All roofs and supporting structures shall be designed to support
dead load, plus a uniform live load of not less than 1 225 N/m 2  (125
kgf/m 2 ) of projected area.
6.4.2.2  Roof plates shall have a minimum nominal thickness of 5 mm. A
greater thickness may be required for self-supporting roofs (  see   6.4.5  and
6.4.6  ).
6.4.2.3  Roof plates of supported cone roofs shall not be attached to the
supporting members.
6.4.2.4  All internal and external structural members of the roof shall
have a minimum nominal thickness, in any component, of 4.5 mm.
6.4.2.5  Roof plates shall be attached to the top angle of the tank with a
continuous fillet weld on the top side only.
If the continuous fillet weld between the roof plates and the top angle
does not exceed 5 mm and the slope of the roof at the top angle
attachment does not exceed 1 in 6, the joint may be considered to be
frangible and, in case of excessive internal pressure, will fail before
failure occurs in the tank shell joints or the shell-to-bottom joint. Failure
of the roof-to-shell joint may be accompanied by buckling of the top angle.
Where the weld size exceeds 5 mm or where the slope of the roof at the
top-angle attachment is greater than 1 in 6, emergency venting devices in
accordance with Appendix C shall be provided by the purchaser. The
manufacturer shall provide a suitable tank connection for the device.
6.4.2.6  Roof plate shall be lapped with a minimum overlap of 25 mm and
shall be welded with a continuous fillet weld on the top side only. Laps
shall be arranged as shown in Fig. (A) or (B) of Fig. 7 for roof plate joint
depending on the local conditions by agreement between the purchaser
and the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_41>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.2.7  For all types of roofs, the plates may be stiffened by sections
welded to the plates but not to the supporting rafters and/or girders.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.3  Permissible Stresses  — All parts of the structure shall be so
proportioned that the sum of the maximum static stresses shall not
exceed the permissible stresses given in IS : 800-1962*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.4  Supported Cone Roofs  — The design of supported cone roof shall
conform to the following:
a) Roof plates shall be welded on the top side with continuous full-fillet
welds on all seams. The size of the roof-to-top angle weld shall be 5
mm or smaller if so specified by the purchaser.
b) The slope of the roof shall be 1 in 16 or greater as specified by the
purchaser. If the rafters are set directly on chord girders producing
slightly varying rafter slopes, the slope of the flattest rafter shall
conform to the specified or ordered roof slope.
c) Main supporting members, including those supporting the rafters,
may be rolled or fabricated section or trusses, with or without
supporting columns. Although these members may be in contact
with the roof plates, the compression flange of a member or the top
chord of a truss shall be considered to receive no lateral support
from the roof plates and shall be laterally braced, if necessary, by
other acceptable methods.
d) Structural members, serving as rafters, may be rolled or fabricated
sections. Rafters in direct contact with the roof plates applying the
loading to the rafters may be considered to receive adequate lateral
support from the friction between the roof plates and the
compression flanges of the rafters, with the following exceptions:
(1) Trusses and open-web joists used as rafters,
(2) Rafters having a nominal depth greater than 375 mm, and
(3) Rafters having a slope greater than 1 in 6.
e) Rafters shall be spaced so that, in the outer ring, their centres shall
not be more than 2 m measured along the circumference of the tank.
Spacing on inner rings shall not be greater than 1.75 m. When
specified by the purchaser for tanks located in areas subject to
earthquake, 20 mm diameter tie rods (or equivalent) shall be placed
between the rafters in the outer rings. These tie rods may be omitted
if I or H sections are used as rafters.
f) Roof columns shall be made from structural shapes or pipes or
built-up sections. Suitable base frames or reinforcing pads shall be
provided at the column base to distribute loads coming on the tank
bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

shell. Columns shall not be rigidly attached to the bottom plate.
Guide clips shall be welded to the tank bottom to prevent lateral
movement of columns. All other structural attachments shall be
either bolted, riveted, or welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.3 Number and Location of Radiographs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3.1  Radiographs shall be taken as follows:
a)  Vertical joints  — One spot radiograph shall be taken in the first 3 m
of completed vertical joint of each type and thickness welded by each
welder or welding operator. Thereafter, without regard to the
number of welders or welding operators working thereon, one
additional spot radiograph shall be taken in each additional 25 m
(approximately), and any remaining major fraction thereof, of
vertical joints of the same type and thickness. At least 25 percent of
the selected spots shall be at junctions of vertical and horizontal
joints, with a minimum of two such intersections per tank.
b)  Horizontal joints  — Where complete penetration and complete
fusion are specified, one spot radiograph shall be taken in the first
3 m of completed horizontal joint of the same type and thickness
(based on the thickness of the thicker plate at the joint), without
regard to the number of welders or welding operators working
thereon. Thereafter, one radiograph shall be taken in each
additional 50 m (approximately) and any remaining major fraction
thereof, of horizontal joint of the same type and thickness.
c) For the purpose of this section, plates shall be considered of the same
thickness when the difference in the specified or design thickness
does not exceed 0.8 mm.
d) When two or more tanks are erected in the same location for the
same purchaser, either concurrently or continuously, the number of
spot radiographs to be taken may be based on the aggregate length
of welds of the same type and thickness in each group of tanks
rather than on the length of weld in each individual tank.
11.3.2  It is to be recognized that the same welder or welding operator may
or may not weld both sides of the same butt joint. It is therefore permissible
to inspect the work of two welders or welding operators with one spot
radiograph if they weld opposite sides of the same butt joint. When a spot
radiograph is rejected, it shall be determined by further spot radiographs
whether one or both welders or welding operators were at fault.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3.3  As far as possible, an equal number of spot radiographs shall be
taken from the work of each welder or welding operator, except that this
requirement shall not apply where the length of joint welded by a welder
or welding operator is much less than average.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_71>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3.4  The locations for taking spot radiographs may be determined by
the purchaser’s inspector.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3.5  As welding progresses, radiographs shall be taken as soon as
practicable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.4 Film  — Each radiograph shall clearly show a minimum of 150 mm
of weld length. The film shall be centred on the weld and shall be of
sufficient width to permit adequate space for the location of identification
marks and thickness gauge or penetrometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.5 Film Defects  — All radiographs shall be free from excessive
mechanical processing defects which would interfere with proper
interpretation of the radiographs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.6 Submission of Radiographs  — Prior to any repairs of welds, the
radiographs shall be submitted to the inspector, who may be nominated
by the purchaser, with such information as he may request regarding the
radiographic technique used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.7 Radiographic Standards  — Sections of welds which are shown by
radiography to have any of the following imperfections, shall be judged
unacceptable:
a) Any crack, incomplete fusion, or incomplete penetration.
b) Any individual elongated inclusion having a length greater than
two-thirds the thickness of the thinner plate of the joint. However,
regardless of the plate thickness, no such inclusion shall be longer
than 20 mm, and no such inclusion shorter than 6 mm shall be the
cause for rejection.
c) Any group of inclusions in line, where the sum of the longest
dimensions of all such imperfections is greater than  T  (where  T  is
the thickness of the thinner plate joined) in a length of 6 T , except
when each of the individual spaces between imperfections is greater
than three times the length of the longer of the adjacent
imperfections. When the length of the radiograph is less than 6 T ,
the permissible sum of the lengths of all inclusions shall be
proportionately less than  T , provided the limits of the deficient
welding are clearly defined.
d) Porosity in excess of that shown as acceptable in the following
specifications:
1) The total area of porosity as determined from the radiographic
film shall not exceed 0.060 T  mm 2  in any 150 mm length of weld,
where  T  is the thickness of the weld. If the weld is less than
150 mm long, the total area of porosity shall be reduced in
proportion. The maximum pore dimension shall be 20 percent of  T
or 3 mm, whichever is smaller, except that an isolated pore<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>67<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_72>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>separated from an adjacent pore by 25 mm or more may be 30
percent of  T  or 6 mm, whichever is less. Dark images of a
generally circular or oval shape shall be interpreted as porosity
for the purposes of this standard.
2) The porosity charts in Fig. 20 to 23 illustrate various types of
assorted and uniform, randomly dispersed porosity indications.
These charts represent the maximum acceptable porosity for each
thickness. The charts represent full-scale 150 mm radiographs
and shall not be enlarged or reduced. The porosity distributions
shown are not necessarily the patterns that may appear on the
radiograph but are typical of the number and size of indications
permitted. When porosity indications differ significantly from the
porosity charts, the actual numbers and sizes of the pores may be
measured and the total area of porosity calculated.
3) In any 25 mm length of weld or 2 T , whichever is smaller, porosity
may be clustered to a concentration four times that permitted by
0.060 T . Such clustered porosity shall be included in the porosity
in any 150 mm length of weld which includes the cluster.
4) Aligned porosity shall be acceptable, provided the summation of
the diameters of the pores is not more than  T  in a length 12 T  or
150 mm, whichever is less. However, each pore shall be separated
by a distance at least six times the diameter of the largest
adjacent pore. Aligned porosity indications shall be counted in
the total area of permissible indications in any 100 mm length
of weld.
5) Permissible
porosity
indications
for

thicknesses
intermediate to those illustrated may be evaluated either by
comparison with the next thinner material or by calculation, as
shown in Table 17.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.8 Determination of Limits of Defective Welding  — When a
section of weld is shown by a radiograph to be unacceptable under the
provisions of  11.7 , or the limits of the deficient welding are not defined by
such radiograph, two adjacent spots shall be examined by radiography.
However, if the original radiograph shows at least 75 mm of acceptable
weld between the defect and any one edge of the film, an additional
radiograph need not be taken of the weld on that side of the defect. If
the weld at either of the two adjacent sections fails to comply with
the requirements of  11.7 , additional nearby spots shall be examined until
the limits of unacceptable welding are determined; or the erector may
replace all the welding performed by the welder or welding operator on
that joint. If the welding is replaced, the inspector shall have the option of
requiring that one radiograph be taken at any selected location on
any other joint on which the same welder (or operator) has welded. If any<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_73>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>of such additional spots fails to comply with the requirements of  11.7 , the
limits of unacceptable welding shall be determined as specified for the
initial section.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.9 Repair of Defective Welds  — Defects in welds shall be repaired by
chipping or melting out such defects from one or from both sides of the
joint, as required, and rewelding. Only sufficient cutting out of defective
joints is required as is necessary to correct the defects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All repaired welds in joints shall be checked by repeating the original
test procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.10 Record of Radiographic Examination  — A record shall be
made by the erector of all films, with their identification marks, on a
developed shell plate diagram.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the completion of the structure, the films shall be the property of
the purchaser, unless otherwise agreed between the purchaser and the
erector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>12.1 Bottom Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.1  After the bottom and at least the bottom course of shell plates have
been welded, the bottom shall be tested by pumping air beneath the
bottom plates to a pressure just sufficient to lift them off the foundation
and in any case, not less than 100 mmH 2 O gauge. The pressure shall be
held by the construction of a temporary dam of clay or other suitable
material around the tank periphery. Soap suds or other suitable material
shall be applied to all joints for detection of leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>69<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_74>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.2  Subject to agreement of the purchaser, fuel oil may be used instead
of air and soap suds to test for leaks.
12.1.3  Alternatively, the bottom seams may be tested by the vacuum box
method. Figure 24 shows typical details of a vacuum box.
12.2 Shell Testing
12.2.1  The shells of fixed roof tanks shall be tested after the completion of
the roof; those of open-top or floating roof tanks after completion of the
wind girder. Whenever possible, testing shall be by filling the tank with
water to the level of the top leg of the top-curb angle and noting any leaks.
When floating roofs are erected by floatation method, the shell shall be
tested concurrently with erection.
12.2.2  Where local conditions are such that testing with water is
impractical, the tank shall be tested by painting or spraying all joints on
the inside with a highly penetrating oil and noting any leaks, or by
pressurising the tank with air, the air pressure not exceeding the weight
of the roof plates, and carefully examining the joints for any leakage by
means of soap suds.
12.3 Fixed Roof Testing
12.3.1  When the tank-shell is tested with water, the roof shall be tested
by pumping air under the roof plates while the tank is still full of water.
In the case of non-pressure tanks, the roof shall be tested to a pressure of
73 mmH 2 O gauge; in the case of pressure roof tanks to a pressure of
one-and-a-quarter times the pressure at which the pressure side of the
pressure/vacuum-relief valve is designed to open. Soap suds or other
suitable material shall be applied to all joints for the detection of leaks.
Alternatively, the roof weld seams may be tested by vacuum box method.
12.3.2  When water is not available for testing the tank-shell, the roof
shall be tested by air as described in  12.2.2 .
12.4 Repair of Leaks
12.4.1  All leaks detected during testing shall be repaired to the
satisfaction of the purchaser and on completion the entire tanks shall be
tight and free from leaks.
12.4.2  In the joints between roof plates only, pinhole leaks may be
repaired by mechanical caulking. However, where there is any indication
of considerable porosity the leaks shall be sealed by laying down an
additional layer of weld metal over the porous sections.
12.4.3  In all other joints, whether between shell plates or bottom plates or
both, leaks shall be repaired only by welding, if necessary, after first
cutting out the defective part.
12.4.4  When the tank is filled with water for testing, defects in the shell
joints shall be repaired with the water level at least 300 mm below the
joint being repaired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>fusion. Welds attaching manholes and nozzles into these insert plates
may have partial penetration as shown in Fig. 25.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-6.2  All opening connections 300 mm or larger in nominal diameter
welded into a shell plate exceeding 25 mm in thickness shall be
prefabricated into the shell plate of thickened insert plate and this complete
assembly shall be stress-relieved before erection. Alternatively, all
weldments and the heat-affected zones on this assembly may be locally
stress-relieved by electric induction heating method, however, prior to
welding the plate assembly into the tank. The stress-relieving requirements
do not apply to the weld to the bottom annular plate, except for flush type
cleanout openings. All flush types cleanout openings, including the bottom
reinforcing plate or annular plate shall be stress-relieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-6.2.1  Where stress relief has been performed, the spacing from the
periphery weld to a shell butt-weld shall be at least 150 mm from vertical
joints or 75 mm from horizontal joints provided that, in either case, the
spacing is not less than 3 times the shell thickness. These rules shall also
apply to the bottom-to-shell joint except that, as an alternative the insert
plate or reinforcing plate may extend to and intersect the bottom-to-shell
joint at approximately 90°.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-6.3  All welds attaching manholes and nozzles shall be examined by
magnetic particle inspection, after stress-relieving if any, but before the
hydrostatic test of the tank.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-6.4  Flush type cleanout openings in accordance with  7.8  are
permissible with the following exception:
a) The material for shell plate in the cleanout opening assembly, the
shell reinforcing plate, the tank bottom reinforcing plate and the
neck plate shall conform to requirements of  B-2 .
b) The maximum height of the opening in the shell shall not exceed
900 mm.
c) The upper corner radius  r 1  of a 900 × 1 200 mm shell opening (  see
Table 14 ) shall be 600 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-6.5  Piping attached to nozzles on the shell shall be designed to have
maximum flexibility to eliminate or minimize loads on the shell connections
imposed by its restraint. Nozzle reinforcements shall also be designed to
take care of any additional loading caused by piping or other attachments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B-8. WELDING PROCEDURES AND INSPECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-8.1  Low-hydrogen electrodes shall be used for all manual metal-arc
welds of shell courses having a thickness of 14 mm or more.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-8.2  Welding procedures used shall produce weldments whose
mechanical properties are consistent with the plate material joined.
Welding procedure qualifications for vertical and horizontal welds for
design metal temperatures less than 10°C shall include impact tests in
the weld metal and heat-affected zone. The impact tests shall show an
average of at least 25 N.m (2.5 kgf.m) at the design metal temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-8.2.1  Weld metal impact specimens shall be taken across the weld with
the notch in the weld metal. The specimen shall be oriented so that the
notch is normal to the surface of the material. One face of the specimen
shall be substantially parallel to and within 1.5 mm of the surface of
material 25 mm and thinner. For material more than 25 mm thickness,
the impact specimens shall be taken as near midway between the surface
and the centre of thickness as practical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-8.2.2  Heat-affected zone impact specimens shall be taken across the
weld and as near the surface of the material as is practical. The
specimens shall be of sufficient length to locate, after etching, the notch in
the heat-affected zone. The notch shall be cut approximately normal to
the material surface to include as much heat-affected zone material as
possible in the resulting fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-8.3  When the service conditions might include the presence of hydrogen
sulphide, it is recommended that consideration be given to the hardness of
the inside welds, including the heat-affected zone, in order to minimize the
possibility of stress corrosion cracking. The weld metal and adjacent
heat-affected zone often contain a zone of hardness well in excess of RC 22
and could be expected to be more susceptible to cracking than unwelded
material. Any hardness criteria should be a matter of agreement between
the purchaser and the manufacturer and should be based on an evaluation
of the expected hydrogen sulphide concentration in the product, the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C-1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-1.1  This appendix applies to the normal and emergency venting
requirements for above ground fixed-roof tanks for liquid petroleum
storage, designed to specifications of this code. The following rules outline
safe and reasonable practices for the normal climatic and normal
operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-1.2  Where abnormal conditions exist or are anticipated, such as tanks
containing heated oil, receiving oil from wells or traps, using flame
arrestors or such restrictions and tanks subjected to pipe line surges,
larger venting capacity than that indicated by the provisions of this
appendix may have to be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-2. DETERMINATION OF VENTING REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.1  Venting requirements shall be computed for the following
conditions:
a) Vacuum or inbreathing owing to maximum outflow of oil from tank.
b) Vacuum or inbreathing owing to vapour contraction resulting from a
sharp decrease in atmospheric temperature.
c) Pressure or outbreathing caused by maximum inflow of oil into
tanks and the resulting maximum evaporation.
d) Pressure or outbreathing due to expansion and evaporation caused
by maximum increase in atmospheric temperatures (thermal
breathing).
e) Pressure or outbreathing owing to fire exposure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>82<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_87>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3. NORMAL VENTING CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3.1  Normal venting capacity shall be computed without exceeding the
normal operating pressure or vacuum conditions, thus avoiding physical
damage to the tank.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-3.2  Total normal venting capacity shall not be less than the total of the
venting requirements arising out of oil movement and thermal effect. For
tanks storing volatile liquids, the required normal venting capacity may
be reduced since vapour formation and condensation which occur within
the permissible vessel operating pressure, shall provide the venting
requirements partially or fully. This should be taken into account where
noncondensables are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3.3 Vacuum Relief<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-3.3.1  Venting capacity required to be provided for maximum oil
movement from the tank should be equivalent to 15 m 3  per hour of
maximum emptying rate. This also includes gravitational flow of oil to
other tanks, for oils of any flash point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3.3.2  For tanks storing oils of any flash point venting capacity required
resulting from thermal inbreathing shall not be less than that shown in
col 2 of Table 18.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3.4 Pressure Relief<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-3.4.1  Venting capacity required for maximum movement of oil into
tank and the resulting evaporation, should be equivalent to:
a) 17.5 m 3  of free air per hour for each 15 m 3  per hour of maximum
filling rate, for oils with a flash point of 40°C or above; and
b) 35 m 3  of free air per hour for each 15 m 3  per hour of maximum
filling rate for oils with a flash point below 40°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-3.4.2  Venting capacity required for thermal outbreathing, including
thermal evaporation, for a given tank capacity should be equivalent to:
a) values shown in col 3 of Table 18 for oils with a flash point of 40°C or
above, and
b) value shown in col 4 of Table 18 for oils with a flash point below
40°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-4. EMERGENCY VENTING CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-4.0  In the event of a storage tank getting exposed to fire, the venting
rate may be in excess of that resulting from a combination of normal
thermal effects and oil movement. Provision of additional venting
capacity in such cases shall be dictated by the type of construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-4.1 Tanks Having a Weak Roof-to-Shell Attachment  — In the case
of fixed roof tanks with a roof-to-shell attachment (maximum 5 mm<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>single-fillet weld) excess pressure will be safely relieved by the
preferential failure of the weak roof-to-shell junction, should the normal
venting capacity prove inadequate. Provision of additional emergency
venting requirements will not be necessary for tanks built to such
specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-4.2 Tanks Without Weak Roof-to-Shell Connection  — For tanks
not having a weak roof-to-shell connection as described in  C-4.1 , the
required venting capacity for fire exposure will be evaluated as outlined
below:
a) For tanks designed for pressures of 10 N/cm 2  (1 kgf/cm 2 ) or below,
the total rate of venting shall be determined in accordance with
Table 19. No increase in venting is required for tanks with more
than 280 m 2  of exposed wetted surface.
b) For tanks and storage vessels designed for pressures over 10 N/cm 2
(1 kgf/cm 2 ) the total rate of venting shall be determined in
accordance with Table 19 for the exposed wetted area not exceeding
280 m 2 . For exposed wetted area exceeding 280 m 2 , the total rate of
venting shall be calculated by the following formula:
CMH  = 220  A 0.82<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CMH  = venting requirement in m 3  of free air per hour at
10 N/cm 2  (1 kgf/cm 2 ) and 15°C, and
A  = exposed wetted surface in m 2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wetted area for the tank shall be the total exposed area of the shell in
m 2  within a maximum height of 10 m above grade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-4.3  The total venting requirements in m 3  of free air as enumerated in
Table 19 and derived from the formula given in  C-4.2  (b) are based on the
assumption that the liquid contained in the storage vessel will have
similar characteristics as that of hexane since this will provide results
which are within an acceptable degree of accuracy as desired, the total
emergency venting requirement for any specific liquid may be determined
by the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>750
L M
--------------<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CMH  of free air =  V .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
V  = volume of free air in m 3  per hour from Table 19 or the formula
in  C-4.2  (b),
L  = latent heat of vaporization of the specific liquid in calories per
gram, and
M  = molecular mass of the specific liquid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>84<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_89>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-4.4  Since the normal thermal effect can be disregarded during a fire,
full credit may be taken for the vent capacity provided for normal venting
and it can also be assumed that there will be no oil movement into the
tanks.
C-4.5  Total venting capacity shall in no case be less than the values
enumerated in Table 19 and in the event of the normal vents being
inadequate, additional emergency vents of the type described in  C-5.1 (b)
shall be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-4.6  The vent size may be calculated on the basis of maximum allowable
working pressure.
C-4.7  The total rate of emergency venting as obtained from  C-4.2 (a)
and  C-4.2 (b) may be multiplied appropriately by one of the following
factors when additional protection is provided:
a) 0.5 when drainage is provided away from the tank or vessel.
b) 0.3, 0.15 and 0.075 when 25 mm, 50 mm and 100 mm thickness of
external insulation is provided respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-5. NORMAL VENTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-5.1  Normal venting shall be accomplished by a pilot-operated relief
valve, pressure relief valve, pressure vacuum (PV) valve, or an open vent
with or without a flame-arresting device in accordance with the following
requirements:
a) A pilot-operated relief valve, if used, shall be so designed that the
main valve will open automatically and protect the tank in the event
of failure of the pilot valve diaphragm or other essential functioning
device. Relief valves equipped with a weight and level, as far as
possible, should not be used.
b) A pressure relief valve is applicable on tanks operating above
atmospheric pressure; in cases where a vacuum can be created
within a tank, vacuum protection may be required.
c) PV valves are recommended for use on atmospheric storage tanks in
which oil with a flash point below 38°C is stored and for use on tanks
containing oil which is heated above the flash point of the oil. A
flame arrester is not considered necessary for use in conjunction
with a PV valve.
d) Open vents with a flame-arresting device may be used in place of PV
valves on tanks in which oil with a flash point below 38°C is stored
and on tanks containing oil which is heated above the flash point of
the oil.
e) Open vents may be used to provide venting capacity for tanks in
which oil with a flash point of 38°C above is stored, for heated tanks
where the oil storage temperature is below the oil flash point, for
tanks with a capacity of less than 10 m 3  used for the storage of any<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>product, and for tanks with a capacity of less than 500 m 3  used for
the storage of crude oil.
f) In the case of viscous oils, such as cutback and penetration grade
asphalts, where the danger of tank collapse resulting from sticking
pallets or from plugging of flame arrestors is greater than the
possibility of flame transmission into the tank, open vents may be
used as an exception to the requirement for PV valves or
flame-arresting devices as called for in (c) and (d) above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.2  Floating roof tanks are mainly intended for protection of stored
products against evaporation and fire. Floating roofs control evaporation
which is characteristic of some crude oil and other petroleum products.
They eliminate filling losses and the vapour space above the product, thus
minimizing possible fire hazard and reaction of the product with air. Use
of floating roofs can be extended to products having absolute vapour
pressures up to 12.25 N/cm 2  (1.25 kgf/cm 2 ) and containing small
percentages of air-vapour explosive mixtures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-2. GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-2.1  The floating roof and accessories shall be so designed and
constructed as to allow the tank to overflow and then return to a liquid
level which floats the roof well below the top of the tank shell without
damage to any part of the roof, tank or appurtenances. During such an
occurrence, no manual attention shall be required to protect any of these
components. If a wind skirt or top shell extension is used for the purpose
of containing the roof seals at the highest point of travel, overflow
drainage openings or other means of alarm shall be provided to indicate<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>88<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and regulate the rise of liquid level in the tank above the nominal height
of tank, unless the tank shell has been designed for a liquid height to the
top of the shell extension.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-2.2  The purchaser shall specify whether the tank shell diameter and
height are nominal or whether a net capacity is required up to the bottom
of the overflows.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-2.3  Where specified by the purchaser foam dams around the outer edge
of the roof shall be provided so that fire fighting foam can be kept in
contact with the top side of the roof seal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-3. DECK AND PONTOON DESIGN REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-3.1  It is recommended that roofs be of the contact type designed to
eliminate the pressure of any air-vapour mixture under the deck.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified by the purchaser, all deck plates shall have
a minimum nominal thickness of 5 mm (40 kg/m 2  plate).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-3.2  Deck plates shall be joined by continuous full fillet welds on the top
side. On the bottom side where flexure is anticipated adjacent to girders,
support legs, or other relatively rigid members, full-fillet welds not less
than 50 mm long on 250 mm centres shall be used on any plate laps which
occur within 300 mm of any such rigid support or member.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-3.3  In the case of a covered floating roof, the outer rim of the floating
roof and the necks of any appurtenances installed through the deck shall
have a minimum height of 200 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-3.4  Top decks of double-deck roofs and of pontoon sections, which are
designed with a permanent slope for drainage, shall have a minimum
slope of 5 mm in 300 mm and preferably shall be lapped to provide the
best drainage. Plate buckles shall be kept to a minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-3.5  The minimum pontoon volume of a single-deck pontoon roof shall
be sufficient to keep the roof floating on a liquid with a specific gravity of
0.7 if the single deck and any two pontoon compartments are punctured.
The minimum pontoon volume of a double-deck roof shall be sufficient to
keep the roof floating on a liquid with a specific gravity of 0.7 if any two
pontoon compartments are punctured. The primary drainage shall be
considered as inoperative for either type of roof, but no live load need be
considered for the preceding design requirements. In addition, either type
of roof with the primary drainage inoperative shall accommodate a 250
mm rainfall in a 24-hour period over the entire roof area without sinking
(with no compartments or decks punctured). The roof may be designed to
carry the entire 24-hour rainfall, or emergency drains may be installed
which will limit the roof load to some lesser volume of water which the
roof will carry safely. Such emergency drains shall not allow the product
to flow on to the roof deck.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>89<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_94>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 803 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pontoon ring of a single deck floating roof shall have sufficient flexural
rigidity to resist compressive loads acting when the deck is punctured or
flooded with 250 mm of rain-water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Large diameter pontoon roof tanks installed in areas subject to high
winds shall receive special consideration to stiffen the deck area and
provide greater safety against wind induced rippling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-3.6  Each compartment shall be provided with a manway with a rain
night cover. The manway covers shall be provided with suitable
hold-down fixtures or other means to prevent wind from removing the
covers. The top edge of manway necks shall be at an elevation to prevent
water entering the compartments under the conditions set forth in  D-3.1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-3.7  All internal bulkhead plates or sheets shall be single-fillet welded
along their bottom and vertical edges for liquid-tightness. When specified
by the purchaser, the top edge of the bulkhead shall also be provided with
a continuous single-fillet weld for liquid-tightness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-4. ROOF DRAINS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-4.1  Primary drains shall be of the hose, jointed or siphon type. A check
valve shall be provided near the roof end of the hose and jointed pipe
drains on single-deck and pan-type roofs to prevent backflow of stored
product in case of damage to the drain line. Provisions shall be included to
prevent kinking of the hose or pinching under the deck legs. Hose drains
shall be designed to permit replacement without entering to tank. The
swing joints of pipe drains shall be packed to prevent leakage. The
primary drain shall be adequate to drain the maximum rain-fall in a
24-hour period without flooding the deck; the minimum size shall be
equivalent in capacity to one 75-mm drain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-4.2  Provision shall also be made to drain rain-water from the deck of
pontoon roofs into the tank when the roof is resting on its support legs
and the primary drain is operating at its lowest efficiency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-5. LADDERS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-5.1  The floating roof shall be supplied with a ladder which
automatically adjusts to any position of the roof in such manner as always

<<HEADING level=3>>D-7. SUPPORTING LEGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-7.1  The floating roof shall be provided with supporting legs. Legs
fabricated from pipe shall be notched or perforated at the bottom to
provide drainage. Length of legs shall be adjustable from the top side of
the roof. The operating and cleaning position levels of the supporting legs
shall be as specified by the purchaser. The manufacturer shall make
certain that all tank appurtenances, such as mixers, interior piping, and
fill nozzle, are cleared by the roof in its lowest position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-7.2  Legs and attachments shall be designed to support the roof and a
uniform live load of at least 1 250 N/cm 2  (125 kgf/cm 2 ) for single-deck and
double-deck floating roofs. Where possible, roof load shall be transmitted
to the legs through bulk heads or diaphragms. In the case of pan type
floating roofs, the supports and attachments shall be designed to support
a uniform live load of 625 N/m 2  (62.5 kgf/m 2 ) on the deck and shall be
such as to prevent damage to the fixed roof when the tank is full. Support
attachments in the deck areas in the case of single deck and covered
floating roofs, shall be given particular attention to prevent failure at the
points of attachment. Steel pads or other means shall be used to
distribute the loads on the bottom of the tank. Pads, if used, shall be
continuously seal welded to the tank bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-8. ROOF MANHOLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-8.1  Single-deck and double-deck floating roofs shall have at least one
manhole provided for access to the tank interior and for ventilation when
the tank is empty. The number of roof manholes shall be as specified by
the purchaser. These manholes shall be of at least 600 mm internal

<<HEADING level=3>>D-9. CENTRING AND ANTI-ROTATION DEVICE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-9.1  In the case of single-deck and double-deck floating roofs, suitable
devices shall be provided to maintain the roof in centred position and to
prevent its rotation. These devices shall be capable of resisting the lateral
forces imposed on them by the roof ladder, wind loads and the like.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-9.2  Prevention of rotation of pan roofs shall be achieved by means of a
seal or other suitable device.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-10. SEALS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-10.1  The space between the outer periphery of the roof and the tank
shell shall be sealed by a flexible device which shall provide a reasonably
close fit to the shell surfaces. If the sealing device employs steel shoes in
contact with the shell, such shoes shall be made from galvanized sheet
with a nominal thickness of 1.6 mm. If uncoated shoes are specified, they
shall be made of sheet metal of a thickness and quality as specified by the
purchaser. An adequate number but a minimum number of three
