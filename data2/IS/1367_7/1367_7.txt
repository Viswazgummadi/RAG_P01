<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope —  Covers the mechanical properties of nuts and similar threaded parts without specified
proof load values which are not covered by the scope of IS : 1367 (Part VI)-1980 ‘Technical supply
conditions for threaded steel fasteners: Part VI Mechanical properties and test methods for nuts with
specified proof loads (  second revision  )’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard does not apply to nuts requiring special properties, such as:
a) Weldability,
b) Corrosion resistance, and
c) Ability to withstand temperature above + 300°C or below – 50°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Note  — Nuts made from free cutting steel should not be used above 250°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Designation System  — The property classes of such nuts are designated by a number suffixed by
letter ‘H’. The number indicates 1/10th of the minimum Vickers Hardness and the letter ‘H’ refers to
the hardness (  see  Table 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Consequent to the decision to revise IS : 1367-1967 ‘Technical supply conditions for threaded steel
fasteners’ due to the work at international level, separate parts have been formulated for technical
and drafting reasons alike. The different parts in the revision are listed in Part I Introduction and
general information. The requirements for nuts, which are not amenable to proof loading either
due to their geometry or application, are covered in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although work is yet to be initiated at the international level on nuts without specified proof loads,
the need for a national standard on the subject has been felt in view of a large number of nut-like
threaded and formed products which are in use. Such products cannot be classified according to
definite test loads or loading capacities, but only according to their hardness values. For this
reason the minimum hardness has been adopted as the characteristic feature. Maximum values
have also been specified to guard against a drop in the transverse toughness due to excessive
hardness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The property classes covered in this standard are applicable for nuts with one or more of the
following characteristics:
a) With nominal heights less than 0.5  d ;
b) With lesser across flats than those specified in IS : 9519-1980 ‘Dimensions for width across
flats for hexagon head bolts and nuts’;
c) With threads other than triangular ISO metric threads;
d) With nominal thread sizes above M39; and
e) With special configuration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The property class designation system based on hardness values is applicable to the type of
products covered in the following Indian Standards:
IS : 3468-1975 Specification for pipe nuts
IS : 5368-1969 Specification for thin slotted and castle nuts (dia range 6 to 52 mm)
IS : 6731-1972 Specification for locknuts, narrow series and lockwashers with straight inner tab
for rolling bearings (  first revision  )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>While the above Indian Standards presently specify property class 4, 6, 8, etc, the same would be
modified in their revisions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of the standard, assistance has been derived from DIN 267 sheet 4-1971
Schrauben, Mutten Und ahuliche Gewinde — und Formterte (Bolts, screws, nuts and similar
threaded and formed parts — technical supply conditions of delivery — property classes and test
methods for nuts of unalloyed or low alloy steels) issued by Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 3.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (December 1984). Side bar indicates modification
of the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
