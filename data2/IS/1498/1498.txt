FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
( First
Revision ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 19 December
1970, after the draft finalized by the
Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Soil survey and soil classification
are at present being done by sever-a!
organizations
in
this
country
for different
purposes.
The
engineering
departments
and research
laboratories
have done a great deal of work in
regard
to soil exploration
and classification
in fields relating
to irrigation,
buildings,
roads, etc.
The investigations
relating
to the field of irrigation
have two objectives
namely,
the suitability
of soil for the construction
of
dams and other kinds of hydraulic
structures
and the effect on the fertility
of soil when it is irrigated.
With
regard
to roads and highways,
investi-
gations
have been undertaken
to classify them from the point of view of
their suitability
for construction
of embankments,
sub-grades,
and wearing
surfaces.
In the field of buildings,
soil investigation
and classification
is
done to evaluate
the soil as regards its bearing
power to a certain
extent.
Soil survey and soil classification
are also done by agriculture
departments
from the point of view of the suitability
of the soil for crops and its fertility.
Each of these agencies was adopting
different systems for soil classification.
The adoption
of different methods
by various agencies led to difficulties in
interpreting
the results of soils investigated
by one agency by the other and
quite often results were found to be not easily
comparable.
This
Indian
standard
was, therefore,
published
in 1959 to provide
a common
basis for
soil classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
Soils seldom
exist in nature
separately
as sand,
gravel
or any  other
single component
but are usually found as mixture
with varying
propor-
tions of particles
of different
sizes.
This revision
is essentially
based on
the Unified Soil Classification
System with the mod&cation
that the fine-
grained
soils have been subdivided
into three subdivisions of low, medium
and high compressibility,
instead of two subdivisions of the original Unified
Soil Classification
System.
The system is based on those characteristics
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the soil which indicate how it will behave as a construction material.
This
system is not limited to a particular use or geographical
location.
It does
not conflict with other systems; in fact, the use of geologic,
pedologic,
textural or local terms is encouraged
as a supplement
to, but not
as a
substitute for, the definitions, terms and phrases established by this system
and which are easy to associate with actual soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition
to relating it to the practices in this field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be*the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard covers a system for classification and indentification
of
soils for general
engineering
purposes.
The
information
given
in this
standard should be considered as for guidance only for treating the soil for
engineering purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose of this standard, the definitions given in IS  :  2809-1972t
and the following shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 CIay -
An
aggregate
of microscopic
and sub-microscopic
particles
derived from the chemical decomposition
and disintegration
of rock consti-
tuents.
It is plastic within a moderate to wide range of water content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  Silt-A
fine-grained soil with little or no plasticity.
If shaken in the
palm of the hand, a part of saturated inorganic silt expels enough ‘water to
make its surface appear glossy.
If the pat is pressed or squeezed between
the fingers, its surface again becomes dull.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Sand and Gravel -

of more or less unaltered
rocks or minerals.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>According
to this system, gravel
is a fraction of the soil material
between 80 mm and the 4.75-mm IS Sieve size and sand is the material

AND IDENTIFICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Division -
Soils shall be broadly divided into three divisions as given
in 3.1.1 to 3.i.3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.1  Coarse-Grained Soils -
In these soils, more than half the total material
by weight is larger than 7Smicron
IS Sieve size.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.13
Fine-Grained Soils -
In these soils, more than half of the material
by weight is smaller than 75-micron IS Sieve size.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.13
Highly Organic  Soils  and Other Miscellaneous Soil Materials -
These
&Is  contain large percentages of fibrous organic matter, such as peat, and
particles of decomposed vegetation.
In addition, certain soils containing
shells, concretions, cinders, and other non-soil materials in sufficient quanti-
ties are also grouped in this division.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Subdivision
-The
first two divisions ( see 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 ) shall be
further divided as given in 3.2.1
and 3.2.2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.B  Coarse-Grained Soils -
The coarse-grained soils shall be divided into
two subdivisions, namely:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)  Gravels -
Ln these soils, more than
half
the
coarse
fraction
( +75
micron ) is larger than 4*75-mm IS Sieve size.
This sub-
division includes gravels and gravelly soils.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) Sends-
In
these soils, more
than
half
the
coarse
fraction
( +75
micron ) is smaller than 4*75-mm IS Sieve size. This sub-
division includes sands and sandy soils.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.2
Fine-Grained  Soils -
The fine-grained soils shall be further divided
into three subdivisions on the basis of the following arbitrarily
selected
values of liquid limit:
4<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Silts and clays of low com&wibility
-
having a liquid limit less than
35 ( represented by symbol  L ),<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Silts and ciays of medium compressibility -
having
a liquid limit
greater than 35 and less than 50 ( represented by symbol I ), and<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Silts and clays of high compressibility -
having a liquid limit greater
than 50 ( represented by symbol  H).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NATE -
In thb system the fine-grain4
soils UC not divided
according
to particle
size but according
to plasticity
and ccmpressibiiity.
The term ‘ compressibility
’ here
shall imply volume change, shrinkage during dry periods and swelling during wet periods,
Y well as. consolidation
under load. Soil particles finer than P-micron may, however, be
designated as clay-size particles and the particles between 75micron
and P-micron as silt-
tie
particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Groups -
The coarse-grained
soils shall be further divided into eight
basic soil groups.
The fine-grained soils shall be further divided
into nine
basic soil groups ( see Table 2 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.1  Highly organic soils and other miscellaneous soil materials shall be
placed in one group.
The groups shall be designated by symbols.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
These groups are broad, based on basic properties of soil; therefore, supplc-
mental detailed word descriptions are reqJired to point out pccularity of a particular
soil and differentiate it from others in the same group.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  Field
Identification
and
CIassification’
Procedure
-
The field
method is used primarily in the field to classify and describe soils.
Visual
observations are employed in place of precise laboratory tests to define the
basic soil properties.
The procedure
is, in fact, a process of elimination
beginning on the left side of the classification chart ( Table 2 ) and working
to the right until the proper group name is obtained.
The group name
should
be supplemented
by
detailed
word
descriptions,
including
the
description of the in-place conditions for soils to be used in place as founda-
tions.
A representative sample of the soil is selected which is spread on a
flat surface or in the palm of the hand.
Ali particles larger than 80 mm
are removed from the sample.
Only the fraction of the sample smaller than
80 mm is classified.
The
sample is classified as coarse-grained
or fine-
grained by estimating the percentage by weight of individual particles which
can be seen by the unaided eye.
Soils containing more than 50 percent
visible particles are coarse-grained
soils, soils containing
less than 50 per-
cent visible particles are fine-grained
soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If it has been determined
that the soil is coarse grained, it is further
identified by estimating and recording the percentage of: (a) grave1 sized
particle, size range from 80 mm to 4.75-mm IS Sieve size ( or apprqximately
5 mm size )  ;  (b)
sand size particles,
size range
from 4.75 to 75-micron
IS Sieve size; and (c) silt and clay size particles, size range
smaller
‘than
75-micron IS Sieve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -The
fraction of soil smaller than 7%micron IS Sieve, that is, the clay and silt
fraction is referred to as fina.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1  Gravelly Soils -
If the percentage
of gravel is greater than that of
sand, the soil is a gravel.
Gravels are further identified as being clean ( con-
taining little or no fines, that is less than 5  per  cent ) or dirty ( containing
appreciable
fines, that is more than 12 per cent ) depending
upon the
percentage of particles not visible to the unaided eye.
Gravels contaibing
5 to 12 percent fines are given boundary classification. If the soil is obviously<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS: Mm-
1970<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>olean,
the classification
shall
be either:
(a) well graded
gravel
( GW ), if
there
is good
representation
of all particle
sizes;
or (b)
poorly
graded
gravel ( GP ), if there is an excess or absence
of intermediate
particle
sizes.
A well-graded
soil has a reasonably
large spread
between
the largest
and
the finest particles
and has no marked
deficiency
in any size.
If the soil
obviously
is dirty, the classification
will be either
(c) silty gravel  (  GM ), if
the fines have little or no plasticity;
or (d) clayey gravel ( GC ), if the fines
are of low to medium or high plasticity
< see 3.2.2
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2
&UZ”  Soils -
If the percentage
of sand is greater
than gravel,
the
soil is a sand.
The same procedure
is applied as for gravels except that the
word sand replaces
gravei and the symbol S replaces G.
The group classi-
fication
for the clean sands will be either  :  (a) well-graded
sand  (  SW ) or
(b) poorly-graded
sand
( SP ), and
the dirty
sands shall
be classified
as
(c) silty sand ( SM ), if the fines have little or no plasticity;
or (d) clayey
sand ( SC),
if the fines are of low to medium
or high plasticity
( see 3.2.2
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3
Boundary Classification for Coarse-Grained Soils -
When a soil possesses
characteristics
of two groups,
c;ther
in particle
size distribution
or in plasti-
city,
it is designated
by combinations
of group
symbols.
For
example,
a well-graded
coarse-grained
soil with clay binder is designated
by GWGC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3.1
Boundary
classifications
can
occur
within
the
coarse-grained
soil division,
between
soils within the gravel or sand grouping,
and between
gravelly and sandy soils.
The procedure
is td assume the coarser soil,  whea
there
is a choice,
and
complete
the classification
and assign
the propet
group symbol;
then, beginning
where the choice was made,
assume a finet
soil and complete
the classifictition,
as6gning
the second group symbol.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.3.2
Boundary
classifications
within
gravel
or sand
groups
can
occur.
Symbols’  such  as GW-GP,
GM-GC,
GIV-GM,
GW-GC,
SW-SP;
SM-SC,
SW-SM
and SW-SC
are common.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3.3
Boundary

can occur between the gravel and sand
groups.
Symbols
such
as GW-S\V,

are
common.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.3.4
Boundary

soils.
Classifications
such as SM-h4L

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.5
Fine-Grained Soils -
If it has been determined that the soil is fine-
graincd, it is further identified by estimating the percentage of gravel, sand)
silt and clay size particles and performing the manual identification tests
for dry strength, dilatancy, and toughness.
By comparing the results of
these tests with the requirements gven for the nine fine-grained soil groups,
the appropriate group name and symbol is assigned.
The same procedure
is used to identify the fine-grained fraction of coarse-grained soil to deter-
mine whether they are silty or clayey.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4.6
Manaal  Identifiation Tests -
The following tests for identifying the
fine-grained soils shall be performed on the fraction of the soil finer than
the 425micron
IS Sieve:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Dilatancy ( reaction to  stiiag
) -
Take a small re resentative sample
in the form of a soil pat of the size of about 5
Ya
cu ic centimetres  and
add enough water to nearly saturate it.
Place the pat in the open
palm of one hand and shake horizontally, striking vigorously agamst
the other hand several times.
Squeeze the pat between the fingers.
The appearance and disappearance of the water with shaking and
squeezing is referred to as a reaction.
This reaction is called quick,
if water appears and disappears rapidly; slow, if water appears and
disappears slowly; and no reaction, if the water condition does not
appear to change.
Observe and record type of reaction as da-
criptive information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Toughness ( consistency near plastic limit ) -
Dry the pat used in the
dilatancy test by working and moulding, until it has the. consis-
tency of putty.
The time required to dry the pat is the indication
of its plasticity.
Roll the pat on a smooth surface or between the
palms into a thread about 3 mm in diameter.
Fold and reroll the.
thread repeatedly to 3 mm in diameter so that its moisture content
is gradually reduced until the 3 mm thread just crumbles.
The
moisture
content at this time is called the plastic limit and the
resistance to moulding at the plastic limit is called the toughness.
After the thread crumbles, lump the pieces together and continue
the slight kneading action until the lump crumbles.
If the lump
can still be moulded slightly drier than the plastic limit and if high
pressure is required to role the thread between the palms of the
hand, the soil & described as having high toughness.

indicated by a medium thread and a lump  formed of
the threads  slightly below the plastic limit will crumble; while low
toughness is indicated by a weak thread that breaks easily and can-
not be lumped together when drier than the plastic limit.
Highly
organic clays have very weak and spongy feel at the plastic limit.
Non-plastic soils cannot be rolled into-thread of 3 mm in diameter
at any moisture content.
Observe and record the toughness as
descriptive information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dry strength ( crushing m-istance ) -
Completely dry the prepared soil
pat.
Then measure its resistance to crumbling
and powdering
between fingers.
This resistance, called dry strength, is a measure
of the plasticity of the soil and is influenced largely by the colloidal
fraction content.
The dry strength is designated as low, if the dry
pat can be easily powdered; medium, if considerable finger pressure
IS required and high, if it cannot be powdered at all.
Observe and
record the dry strength as descriptive information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -The
presence
of high-strength
water
soluble
ccmendng
mat&ah,
such
as calcium
carbonates
or iron oxides may cause high dry rtrcngth.
Non-
plastic
roils, such
as caliche,
coral,
crushed
lime stone or soils containing
carbonaceous
cementing
agents may have high dry strength,
but this can be
dcc?tcd
by the d%rvcscencc
causal
by the application
of dduted
hydrochloric
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organic  content and colour -
Fresh wet organic soils usually have a
distinctive odour of decomposed organic matter.
This odour can
be made more noticeable by heating the wet sample.
Another
indication of the organic matter is the distinctive dark colour.
In
tropical soils, the dark colour may be or may not be due to organic
matter; when not due to organic matter, it is associated with poor
drainage.
Dry organic
clays develop
an earthy odour
upon
moistening, which is distinctive from that of decomposed organic
matter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Other id&t$cation tests
1)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acid t&t -Acid
test using dilute hydrochloric
acid (  HCl )  is
primarily a test for the presence of calcium carbonate.
For
soils with high dry strength, a strong reaction indicates that
the strength may be due to calcium carbonate as cementing
agent rather than colloidal clay.
The results of this test should
be included in the soil description, if pertinent.
Shine test -
This is a quick
supplementary
procedure
for
determining the presence of clay.
The test is performed by
cutting  a  lump of dry  or  slightly moist soil with a knife.
The
shiny surface imparted to the soil indicates highly plastic clay,
while a dull surface indicates silt  or  clay of  low  plasticity.

Other criteria undoubtedly
may be deve-
loped by the individual as he gains  experience in clauifjring<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>the soils.
For
example,
differentiation
between
some
of the
fine-grained
soils depends
largely
upon the experience
in the
feel of the soils.
Also wet clay sticks to the fingers and dries
slowly but silt dries fairly quickly
and can be dusted
off the
fingers leaving only a stain.
Frequent
checking
by laboratory
tests is necessary
to gain this experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Boundal-y Class$cation for Fine-Grained Soils -
Boundary
classifications
can occur within
the fine-grained
soil divisions,
between
low and medium
or between
medium
and high
liquid
limits
and between
silty and clayey
soils.
The
procedure
is comparable
to that given for coarse-grained
soils
( ~86 3.4.3
), that is, first assume a coarse soil, when there is a choice,
and
then a finer soil and, assign dual group
symbols.
Boundary
classifications
which are common
are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ML-MI,

Liborrtory
Identihation and QassZcation Procedure-  The
laboratory method is intended for precise delineation of tire soil groups by
using  rt4ts
of laboratory tests, for gradation and moisture limits, rather
than visual estimates.
Classification by these tests alone does not fulfil the
requirements for complete classification, as it does not provide an adequate
description of the soil.
Therefore, the descriptive information required for
the field method should also be included in the laboratory classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>35.1
@ass$cation Criteria for Coarse&rained Soils -
The laboratory classi-
tca,.ir4 criteria for classifying the coarse-grained soils are given in Tables
.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>35.2
Boun&ary Classtjication for  Coarse-&a&d  Soils -
The
coarse-grained
soils containing between 5 and 12 percent of fines are classified as border-
line cases between the clean and the dirty gravels or sands as for example,
GW-GC,
or SI’-SM.
Similarly border-line
cases might occur in dirty
gravels and dirty sands, where the Z, is between 4 and 7 as, for example,
GM-GC or  SM-SC.
It is possible, therefore, to have a border line case of
a border line case.
The rule for correct classification in this case is to
favour the non-plastic classification.
For example, a gravel with 10 percent
fines, a Cu of 20, a Cc of 2.0 and Z, of G would be classified GW-GM rather
than GW-GC ( Z,  is  the plasticitv Index of the soil ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

PLASTICITY CHART<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.3.1  Organic
silts and
clays
are
usually
distinguished
from
in-
organic silts which have the same position on the plasticity
chart,
by odour
and colour.
However,
when the organic
content
is doubtful,
the material
can be oven dried, remixed with water,
and retested for liquid limit.
The
plasticity.
of fine-grained
organic
soils is greatly
reduced
on oven drying,
owing
to irreversible
changes
in the properties
of the organic
material.
Oven drying also affects the liquid limit of inorganic
soils,
but only to a
small degree.
A reduction
in liquid limit after oven drying  to a value less
than three-fourth
of the liquid limit before oven drying is positive identifi-
cation of organic soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
