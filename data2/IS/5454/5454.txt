FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
(  First Revision  )  was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 10 July 1978, after the draft finalized by the
Building Materials
and Components
Sampling Sectional Committee
had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The clay building brick is the most extensively used building material in
the construction
work. Its quality is of fundamental importance in ensuring
the soundness of the buildings and structures.
It is, therefore, imperative
that due consideration
is given to the sampling procedures
which would
help in proper and objective evaluation of the quality of the bricks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard was originally issued in 1969. However, in view of the
experience gained in the course of years and the introduction
of new and
revised quality characteristics
and methods
of test in Indian Standards
pertaining to various types of clay building bricks, it was felt necessary to
revise this standard.
In this revision, sampling procedures
for breaking
load, transverse strength and bulk density have been included.
The criteri:t
for conformity for efflorescence and compressive strength have been moc!l-
fied to bring them in line with the latest Indian Standards on specifications
and methods of testing of clay buiiding bricks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded elf,
it shall be done in accordance with IS:2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard lays down methods for sampling  and
criteria
for asccr-
taining conformity
of solid, hollow and perforated
burnt clay building
bricks to the relevant specifications.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose
of this standard,
the following
definitions
shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Lot -
X  collection
of bricks of the same class and size, manufactured
under
rchtively
similar
conditions
of production.
For
the
purpose
of
s:rmpling.
:r lot shall
contain
a maximum
of 50 000 bricks.
in case a
consi~nmcnt
has bricks more than 50000 of the same classification
and size,
and m;trruf.t~turcd
under relatively
similar
conditions
of production,
it shall
be di\,i&d
Into lots of 50000 bricks or part thereof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Sample -- A collection
of bricks
selected
for inspection
and/or
testing
from
a lot to reach
the decision
regarding
the acceptance
or rejection
of
the lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Defective-A
brick
failing
to meet
one
or
more
of the
specified
requirements.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Average-The
sum
of the observations
divided
by the number
of
observations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. METHODS
OF SAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The
sample
may
be
drawn
either
by:
(a)
random
sampling,
or
(b) stratified
sampling-method
in accordance
with IS:490539685.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 The sample
shall be taken
by one of the methods
given in  3.2.1, 3.2.2
or 3.2.3 so as to yield the number
of bricks required.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1  Sampling
in Motion -
Whenever
practicable
the sample
shall
be
taken
while the bricks
are being
moved,
for example,
during
loading
or
unloading.
The lot shall be divided
into a number
of convenient
portions
(not less than ten).
Approximately
equal number
of bricks
shall be drawn
from
each of these
portions
at regular
intervals,
such that
the requisite
number
of bricks for inspection
and testing is provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2  Sampling from
a Stack -
When
it is necessary
to take a sample
from a stack, the stack shall be divided
into a number
of real or imaginary
sections
and the required
number
of bricks drawn
from each section.
For
this purpose
bricks
in the upper
layers
of the stack shall be removed
to
enable
units to be sampled
from places within
the stack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3  Sampling from Lorries or Trucks -
When it is necessary
to take a
sample
from bricks
loaded
in lorries
or trucks,
the sample
bricks
shall be
taken from a number
of lorries/trucks
(not
less than ten, if possible)
such
that when equal number
of bricks are drawn from each of the lorries/trucks
the number
of bricks required
for the inspection
and testing
is provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Visual Characteristics-All
the bricks selected as in 4.1.1 in accordance

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Dimensional Characteristics-
The dimensions
and tolerances
have been
spccilied
in  various standards for clay building bricks.
In some standards
the dimensions and tolerances have been specified for individual brick.
In
some other standards the dimensions and tolerances have been specified for
a group of 20 bricks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1 In case the dimensions
and tolerances
have been specified for
individual brick, the scale of sampling and criteria for conformity
shall be
the same as laid down in 4.2 for visual characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2 In case the dimensions and tolerances
for bricks are specified as
overall on a group of 20 bricks, the number of bricks to be selected for
inspecting the dimensions and tolerances shall be in accordance with co1 1
and 4 of Table 1. These bricks will be divided into groups of 20 bricks at
random and each of the groups thus formed tested for all ‘the dimensions
and tolerances.
A lot shall be considered having found meeting the require-
ments of dimensions and tolerances if none of the groups of bricks inspected
fails to meet the specified requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The lot which has been found satisfactory
in respect of visual and
dimensional requirements (see 4.2 and 4.3) shall next be tested for physical
characteristics
like compressive strength, breaking load, transverse strength,
bulk density, water absorption,
efflorescence and warpage as specified in
relevant material specification.
The bricks for this purpose shall be taken
at rarrdom from those already selected in 4.1.1. The number of bricks to be
selected and tested for each of these characteristics
