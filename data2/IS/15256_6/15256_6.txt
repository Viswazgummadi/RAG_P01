<<HEADING level=3>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 11568
is one of a series of standards
describing
procedures
for the secure
management
of the cryptographic
keys used to protect messages
in a retail banking environment,
for instance,
messages
between
an acquirer
and a
card
acceptor,
or an acquirer
and a card
issuer.
Management
of keys
used
in an integrated
Circuit Card
(ICC)
environment
is not covered by ISO 11568
but will be addressed
in another
ISO standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Whereas
key
management
in a wholesale
banking
environment
is characterized
by the exchange
of keys
in a
relatively
high-security
environment,
this standard
addresses
the key management
requirements
that are applicable
in the more accessible
domain of retail banking services.
Typical of such services
are point-of-saie/point-of-service
(POS)
debit and credit authorizations
and automated
teller machine
(ATM) transactions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 11568
is a multi-part standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 11568
provides general
information
and criteria concerning
key management
schemes
for use in a
retail
banking
environment.
Annex A
provides
a
description
of
certain
key
management
schemes
that
are
considered
by ISO members
as suitable for implementation
in the retail banking environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Generic
overview
of retail banking
key management
schemes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A key management
scheme
is a set of rules that define how cryptographic
keys in retail banking systems
are to be
created,
distributed,
used and replaced.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
objective
of a key management
scheme
is to ensure that cryptographic
keys are managed
in such a way that
the data that is ultimately to be protected
will be safeguarded
from potential compromise
resulting from non-secure
creation,
transfer,
use or replacement
of cryptographic
keys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>In
order
to
accomplish
this
objective,
key
management
schemes
shall
employ
key
management
techniques
described
in ISO 11568-2
and ISO 11568-4.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Secure
cryptographic
devices,
as described
in ISO 13491,
shall be used to provide the intended level of security.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The
requirements
and
implementation
of the
phases
of the
life cycle
of cryptographic
keys
are
addressed
in
ISO 11568-3
and ISO 11568-5.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Key management
schemes
may employ symmetric,
asymmetric
or hybrid techniques.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A key management
scheme
shall conform to the key management
principles set out in ISO 11568-1.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Separate

and a one-way
function. The key register is updated
at the terminal
and the host using MAC
residues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Messages
within a transaction
are linked by including the MAC
residue
from the previous

in the
MAC calculation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>End-to-end
and “break forward” protection for PIN’s can be acheived
by omitting some of the card data from

<<HEADING level=3>>DESCRIPTION
OF SCHEME:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The TBSS
specifies services and mechanisms required to secure telebanking services. All mechanisms follow
international standards (or drafts), limit the options allowed therein and specify algorithms to be used such that
interoperability can be guaranteed.
TBSS
standardizes
mechanisms and procedures for the following Security
Services — Entity Authentication, Confidentiality, Non-repudiation of origin and receipt — and includes the necessary
key management services and mechanisms. An outline of the relevant parts of TBSS is given below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)
Key  Transport<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Describes the mechanisms for the secure transfer of secret keys to be used for symmetric algorithms. As key
transport always has to be done in an authenticated manner, these mechanisms fulfil the aim of entity (or user)
authentication at the same time. Three key transport mechanisms (which differ in the capabilities of the parlners
and the features) are specified:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1)
Key Transport
Mechanism
1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One pass; uses Digital Signatures and RSA encipherment together with a time-stamp or sequence number.
Follows lSO/lEC 11770-3 and conforms to ISO 11166-1.
Features: Mutual authentication (implicit/explicit),
key determined
by one party.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2)
Key Transport
Mechanism
2<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Two pass; uses asymmetric encipherment (RSA) together with random numbers. Follows lSO/lEC 11770-3.
Features: Unilateral authentication, key determined
by one party.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3)
Key Transport
Mechanism
3<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Three
pass;
uses
asymmetric
encipherment
(RSA)
together
with
random
numbers.
Follows
lSO/lEC
11770-3.

transactions.
For each transaction
a new set of

<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
specifies
key management
techniques
for keys
used
in the authentication,
encryption
and
decryption
of electronic
messages
relating to financial
transactions
using session
keys.
In particular,
this
standard
defines
security
interface
procedures
between
nodes,
methods
of interchange
of the
various
encryption
keys
used for securing
transactions
and ensures
that messages
can only be authenticated
at
their correct
destination.
The
conventions
may be adopted
in all situations
where
a secure
node-to-node
dialogue
is desired
and can be used in conjunction
with the terminal-to-acquirer
systems,
as described
in
another
part of the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The
objective
is to provide a key management
scheme
for use between
any two “nodes in a network
and
divide different keys for PIN encryption,
message
authentication
and privacy (data encryption).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A key hierarchy
of two levels is maintained:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)
Level 1 — Key Enc~pting
Key (KEK); the KEK is statistically
unique to each link and is used to encrypt
session
keys to enable secure exchange
of the keys on that link.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Level 2 —
Session
Keys
(KS);
separate
KS
are
maintained
for
each
function
and
direction
of
transmission.
There are two privacy (data encryption)
keys on a link; one for encrypting
data to be sent
and the other for decrypting
data
received.
There
are two MAC
keys:
one for computing
MACS
on
messages
to be sent and the other for verifying
MACS on messages
received.
There
shall be two PIN
encryption
keys for encrypting PINs on a link, one for each direction of transmission.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
advantages
of the system are two fold: a) the scheme
is independent
of the network architecture
and
allows for gateways
to other networks, and b) the node-to-node
scheme
can be used in conjunction
with the
schemes
as described
in AS 28056.2
and AS 28056.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>rhe objective
is to provide
a key management
scheme
for use between
a terminal
and an acquirer
in a
letwork. The terminal-to-acquirer
mechanism
provides for session keys to be generated
by the acquirer and
or these
to be communicated
to the terminal
encrypted
under a key encrypting
key. The
key encrypting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ieys
are
not like traditional
master
keys
in that they
are themselves
updated
by means
of a one-way
unction from information that is not transmitted.
The key update is initiated by the acquirer,
who controls the
Ipdate frequency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>rhe scheme
is used to prevent
back-tracking
of key encrypting
key changes
and,
hence,
prevents
back-
packing of transactions
prior to the last update of the key encrypting
keys. Furthermore,
the scheme
divides
iifferent keys for PIN encryption,
message
authentication
and privacy (data encryption).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

There

key
for encrypting
PINs
on a terminal-to-acquirer
link. For the terminal-to-acquirer
links,
these
keys are dynamically
created
by the acquirer
in such a way as to ensure
statistical
uniqueness
and to prevent the ability to forecast any key.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The advantages
of the system
are two-fold: a) the scheme
is independent
of the network
architecture
and
allows for gateways
to other networks,
and b) multiple acquirers
are allowed access to terminals
and each is
responsible
for its own security; less security on the part of one acquirer does not jeopardize
the security of
others.
Each acquirer to which a terminal can conimunicate
has its own partitioned set of keys and data that
cannot be accessed
by any other acquirer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

OF SCHEME:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
standard
defines
the interface
and method to initialize
remotely
a Terminal
Cryptographic
Unit (TCU)
and is designed
to be adopted
wherever
secure
remote terminal
initialization
is required and it is desired
to
avoid delivery
via a sponsor facility for secure
initialization.
The term “initialization” refers only to the initial
set-up of a cryptographic
keying relationship between
the TCU and the sponsor and acquirers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
main objective
of the scheme
is to remove the requirement
for visits by agents
of acquirers
during the
life of a TCU
for the purpose
of initialization
of key management
cryptographic
variables
and defines
the
technique
by which terminals
can be remotely initialized.
Initialization
is limited to cryptographic
initialization
of the first key of the TCU’S key management
scheme.
Furthermore,
the scheme
minimizes
the probability of
initialization of TCUS unknown to the sponsor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
