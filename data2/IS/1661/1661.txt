FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution  on 25  February 1972, after the draft finalized by the
Flooring and Plastering Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Cement plaster and cement plaster gauged with lime are widely used
in this country for finishing of walls and ceilings of buildings.
Practice in
the country with regard to the preparation,
application and finishing of the
plaster varies considerably from state to state and from department
to
department.
It is th,: object
of this standard
to lay down a code of
practice generally suitable to Indian conditions,
and striking a workable
compromise between theoretical requirements and existing practices.
This
standard which was first published in 1960 is now being revised taking into
account the experience
gained in the plastering work for the past one
decade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This code is intended chiefly to lay down requirements
regarding the
quality of materials, their selection and the manner of their application
in
plaster’ work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.
This
has
been
met
by
deriving
assistance
from
BSCP 211  :  1966 published by the British Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 This standard is one of a series of Indian Standards on plaster finishes.
Other standards published so far in the series are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 2394-1965
Code of practice for application of lime plaster fi-ish<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 2402-1963

<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I!s:1661-1972<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard’ is complied with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value ix this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Lime plasters, mud plasters and other special plasters are not covered by
this code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I2 Recommendations
are laid down
with regard
to the minimum
preparation of surfaces to receive the plaster. Different materials available,
their suitable mixes and the best methods of their application are also
discussed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

cover and
away from damp surfaces so as to prevent
deterioration
either
by moisture
or by intrusion
of foreign
matter.
If these
precautions

moisture and carbon
dioxide.
For
this
reason, it shall be kept in a dry  place and be protected
from direct
contact
with water, fumes from boilers
or similar
contamination.
Hydrated
lime
will not
develop
any
serious
deterioration
for a period
of six months
provided
it is left undisturbed
in the bag and kept in a cool dry place free
from draughts,
fumes from boilers or similar
contamination
( see IS  :  4082-
1967-/’ ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Sand-

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Tools -
All tools shall be cleaned by scraping and washing at the end
of each  day’s  work,  or after
use with
different
materials.
Metal
tools
shall be cleaned
and
greased
after each
operation.
The
tools shall be
examined
and thoroughly
cleaned
before plastering
is begun.
Cleanliness
is particularly
important
with cement
plasters,
where
contamination
with
set material
may seriously
affect  the  performance
as well as reduce
the
effective life of the tools.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Scaffolding
(  Staging ) -
Wooden
BALLIES,
bamboos,
planks,
trestles and other
scaffolding
materials
shall be sound and in accordance
with local b-uilding regulations.
These shall be properly
examined
before
erection and use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  DESIGN
CONSIDERATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Suitability
of Cement Lime Mixes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1  Plastering
mixes containing
lime putty dry hydrated
lime, cement
and
sand are
characterized
by high
workability
and marked
ease
of
application.
Such properties
become less pronounced
as the proportion
of
cement increases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2
Cement-lime
mixes have a reasonably
longer
working time  (Max
2  h ), a fairly slow rate of strength development
increasing with the amount
of
cement
added
and
adequate
early
strength
to withstand
modern
building
conditions.
They need moisture
to complete
the setting process
and, therefore,
rapid drying in the early stages should be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.3
The
weaker
mixes
of cement
lime
plaster
containing
smaller
proportions
of cement,
shall not be used in conjunction
with a strong
finishing coat.
Weaker mixes offer certain
advantages
over the stronger
(richer
) mixes when applied to non-rigid
backgrounds,
such as lathing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.4
For trowel finishes
( very smooth
surfaces ), mixes
of lime
and
cement shall not, in general,
be used for finishing coats,
as their shrinkage
on drying creates a tendency
for surface crazing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Number
of  Plaster Coats<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1  The ideal number
of coats, where practicable,
is two, namely,
the
undercoat
followed
by a finishing
coat.
It is recognized,
however,
that
much successful work has been carried out in the past with  plaster finishing
coats with a single coat on reasonably
plane backgrounds
of brick, concrete
and similar materials.
However,
for very rough surfaces,
such as rough
stone masonry,
three
coat
plastering
may be necessary.
Metal
lathing
normally
requires
a
three
coat
plaster
finish
for
successful
rtdts.
Renovation
work on wood laths should also be carried out in three coats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2
The range of coats normally
employed for different backgrounds
is
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>flumber of CoatJ<<HEADING_END>>

Internal

special techniques
may have to

on good
craftsmanship.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6  Corrosive
Effect on Metals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.1  In normal circumstances,
matured
plaster work may be regarded
as dry and therefore non-corrosive.
Such dangers of corrosion as do arise
should only occur during the initial drying period and subsequently
during
periods of heavy condensation.
Plasters containing
uncarbonated
lime ( for
example,
lime and cement
mixes ) have a protective
effect on iron and
steel, but are likely when persistently damp to corrode lead and aluminiym
unless protected
by a suitable paint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.2
Plastering
mixes in which sand or water
contaminated
with sea-
salts have
been
used
are
likely
to be
continually
damp,
due
to the
deliquenscent
or moisture-attracting
nature
of the salts, and may corrode
metals
in contact
with them.
Frost proofing additives containing
soluble
chlorides,
for example,
calcium chloride,
are likely to have similar effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.3
Protection
may be given to steel and aluminium
when necessary by
means of suitable metallic or paint coatings.
Sleeves
of material
resistant
to any
corrosive
effects may sometimes
provide
a convenient
means of
avoiding contact of metal pipes or conduits
with plasters which accelerate
corrosion,
or the metal
may be embedded
in a plastering
mix of a more
suitable
composition.
Under
persistently
wet
conditions
no form
of
plastering
can be relied on to protect metals from corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.4
With cold water service pipes the provision of an insulating
sleeve
serves also to avoid
condensation
of moisture
in the
plaster
in their
immediate
vicinity during the subsequent
life of the building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7  Effect of Atmospheric
Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7.1  The
prevailing
weather
at the time of plastering
or during
the
setting,
drying
and
hardening
period
may
affect
the finished work as
follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Frost -
The destructive effect of frost on plaster work is substan-
tial.
Unless
special
precautions
are
adopted,
plastering
work
shall be suspended entireIy during frosty weather.
Recommenda-
tions have
been
made
from
time
to time in countries
which
experience
long
continued
periods
of frosty weather
and they
should serve as a guide to good practice in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_17>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1661- 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Cold -
rhe
setting and
hardening
times of all
plasters
are
appreciably
lengthened
by a reduction
in
the atmospheric
temperature.
Where plastering has got to be carried out in cold
weather, the time intervals shall be lengthened to allow for this,
and the work programmed or re-programmed accordingly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  Condensation -
In certain
localities
condensation
resulting from
cold wintry conditions
may be so excessive as to impair the
finished plaster work.
It may also retard or prevent the drying
out of wet building operations for periods of week, or even months,
thus presenting conditions unsuitable for plastering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)  Extreme
dry Conditions-Under
hot dry conditions
the applied
plaster may become dry before the setting process is sufficiently
advanced.
The partially set weak material often has a powdery
surface which
will
not provide
a satisfactory
base for the
subsequent coat or for decoration.
Plasters containing
cement
are particularly
sensitive in this respect.
In such contingencies
the surface should be continually
kept wet during the curing
period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  GENERAL PRECAUTION
IN PLASTERING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Cleanlbss
and Protection of Existing Work<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.1  Cleanl‘iness is essential in carrying out plaster work.
Adequate
protection shall be given to all existing work and fittings which are liable to
be damaged, not only in the area of plastering operations, but also in the
approaches
thereto
by covering
up with boards,
dust sheets, etc,
as
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2
Cleaning
off on Completion -
On completion, all work affected by
plastering operations shall be left clean.
Special care is necessary when
removing set plaster from glass to avoid damaging its surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Suction
Adjustment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1  The
careful adjustment
of suction is very necessary for good
plastering, and may be done either by wetting the backing suitably if it is
dry, or by sprinkling with a cement-mix as in the case of a concrete surface
with low suction.
Without the aid of suction, plaster would creep and
slide down due to its own weight.
On the other hand, high rate of
suction withdraws all moisture from the plaster and makes it weak porous
and friable.
Too much water makes it impossible to keep the mortar in
position till it sets.
A failure in bond due to excessive water leads to
further failures as the pocket formed may hold water and break up the
plaster when the water freezes; or if the water is salt-laden,
the same
results will be produced on evaporation by crystal formation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_18>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1661.1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.2
The
wall shall
not be soaked
but
only
damped
evenly
before
applying
the plaster.
If the surface
becomes
dry in spots, such
areas
shall
be moistened
again
to restore
uniform
suction.
A
fog-spray
is
recommended
for this work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3  Adjastment
of Working
to the Setting  Properties
of Plaster<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>89.1
Cement plasters and cement-lime
plasters contain
materials
which
set when brought
into contact
with water,
and the fullest
use of their
strength producing properties is not made unless the mix is applied before
the setting process has started.
If retampering
of such mixes is carried out
after the set has commenced,
an inevitable
loss in strength
and efficiency
will result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3.2
In
the case of cement
plasters,
the commencement
of the set is
accompanied
by a noticeable
stiffening of the mix.
In the case of cement
plaster heavily gauged with lime, however, it is not always obvious to the
operator
when the set has started and it is with this type of mix that the
retention
of the full measure
of strength
afforded
by the cementitious
material is particularly
important.
Such plasters may be overworked both
before and after application
with resultant
impairment
of the set of the
gauging
plaster.
This not only reduces
the strength of the materia1, but
also gives it the shrinkage
characteristics
of a pure-lime
plaster with its
liable accompaniment
of the surface crazing.
It is essential, therefore, that
mixes shall be used as soon as possible after water has been added and that
working periods recommended
in this code shall not be exceeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4  Control of Cracking -
This is normally
a structural
problem, but the
plaster will be able to reduce the effects of structural
cracking
by making
a trowel cut between adjacent
surfaces.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5  Maintenance
of
Proper
Time
Intervals -
Shrinkage,
partly
irreversible,
occurs on drying,
causing
stresses to be set up both  in  the
applied
coat and in the undercoat
or background,
and in order to avoid
break-down
of adhesion between successive coats, it is very important
that
the drying shrinkage of the first coat should be materially
complete
before
a subsequent
coat is applied.
The
rate of drying
will vary widely with
conditions
of temperature,
humidity and ventilation.
Proper time interval
serves to diminish the possibility of efflorescent
salts finding their way to the
final plaster surface, and also of the drying
and naturing
shrinkage
( map
crazing ) of the undercoat
reaching the finished
plaster face over a period
of time.
The surface then shall be allowed to set for at least a day  OF two
depending
upon the weather
( one day in summer and two days in winter ).
During this period the surface of this coat shall be kept damp and shall not
be allowed to dry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.  PRELIMINARY
PROGRAMMING
OF WORK<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1  All materials necessary for plastering shall be kept readily

<<HEADING level=3>>Is : 1661- 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>in advance
so as to mature
before
use.
An adequate
supply
of water
suitable for mixing the plaster and for curing purposes shall be available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 In building operations,
such as construction
of brick
and block
walls,
the encasement
of steel columns
and beams with concrete,
etc, requiring
plastering
shall be so programmed
that they
are sufficiently
matured
to
receive the plaster without
subsequent
damage
to plaster or decoration.
Careful
programming
and
avoidance
of last minute
alterations
in the
design or in the sequence of work can avoid serious damage
to the plaster
finish.
Where such alterations
are unavoidable
the permanent
decoration
shall be postponed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 Plastering
operations
shall not be started until all necessary fixing, such
as door and window frames, mantlepieces
are completed
and all pipes and
conduits to be embedded
in the wall or plaster are installed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.4 A preliminary
inspection
shall be made to ensure that the surfaces are
in a suitable condition
for plastering,
particularly
as regards their planeness
and dryness.
If dubbing
out is necessary,
it should be done in advance, so
that an adequate
time interval may be permitted
before
the application
of
the first undercoat.
Plastering
operations
shall be so scheduled
as to allow
sufficient interval between undercoats
and finishing coats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10. SEQUENCE
OF
OPERATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  For external
plaster,
the plastering
operations
may be started
from
the top floor and carried downwards.
For internal
plaster,
the plastering
operations
may be started wherever
the building frame and cladding
work
are ready and the temporary

OF PLASTER<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 Proportioning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.1  The material
used in the preparation
of plastering
mixes may be
measured
by volume using gauge boxes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.2
Cement
shall
be measured
by
weight.
For
the
purpose
of
proportioning
one cubic metre of cement shall be taken to weigh
1 440 kg
approximately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.3
Proportioning
of lime may be done by measurement
of volume as
lime putty or dry hydrated
lime before the preparation
of putty.
The mix
proportion
of lime, unless otherwise
stated, generally
refers to the volume
of  putty.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  1  -
Lime putty weighs about 1280 kg/m*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTES  -One

putty.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.4  Quantity of Water-
For general
cement-plaster
work with 1  :  3
proportion
the quantity
of water required
is about 70 percent by weight
of
cement.
This
may,
however,
vary depending
on
the
following
factors,
and adjustment
shall be done as explained
in IS  :  2250-1965*:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The nature and condition
of the fine aggregate;
‘b) The temperature
and humidity
at the time of working;

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.1
Cement-Lime Plaster -
The cement-lime

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.3
Cement-lime
plaster .shall be used within two hours after the
addition of water to cement provided it is kept agitated or turned over at
intervals of at least 20 min.
Cement plasters shall be used within half an
hour after the addition of water. Any mortar or plaster which is partially
set shall be rejected and removed forthwith from the site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2.4 Mixing may be done either manually or mechanically.
‘  Hand

platform.
During
mixing, the mortar shall be heed back and forth for 10 to 15 min after the
water IS added.
In  c  machine mixing  ’  the mixer shall run at least 5 min
after placing all the ingredients in the drum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.4.1

<<HEADING level=3>>12.  PREPARATION
OF BACKGROUND
FOR APPLICATION
OF
PLASTER<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1  For the durability of the plaster or rendering, it is vital to obtain a
satisfactory bond between the background and the first plaster coat and
also to ensure that the bond is maintained subsequently. The requirements
of good background in this respect are explained in 12.1.1 to 12.1.7.2.
Necessary preparation of the background shall be done to fulfil these
requirements.
The preparation
for different types of backgrounds is
individually dealt with in 12.2 to 12.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1 .l  Cl+fanlincss -
The loose  layer of dust on masonry shall be removed
either by watering or by brushing as required.
A freshly cast concrete
surface is often covered by laitance and this shall be removed.
A concrete
surface may also often be contaminated by the soap which is formed with
calcium hydroxide and the oils in the moulds.
The contaminated layer
shall be removed by brush.
Special care shall be taken in repairing for
rendering an bld plaster coat.
Old layers of the plaster coat shall be
completely removed and made good.
Crumbled and frost-damaged par-U
shall be cut out and patched.
Any trace of algae or mass formation shall be
removed.
If the background contains soluble salts, particularly sulphates,
the application of the plaster shall be done only after the efflorescence of
the salts is complete, and the efflorescence is thoroughly removed from the
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.2  Roughnm-The
roughness of the background may generally
improve the bond of the plaster..
A smooth surface may be roughened by
wire brushing, if it is not hard; or by hacking or bush-hammering if.it is
hard.
Alternatively, to obtain a rough surface, a mortar 1 cement  : 1* to
3 coarse sand by volume prepared to a wet consistency may be forcibly<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>20<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_22>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Is : 1661- 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>dashed  or to  the surface ( spatterdash treatment)
by suitable means on to
a hard surface like concrete.
After roughening the surface, care shall be
taken to moisten the surface sufficiently before plastering, as otherwise the
surface may tend to absorb considerable amount of water from the plaster.
In addition to general roughness in the masonry, the joints shall also be
raked to a depth of about one centimetre for providing key to the plaster.
On a soft smooth surface after hacking
a thin coat of cement slurry
(1:l
: :  cement  :  fine sand ) may be applied.
In special cases wire netting,
etc, may be fixed to improve further the key to the plaster.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.3
Suitable
Suction  -The
adjustment of suction of the background
during the application of plaster is already dealt with in 8.2.
The amount
of water introduced in the bockground during its construction
has an
important bearing and adequate drying intervals shall be allowed between
erection
and
plastering
to bring! the
surface
suitable
for
suction
adjustment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.4
Evenness-
The
background
shall be even in order to avoid
variations in the thickness of the plaster.
Any unevenness must be levelled.
before the plaster is applied.
Local projections in brickwork are serious
from the point of view of plastering.
For three-coat plaster work, the local
projection shall not exceed 1.2 cm proud of the general surface as deter-
mined by the periphery of the surface concerned and local depression shall
not exceed 2.0 cm.
For two-coat plaster,
a local projection shall not
exceed 0.6 cm and local depression 1.2 cm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.1.5
Strength and Elasticity -
The strength and elasticity of the plaster
shall be compatible with that of the background.
The recommendations
given in this standard already  cover  this aspect.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.6  Immobility-
The background must be immobile at the time of
application
of the plaster or subsequently the movements of the back-
ground shall be in step with and in the same direction as those of the
plaster.
Differential movements between the background and the plaster
due to moisture
change,
temperature
change,
structural
settlement:
deflection, etc, will cause cracking of the plaster.
The  major  part of such
movements shall be allowed  to set in  before the plaster is applied, as for
example, by giving in the case of moisture movement sufficient drying
interval to the background.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.7
Precaution Against Discontinuity in Backgrow&
-
Cracking of walls
or of plaster is often caused by discontinuity,
for instance changing from
concrete to brickwork, from clay brickwork to lightweight concrete block
work or even changing from one type of brick  to  another.
Differential
drying shrinkage is probably the main cause but difference in thermal
movements may alsp contribute.
Reinforcement
of the plaster by metal
lathing or scrim over the junction
is not always successful.
The best
treatment may be to separate the two portions by a neat cut through the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>21<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_23>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I5:1661-1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>plaster
at the junction.
The junction
may be masked, if so desired, by
fixing a cover strip to one side.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.7.1
A change
from
wall
to
ceiling
can
be
regarded
as
a
discontinuity.
To provide for the crack, a cornice that would allow slight
movement
without
cracking
or a straight
cut through
the plaster at the
junction
may be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1.7.2
When plaster is applied to provide an unbroken surface over
a board or slab background,
the plaster coat bridging
the joints is subject
to higher stresses and any movement
in the background
will show at once
by cracks along the joints.
To avoid this, the plaster is reinforced
at the
joints by fixing jute
scrim
( namely,
netting, gauge.
‘  scrimming  ’ ),  or a suitable
wire
This treatment
may still be ineffective if large changes in
humidity
take place and if thin board backgrounds
with high moisture
movement
are used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2
Surface
Preparation
for
Brickwork
or
Hollow
Block
Masonry
-
The masonry shall be allowed to dry out for sufficient period
so that initial drying shrinkage is fairly complete,
and suction
adjustment
is possible during plastering
( see 12.1.3
and 12.1.6
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.1
Joints
of new brickwork
or block masonry,
if particularly
the
bricks or blocks are smooth,
shall be raked
out
as the work
proceeds
(gee 12.1.2
).
Projecting
bricks shall
be trimmed
off where
necessary
( see 12.1.4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.2
Old brickwork shall be considered
on its merits with the object
of securing adequate key.
The surface shall be thoroughly
brushed down
to remove
dust and loose particles or efflorescence where it has occurred.
Low spots may,
where necessary,
be dubbed
out at this stage by means
of a mix similar to that intended for the first coat of plaster but stronger
( richer ) and coarser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3  Surface Preparation for  in situ  Concrete<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3.1  The
surface
shah
be
cleaned
and
roughened
as in
12.1.1
and 12.1.2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3.2
Concrete
surfaces
shall
have
sufficient
roughness
to provide
proper
adhesion
( see 12.1.2 ).
The
surface
shall
be
evenly
wetted
( not saturated ) to provide correct suction ( see 12.1.3 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1243.2.1
If a chemical
retarder
has been applied
to the formwork,
a
roughened surface may be formed by wire-brushing
and all the resulting
dust and loose particles cleaned off, and care shall be taken that none of
the retarders
is left on
the concrete
or on other
surfaces,
as it may
interfere with the set of the plaster or with other building operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>123.2.2
Where mechanical
key-forming
devices have been used in the
concrete,
these shall be stripped
off if still adhering
and
the resulting
surface cleaned down.

When
the
boards
or
slabs
are
fixed
in
accordance
with relevant
Indian
Standard
for fixing wall coverings and

‘  scrimming  ’ (see  12.1.7)
is all the preparation
that is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.  APPLICATION
OF UNDERCOATS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1 The Rendering or First Coat
13.1.1  The rendering
coat shall be 10 to 15 mm thick and carried to the
full length of the wall or to natural
breaking
points like doors or windows.
Before
the
rendering
coat
hardens,
it shall
be roughened
to provide
mechanical
key for the second coat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1.2
Masonry
walls on which plaster is to be applied directly,
shall be
properly set and cured with the joints raked to a depth of at least 10 mm.
Before
applying
the rendering
coat,
the
surface
shall
be cleaned
and
damped evenly to control suction,
an essential treatment
for securing
first
class work.
The rendering
coat shall be trowelled hard and tight, forcing
it into surface depressions
to obtain a permanent
bond.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1.3
On
smooth
concrete
walls,
the
surface
shall
be roughened
according
to 12.1.2
and the rendering
coat shall be dashed on to ensure
adequate
bond.
The dashing of the rendering
coat shall be done using a
strong whipping motion at right angles to the face of the wall, or it may be
applied
with
a plaster-machine
or
cement-gun.
In
either
case,
the
plaster shall be projected
on to the surface with considerable
force.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.2
The Floating
or Second
Coat -
Before starting to apply the second
coat, the surface of the rendering
coat shall be damped evenly as described
in 8.2.
The
second
coat
shall
be approximately
3 to 8 mm
thick.
It shall be brought
to a true, even surface and then roughened
to provide
bond for the finishing coat.
Each under coat shall be damp-cured
for at
least two days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.  APPLICATION
OF FINISHING
COAT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1  Before starting
to apply the finishing
coat,
the second
coat shall be
damped evenly as described
in 8.2.
Whenever
possible,
textures
shall be
applied from top to bottom in  one operation  to eliminate joining
marks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2 Coloured
Cement
Work<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2.1
This work may be classified under two categories
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) In
which
the coloured
cement
used in the work is made by
intimately
grinding mineral pigments with the cement clinker, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_25>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I!3 : 1661- 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Where mineral pigments are added to white or ordinary  (grey  )
cement to get the required shade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The former method has the advantage that the work can be carried
out in the absence of skilled workmen.
The mineral pigment added shall
not in any way interfere with the physical and chemical
properties
of
cement.
14.2.2 In the case of coloured cement plastering, it is necessary to add
an
integral
waterproofer
in
the
undercoats
to minimize
the risk  oi
efflorescence.
Where a coloured cement plastering is to be done on an
already existing mortar base, it is recommended to apply a surface water-
proofer on the base and also mix an integral water-proofer
with the
coloured cement plaster for the finishing coat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.3  Special Finishing Textures -
Various types of special textures for
rendered surfaces may be obtained by using special tools for the application
of the final coat.
The special finishes shall be applied in accordance
with
the details given in IS : 2402-1963*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.  TRUENESS
OF PLASTERING
SYSTEM<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.1  The finished plaster surface shall not show any deviation more than
4 mm when checked with a straight edge of 2 m length placed against the
surface.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16. CURING
16.1 To develop maximum strength
and. density in the plaster, it is
necessary to cure cement and cement-lime
plasters properly.
Each coat
shall be kept damp continuously till the next coat is applied or for a
maximum period of 7 days.
Moistening shall commence as soon as the
plaster has hardened sufficiently and is not susceptible
to injury.
The
water shall be applied by using a fine fog-spray.
Soaking of wall shall be
avoided and only as much water as can be readily absorbed shall be used.
Excessive evaporation on the sunny or windward sides of buildings in hot
dry weather, may be prevented by hanging mattings or gunny bags on the
outside of the plaster and keeping them wet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.2 After the completion of the finishing coat, the plaster shall be kept
wet for at least seven days, and  shall'  be  protected during that period from
extremes of temperature and weather.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>17.  INSPECTION
AND  DIAGNOSIS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>17.1 Interrelation
of Various
Factorm<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>17.1.1  It is essential to determine the cause of any defects ,of plaster-
work before any attempt is made to remedy or repair them and unless the<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Code of practice for external rendered finishes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>24<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_26>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS :  1881- 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cause is properly dealt with, the majority of defects will continue to recur
after repair.
The interpretation of defects of plasterwork and the deter-
mination of their causes can only be done by approaching the subject in a
systematic and logical manner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>17.1.2
Since it is the final plaster finish which claims the attention of
the casual observer, it is a common error to blame only the plastering
materials or workmanship for all defects.
Actually,
these, although
perhaps the most important, are not the only factors that may influence
the final result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>17.1.3 Every defect in plastering is more or less connected with the
whole history and treatment of the background.
Consideration shall be
given not only to the plastering material used and to the quality of work-
manship, but also the climatic conditions prior to, during and after the
plastering process, and to the correct choice of the plastering system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>17.1.4 Detailed consideration has already been made in 7 and 8 or
several factors in this connection such as:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the possible causes for lack of bond between successive coats
of plaster and between the first undercoat and the background
concerned,
b) the possible effect of inadequate time intervals in promoting severe
efflorescence or  ‘  map crazing  ’  on the finished surface, and
c) the effect of climatic conditions in causing or aggravating the
above as well as other troubles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>17.1.4.1
Besides, the active influences of the various atmospheric
conditions, the effect of the physical properties of the building surface
prior to plastering shall also receive due consideration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18. PLASTERING
DEFECTS
AND THEIR
REMRDIRS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.1 General -
It is not possible to give simple rules for the correction of
all plastering defects or failures.
Many serious defects may be shown to
have causes outside the materials or techniques used in the plastering
operations and it is often useless to repair or even replace the plaster
without first having discovered and corrected ‘;le nrimary fault.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.1.1 Thus, penetration
of moisture through an external wall may
cause blistering, efflorescence, flaking or complete disintegration of the
plaster.
To patch or to replaster such a wall without first taking steps to
prevent further damp penetration would be useless. Again, plastered ceilings
may develop cracks because the ceihng constructron permits excessive
d&&ion,
and no plaster repair
could be expected to be effective in
preventing it.
Recurrent surface dampness may be associated with the
presence of deliquescent salts in the plasterwork,
but it would not<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>25<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_27>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 16619 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>necessarily
be effective to renew the plaster.
The salts may also be in the
background
and would probably
migrate
into the new plaster .and bring
about a renewal of the trouble.
This type of defect
usually
traced’ to- the
use of an unwashed estuarine
or sea sand, is best corrected
by battening
out and erecting
a new p!aster
base out of capillary
contact
with
the
affected area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.1.2
Defects caused by the use of unsuitable
plastering
materials
or by
faulty technique
may be corrected
by means of an appropriate
repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2 Typical
Plastering
Defects<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.1
Blistering -
This is due to intense local relative movement
of the
final coat, where the component
of the splitting force at right angles to the
plaster surface exceeds the bond strength
at the inter-face,
which is aggra-
vated by the absence
of an adequate
key between
the final
coat
and
undercoat.
The most common
cause is local exposure to radiant heat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.2
Bond Failure or Loss of Adhesion  -This,
according
to its severity,
results in  ‘  hollow  ’  patches, flaking of top coats,
or peeling
of substantial
areas.
It is essential to prevent moisture penetration
from the outside,
as’
otherwise peeling will eventually
occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.3
Cracking -
This is usually caused by movement
in the background
or the surrounding
structure.
Shrinkage
movement
in undercoats
based
on cement
or lime or the use of unsuitable
grades
of sand
may cause
cracking of the final coat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.4
Crazing -The
effect
of
this
may,
however,
be reduced
to
tolerable
or even to negligible
proportions
by attention
to the points
enumerated
in 18.2.4.1
and 18.2.4.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.4.1
Cement
plaster or cement-lime
plaster, attempts
to shrink
on
hardening
but is restrained
by bond with the background
which, either has
already
undergone
most of the shrinkage
if of concrete,
or is practically
immune from movement,
if of brick or stone.
This
restraint
to shrinkage
causes tensilestress
in the plaster which is maximum
at the skin.
If the
shrinkage.is
great, these failures develop in:o cracks which exist through the
whole depth of the plaster.
In order
to prevent
this formation,
it is
necessary
to limit
the
differences
in shrinkage
and thereby
reduce
the
tensile stress to within safe limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.4.2
Attention
to the following points will reduce the tendency
to
surface crazing to a minimum:
4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Use of well-graded
sand and the most
suitable
proportions
of
cement and sand as recommended
in this code;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Avoidance
of overworking
of cement
finishings
so that
excess

<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.5
E$orescence -
This is caused by the presence of soluble salts, such
as sulphates
of
sodium,
calcium
and
magnesium
normally
in
the
background,
and sufficient water to carry
these
to the surface
as the
structure dries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.5.1
Remedy -
Sealing coats may not effectively
hold back strong
efflorescence.
Dry brushing of the growth as it appears is the only remedy.
Efflorescent salts shall not be removed
by washing
with water as it may
carry some of the salts back into the pores.
On redrying,
efflorescence
may be even worse than before if the salts were still present in the structure.
Efflorescence
will continue
as long
as there
is sufficient
water in the
structure or plaster backings
to carry
the soluble
salts forward
and it is
useless to attempt
to seal the moisture
by the paint film on the surface.
The treatment
of an old wall with silicone solution will frequently
stop the
efflorescence as the liquid blocks the passage for movement of moisture.
In
the case of efflorescence
due to the rising of salt solutions through capillary
action from sub-soil the only remedy
is to provide bitumen
or metallic
seals in the walls above the ground level so that an effective
barrier
to the
capillary action is created.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.6
Grinning -
Grinning
is generally caused by marked differences
in
suction of the background
which are not masked
by
the procedure
of
adjusting the suction, and which are manifested
as areas of varying
texture
on the plaster surface.
Such differences are often caused
by the use of a
mortar having suction characteristics
markedly different
from those of the
bricks or blocks with which it is used.
Grinning
is more usually associated
with single coat work ( two coat work is normally
provided
on most solid
backgrounds
and with this thickness of plasterwork
grinning
is rare ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.7
Irregularity of Surface Texture-This
may
be caused
by faulty
workmanship,
but even a skilled craftsman
may be unable to prevent it on
backgrounds
exhibiting
varying
suction
characteristics
unless three coat
plastering is employed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.8
Pokbing or Blowing -
These
occasionally
occur
in plaster mixes
which contain
particles
of materials
which may keep on expanding
even
after the plaster coat has set.
The expansive force is sutllciently
great
to
push out the plaster in front of the particles, leaving a conical hole known
as a  ‘  Pop or Blow ‘. Insufficiently
slaked and unmatured
lime is frequently.
the source of unsound
particles
causing
popping
or  blowing.
Popping
may also be caused by the presence of particles of coal or other oxidizable
material contained
in the sand used for the plaster mix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.9 Recurrent Surf&e Dampness -
The presence
of deliquescent
salts as
occur in sea-water
will bring about recurrent
dampness
in plaster
dnisha
when
the atmospheric
humidity
is high.
It may
also be eau+d
by
condensation
of moisture
in chimney
flues with a permeable
lining,
for
example,
where slow combustion
stoves are employed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.10 Soj%tess or  Chalkiness -
This may result from excessive suction
of
the background,
undue
thinness
of the finishing
coat, working
past the
setting point, or subsequent
exposure
of the finishing
coat to excessive heat
or draught
during
settmg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>19.1  Plastering
work
shall
be protected
at all stages
of its life from
persistent
attack
by water
or moisture
either
through
the undercoats
or
through
the outer surface.
The matter is particularly
important
during
the
interval
between
plastering
and decorating.
Subsequent
decoration
on the
whole surface
may be vitiated
by a persistent
stream
of water
down on
particular
part due to flooding
of upper floors under
construction,
delay
in
provision
of gutters,
etc.
Thus would be particularly
serious
if conditions
are
favourable
to
formation
of efflorescence.
In
extreme
cases,
the
plaster
surface
may be softened
or badly
channelled,
necessitating
local
repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
