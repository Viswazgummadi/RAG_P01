<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
(Part 55) (First Revision)
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft
finalized by the Environment
Protection
and Waste Management
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Chemical
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pollution
caused
by substances,
on which
biotic
and abiotic
agencies
of decomposition
are ineffective,
is a
unique
type of pollution.
Toxic
trace elements
and heavy metals come under the category
of non-degradable
pollutants.
The problem
caused by these elements
is in fact due to their concentration
in the environment
in the
bio-av ailab]e state and above a certain concentration
become
harmful
to the living organism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Aluminium
is the third most abundant
element
of the earth’s
crust (estimated
range
from 8.1-8.8
percent
by
weight).
This wide distribution
accounts
for the presence
of aluminium
in nearly
all natural
waters.
In natural
waters,
the aluminium
concentrations
ranges from 3 pg/1 to 20 pg/1. Soluble,
colloidal
and insoluble
aluminium
may also appear in treated water or waste water as residual from the alum coagulation.
The aqueous
volubility of
alurninium
is lowest in approximately
neutralpH
environment,
but it increases in high and in lowpH
environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Plenty of aluminium
(Al) is present
in foodstuff
and water. It has been estimated
that a normal
individual
ingests
about 80.5 mg of this element
per day. Aluminium
levels as high as 50-60 times the average
daily intake do not
appear
to cause any interference
in the metabolism
of the human body. Higher
levels of aluminium,
however,
may interfere with phosphate
metabolism,
inhibit absorption
of fluorides, calcium and iron compounds.
Pulmonary
effects of aluminium
follow inhalation
of bauxite aerosols.
Both restrictive
and obstructive
pulmonary
diseases
develop
as a sequel
to fibrosis
in tissues
of lung. Aluminium
compounds
dissolved
in water
are much more
injurious than as particulate
in suspended
state. An ahrminium
content higher than 1.5 pg/ml may cause anorexia,
decreased
activity
and gill hyperplasia
in fishes. To plants the injuring
action of aluminium
is enhanced
under
acidic conditions
(pH 5 or below).
Roots become
thick,lack
-finer branches
and are unable
to absorb
water and
nutrients
efficiently.
Plants become
stunted,
stubby and brittle. Usually
young seedlings
are more susceptible
to
the toxic effects of aluminium
than older plants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However,
in view of the environmentally
prevalent
nature of Aluminium
compounds
in levels should be closely
monitored
to avoid any likelihood
of toxicity caused by this element.
As per IS 10500:
1991 ‘Drinking
water —
Specification
(/2rst revision)’
the permissible
limit for aluminium
in drinking
water
is 0.03 pg/1, maximum.
Beyond
this limit, a cumulative
effect is reported
to cause dementia.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The committee
responsible
for formulation
of IS 3025:1964
had decided to revise the standard
and publish it as
separate
parts .This standard
(Part 55) supersedes
31 of IS 3025:
1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard
considerable
assistance
has been derived-from
Standard
Methods
for the
Examination
of Water and Waste Water, 19th Edition,
1995, published by the American
Public Health Association,
Washington,
USA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Atomic absorption
method specified
in this standard
is technically
equivalent
to the Flame AAS method specified
in ISO 12020:
1997, ‘Water quality — Determination
of aluminium — Atomic absorption
spectrometric
methods’.
ISO 10566:
1994, ‘Water quality — Determination
of aluminium
— Spectrometric
method
using pyrocatechol
violet’ specifies
Spectrometric
method
using the indicator
‘Pyrocatechol
violet’ against
the use of’ Eriochrome

in Eriochrome,
cyanine
R method
of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the Committee
responsible
for formulation
of this standard
is given in Annex
A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the result of a test or analysis
made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final value, observed
or
calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS 2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding

<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
(Part

of aluminium:<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE —  ‘Purechemicals’shall mean chemicalsthat do not
containimpurities which affect the result of anal ysk<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2  Depending
upon
the concentration
range
and
interference
levels, choice of the method
is made. For
dissolved
aluminium
content,
filtration
through
0.45 mm membrane
filter is required.
Do not use filter
paper, absorbent
cotton, or glass wool for filtering any
solution
that is to be tested
for aluminium,
because
these will remove
most of the soluble
aluminium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 ERIOCHROME

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
Principle<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ahaninium forms a red to pink complex with’ Enochrome
cyanine R’ atpH 6.0. The colored complex obeys Beer’s
law and is suitable for spectrophotometric
measurements
between 525 nm and 535 nm. This method is applicable
in the range of 20 to 300 @
of aluminium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The standards
listed below contain
provisions
which
through
reference
in this text, constitute
provisions
of this
standard.
At the
time
of publication,
the
editions
indicated
were
valid.
All
standards
are
subject
to revision
and parties
to agreements
based
on this
standard
are encouraged
to investigate
the
possibility
of applying
the most recent editions
of the
standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2
Interferences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Interference
of heavy meals like iron and manganese,
often found in water, is eliminated
by adding ascorbic
acid. Flouride and polyphosphates,
give rise to negative
errors. Interference
from flouride
can be overcome
by
adding
known
amounts
(depending
upon
amount
of
fluoride present
in the sample)
of fluoride
to the set of
standards.
Similarly,
interference
due
to complex
phosphate
can be eliminated
during sample treatment
(see 5.5.3.2).
The interference
by alkalinity
can be
removed
by
acidifying
samples
just
beyond
neutralization
point of methyl orange.
Sulphate
do not
interfere
up to concentration
of 2 ~gll.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The water

For preservation,
the samples should be acidified with concentrated
nitric
acid (2 ml of concentrated

just
to bring
down
the pH
below
2). Unacidified
samples
should
be analysed
on the same day, while<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Prepare
a reagent

and
sufficient
standards
containing
O to 60 mg/1 of aluminium
by diluting
suitable volumes
of standard
aluminium
solution with
nitric acid (1 : 499) to 100 ml in volumetric

2 ml of KC1 solution
to each of the volumetric

<<PARAGRAPH>>The aluminium
content
of the sample
is determined
by atomic absorption
spectrophotometry.
For dissolved
aluminium
the filtered
sample
is directly
aspirated
to
the atomizer.
For total
recoverable
aluminium,
a
pretreatment
with cone
HC1 is carried
out, prior
to
aspiration
of the sample.
This method
is applicable
in
the range from 5 to 100 mg/1 of aluminium.
However,
the concentration
range will vary with the sensitivity
of the instrument
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.2  Determination

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Add 0.5 ml of concentrated
nitric acid to 100 ml of the
sample taken in a 250-ml beaker.
(If total recoverable
aluminium is to be determined,
use 100 ml of the sample
obtained after a pretreatment
as given below. Add 5 ml
of concentrated
hydrochloric
acid to 100 .ml of the
sample taken in a 250-ml beaker. Heat on a hot plate to
reduce the volume to about 50 ml and fiher the sample
through 0.45 pm membrane.
Transfer quantitatively
the
contents of the beaker to a 100 ml volumetric flask. Make
up to the mark in a volumetric
flask.) Add 2ml of KCI
solution to this. Prepare a reagent blank with 100 ml of
water. Rinse the atomizer by aspirating water containing
1.5 ml cone HNOJ1.
Aspirate
the reagent
blank and
carry out zero adjustment.
Aspirate the sample solution
and measure
the absorbance
at 309.3
