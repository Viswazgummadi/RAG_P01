FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part XXII
) ( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 February
1972, after the draft
finalized by the Soil Engineering Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With
a view to establish uniform procedures for the determination
of
different characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating
comparative
studies
of the results, the Indian Stahdards Institution is bringing out this  ‘  Indian
Standard Methods of Test for Soils  ’ (  IS  :  2720 ) which is being published
in parts,
Thirtythree
parts of this standard have been published so far.
This part deals with the method of test for the determination
of organic
matter content in the soil.
Organic matter is an undesirable constituent of
the soil from the engineering
point of view since it causes swelling or
shrinkage of the soil when the moisture content or the applied load changes.
The estimation
of organic matter,
therefore, forms an important
part of
soil examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 A wide variety of both dry and wet combustion methods are in use for
the determination
of the organic matter of soils.
Two methods which are
widely in use are given in this revision of the standard.
These methods
give reproducib/e results and the results are sufficiently accura.te for common
engineering purposes.
The first method is given as the standard method
and the other as an alternative
method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to reIating it to the practices in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

shall be
run from a burette
into a 500-ml
concial flask.
Twenty
millilitres
of con-
centrated
sulphuric
acid shall
then
be
added
carefully
and the mixture
swirled and allowed
to cool for some minutes.
Two hundred
millilitres
of
distilled water
shall then
be added
to the mixture
followed
by 10 ml of
phosphoric
acid and 1 ml of the indicator,
and the mixture
shall be shaken
thoroughly.
Ferrous
sulphate
solution shall then be added from the second
burette
in 0.5 ml increments,
the contents
of the flash being swirled, until
the colour of the solution changes from blue to green.
A further
0.5 ml of
potassium
dichromate
shall then
be added
changing
the colour
back
to
blue.
Ferrous
sulphate
solution
shall then be added
drop by drop with
continued
swirling until the colour of the solution changes from blue to green
after the addition
of a single drop.
The
total volume
of ferrous
sulphate
solution
used ( X)
shall be noted
to the nearest
0.05
ml ( 1 ml ferrous
sulphate
solution is equivalent
to 10*5/X ml potassium

).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  SOIL
SAMPLE
FOR
TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The soil sample as received
from the field shall be prepared
in accord-
ance
with
IS  :  2720
( Part
I )-19727.
The
portion
of
the
air
dried
sample selected for the purpose
of this test shall be weighed,
its moisture
content
determined
using separate
sample
for the purpose
and the equi-
valent
oven-dried
weight
( W,)
recorded.
It shall
then
be sieved on a
IO-mm IS Sieve and all particles
other than stones crushed
to pass through
the sieve.
The equivalent
weight on oven-dry
basis of the material
passing
IO-mm IS Sieve ( W’s ) shall be calculated
and recorded
to the nearest
O-1
percent
of its total weight.
A sample weighing
approximately
100 g shall
be obtained
from the material
passing the IO-mm
IS Sieve
by quartering
( see Notes 1 and 2 ).
This sample shall then be pulverized
so that it passes
the 425-micron
IS Sieve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

-This
method
gives high results of organic
content
in soils containing
The
chlorides
may be removed
at this stage by washing the soil with
distilled water until no turbidity is obtained when a drop of the washing water is tested
with silver nitrate solution.
Alternatively,
the effect of chlorides on the determination
can be partly eliminated by using concentrated
sulphuric acid in which silver sulphate
has been dissolved in place of the concentrated
sulnhuric acid soecified in 3.1.3.
If
the ratio of carbon to chloride does not exceed unity,*25 g of silver6ulphate
per litre of
sulphuric acid will be sufficient to precipitate the chloride.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  A 5-gram soil sample shall he taken from the thoroughly mixed
portion of the material
passing the 425-micron
IS Sieve and used for the
test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The sample shall be placed in a glass weighing bottle and weighed to
O*OOl g.
A small quantity,
from 5 g to 0.2 g depending on the organic
content (see Note ) shall be transferred to a dry 500-ml conical flask, the
weighing bottle reweighed and the equivalent
weight on oven-dry basis of
soil specimen removed ( I43 ) calculated by difference and allowing for the
moisture content of the soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The size of the specimen for chemical analysis will vary with the amount of
organic matter present in the soil.
As much as 5 g may be required for soil low in or-
ganic matter and as little as 0.2 g with a very peaty soil. After a number of determina-
tions have been made, experience will indicate the most suitable size of specimen to be
taken.
In unfamiliar types of soil it is suggested that a series of specimens of varying
sixes should be weighed out and tested.
The determination
giving a total of 5 to 8 ml
dichromate solution reduced should be taken as the correct result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Ten millilitres
of N potassium dichromate
solution shall be run into
the conical flask from a burette,
and add 20 ml of concentrated sulphuric
acid very carefully
from a measuring
cylinder.
The
mixture
shall be
thoroughly swirled for about one minute and allowed to stand on a heat
insulating s&face, such as asbestos, or wood, for 30 min to allow oxidation
of the organic matter to proceed.
During this period the flask shall be
protected
from draughts.
Distilled
water, 200 ml, shall then be added
along with 10 ml of orthophosphoric
acid and one ml of the indicator
( see Note ).
The mixture. shall be shaken vigorously.
If the, indicator
is
absorbed by the soil, a further 1 ml of the solution shall be added.
Ferrous
sulphate solution shall then be added from the second burette in 0.5 ml
increments,
the contents of the flask being swirled, until the colour of the
solution changes
from blue to green.
A further
0.5. ml of’ potassium
dichromate
shall then be added, changing the colour of the solution back
to blue.
Ferrous
sulphate
solution shall then be added drop by drop
with continued swirling until the colour of the solution changes from  blue<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.  CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  The total volume (  Yml  )  of potassium dichromate used to oxidize the
organic matter in the soil is given by the following formula:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V=
10.5 ( 1 -
Y/X)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Y=
total volume of ferrous sulphate used in this test, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X = total volume of ferrous sulphate used in the standard-
ization test (see 4.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 The percentage
of organic.matter
( OM ) present in the oven-dried
sample shall be calculated from the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Oh& percent by weight = “*F,
$s
’ ( see Note )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
w2  = weight on oven-dry basis of the soil sample passing
lO.mm IS Sieve,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V =  total volume of potassium dichromate used to oxidize
the organic matter, ( as in 7.1 ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>U’l =  weight on oven-dry
basis of the total soil sample
taken for the test before sieving, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ws  = weight on oven-dry basis of the soil specimen used
in the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -The
method is based on the determination
of the organic carbon content of
the soil and it assumes that soil organic matter contains an average of 50 percent of
carbon
by weight.
With
the technique employed approximately
77 percent of the
carbon in the organic material is oxidized.
These factors are included in the formula
given in 7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. REPORT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  The
test results should be recorded suitably.
A recommended pro

<<HEADING level=3>>13.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1 Oxidation of Organic Matter  -From
a pipette, 20,ml of 0.4 N
chromic
acid solution shall be added to the soil sample in the 250-ml
beaker or test tube, and similar quantity shall be taken for the standardiza-
tion blank.
The vessel with mixture shall be placed in the orthophos-
phoric acid bath and heated on the electric hot plate at such a rate that a
temperature of 155°C is reached in 20 to 25 min.
The  Icontents  of tube or
beaker shall
be mixed
every 5 min during &he eg
period.
The
temperature
is held
at 155. to IS@%
for an additional
5 mir).
The
thermometer shall be kept in the blank, which is simultineouoly
heated,
to follow the solution temperature.
13.2 The vessels with samples and blank shall be then removed from the
bath, allowed to drain in the air for 30 set, and then placed in a swater
bath at room.temperature
for 2 min.
The thermometer
shall be removed
with care not to break it by thermal shock.
13.3 Back Titration
-The
chromic acid solution, now cooled to rooin
temperature,
shall be diluted with water to 75 to 200 ml, either in the tube
or 250-ml
beaker.
Then 5 ml of 85 percent orthophosphoric acid and 4
drops of orthophenonthroline
indicator shall be added.
The solution shall
be back titrated with the O-2 N ferrous ammonium
sulphate until solution
colour turns from green to red at the end point. An air jet stirrer should be
used with the tube.
The colour at start is dark_ brownish,
and then shifts
sharply from blue to red at the end point.
The. blank shall be similarly
titrated.
More chromic acid shall be added to fresh samples if the amount
added proves to be inadequate;
not over one-half of the chromic acid should
be consumed by dxidation of organic matter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.  CALCULATION
OF RESULTS
14.1  The

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
In  deriving the constant 0.23, it is assumed a 4 valance
change
of carbon
occurs, 58 percent carbon occurs in soil organic matter, only
carbon
is oxidized,
and
only 90 percent of total soil organic matter is oxidized.
14.2 The organic matter content present shall be reported
to the nearest
0.1 percent of the original oven-dry soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
