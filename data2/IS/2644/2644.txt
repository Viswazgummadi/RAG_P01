<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Fourth Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the Steel Castings
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1964 and was revised in 1969, 1979 and 1986. While reviewing
the
standard
in the light of the experience
gained during these.years
the committee
has decided that the
standard may be further
revised.
In this revision
various clauses
have
been aligned
with the recent
standards on steel castings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>High strength steel castings have, in addition to high strength,
good toughness and often good weldabi-
lity. These
castings
find extensive
use in transportation
equipment,
agricultural
machinery
parts and
general
engineering,
as structural
parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard,
assistance
has been derived
from
ISO/DIS
9477 ‘High strength
cast steels for general
engineering
and structural
purposes’,
issued by International
Organization
for
Standardization
( IS0 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final
value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accord-
ance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised)‘.
The number of significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

each
melt. Drillings for analysis shall be taken from
not
less than
6 mm beneath
the cast surface,
and in such a manner as not to impair the use-
fulness of any casting selected.
The permissible

<<PARAGRAPH>>Analysis and reporting
of the analysis
in the
test
certificate
for
the residual
elements shall
be done only when so specified by the purchaser
in the enquiry and order.
However,
the manu-
facturer
shall ensure that the residual
elements
are
within
the limits,
when
such limits are
specified
by the purchaser
in the enquiry and
order.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All
castings
shall
be properly
fettled
and
cl;t;.sedd, and all surfaces
shall
be thoroughly<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12 HEAT TREATMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1 The
castings
shall be heat-treated
in a
properly
constructed
furnace,
having
ade-
quate means of temperature
control,
which shall
permit
the whole
of the castings
being uni-
formly
heated
to the necessary
temperature.
All castings
shall be suitably heat treated
so as
to attain the specified mechanical
properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9 WORKMANSHIP
AND FINISH<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 The castings shall be accurately
moulded
in
accordance
with
the pattern
or the working
drawings
supplied
by the purchaser
with the
addition
of such letters,
figures and marks as
may be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2 The test pieces shall be heat treated
along
with the casting they represent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13 MECHANICAL
TESTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 The purchaser
shall specify
the tolerances
on all important
dimensions.
On other
dimen-
sions, tolerances
specified in IS 4897  :  1994 shall
apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1 The
mechanical
properties
specified
are
those
which
are to be obtained
from test bars
cast either
separately
from or attached
to the
castings to which they refer
and heat
treated
as given
in 12. The
test
values so exhibited;
therefore,
represent
the quality
of steel from
which
the castings
have been poured,
they do
not
necessarily
represent
the properties
of the
castings themselves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10 FREEDOM
FROM DEFECTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1  All castings shall be free from defects
that
will adversely
affect
machining
or utility
of
castings.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.2 The
tensile
test shall be carried
out in
accordance
with IS 1608  :  1972. The relevant
mechanical
properties
shall
be
as
given
in Tabl: 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 When necessary to remove
risers or gates
by flame or arc or a combination
thereof,
or by
any other process
involving
intense
heat,
care
shall
be taken
to make the cut at a sufficient
dtstance from the body of the casting
so as to
prevent
any defect
being
introduced
into the
casting due to local heating. Any such operation
is to be done before final heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.3 7 he Brine11 Hardness when tested in accor-
dance with IS’1500  :  1983 shall be as specified
in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.3.1 The hardness test shall be carried
out on
the ends of tensile
test specimens or when so
stated in the enquiry
and order, ‘on castings
preferably
on a rectangular
pad 20 mm x 40 mm
so located
on the casting
as to permit proper
mounting
on the Brine11 tester.
The
location
where
hardness
reading
is taken
shall
be
properly
prepared
to eliminate
the effect
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3 In the event of any casting proving
defec-
tive from
foundry
causes in the course of pre-
paration,
machining
or  erection,
such casting
may
be rejected
notwithstanding
any previous
certification
of
satisfac:ory
testing
and/or
inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>15 REPAIR  OF CASTINGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.1 Unless otherwise
specified
by
the
pur-
chaser
in the enquiry and order, castings may
be rectified by welding. All repairs
by welding
shall be carried
out in accordance,
with the
procedure
laid
down
in IS 5530  :  1987.
If
castings have been subjected to non-destructive
or bydraluic testing by agreement
between
the
purchaser
and the
manufacturer,
the castings
shall
be re-examined
in the area of repair
following any rectifying
operation
performed
on
the castings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.4 If specified in the enquiry
and order,
the
impact
test shall be carried out in accordance
with IS 1757  :  1988and the values obtained shall
conform to the requirements
given in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14 NON-DESTRUCTIVE
TESTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1 Non-destructive
testing shall be applied
if
so specified in the euquiry and the order. Under
this heading
are grouped
the tests, which aim
at revealing defects
which
cannot
be revealed
by a simple visual examination,
such as penet-
rant,
magnetic
particle,
ultrasonic,
X-radio-
graphic,
or
gamma-radiographic
inspection;
also included
under
this heading are tests on
the surface condition
by visual or visual-tactile
examination.
The purchaser
shall specify
in the
enquiry and order:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.2 To form the basis of an agreement between
the purchaser
and the supplier in this respect,
the following classification
shall apply concern-
ing the extent of repair:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Weld repair involving a depth not exceed-
ing 20 percent of wall thickness or 25 mm,
whichever
is lower, shall be termed
as a
minor repair;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The type of non-destructive
testing which
he intends
to carry
out
or to
have
cal ried out  ;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Any weld repair
exceeding
the
above
shall be termed
as a major repair. Fur-
ther
any single repair
having an area
excleding
250 mm square for every milli-
metre
of wall
thickness
shall also
be
deemed to be a major
repair,
regardless
c$&
considerations
mentioned
in (a)
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The area or areas of the casting to which
these
tests
apply,
and the types of dis-
continuity,
)vhere relevant;
c) Whether
all, or what proportion,
of the
castings are to be tested;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The severity level defining the acceptabi-
lity or non-acceptability
of defects
which
may be revealed;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.3 Carbon Equivalent<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise
specified
in the
enquiry
and
order,
or
otherwise
agreed
to,
the
Carbon
Equivalent ( C.E. ) for the purpose of guidance
in determination
of
the
pre- and post-weld
treatment

to carbon
and low alloy
steels shall be computed
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Whether
the manufacturer
is or is not
contractually
responsible for carrymg out
the tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2 Unless otherwise agreed upon,
