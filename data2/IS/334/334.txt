<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen, Tar and Their Products Sectional Committee, PCD 6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Third Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, afler the draft finalized
by the Bitumen, Tar and Their Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Petroleum, Coal and
Related Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1953 and subsequently revised in 1965 and 1982. Due to considerable
developments
in the application of bitumen, tar and their products in the engineering and chemical fields
resulting in an increase in the number of terms used, it became necessary to revise the standard to standardize
the terminology on a more exact basis so as to avoid ambiguity and confusion. It is hoped that the glossary of
terms in this revision would help in fixing a more precise meaning of words which have acquired too general
usage. To facilitate ease of reference, the terms have been arranged alphabetically.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation of this standard, due weightage has been given to International co-ordination among the
standards and practices prevailing in other countries and this has been met by drawing assistance tlom ASTM
D 8-1997 ‘Standard Terminology Relating to Materials for Roads and Pavemenk’
issued by the American
Society for Testing and Materials, USA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given in Annex A<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
