( and for larger
diameters,
with the  width

<<PARAGRAPH>>Note-The
crown
values
given
in Tables

by the formula
h = 0,003 x D, where D is the
diameter
of the pulley.
An upper

has, however,
been applied
above
a certain
va!ue of Dfor

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The pulleys
shall
be of solid
or split
construction,
and with flat or crown
face, as may be speci-
fied by the purchaser.
Pulleys
with
central
disc construction
are also
permissible
in the smaller
sizes,
but additional
details
of such pulleys
shall
be subject
to agreement
between the manufacturer
and the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 In case of mild steel pulleys,
the boss may be of cast iron or of mild steel,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 If cast iron is used for pulleys,
the casting
shall
be of close
grain
and free from
porosity
or
blow
holes
after
machining
and free from contraction
cracks and hollows
in the
spokes,
centre
plate and boss.
Iron cement or other recognized
filling
medium
may, however,
be used to fill
small
defects
in the rim, centre plate and boss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 When the length of the boss is more than twice the diameter
of the bore, chamfered
bores are
acceptable
provided
the width
of the chamfer
is not greater than o.ne-third
of the boss length,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 Any superficial
defects in the rim, boss and web (excluding
those
in spokes ) may be rectified
by welding
or brazing
in such a way as not to give rise to internal
stresses.
The use of plastic
having
the appearance
of metal, or lead or of compressed
soft metals,
is not permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 The spokes
made of steel may be shrunk fit or securely
screwed
where the hub is made of cast
iron,
and may also be welded
if the hub is made of steel.
shall
be cast solid with the hub.
Where the spokes are of cast iron, they<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7 The joints
between the rim and the spokes may be either welded
or riveted
where
both rim and
spokes are made of mild steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 The rim and bore shall
be machined
to have a good finish.
Unless
otherwise
specified
by the
purchaser,
the bore shall
be machined
for sliding
fit on the appropriate
shaft
( see 3.5 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9 The face of cast iron pulleys
shall be machined,
either flat or crown,
as may be specified
by the
purchaser.
The face of mild
steel
pulleys
shall be either rolled
or machined
to form flat or crown,
as may be specified
by the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10 The rivet heads or protruding
welded
portions
on the rim face shall
be properly
dressed
smooth
to prevent
damage to the belt.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11  Sharp
corners
on the rim edges of both cast iron
and mild steel pulleys
shall
be removed to
prevent
damage to the belt.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12 The faces of the boss and rim sides
of both cast iron and mild
steel
pulleys
shall
be well
finished.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.  Balancing
of Pulleys
-Since
out-of-balance
pulleys
set up vibrations
which
increases
as the
speed
increases
or which
may develop
to serious
amplitudes
at certain
speeds,
all pulleys
shall be
balanced
statically,
and
they
shall
be dynamically
balanced
subject
to agreement
between
the
manufacturer
and the purchaser
if the width
of the face in relation
to the peripheral
speed makes it
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  True Running
-The
permissible
errors for true running
of the outside
diameter
and rim sides
of the pulleys
shall
be as given in Table
5.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. Tests<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  True Running
-For
testing
the true
running
of the outside
diameter
and rim sides, the pulley
shall
be fitted
to the respective
size of test mandrel
and shall
be placed
on lathe centres.
The
pulley
shall
be revolved
slowly
to find out the degree of inaccuracy
as illustrated
in Fig. 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2  Sfafic Balancing
-
Test for balancing
shall
be made in a balancing
machine.
A typical
testing
machine
is illustrated
in Fig. 3.
The
machine
essentially
consists
of two supporting
frames each
carrying
a bevelled
straightedge
which
has been carefully
levelled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Purchasers
are recommended
to get

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2. Cast  Iron Pulleys -
The diameters
of cast iron pulleys
most commonly
in demand
are given
in Table
1.
It is quite
common
for users to give their
own drawings
for cast iron
pulleys
up to
200  mm diameter,
but even UP to this diameter,
efforts should
be made to popularize
the sizes
that
have been tabulated.
Above 200 mm the sizes given in the table are quite popular.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard,
originally
published
in 1960, was revised
in 1968 to bring
this
standard
in line
with
the then current
technological
practices.
The present
revision
has been taken up to bring this
standard
in line with the modern
manufacturing
techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pulleys
of various
types are in use for different
power
transmission
systems.
This
standard
covers
the
requirements
only
for
mild
steel and cast-iron
flat and crowned
pulleys
of the very
commonly
used types.
It does not include
dynamo pulleys
and other special
types of pulleys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While
preparing
this standard
assistance
has been derived
from the following
standard
issued
by the International
