FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by _the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 28 February
1983, after the draft
finalized
by the Prefab-
.
ricated
and
Composite
Construction
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The scheme
consists of a nominally
reinforced
precast
open box type
concrete
units
called
waffle
units laid in a <grid pattern
and cast-in-situ
concrete
in the joints
between
the units with the reinforcement
provided
in the joints.
Minimum
thickness
of top screed
is provided
depending
upon structural
and functional
requirements.
The
finished
slab
has a
pleasant
grid
pattern
in
the
ceiling.
The
scheme
is suitable
for
roofs/floors spanning
in two directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  ‘This standard
covers tile details
of construction
of floors
and
roofs
using precast
concrete
waffle units.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  DETAILS
OF THE
SCHEME<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Precast
Unit<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1 S/m/x -- The  units are of the.shape
of an inverted
trough,
square,
rectangular,
triangular
or any other shape.
‘l’he ribs of the units may be
given
an outward
slope to enable
the precast
components
to demould
easily
and
also
to enable
them
to act monolithically
with cast-in-situ
beams
in joints between
the units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Size -
The
lateral
dimensions
of the units
should
be modular
( see IS  :  6820-1972*
).
The
depth of the unit shall be as per structural
design
and
will
vary
according
to loads
and
spans.
The
minimum
thickness
of the flange and web of the units shall be 25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. MATERIALS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  General
-
The material
used for the construction
shall
conform
to
IS  ;  456-1978f.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. STRUCTURAL
DESIGN<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The
grid slab shall be analysed
by any of the accepted
methods
of
analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The
precast
units
shall
have
adequate
strength
and
stability
in
accordance
with relevant
code of practice
( IS  :  456-19787
) during
th?
following
stages:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Demoulding;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Handling,
stacking,
transporting
and placing;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) With all design
loads together
with dead load of in-situ
concrete
in joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  Where  portland pozzolana cement is used delayed strength development
at the early ages  shall be  considered.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3
Loads
shall be in accordance
with IS  :  875-1964:.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 For calculating
the limit state of collapse
at the critical
cross sections,
at stage of demoulding
and handling,
a load factor
of at least
1.5 shall
be applied
for calculating
the design
limit state of collapse
load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. MOULD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 The mould
used for manufacturing
waffle slabs normally
consists
of
two parts
(a) bottom
mould
and
(b) side moulds.
The
bottom
mould
can be made out of timber,
masonry,
concrete,
steel
FRP,
plastic
or any
other material
acceptable
to engineer-in-charge.
The side moulds
simi-
larly
can
be timber,
steel,
FRP
or
plastic.
When
using masonry
or
concrete
moulds,
the top surface
shall be finished
to the required
accu-
racy and made smooth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case
of masonry
moulds,
the
use of
chicken
mesh
or
fibre
reinforcement
in the
top
surface
will
help
in making
the mould
last
longer
for higher
efficiency.
Admixtures
for higher
strength
of concrete
can also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
