<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 30 June
1972,
after the draft finalized
by the Thermal
Insulation
Materials
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Chemical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Cellular concrete is a versatile thermal insulation material
on account
of its light weight and high thermal
insulation.
Its versatility
is due to
its resistance to sulphate action, resistance to alternate cooling and thawing
( when high pressure steam cured ) and due to its resistance to penetration
of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 When cast  in-situ,  it  can be applied
over flat roofs as thermal insula-
tion material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
