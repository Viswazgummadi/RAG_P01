<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by
the Hydraulic
Structures
Instrumentation
Sectional Committee had been approved
by the River
Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
device developed
for recordirg
stress directly,
is not capable of recording tensile stresses.
Besides, it is very expersive and requires much more care for installation
than
that
required
for
strain
measurirg
instruments.
For
this reason
measurement
of strain in the dam is considered
important.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Strain measuring
device, when embedded
in the concrete
dam determines
actual
accumulated
length
changes
at the point
of instrument
location due to changes in volume of mass concrete,
namely, those
resulting
from applied
loads and due to several
other
causes such as creep,
temperature
change, moisture change and chemical action of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recessary
to sort out those parts of changes in length which are not attributed
directly to
stress developments
in the mass concrete.
These parts are due to  : (  a ) volume
changes
due to
charges in moisture content, ( b ) thermal expansion, and ( c > autogenous
growth.
For large mass
of concrete,
it has been observed that moisture change is inconsequential
and in most cases may
be neglected in the stress-strain
computations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effect of temperature
on the volume change of concrete
through thermal expansion
shall also
be considered.
To compute
this effect, a laboratory
determination
of the coefficient of thermal
expansion
of the concrete of the dam containing
the embedded instruments
is made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The volume
change
due to autogenous
growth
characteristics
vary depending
on the type of
cement used and the materials used in making the concrete.
The growth may produce an increase
or a decrease in volume during the process of hydration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With a view to determining
strain due to all causes other than stree, a ‘no-stress’ strain meter
exposed to the same conditions
as those of the surrounding
concrete close to the strain meter is
installed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard, is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules
for rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers the details
of installation,
maintenance
and observation
of electrical
type
strain measuring device suitable for embedment
in concrete dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The strainmeter
is in the form of a long cylinder
with flanges on each end to anchor the ends of
the
meter
to the surrounding
concrete.
Its
construction
details are shown in Fig. 1.
White
cotton
cloth is wound around
the cylindrical
portion which is corrugated
in order
to allow
deformation.
The cotton
cloth
is taped
so
that
when
the
instrument
is embedded
in
concrete
the
strainmeter
allows
flange
only
its
ends
to make
a
contact
or
bond
with the surrounding
concrete.
Within a flexible
brass cover is a steel framework
on which are
supported
procelian
spools around which are
wound,
under
sufficient
initial
tension,
two
equal
coils
of fine steel music wire having
resistance RA and RB. When the ends of the
meter are pulled apart by expansion,
the outer
or expansion
coil elongates
and increases
in
tension and resistance.
At the same time inner
or contraction
coil
decreases
in tension
and
resistance as it shortens.
Changes in the ratio
of the
resistance
of the
outer ( expansion )
coil to the inner ( contraction
) coils used as
a
sensitive
measure
of
length
change
in
the strainmeter.
The change
in ratio
of 0’01
percent normally indicates a change in length of
about 4 millionth of centimetre
per centimetre.
Resistance
ratio
change
are not
affected
by
simultaneous
changes due to temperature
of the
wires since temperature
change affects both coils
by an equal amount.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in such a manner that
the natural frequency
of vibration
of the wire is
a function of the change in the distance between
the flanges.
The flanges,
when embedded
in
a concrete
structure,
will follow
the strain
in
the concrete;
consequently,
the square of the
gauge
wire frequency
will be proportional
to
the strain in the concrete.
A single gauge may
be used or several guages may be combined
to
form a variety of rosette configurations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The range
of strainmeters,

installed,
is of the order
of 0’001 cm/cm of

as applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A hole is drilled in a completed
lift of concrete
or formed
at
the time of concrete
placement
into which an anchor rod is installed by grout-

anchor
rod
will have
a threaded

blocks through a
groove
already
formed
in the previous
lift
and then covered with mortar.
The above works
are
carried
out a day prior to the
placing of
next lift of concrete.
The strainmeter
group is
temporarily
covered
with a box which will be
removed
when
the area around
the group
is

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 Forms of Record<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Observations
shall be recorded
on a suitably
designed
printed
field

form.
These
forms should
be got
printed
sufficiently
in
advance and kept ready.
Duplicate copy of the
observations
should be prepared
simultaneously.
The original should be sent to the Design Office
or
to the office entrusted with the analysis of
data and duplicate retained
in the field record
office for future reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 OBSERVATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  Observations
of
the resistance
ratio
and
resistance
of the
strainmeter
are
made
by
connecting
the meter conductors,
until these are
soldered to the terminal
contacts
on terminal
boards, to the binding
posts
of the standard.
Wheatstone
bridge in the order specified by the
manufacturer.
Subsequent
to their terminations
on the terminals
boards
in galleries,
observa-
tions
of meters
are made by’ connecting
the
required cluster of contacts to the test set with
the help of female plug which has socket at one
end and individual
conductors
equipped
with
metallic like terminals for connection
to the test
set binding posts at the other end.
Care should
be taken to connect the cable leads in the order
specified by the manufacturer
to ensure correct
measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9 SOURCES
OF ERRORS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Presence of moisture inside terminal panel
in case of unbounded
strain gauge type.
b) Loose circuit connections
of the test set.
c) Faulty cable leads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Imperfect cable splice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Presence of deposit on cluster of contacts.
f) Low voltage of batteries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Note the zero frequency
of the gauge before
installation.
The variation,
if any, for the zero
frequency
recorded
in the calibration
data pro-
vided with the gauge could be due to difference
in the temperature
from the clibration
tempera-
ture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10  COLLECTION
OF
COMPLEMENTARY
DATA<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following
properties
of the dam concrete
shall be defined:
a) Modulus of elasticity at various ages.
b) Poisson’s ratio.
c) Creep properties
at various ages.
d) Coefficient of thermal expansion.
e) Autogenous
growth.
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During and after the installation
of
the
strain
guage in concrete,
regular
readings
shall
be
taken
and recorded.
A reading is taken after
the concrete
is set and it shall be recorded
as
initial reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Thermal
diffusivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in case of vibrating wire type strain-
meters,
since
in this
case
the
calibration
constants
are not affected
due to temperature
changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11 METHOD OF ANALYSIS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 Computation of Length Change and Strain<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.1  Correction
to
Calibration
Constant for
Unbounded Resistance rype Strainmeters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.3 A single reading of the strainmeter
has
no meaning
but the difference between the two
readings
indicate
the
length change occurring
from
the time
of first reading
to the time of
second reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sample data sheet on which
tempratures,
length
changes and strains of field readings
are com-
puted is shown in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Calibration
constant
supplied by the manufac-
turer shall be corrected by the following formula:
Yc ( 0’89 >
C’=C-l-
K<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2 Computation of Elastic Strains from Length
Changes of Strainmeter<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since the main purpose is to evaluate
stresses
it is necessary to subtract this portion of length
change which is due to causes other than stress.
With a view to estimating
the elastic
strains,
generally
following
corrections
are carried out
in addition to corrections
for meter expansion:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
C’ = the new calibration
constant,
c
= the original calibration
constant,
Yc = the resistance
of a pair of conductor
cables, and
R =  the meter resistance at 0°F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Correction
due to thermal
expansion of
the concrete.
b) Correction
due to autogenous
growth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Therefore,
when the strainmeter
is embedded in
concrete
which expands
freely
due to a tem-
perature
rise, the strainmeter
is likely to indicate
a contraction.
Thus,
certain
definite
cor-
rections ( addition
for increase
in temperature
and (  vice Lersa )  as may be prescribed
by the
manufacturer
for change of every centigrade in
temperature
must
be applied
to the indicated
length
change
shown
in
co1 9 of
the
com-
putation
sheet Annex C.
11.1.2  Correction
to
Calibration
Constant for
Vibrating Wire Type Strainmeter<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Dilatation
correction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Poisson’s ratio correction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In limited
installations,
correction
for thermal
expansion
of concrete
may
only
be made.
However,
in important
structure,
all the above
corrections
may be made with a view to increas-
ing the
reliability
of
results.
For
limited
installations
procedure
for computation
of strain
as given in Annex C shall be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No  corrections
need be applied to calibration<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
