<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This

1982,
after

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Earlier,
determination
of arsenic
in
iron
and steel was covered
in
IS  :  1546-1960*.
The Sectional
Committee
responsible
for
the
revision
of  this
standard
decided
to publish
this as a part of IS  :  2287 for com-
prehensive
analysis
of steel.
However
this method
could also be applied
for the determination
of arsenic
in iron.
With
the
publication
of this
part, IS  :  1546-1960*
will be withdrawn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting
the result  of  a  test or analysis

For the filtration of
arsenic
precipitate,
filter
paper pulp pad shall be used.
It shall be  pre-
pared
by shaking
small pieces of filter paper with a mixture
of one
part
of saturated
solution
of
bromine
in
concentrated
hydrochloric
acid
( rd =
l-1 6 ) and seven parts of water.
When
sufficiently
disintegrated,
the mixture
shall be heated
on the steam bath for 30 minutes
and diluted
with an equal
volume
of water,
shaken
and bottled.
A filter pad shall be
made of this pulp and washed

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1
Outline,of
the
Method
-Arsenic
which in steel exists mainly
as
iron arsenide
( FeAse ) is converted
into
arsenic
acid
( HyAsO,
) when
the alloy is dissolved
in a mixture
of sulphuric
acid
and
nitric
acid.
Arsenic
acid
is reduced
quantitatively
in
acid
medium
by
sodium
hypophosphite
to
metallic
arsenic
and the metal is then
oxidized
by a
measured
excess of standard
iodine
solution
to pentavalent
arsenic.
The
excess iodine is back titrated
with standard
arsenious
oxide solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of 30 ml of dilute

nitric acid and
20 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric
acid.
If a large number of determi-
nations have to be carried out, use 200 ml of the mixed acids ( see 4.2.6 )
for each determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

finally add 12 g  of  sodium

Insert
a cork carrying
a

tube ( 600 x 10 mm ) in the mouth of the conical flask
and boil the contents of the flask for 15 minutes.
Cool the solution
and
filter through a pad of pulp prepared in accordance
with 3.1.
Wash the
arsenic
precipitate
with
100 ml of dilute hydrochloric
acid containing
3 g  of  sodium hypophosphite
and then 7 times with ammonium
chloride
solution.
Further proceed in accordance
with 4.3.5 and 4.3.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4
Procedure for Reduction of Arsenic Acid ( in Case of Tungsten Steel ) -
Transfer
the clear
solution
from 4.3.2 to a quartz flask, and add 40 ml
of water.
Boil the solution to expel nitric acid
fumes completely;
cool,
add 80 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric
acid and 40 ml of water.
Add
2 g of sodium hypophosphite, warm to brisk effervescence avoiding boiling,
and add by instalments
2-g portions of hypophosphite
till effervescence
ceases.
Add
10 drops of hydrofluoric
acid and 12 g of sodium hypo-
phosphite. Boil under reflux tube and filter and wash the reduced arsenic
as described under 4.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘4.3.5 Discard the filtrate and transfer the residue along with the filter
pad to an 800-ml
tall-form
beaker,
rinsing
the funnel
with 50 ml of
water.
Run in a measured excess of the standard iodine solution ( about
30 ml are usually adequate ).
Stir to disintegrate the filter pad, allow to
stand for 5 minutes and dilute to 250 ml.
Titrate
with the standard
arsenious
oxide
solution
to pronounced lightening of the iodine colour.
Add a few ml of starch
solution;
discharge
the coloration
by adding
about 3 ml more of standard arsenious oxide solution and about 2 g of
sodium bicarbonate.
Back-titrate
cautiously
with the standard
iodine
solution, shaking
vigorously
for each addition, until the blue colour just
re-appears.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.6 Carry
out a blank determination
following through all steps of
the procedure and using the same amounts of reagents ( including
10 ml
of the standard
arsenious
oxide
solution ) but without
the material.
Since arsenic is oxidized from the elemental state, to the pentavalent state,
therefore 10 ml of standard arsenious oxide solution used in blank estima-
tion represent 25 ml in the final titration. Any amount in excess of this 25
ml that is required in titrating the blank represents volume of the standard
iodine solution required for the blank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
