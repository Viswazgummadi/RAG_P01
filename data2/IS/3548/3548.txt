FOR<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( First
Revision)
was
adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on
19 September
1988, after the draft
finalized by
the Building
Construction
Practices
Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil Engi-
neering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>country and also the exposure
conditions
which
the construction will have to stand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard
was first published
in 1966.
The present revision
has been taken
up with a
view to updating
its contents
in line with the
current practices. The important
changes include
addition of louvered
glazing and new items like
safety, wired and figured glasses, and polysulphide
based sealants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Glazing
is an important
item
in building
construction and glass has to be selected
to cater
to several
requirements.
The
fixing of glass is
also a specialized
operation
and, if not satisfac-
torily done, will lead
to the hazards of broken
glass. With the wide adoption of glazed windows
in industrial structures and also in multi-storeyed
buildmgs, the importance of glazing and the need
for proper workmanship has considerably
increas-
ed. This code is intended to provide guidance in
the selection of glazing for building construction
and also fixing operations, taking into account the
types of sheet glass that
are available
in this<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
For the purpose of deciding
whether a parti-
cular requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be
rounded off in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in
the
rounded off value
should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
Non-setting Compounds -
These are needed
for use with colour
and
heat-absorbing
glasses
which
will become hot in sunshine and which are,
therefore,
liable to expand and contract
much
more
than ordi-
nary glass.
The
fact that
non-setting
compounds are
easily finger marked make
it undesirable
to use them
without beads, except in relatively
inaccessible
situa-
tions. If, in order
to
prolong
its life,
or for
other
reasons, the compound
is required
to take paint, refe-
rence
should
be
made
to the manufacturer
of the
compound.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

it should be remembered
that frame
members
of
high

conductivity
may
provide direct paths for heat leakage between the

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Durability
-
Though,
under ordinary con-
dition, glass has excellent
durability,
all glasses
are
subject to deterioration
by action of water
and prolonged
attack
by alkaline
solutions may
damage glass. If glass is allowed to remain dirty
for a long period, the dirt film will tend to hold
water and in this way, a process of surface attack
may begin,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6  Sound Insulation
-
For sound insulation,
reference
may be made to IS  :  1950-1962*.
For
effective sound insulation, spacing of the order of
100 mm and above be adopted in case of double
or multiple glazing. Thicker
glass also provides
insulation.
Further improvements may be effected
by lining the surrounds
between the glasses with
a sound absorbing material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7  Rebates
and Grooves
-
These
should be
rigid and true. Rebates for normal
glazing
shall
be at least 8 mm deep, for small panes rebate may
be 6 mm deep. For large windows, such as shop
windows, the frame rebates at the tops and sides
should be at
least 10 mm
and
at the bottom
12 mm. Rebates for double
or multiple
giazed
sealed units shall be 16 mm deep generally, unless
otherwise
advised
by the manufacturers
of the
particular
units. Rebates
for flat glass without
beads should be wide enough to accommodate the
back putty, the glass and the front putty stripped
at an angle. A wider rebate is needed for bent
glass than for flat glass. For glazing
with beads,
rebates should be wide enough to accommodate
glass and beads
and to allow a minimum
clea-
rance of 1.5 mm at both the back and front of the
glass.
Rebate
and grooves shall
be clean and
unobstructed before glazing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5  Light
Transmission
and
Heat
Insula-
tion -
For improved heat and sound insulation,
double or multiple glazing may be used. The heat
insulation depends upon spacing
and scarcely at
all on the thickness of the glass used. For vertical
glazing,
the insulating
value increases
up to a
.spacing of about 10 mm, beyond
which
there is
little further change. However,
the spacing of as
little as 3 mm will provide an insulating value of
50 percent
of this maximum.
For inclined
or
horizontal glazing, there may be some advantages
in using a spacing greater than 20 mm where this
is practicable.

as specified
below:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For wood or metal surrounds
2.5 mm<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

1.5 mm cover to the glass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6  Glazing
with Compound
into Rebates
-
Sufficient
compound
should
be
applied
to the
rebate
so that, when
the
glass has
been
pressed
into the rebate,
a bed
of compound
( known
as
back
putty )
not
less
than
1.5
mm
thick
will
remain
between
the glass and the
rebate;
there
should also be surplus
of compound
squeezed
out
above the rebate
which should
be stripped
at an
angle
( see Fig.
1B ) not
undercut,
to prevent
water accumulating.
The glass should be secured
by springs or spring
clips spaced
not
more
than
450 mm apart measured
around
the
perimeter
of
the pane, and afterwards
fronted
with
compound
to form a triangular
fillet
stopping
l-5
mm short
of the sight line
so
that
the
edge
of the
com-
pound may be sealed against
the
glass by paint-
ing, without encroaching
over the sight line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Location
of Glass in
Frame
-
The
glass
shall rest upon
two
blocks
to
locate
the
pane
properly
within the surround.
In the case of small
panes, use of blocks may not be necessary.
When
giazing
in side-hung
windows or doors,
the glass
shall be located
by blocks so that
it bears on the
bottom
of the surround
at a point
near the hinge,
but is not brought
into contact
with
the surround
and does not suffer undue
stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1
When glazing in horizontal
centre-hung
sashes, which may be turned
through
about
180”,
additional
blocks shall be placed between
the top
edge of the glass
and
the
surround
to
prevent
movement
of the glass when the
sash is inverted,
Where
the panes are more
than 90 mm
high, the
glass shall be located
at the two
pivoting
points
by blocks of suitably
resilient
material,
such as
chloroprene.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.7  Glazing
with Compound
into Grooves
-
The glass
should
be pressed
into glazing
com-
pounds
previously
placed
in
the
groove.
The
spaces
between
the glass
and
the
sides of the
groove
should
be filled
with
compound,
which
should then be stripped at an angle
( see Fig.
1C )
not undercut.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3
Preparation
of Rebates
and
Grooves
in
Wood
-
Rebates
or
grooves
should be primed
to prevent
excessive
absorption
of oil from the
putty.
If a shellac
varnish
or gloss paint is used
for this purpose,
the
wood may
be
completely
sealed and setting of the putty unduly delayed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.8  Glazing
with
Beads
Alongwith
Com-
pound -
Sufficient
compound
should be applied
to the rebate
so that
when
the
glass
has been
pressed
into
the
rebate,
a bed
of
compound
( known
as back
putty )
not
less thad 1.5 mm
thick
will
remain
between
the
glass
and
the
rebate.
There
should
also be a surplus
of com-
pound
squeezed
out
above
the
rebate
which
should be stripped
at
an angle
not
undercut,
to
prevent
water
accumulating.
Beads
should
be
bedded
with
compound
against
the
glass
and
wood
beads
should
also be bedded
against
the
rebate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1
Absorbent
hardwood
frames
that are not
to be painted
should
either
be
primed
with a
medium
composed
of equal
parts
of
exterior
varnish and white spirit, and glazed
with
linseed
oil putty or be
completely
sealed
with a coat of
unthinned
exterior
quality
varnish
and
glazed
with
metal
casement
putty
( which will need to
be painted
),
or with a nun-setting
compound.
Where
hardwoods
such as teak which are comple-
tely
non-absorbent
are
recommended
metal

putty
should
be used,
If the
wooden
frame
has
been
treated
with
a preservative,
according
to the instructions
of the manufacturer
of the glazing
compound,
preparation
of rebates
and grooves should be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.8.1
Care should be
taken
to
ensure
that no
voids are left between
the glass and the bead.
For

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.8.6
Figured
glasses are used to avoid
direct
sunrays and to
get
diffused
light.
This
can
be
achieved
advantageously
by placing
rough surface
of the glass facing outside.
As the surface
of glass
from inside is smooth,
it will facilitate
in pasting
of colour plastic film on inside
surface,
whenever
required.
In that case, it will be difficult to clean
the rough
surface of glass which is outside but it
can be cleaned
by a water jet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Cleaning -
Glass should be cleaned
regu-
larly.
Failure
to do this will result in considerable
reduction
of daylight
indoors,
and may also result
in discolouration
and deterioration
of the surface.
Warm
water with soap or a mild
domestic
deter-
gent, followed
by a clean water
rinse
is generally
adequate
for
routine
cleaning.
For
transparent
glasses, cloth or wash leather
should be
used; for
glasses with a broken
or textured
surface,
a stiff
plastic
or bristle
brush will
be
found
effective.
Where
the above
methods
fail to
remove
obsti-
nate dirt from
transparent
glass,
polishing
with
whiting
in
water
or
methylate
spirits
may
be
found to be successful.
Corrosive
cleaning
liquids
are
also
sometimes
employed,
but
should
be
handled
with
great
care
and should
be sluiced
away
with
excess
of
clean
water
as
soon as
possible after use to avoid
damage
to
glazing
or
fixing compounds,
window
frames
or any other
materials
near
to the
glass.
Organic
solvents are
also
useful
for
special
purposes,
for
example,
petrol or benzene
for
removing
tar,
turpentine
for paint that has not dried
hard and paraffin for
grease,
The solvents should, however,
be carefully
cleaned
off the
glass
afterwards
and,
in some
instances,
the fire risk may
need to be guarded
against
during use. Plaster
or mortar
splashed
on
the glass may be removed
with a thin razor blade
preferably
before the material
has set hard.
Dried
paint
may
be removed
similarly.
In using
the
razor blade,
excessive
force should not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
