<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO
(the
International
Organization
for

is a worldwide
federation
of national
standards
bodies
(ISO member
bodies).
The work
of preparing
International

is normally
carried
out through
ISO
technical
committees.
Each
member
body
interested
in a subject
for
which
a technical
committee
has been
established
has the
right
to
be
represented
on that committee.
International
organizations,
governmental
and non-governmental,
in liaison with
ISO, also take part in the work.

closely
with

as defined

minimum
criteria
are required
to qualify

should
be judged
and maintained.
