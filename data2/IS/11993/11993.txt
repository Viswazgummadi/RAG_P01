FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
n;!opted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Insritution
on 27 March
1987, after
the tiraft
finalized
by the Construction
Plant
and
Machinery
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The
introduction
of the
concept
of
compaction
of
concrete
by
vibration
has
macle
it possible
to use  IOW  slump,
stiff
mixes
for produc-
tion of high
quality
concrete
with
required
strength
and
impermeability.
The
use of vibration
is essential
for the production
of good
quality
con-
crete,
when
hand
compaction
methods
fail
to
eliminate
the
voids.
Insufficient
compaction
results
in formation
of voids
in concrete,
which
in
turn
reduce
the
strength.
If,
the
void
content
is 10 percent,
the
strength
may
be reduced
by as much
as 50 percent.
Where
the exposed
surface
is large,
and
thickness
of layer
is relatively
small
as in the case
of concrete
slabs,
for road
and
airfield
pavements,
building
roofs,
etc,
screed
board
type
vibrators
play
a very important
role in improving
the
compaction
and
strength
of  concrete.
Results
of research
in
many
countries
and
at Central
Road
Research
Institute,
New
Delhi
has
esta-
blished
that
reasonably
high
amplitude
of vibration
corresponding
to a
matching
frequency
is of primary
importance
for sufficient
compaction,
while
using
screed
vibrators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 IS  :  2506-19858
stipulates
that
the amplitude
of vibration
of such
vibrators
shall
not
be
less
than
I.5
mm
under
‘operation
in
air’
condition
for sufficient
compaction.
As against
this,
several
major
user
departments
in
the
country
have
reported
that
the
indigenously
available
screed
board
vibrators
exhibit
rather
low
amplitude
of
vibrations
of the order
of 0.4
to 0.5 mm.
While
EUCII low  amplitude
screed
vibrators
may
be adequate
for surface
finishing
operations
only,
they
are
unable
to
do
satisfactory
compaction
beyond
the top 10 cm
or so.
Cases
of honey-combing
at
lower
layers
of thicker
slabs
have
been
reported
in the case of airfields.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1  The Central
Road
Research
Institute,
New Delhi has developed
an improved high amplitude
screed vibrator
indigenously
which
is now
under
commercial
exploitation.
The high amplitude
screed vibrator
is
reported to provide amplitude
of vibration
in the range of 1’5 to 2 0 mm
for matching
frequencies
of 3200-3800
revolutions
per
minute
when
operated
in air, corresponding
amplitude
and matching
frequency
range
under ‘loaded’
condition
that  is  under
actual
operation
on
green
con-
crete
being 0 8 to 1’8 mm and 3300-3600
cycles per minute respectively.
Comparative
tests on
a series
of full size concrete
slabs of thicknesses
varying
from 15 to 25 cm have shown that
the
high
amplitude
screed
vibrators
with
an
amplitude
of vibration
of
2 mm when ‘operated
in
air’ condition
may compact
up to 25 cm
thick
slabs
with
a minimum
of 97 percent
efficiency
( 3 percent
voids ) at the lower layers as against
only 90 percent efficiency
that is 10 percent
voids in case
of commonly
available
screed vibrators
having 0’4 to 0 5 mm, as amplitude
of vibration
when ‘operated
in air conditions’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
deals
with
the use of screed board
vibrators
for the
compaction
of concrete,
the
maintenance
of the
screed
vibrators
in
proper
running
order and the safety requirements
for their use and gives
recommendations
regarding
placing of concrete
and its compaction

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2
Where
reliable
supply
of electricity
is available,
the
electric
motor
is generally
the
most satisfactory
and economical
power
unit as
the speed
is relatively
constant
and cables
used
are light to handle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3
The type of power
unit and
rating
in

of the vibrator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  HANDLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The
vibrators
operate
under
heavy
stresses
and,
therefore,
require
regular
maintenance
to keep them under
proper
working
conditions.
After
use, the vibrators
shall be thoroughly
cleaned
and stored
in clean
and
dry
place.
All repairs
shall
be carried
out under
careful
supervision
and
in
accordance
with manufacturer’s
instructions.
Stand
by units
shall
also
be provided.
There
is also a tendency
for bearings
to wear
out
because
of centrifugal
force
and the resultant
impact.
Worn-out
parts
shall
be
replaced
in time to avoid
premature
damage
to the whole
machine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Overloading
of Driving
Unit -
Proper
precautions
shall
be taken
in
selecting
the
driving
unit to avoid
over heating
of motor,
when
the
concrete
is very stiff the vibrator
will
usually
be
over
loaded
and
the
electric
motor
or petrol
engine
may get excessively
heated.
The

essen-
tial
to obtain
maximum
benefits
from
screed

For best results,
the concrete
to be vibrated
shall
be
of the
stiffest
possible
consistency
compatible
to the compacting

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:11993
-  1987<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>range
of workability
as specified in IS  :  456-1978*.
Screed vibration
of
concrete
of very high workability
may not increase
its strength,
it may,
on the contrary,
cause segregation,
if continued
for usual length
of time.
Formation
of watery
grout on the surface of concrete
soon after screed
vibration
is an indication
that the concrete
is too
workable
and
unsuit-
able for vibration,
a close textured
layer of viscous grout may, however,
be allowed.
It has been proved
that the best compaction
is achieved
at
resonant
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. DESIGN
OF FORMWORK<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 For
vibrated
concrete
used for airfield
and highway
pavetnents,
the
formwork
shall be well designed
necessary
for hand-compacted
concrete
and greater
care shall be exercised
in its assembly.
It should he designed
to take
up the increased
pressure
of concrete
due to the screed vibrator.
The design of formwork
depends
upon
the experience
and judgement
and
the type
of work.
Generally,
steel channels
supported
by stakes
driven
into subgrade
or subbase
are used except in curves where wooden
formwork
may
be used.
In
the
latter
case, it should be cappecl with
50 mm angle iron along the inner
side
and
kept
flush
with
the
face.
The
joints
of the
formwork
shall be tight and close enough
to prevent
the
squeezing
out
of
grout
or sucking
in of air
during
vibration.
Absence
of this precaution
may cause honey-combing
at th? end surface
of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The
amount
of mortar
leakage
or the
permissible
gap between
channels
will depend
on the desired final
appearance
of the
work
but
normally
gaps
larger
than
1.5 mm
between
the channels
shall not be
permitted.
The number
of joints should be made
as small
as possible
by
the
use of long
lengths
of channel
sections adequately
supported.
Application
of grease or oil on the formwork
to prevent
the adhesion
of
concrete
should be very thin as otherwise
they may mix with the concrete
under
the effect of vibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. VIBRATION
OF CONCRETE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 The concrete
to be vibrated
shall be placed
in position
in level layer
or layers
( in case of multi
layered
construction
) of suitable
thickness
and
the
concrete
at the
surface
shall be distributed
as horizontally
as
possible,
since the concrete
flows
in slopes while being
vibrated
and may
segregate.
The
screed
vibrator
shall
rest
on
side forms and shall be
lowered
vertically
on to the
concrete
surface,
evenly
spread
to the
required
level
above
the
base,
making
due allowance
for compaction
by
providing
adequate
surcharge.
The
vibrator
is allowed
to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Code of practice for plain and reinforced concrete ( third  revision ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 11993 - 1987<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>remain
in position
for a few
seconds
until
compaction
is
com-
plete,
then
lifted
vertically
and
lowered
on to the
adjacent
strip of
uncompacted
concrete
with an overlap
of about
half the
width
of the
screed
board
keeping
in
view that there shall not be any segregation.
After
the length
of concrete
already
placed
is compacted,
the
screed
shall
again
be taken to its original
position and allowed
to move slowly
over the
surface
sliding
with
its axis slightly
tilted
away
from
the
dioection
of sliding
and the operation
repeated
until the required
dense,
close knit textured
surface is obtained.
Slabs of thicknesses
up to 20 cm
may
be compacted
in single
layer
using
screed
vibrator,
in all cases
immersion
vibrators
are required
to be used in addition
for compacting
the corners and edges of the slabs.
For thicknesses
greater
than 20 cm,
multi-layered
construction
may be resorted
to.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 The surcharge
during
compaction
is the additional
height
to which
the
concrete
is spread
above
the level of the form work.
When
the
surcharge
is lower than the optimum
which the
vibrator
may
compact
efficiently,
the force on the concrete
is inadequate
resulting
in insufficient
compaction
of concrete.
The
relation
between
surcharge
and
com-
pactive
effort is affected by changes
in the characteristics
of the vibration
and in the workability
of concrete.
For the same surcharge,
when
the
vibration
is  not
very
powerful,
the concrete
is not compacted
in depth,
so that there is a surplus
of concrete
which
is pushed
in front
of the
beam.
On
the  other
hand,
when the vibration
is powerful
the use of
too low surcharge
results in complete
compaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 Compaction
by screed vibrator
shall be carried
on till the mortar
in
the
mix just works  up to  the surface.
Care shall, however,
be exercised
and the operation
so controlled
as to prevent over
vibration
leading
to
bleeding, that is, appearance
of excess of mortar
and/or water at the top.
Generally,
with
properly
designed
mixes, extended
vibration
will only
be waste of effort.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4
If the concrete
is too
workable
or the quantity
of mortar
is in
excess of the volume of voids in coarse aggregates
or grading
of aggre-
gates is unsatisfactory,
over vibration
will encourage
segregation,
causing
migration
to the surface of tighter and smaller constituents
of the mix
and so producinn
a layer of mortar on the surface and leakaee of mortar
through
defectiv;
joints in the formwork.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
