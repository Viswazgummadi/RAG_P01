<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Stanc’ard was adopted by the Bureau of Jndian Standards on 5 January 1990 after
the
draft finalized by the Ccmmercial
Weights and Measures Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Light Mechanical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is one of a series of Indian Standards relating to commercial
weighing instruments.
This standard was originally published in 1959.
This revision is based on the further
experience
gained in manufacture
of commercial
weighing instruments
and other developments
in this field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Jn this revision requirements
of 5 kg, 500 kg and I COO kg capacity
steelyards
have been included
and steelyards of capacity 150 kg and 250 kg have been deleted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is intended chiefly to cover the technical
provisions relating
to steelyards and it does
not include all the necessary provisions
of the contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard assistance has been derived from the weights and measures rules
and acts prevailing in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

conforming
to IS 226  :  1975 or stainless steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1!  This standard
covers
the requirements
for
steelyards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 The steelyard blade shall be perfectly straight
but its cross-section
need not necessarily be uni-
form throughout.
Notches
or graduations
on
the blade
shall be cut in one plane and at right
angles to the blade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2  REFERENCES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  The following Indian Standards are necessary
adjuncts to this standard:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 The sliding poise and suspending
hooks shall
be securely attached to the instrument.
All end-
fittings such as the nut attached
to prevent
the
poise-carrier
riding
off the steelyard,
shall be
securely fixed to the blade.
The
sliding
poise
shall be freely moveable and there shall be a stop
to prevent
it from
travelling
behind
the zero
mark. Steelyards having counter-poise,
or travel-
ling poise shall be provided with a hole or other
suitable means for the future
adjustment
of the _’
counter-poise
or travelling poise, such hole being
undercut.
Wherever
loose material
is used in
the travelling poise, it shall be securely enclosed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3  DEFINITION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  For the purpose of this standard,
a steelyard
shall mean an unequal armed balance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Steelyards
shall be of the following
capa-
cities:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

graduation
shall be tested
and the instrument
shall be corrected

error
specified in co1 3 of Table
1, whether
the test is carried out with increasing or decreas-
ing loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
