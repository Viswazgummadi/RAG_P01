<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Canals and Cross Drainage Works Sectional Committee had been approved by the Water Resources Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lining of canals is considered an important feature of irrigation projects which not only minimizes loss of water
due to seepage but also helps in achieving consumptive use of water for cultivable land and minimizes risk of
waterlogging due to rise in water table. Further, the water, thus saved, can be usefully employed for the extension
and improvement of irrigation facilities. Lining of water courses in the areas irrigated by tube wells assumes
special significance as the pumped water supplied is relatively more costly. Further, lining of canals permits the
adoption of high velocities resulting in savings in the cross-sectional areas, the cost of excavation and masonry
works, which may in certain cases offset completely the extra cost of lining. Also, the lining ensures stability of
channels sections thereby reducing the maintenance cost. Due to comparative flatter bed slope which can be
provided in lined canals, command or the culturable command area would improve. The benefit that accrue
from lining of canals generally justify the initial capital cost and because of this there is now a better appreciation’
of the need for lining of canals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Judicious selection of serviceable and economical lining at the first instance and subsequently proper execution
of the work while laying the lining results in achieving considerable overall economy in the project .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Soil-cement lining is one of the cheaper types of canal lining which has been used successfully in other countries.
It’s use as an economic water-proof membrane is possible where soil characteristics are favorable
to stabilization.
While the lining will minimize absorption losses and give reduced section of the canal, it can suffer from
damage from cattle trespass, weathering action and low resistance to subgrade pressures occurring due to
sudden closures of the canal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In many areas local soils mixed with water and cement maybe used to construct adequate soil-cement linings.
Soil-cement mixtures are relatively dry mixtures of soil, cement and water, compacted to a maximum density.
The suitability of the soil and the proportions of the mix to be used shall be determined by laboratory tests before
any work is undertaken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1973. This revision of the standard has been taken up to incorporate the
latest technological changes in this field as well as to account for the experiences gained during the last four
decades.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no 1S0 Standard on the subject. This standard has been prepared based on indigenous data/practices
prevalent in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

be over excavated to a depth of about 600 mm and
filled to the grade of the underside of lining with good
draining material leading away the seepage water to
specially constructed points either to the outside of
the canal or releasing it into the canal by provision of
suitable pressure relief valves. However, the excavated
surface of expansive clay shall be given a coat of
asphalt with a minimum thickness of 20 mm before
loading it to prevent the entry of water into the clay.
The asphalt used shall conform to IS 3037.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.3 If at any point material of the prepared subgrade

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Under-drainage<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.4 To cover up any lapses in the compaction of the
inner core of the banks near the edges and to allow
sufficient width for a labourer to work conveniently a
lip cutting width of not less than 600 mm horizontally
shall be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure relief arrangements for under-drainage shall
be provided as given in IS 4558 for a lined canal where
the ground water level is higher or likely to be higher
than water level inside the canal so as to cause
damaging differential pressures on the lining or where
the subgrade is sufficiently impermeable to prevent
free drainage of the underside of lining in case of rapid
draw-down.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.5 The compaction of the subgrade shall be done at
optimum moisture content in layers not exceeding
150 mm thick to a density which will not be less than
95 percent
of the maximum
density
obtained
in
accordance with IS 2720 (Part 7), The compaction
shall be effected by means of smooth wheeled rollers,
tampers or similar suitable equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 Anti-salt Treatment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Soil in all reaches shall be tested for salt contents
before the lining is started. Where the salt content is
over
1.00 percent
or sodium
sulphate
is over
0.36 percent, the subgrade shall be first covered with
about 2 mm thick layer of bitumen obtained by evenly
spraying bitumen at a rate of about 2.35 l/m2. To get a
good bond between bitumen and soil, crude oil at a
rate of 0.5 1/m*shall be sprayed over it in advance of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.5.1 Where the dry bulk density of the natural soil
is equal to or more than 1.8 g/cm3 the procedure
described in 7.4.1 shall be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.5.2  Bed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the dry bulk density of the natural soil is less<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 7113:2003<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>be taken to obtain uniformity in depth. Sufllcient depth
of loose material to give the required thickness atler
compaction
shall be spread in one operation.
The
thickness of the soil-cement lining should be 100 to
150 cm. Generally, it is necessary to process 130 to
150 mm of loose soil to obtain a compacted thickness
of 100 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>than 1.8 g/cm2 and the subsoil
water is near the
subgrade, the compaction
shall be done by under
cutting the bed by 75 mm and then ploughing up to
150 mm below the subgrade level. The loosened soil
shall then be recompacted with sheep foot rollers or
other suitable devices. Where the subsoil water is low,
requiring no dewatering and the dry bulk density of
the natural soil is less than 1.8 g/cm3, consolidation
shall be done by digging the canal up to subgrade level
and after that loosening the earth below subgrade up
to 150 mm by disc harrows,
or ploughing
and
compacting the same to a layer of 110 mm. After that,
the second layer of 150 mm of earth shall be laid over
the compacted layer by taking earth from lip cutting
and compacting
this to depth
of 110 mm. The
compacted layer of 70 mm above the subgrade level
shall be removed and the subgrade brought to design
profile before laying the lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 Compaction of the Soil-Cement MIX<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Compaction shall be carried out continuously as the
mixed material is spread, but the equipment shall be
kept sufficiently far back from the free edges of the
layer to prevent
lateral
movement
of the mixed
material. The compaction shall be effected by means
of a smooth wheeled roller, vibratory roller, tampers
or any other type of equipment capable of achieving
the desired degree of compaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.1 The time between preparation of the soil-cement
mixture and the commencement
of the compaction
shall be as short as possible, and in no case shall exceed
30 min. Compaction of any portion of the layer to
required density shall be completed within 1%h after
the material has been spread.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.5.3  Sides<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Compaction on sides shall be done by manual labour
or suitable compactors to a depth of 300 mm to obtain
a minimum dry bulk density of not less than 90 percent
of the density at optimum moisture content obtained
in accordance with IS 2720 (Part 7).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5 Curing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 CONSTRUCTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After final compaction and finishing, the surface shall
be allowed to harden and soon afier it shall be kept
continuously damp for at least 14 days. This may be
done by any suitable method, such as fog-spraying with
water or covering the surface with damp hessian, straw
or sand maintained moist throughout
the period of
curing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Pulverizing
the Soil<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The soil shall be pulverized manually or mechanically
to make sure that there are no clods and the soil
conforms to 5.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Mixing Soil and Cement<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.6 Jointing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The required quantity of cement shall be thoroughly
mixed with the dry soil either mechanically or by hand-
mixing through manual labour. The mixing shall be
continued till the soil-cement mix acquires uniform
coloration
which can be examined under a magni~ing
glass. The required quantity of water will be added and
mixing continued to ensure uniform distribution of the
moisture throughout the soil-cement mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A straight transverse construction joint shall be formed
wherever there is a break of work (of even a few hours).
Such joints shall be sealed leak tight with sealing
compound
conforming
to the requirements
given
IS 5256 after the expiry of the curing period. As an
alternative, the edge surface of the previous lining may
be roughened with 1:3
cement sand grout not more
than 12 mm thickness applied and the lining operation
continued.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1 Batching of the materials shall be by weight.
The appropriate quantities of soil and cement required
for one batch shall be measured out after making due
allowance for the moisture present in the soil. The
correct amount of water to bring the moisture content
of the mix to the optimum giving due allowance for
evaporation shall be then added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9 FIELD CONTROL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following factors shall be checked for controlling
field operations during the progress of the work:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
