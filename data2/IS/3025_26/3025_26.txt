<<HEADING level=3>>1.  Scope-
Prescribes the iodometric or stabilized neutral ortho-toluidine
method for determination
of residual chlorine.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  lodometric
method is more precise than
calorimetric
method
where
residual
concentration
exceeds 1 mg/l, but for tower concentration
it is not so accurate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>:
C<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2  Stabilized neutral ortho-toluidine
is useful to determine
free available
chlorine
and combined
chlorine.
This method is sensitive
to low residual
chlorine concentrations,
in the range of 5 to
10 rgll.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Sampling
and  Storage -
Chlorine is not stable
in aqueous
solution.
Exposure
to sunlight
or
other light or agitation
will accelerate the reduction of chlorine.
Therefore, it is recommended
that
chlorine determinations
be started immediately
after sampling and exposure
to light
and agitation
are to be avoided.
The sample can not be stored. Sampling and storage shall be done as prescribed
in IS  :  3025 ( Part 1 )-1986
‘Methods of sampling
and test (physical
and chemical ) for water and
wastewater  :  Part 1 Sampling (  first revision )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  lodometric Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Interferences -
Oxidized
forms of manganese
and other
oxidizing
agents
interfere.
Redu-
cing agents, such as organic
sulphides
also interfere.
Although the neutral titration
minimizes
the
inte.rfering effect of ferric and nitric ions, the acid titration
is preferred because some forms of com-
bined chlorine do not react at pH 7.
Use only acetic acid for titration;
sulphuric acid will increase
interferences
;  never use hydrochloric
acid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Reagents<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1
Select  a sample volume which will require no more than 20 ml of 0’01 N sodium thiosul-
phate.
Thus for residual chlorine concentration
of 1 mg/l or less, take 1000 ml of sample; for range
of 1 to 10 mg/l, a 500 ml of sample and above 10 mg/l Proportionately
less sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.2
Take appropriate volume of the sample as given in 3.3.1 and add acetic acid to bring down
the  pH  to 3 to 4 in the flask.
Add about 1’0 g of potassium iodide crystals and mix with a glass rod.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Add chlorine-free
distilled
water
if larger volume
is preferred
for titration.
Titrate
with 0’01 N  sodi-
um thiosulphate
until yellow
colour
of the librated
iodine
is almost
discharged.
Add 1’0 ml of starch
indicator
and titrate
until the blue colour
is discharged.
In many cases residual
chlorine
is very low
and starch needs to be added before starting
up the titration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.  Stabilized
Neutral
Ortho-toluidine
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Principle and Theory -
The
stability
of
oxidized
ortho-toluidine
decreases
as  pli
increases.
Anionic
surface active reagents
stabilize
the colour
development
by free chlorine
and ortho-toluidine
at pH 7’0.
Sodium
di ( 2-ethyl-hexyl
) sulphosuccuiate,
is the best stabilizing
agent.
The optimum
concentration
of stabilizer
is  40  mg for each 100
ml of sample
plus
reagents.
The
final
solution
should
have pH between
6’5 and 7’5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  interferences -
Strong
oxidizing
agents,
such
as bromine,
chlorine
dioxide,
iodine,
manganic
compounds
and ozone interfere.
However,
the reduce&forms
of these compounds
do not interfere.
Reducing
agents Iike’nitrites,
ferrous
compounds,
hydrogen
sulphide
and
oxidizable
organic
matter
do not interfere,
but may interfere
by reducing
the
chlorine
residual
by reaction
with
chlorine
to
produce
chlorine
ion.
Turbidity
and colour
also interfere
unless
the background
turbidity
or colour
is compensated
for using a blank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Add sufficient
chlorine
to distilled
water to des-
troy the ammonia
and nitrate.
The amount of chlorine
required
will
be about
IO times the amount
of ammoniacal
nitrogen
present;
produce an initial
residual
of more than 1’0 mg/l free chlorine.
Let
the chlorinated
distilled
water stand
overnight
or longer;
then
expose to
direct
sunlight
until
all
residual
chlorine
is discharged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2
Neutral ortho-toluidine
reagent -
Add 5’0 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric
acid to 500 ml

or by bubbling
chlorine
gas through
distilled
water.
Improve
the solution
stability
by storing
in the
dark or brown,
glass-stoppered
bottle.
Standardize
it each day of use.
Alternatively,
dilute
house-
hold hypochlorite
solution,
which
contains
about 30 000 to 50 000 mg/l chlorine
equivalent.
This
is  more stable than chlorine
solution,
but do not use for
more
than
1 week without
restandardiza-
tion.
Use the same chlorine
concentration
actually
applied
in
plant
treatment
to determine
chlorine
demand.
Depending
on intended
use, a suitable
strength
of
chlorine
solution
usually
will
be be-
tween
100 and 1 000 mg/l.
Use a solution
of sufficient
concentration
so that adding
the

Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1
Construct
a calibration
curve by making
dilutions
of standardized
hypochlorite
solution.
Take care when diluting
to low concentrations
because of possible
consumption
of small amounts
of
chlorine
by trace impurities.
Use chlorine
demand free distilled
water for dilution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1  .I
Use 5’0 ml neutral
ortho-toluidine
and
5’0
ml buffer
stabilizer
reagent
with
100 ml
sample.
Place the
neutral
ortho-toluidine
and
buffer stabilizer
mixture
in a beaker on a magnetic
stirrer.
Mix and add sample to the reagents with gentle
stirring.
Measure the absorbance
at 625 nm.
The value obtained
(A )  from the calibration
curve represents
the free chlorine
residual.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1.2
Monochloramine
-  Return any position
used  for measuring
free
chlorine
in 4.5.1.1
to
the sample.
Add
with stirring
0’5 ml potassium
iodide
solution
to each 100 ml sample
or similar
ratio for other sample volumes.
Again
measure the absorbance
and obtain
value ( B ) from calibra-
tion curve.
This will
give free residual
chlorine
plus monochloramine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1.3
Dichloramine
to  the sample.
-Return
any portion
used
for
measuring
the monochloramine
in 4.5.1.2
Add with
stirring,
1 ml of sulphuric
acid to each 100 ml of
sample, or a similar ratio
for other sample volumes.
After 30 seconds for
colour
development
add 1 ml of sodium
carbonate
solution,
slowly
with stirring
or until a pure blue
solution
returns.
Measure the
absorbance
of total
residual
chlorine,
free chlorine,
monochloramine
and
dichloramine
and
obtain
the
value
( C ) from
the calibration
curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2
Compensation for interferences -
Compensate
for
the
presence of natural
colour
or turbi-
dity as well as manganic
compounds
by adding
5‘0
ml arsenite
solution
to 100  ml of sample.
Add
this blank sample to the reagents as above.
Use the colour of the
blank
to set zero absorbance
on
the spectrophotometer.
Measure all samples in relation
to this blank.
Read from the calibration
curve
the concentrations
of chlorine
present in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Chlorination
of water and wastewater
serves primarily
to destroy
or deactivate
disease-produ-
cing micro-organisms.
The other benefit
is the
overall
improvement
in water
quality.
Chlorination
may
produce
adverse
effects.
Taste
and
odour
characteristics
of phenols
and other
organic
compounds
present in water may be intensified.
Potentially
carcinogenic
chloro-organic
compounds,
such as chloroform
may be formed.
Combined
chlorine
formed
on chlorination
of ammonia
or amine
bearing
waters adversely
affects some aquatic
life.
To fulfil
the primary
purpose of chlorination
and
to minimize
any adverse effects,
it is essential
that proper test methods
be used with
a fore know-
ledge of limitations
of analytical
determination.
