<<HEADING level=3>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part 1 ) ( First
various parts.

by the
Bureau
of
as follows:
Other parts of this standard are<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indian

on 30 October
1987, after

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 For the alignment
of tunnels and designs
of tunnel
supports and lining,
the nature
of
soft or hard strata and its formation
plays a
vital role. It is necessary to know the general
topography, the geology of the area,
state of
stress and other mechanical
properties
of the
strata.
For
this certain
topographical
and
geological investigations,
in-situ  and laboratory
test, and observations are necessary. For certain
locations
where
difficult
working conditions
are anticipated,
more
detailed
investigations
may be undertaken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard was first published in 1975.
The present revision of the standard has been
taken
up in the light of experience
gained
during the last few years in the use of  this
standard.
In this revision,
the clauses on  ‘in-
situ  rock and tests’ and ‘instrumentation’
have
been modified to introduce
the modern rock
mass classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and
also up
to

corresponding
to tunnel

indicating
loca-

structural
features
such as folds, faults,
joint

etc, to plan drill holes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Subsurfuce exploration -
Few
cored bore
holes should be taken at suitable
loca-
tions along the alignment
of tunnel
as
suggested
by
geologist.
The
number
of bore holes depends upon the length
of tunnel,
rock
cover
over
tunnel
grade,
number
of adits available
and
geological
features
likely
to
be met
with. However,
the minimum
number
of
bore
holes
as
adjudged
to
be
necessary
by an experienced
engineer-
ing
geologist
in
consultation
with
design
engineers
should
be provided.
For
proper
determination
of
rock
quality
designation
( RQD
)
( see
3.2.3
), the bore
holes
should
be dri-
lled with NX size and larger
size only
and not that BX or smaller
sizes. The
core samples
of each
bore
hole shall
be preserved
and logged
by an engi-
neering
geologist.
Bore
holes
shall
avoid,
as far as possible,
intercepting
tunnel
bore,
particularly
in
water
bearing
strata,
and shall
be properly
backfilled
preferably
with concrete;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Wherever
possible,
aerial
( photogra-
phic ) survey
should
be
carried
out
and
the
stereoptic
coverage
should extend
for
at least
3 km on
either
side
of the possible
foreseen
limits
of the
tunnel
alignment.
This
would
facilitate
to pinpoint
those areas
that
require
surface
and
subsurface
investigations
for
a
detailed
assessment.
If infra-red
aerial
photo-
graphy’is
used, it would facilitate
to delineate
hot water bearing
zones in bed rock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
Geological
Investigations
-
Geological
investigations
should be carried
out with sophi-
sticated
instruments,
some of which
are listed
in 4.1.
If the area has been
aerially
photogra-
phed, such data should be studied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

interest
of checking

also for

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1
Systematic
instrumentation
is to be done
in ail
major
tunnels
under
construction
to
monitor
the
behaviour
of supports
and
the
rock.
Such a study
may be
started
from the
very start of the tunnel.
The instruments
should
be installed
at the time
of installation
of
the
supports.
The
following
may
be done.
The
instrumented
section
should
be so dispersed
as
to cover statistically
differing
rock conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

a cavity is formed
in the rock
mass, the
in-situ  rock
stresses
are
altered
for
some distance
around
the opening.
In-situ  rock
tests are carried
out to evaluate:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Load Observations -
Rock

<<PARAGRAPH>>Contact Pressure Observations -
Pressure
cells should be placed at the intervals
of the supports
and the
rock

to measure
rock pressure
and internal
water

should
not
be

<<PARAGRAPH>>The tests shall
be carried
out in two
directions

to
each
other in case of laminated

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  The
instruments
mentioned
in 4.1 may be
provided
at more than three
sections or at the
typical
representative
reaches
met
with while
excavating.
The
range
of
instruments
to
be
installed
depends
upon
rock
cover,
internal
pressure
and geological
features
and properties
of rock mass and
should
be fixed
after
due
analysis.
Instrumentation
may be done in the
drifts which are
made during
investigation
so
that the data can be made available
for design
of supports and lining during
execution
of the
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.2  The information
obtained
from

is required
for providing

are
to be
obtained
by
installing
instruments
described
in 4.1.<<HEADING_END>>
