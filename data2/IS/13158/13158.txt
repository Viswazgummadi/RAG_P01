<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Rureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
Cement and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prestressed concrete circular spun poles are now-a-days
being used for overhead power, traction and
telecommunication
lines. This standard has been prepared with a view to delining design requirement,s,
materials, manufacture
and test procedure for prestressed concrete spun poles in order to encourage the
manufacture
and use of such poles. These poles are lighter and easy to handle than those manufactured
according to IS I678  :  1978 ‘Specification for ~prestressed concrete poles for overhead
power, traction
and telecommunication
lines (first revi&n )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the committee responsible for the formulation
of this standard is given in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2 : I960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised 1.’  The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
