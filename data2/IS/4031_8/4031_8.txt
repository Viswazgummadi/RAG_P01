<<PARAGRAPH>>individual tests. Further,
since publication
of the
original standard in 1968, a number of standards
covering the requirements
of different equipment
used for testing of cement, a brief description
of
which was also covered in the standard, had been
published.
In this revision, therefore,
reference
is given to different
instrument
specifications
deleting the description
of the instruments,
as  it
has been recognised
that
reproducible
and
re-
peatable test results can be obtained
only with
standard
testing
equipment
capable
of giving
desired
level of accuracy.
This part ( Part 8 )
covers the procedure for determination
of.  com-
pressive and transverse
and compressive
strength,
of plastic mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part
8 )
(  First
Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
on 10 .March
1988, after the draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Standard
methods
of
testing
cement
are
essential
adjunct
to the cement
specifications.
This standard in different
parts
lays down the
procedure
for the tests to evaluate
the. physical
propertiesof
different types of hydrauhc
cement.
The procedure
for conducting
chemical
tests of
hydraulic cement is covered in IS  :  4032-1985*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Originally
all the
tests
to
evaluate
the
physical
properties
of hydraulic
cemen!s were
covered in one standard but for facilitatlpg
the
use of this standard and future
revisions,
it has
been decided to print the different tests as different
parts
of the
standard
and
accordingly,
this
revised standard has been brought out in thirteen
parts.
This
will also
facilitate
updating
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  For
the
purpose
of deciding
whether
;t
particular
requirement
of this standard
is corn--
plied with, the final value, observed or calculat-
ed, expressing the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS  :  2 -
1960*. The number of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same  as
that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Vertical faces as cast shalI
remain vertical during storage.
The specimens
shall be kept apart
from
each other,
allowing
free access of water to all their faces.
It is’ cons
venient to replace the water every 14 days.
The
specimens shall be taken from the water less than
I5 min before test.
In order to satisfy this con-
dition,
they shall be transported
to
the
test
machine in a container full of water.
They shall
then be wiped with a clean cloth,
so that any
deposit
that might have accumulated
on them
is removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mixer shall then be stopped
for 1 min 30 s.
During the first 15 s, all the mortar
adhering
to the wall of the bowl shall be removed by
means of a rubber scraper
and thrown
into the
middle of the bowl.
The bowl shall be covered
during the remaining
1 min 15 s.
Mixing
shall
then be continued at medium speed ( 285f 10 rev/
min ) for one minute.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

AND CURING OF TEST
SPECIMENS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Moulding of Test Specimens<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. TESTING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1 The
specimens
shall
be made
in
a
laboratory
of which the temperature
shall
be
27rt2”C
and the relative
humidity
shall
be
65f5
percent.
The moulds
and all accessories
shall be at this
specified
temperature.
The
moulds shall be lightly
oiled
inside and their
external
joints sealed
( using, for example,
a
mixture of 3 parts
of paraffin
wax to 1 part of
rosin ).
The mould and its hopper
being fixed
on the jolting table, the first layer of mortar
of
about 320 g shall be introduced
directly
from
the mixer into each of the mould
compartments
(that is, by using a spoon of a known capacity ).
This layer shall be spread by means of steel plate
levelling, tool which is drawn twice forward
and
backward
along the mould while processing
its
flanges against the top of the hopper.
Sixty jolts
shall be given to the first mortar
layer in 60  S.
A second identical layer of mortar is then intro-
duced,
levelled
and compacted
as previously.
The mould shall then be lifted
from the jolting
table and its hopper removed.
The excess mortar
shall be struck
off with a metal straight edge
held nearly vertical and moved slowly along the
length of the mould
with a transverse
sawing
motion.
The
surface
shall
subsequently
be
lightly smoothed, using the same straight
edge
held almost flat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Bending Strength - The apparatus for bend-
ing strength tests shall consist
of two supports
in the form of rollers of 10 mm dia. and spaced
100 or 106’7 mm apart, on which the test prism
is placed on a side face and of a third
roller of
the same diameter, equidistant from the first two
and transmitting the load  P  to the opposite
side
face of the prism.
Two of the rollers
should be
free to rock about their centres in order to permit
uniform distribution
of loads over the specimen.
The prism and rollers shall be placed
in electri-
cally operated testing machine
which is capable
of applying and measuring small loads ( less than
10 kN ) with an accuracy
of 1 percent
in the
upper 4/5 of its range.
The applied load  P  shall
be
increased
progressively
at
the
rate
of
50flO N/s.
The breaking stress  R,
in N/mm*
is.0’002 34  P  or 0’002 54  P, P  in N, depending on
whether the distance between supports
is 100 or
106’7 mm.
This follows from the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RL-~<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where
M = bending moment, and
b =  side of the square
cross-section
of
the prism.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2 Marks identifying
the specimens shall be
made on the moulds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Compressive
Strength - After
the bending
strength tests, the half prisms shall be kept moist
until the compressive
strength
tests are made.
Each prism
shall be
tested
for
compressive
strength
on its side faces, of which an area
40X 40 mm shall be placed .between two hard
metal plates. These shall be at least 10 mm thick,
40’0&0’1 mm wide, more than 40 mm long and
their surfaces shall be plane to within 0’02 mm.
The plates shall preferably be of tungsten carbide
or of steel, with a Vickers hardness
index of at
least 600 ( HV 600 ).
During the test, the plate
shall be guided without
friction
in such_ a way
that the upper is maintained vertically
above the
lower.
One of the plates may be slightly in-
clined to permit perfect
contact
between it and
the face of the test specimen.
A typical jig used
for compressive
strength test is shown in Fig. 2.
The plates,
test specimen
and suitable guides
shall be placed in a compression
machine,
the
upper platten of which shall be mounted
on a
freely moving ball seating centred on the axis of
compression.
The side or diameter of this platten
shall be not larger than 100 mm on account
of
the small size of the test specimens. The machine<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Curing of Test Specimens<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1 In order to prevent evaporation
of water,
the moulds shall be covered by a steel or rubber
sheet and placed
until
demoulding
in a moist
room or cabinet which shall be at a temperature
of 27f2”C
and a relative
humidity
of not less
than 90 percent,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2 In the case of tests at 24 h, demoulding
shall be carried out 15 to 20 min before
the test
is due.
For tests at other ages, the demoulding
shall be carried
out between
20 and 24 h after
moulding.
If the mortar has not acquired suffi-
cient strength after 24 h to be handled
without
danger
of
deterioration,
demoulding
may be
delayed by 24 h, but the fact shall be mentioned
in the test report.
Demoulding
shall be done
with
due
precautions
using
the
demoulding
device.
Each
demoulded
test
specimen
shall
be weighed and marked
on its bottom
surface.
This weight is a check on the procedure.
7.2.3 After
demoulding,
the specimens shall
be cured at 27f2”C
by immersing in water, until<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
