<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 30 November
1989,
after the draft finalized
by the Water Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Chemical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The dissolved oxygen level in natural
and wastewater
depends
on the physical,
chemical
and
biochemical
activities
in water.
Analysis for dissolved
oxygen
is an important
step in water
pollution
control and wastewater treatment
process control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard,
considerable
assistance
has been derived
.from Standard
Methods for the Examination
of Water and Wastewater,
published
by the American
Public Health
Association,
Washington,
USA, 16th Edition, 1985.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard supersedes clause 11 of IS 2488 ( Part  1 ) :  1974 ‘Methods
of sampling and test for
industrial
effluents, Part l’, and
clause
50 of
IS-3025  :  1964 ‘Methods
of sampling
and test
( physical and chemical ) for water used in industry’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final,value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.  The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
vaJue in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1  Prtnciple<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.4.5  Sodium rhiosulphate stock solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Divalent
manganese salt in solution is precipitat-
ed by strong alkali to divalent manganese hydro-
xide.
It is rapidly oxidized by dissolved oxygen
present in the sample to form trivalent or higher
valency hydroxide.
Iodide ions are added and
acidified,
which reduce
tetravalent
hydroxides
back to their stable divalent state thereby libera-
ting equivalent
amount
of iodine. This iodine
is,equivalent
to dissolved oxygen present in the
sample.
The sequence of reactions is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dissolve approximately
25 g of sodium thiosul-
phate ( Na&Oa.SHzO
) in boiled distilled water
and make
up to 1 000 ml. Add 1 g of sodium
hydroxide
to preserve it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.4.6  Standard sodium thiosulphate solution<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The dissolved oxygen

the standard

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1’  Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method
is a modification
of the Winkler
method
for the determination
of dissolved oxy-
gen, and the principle is the same. The method
depends
on the formation
of a precipitate
of
manganous
hydroxide.
The oxygen dissolved in
the water
is rapidly
absorbed
by manganous
hydroxide,
forming
a higher oxide,
which may
be in the following form:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>is immersed
in water sample.
The current
is
linearly
proportional
to the concentration
of
molecular oxygen in the test sample. The sys-
tem is composed
of solid metal
electrodes
elec-
trically connected by a suitable
electrolyte
and
separated from the water
sample by the mem-
brane which is permeable
to molecular
oxygen
but impermeable
to impurities.
The diffusion
current is amplified and converted
into a suitable
concentration
scale.
The scale is calibrated
at
a given temperature
using saturated
solution of
oxygen in water.
The method is well establish-
ed with accuracy of f 0’05 mg/l and the range
of 0’15 mgll.
The method has the disadvanta-
ges like
temperature
dependency,
effect
of
salt concentration
in the sample
and changes in
electrode
sensitivity
due to corrosion,
fouling
of membrane
or changes
in the thickness
of
membrane.
The plastic
films used with mem-
brane electrode
systems
are permeable
to cer-
tain gases like hydrogen
sulphide,
chlorine,
etc.
Prolonged use of membrane
electrodes in water
containing
such gases tends to lower the cell
sensitivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>can be suppressed
by addition of 1 ml of potas-
sium fluoride and azide
solution
and the titra-
tion
is done
immediately
after
acidification.

is
not
useful
when sulphites,

and high BOD in wastewater
are
present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Collect the sample in 300 ml bottle,

The sulphuric
acid addition
should’not
be in excess. Add sufficient
quantity
of potassium

to get a
violet tinge that persists for 5 minutes.
If the
violet
tinge disappears
before
5 minutes,
add
more
permanganate

but avoid large
excess. Remove
the permanganate
colour com-
pletely by adding
0’5 to  I'0
ml of potassium

Avoid excess amount of potas-
