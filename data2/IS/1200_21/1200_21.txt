FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part XXI )  (  Second
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 24 March
1973, after the
draft
_I I_ _._
finalized
by the Civ11 Works Measurement
Sectionai
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council..<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
a very jmportant
place
in the planning
and
executidn
of any
civil engineering
work from the time of first estimates
to
the final completion
and settlement
of payments
for a project.
Methods
followed.
for measurement
are
not uniform
and
considerable
differences
exist between
practices
followed
by different
construction
agencies
and
also between
various
Central
and State Government
departments.
While
it is recognized
that
each system

responsible
for the work, a unification
of various
systems at technical
level
has been accepted
as very desirable
specially
as it permits
a wider range of
operation
for  civil engineering
contractors
and eliminates
ambiguities-and
misunderstandings
of various
systems followed.
0.3 Among
various
civil engineering
items, measurement
of buildings
was
the first to be taken
up
for standardization
and

revised in 1964.
0.4 In the course of usage of this standard
by various construction
agencies
in the country,
several clarifications
and suggestions
for modifications
were
received
and
as a result
of study, the technical
committee
responsible
for
this standard
decided
that its scope besides
being
applicable
to buildings
should
be expanded
to cover method
of measurement
of civil engineering
works like industrial
and river valley
project
works.
0.5 Since
different
trades
are not related
to one
another
the
Sectional
