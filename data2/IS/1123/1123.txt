<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(First
Revision)
was
adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on
19 July
1975, after the draft finalized
by the Stones
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Couucil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and identification
of rocks and thus before ascer-
taining
the strength
properties
it is also necessary
to identify
the types of rock.
This standard
had
therefore
been
formulated
to
cover
standard
methods
for
identification
of natural
building
stones.
This standard
was first published
in 1957
which
covered
the aspects
of petrographical
exa-
mination
of building
stones.
While
revising
the
standard
its scope is limited
to only identification
of natural
building
stones which is in fact needed
by the various research
laboratories
of stones using
departments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Building
stones are available
in large quantity
in various
parts of the country
and to select and
utilize
them for their satisfactory
performance
it is
necessary
to know the various
strength
properties
determined
according
to the standard
procedure.
The strength
of the  rocks  depends
on its mineral
constituents
which
form the basis of classification<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ed by blasting,
driving
wedges, heating,
etc, shall
not be included
in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
lays down
the procedure
for
identification
of some of common
types of natural
building
stones.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Field Stons and Boulders -
A detailed inspec-
tion of the stone and boulders
over the area where
the suppl*r is to be obtained
shall be made.
The
different
kmds of stone and their condition
at vari-
ous quarry sites shall be recorded.
Separate
samples
for each class of stone that would
be considered
for use in construction
as indicated
by visual inspec-
tion shall be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  SELECTION OF SAM$‘LE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The sample
shall be selected
to represent
the
type of grade
of stone under
consideration.
The
samples shall be from the fresh rock and not wea-
thered.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The sample shall be selected by the purchaser
or his authorned
representative
from the quarried
stone or taken from the natural
rock, as described
in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and shall be of adequate
size to
permit
the preparation
of the requisite
number
of
test pieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The sample shall be examined
macroscopically
for its colour, structure,
texture and mineral
consti-
tuents .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The type of rocks shall be identified
according
to characteristics
given
in Table
1.
In -case of
doubt
guidance
can be obtained
from engmeering
properties
of the rock given in Table
1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  Stones from LGdges or Quarries -
The ledge
or ,auarry
face of the stone
shall be inspected
to
determine
any variation
in different strata,
Differ-
ences
in colour,
texture
and
structure
shall
be
observed.
Separate
samples of stone
weighing
at
least 25 kg each of the specimens
shall be obtained
from all strata that appear
to vary in colour,
tex-
turoand
structure.
