<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part
1 ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
on 30 April 1987, after the draft finalized
by the Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineer-
ing Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
In recent years there has been
a growing
awareness
that
exposure
to
asbestos
dust can have harmful
effects on the health
of workers.
In
order to give guidance
on how the risk of exposure
to asbestos
dust
can
be
prevented,
controlled
or minimized,
it was felt necessary
to lay down
some
standards
regarding
safe
use
of different
products
containing
asbestos,
improving
conditions
in workplaces,
preventive
measures,
pro-
tection and supervision
of the health of workers, packaging
and transport,
disposal of asbestos waste, etc.
This
standard
laying
down
guidelines
for
safe
use of products
containing
asbestos has been
prepared
in three
parts.
This part of the standard
lays down
guidelines
for
safe
use
of
asbestos cement
products.
Guidelines
for safe
use of friction
materials
containing
asbestos and non-cement
asbestos
products
other than friction
materials
are covered
in Parts 2 and 3 respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Asbestos
cement products
generally
contain
10 to 15 percent
asbestos
fibres in a cement
matrix
that comprises
the rest of the material
and are
termed
as ‘locked-in’
asbestos products
as these products
have the asbestos
fibres bound in cement.
There
is very little possibility
of generation
of
airborne
asbestos
fibres
during
any
reasonable
handling,
transport,
storage
and
use  of such
products.
However,
during
storing
and
instal-
lation,
recommended
work
practices
shall
be followed
to
avoid
harnlful
dust exposures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
‘In the formu!ation
of this standard,
due wt~iphta~e
has
been
given
to

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1  When
working
asbestos
reinforced
cement
products
with power-
driven equipment,
such as saws, jig saws and band saws, the fineness
of
the
dust
produced
depends
primarily
on the geometry
of the saw blade
as well as on the blade
speed (  number  of strokes,
number
of revolutions,
etc ) of the machine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2
With a machine
operating
at a high frequency
together
with
a
fine
saw
blade,
an excessive
amount
of respirable
fine dust is protluced
due
to the
grinding
action
and
hence,
such
type
of
saw
is
not
recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.3  With
a coarse-toothed
saw and a low frequency,
a chip-cutting
action
‘takes
place
which produces
mainly
coarse dust.
Under
certain
conditions
such saw does not require
any dust extraction
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.4
Low
speed
circular
saws
with
milling
action
produce
coarse
chips and do not require
dust extraction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.5
The type of machinery
is assessed by the following
formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d _
-“k”_<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d =  calculated
chip thickness
im pm;<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>v = rate of feed in mm per minute;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a = tooth spacing
in mm;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>k = speed of the cutting
teeth in mm per minute
and is given
by the following
formula:
k = Hf,  for reciprocating
movement;
and
k = wR = PxRf,  for radial
movement<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H =  length
of stroke in mm;<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f-
frequency
( number
of strokes or revolutions
) in
revolu-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>tions per minute;
w = angular
velocity
in radians
per minute;
and
R -
radius of circular
saw blade in mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.6
When
working
without
dust extraction,
the
feed
rate
shall
be
so chosen
that
the
required
chip
thickness
is reached
under normal
operating
conditions.
For a given
frequency
of
the
machine
and
a
given
saw blade, the feed rate depends
principally
on the shearing
force
as well as the thickness
and the properties
of the material
being cut.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.7
A certain
proportion
of fine dust will be
produced
even
when
operating
with
a thick chip.
For this reason, the required
thickness
of
chip lies considerably
above the dimensions

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.8
The working
process with a rotating
saw
blade
is exactly
the
same
as that
of the working
stroke of a machine
with a reciprocating
motion.
However,
on the return stroke, a grinding
effect
occurs
which
produces
fine dust.
The proportion
of fine dust
produced
during
the
working
stroke
is,
therefore,
to
be reduced
to compensate
for the fine
dust produced
during the return stroke in order
to maintain
a similar
average
dust
concentration.
Less
fine
dust is produced
on the return
stroke
when
using
thick
saw
blades
because
of the
reduced
surface
pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.9  The
cooling
air
for
a jig
saw is often so directed
that the fine
dust falling
from the saw blade is blown away.
This
sort of air flow
is
not permissible
for working
of asbestos reinforced
cement products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.2
Tools with a Shearing Action ( see Fig. 5 )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2.1
These
tools work in such a way that the knife of the cutting
aggregate
moves up and down between
two stationery
jaws. The cutting
edge of the sheet is perpendicular
to the surfaces
of the sheet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2.2
Cutting
from the back of the sheet
effects
absolutely
sharp
.edges on the top side of the sheet ( particularly
autoclaved
sheets )_<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2.3
The sheering
action does not actually
produce
chips.
The
asbestos-cement
material
between
the
two
stationary
jaws
becomes
highly compressed
and
is peeled
off continuously.
This
compression
effects
adequate
stress
of the blade.
Working
of asbestos-cement
pro-
ducts
with
shearing
tools
is, therefore,
limited
to
flat
sheets
up
to
approximately
8 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2.4
In spite of the fact that
chips
are
not
really
produced,
a

Chain
cutters
operate
by
means
of

wheels,
mounted
in
a chain
wrapped
around
the pipe barrel.
Hydraulic
pressure,
applied
by means of a remote
electric
or manually
operated
pump,
simultaneously
squeezes the cutting
wheels into the pipe-
wall until the material
shears along
the squeezing
line.
Because
of the
shearing
process,
cutting
with
the chain
is practically
dust-free
and no
chip thickness
is to be calculated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The chain
cutter
is particularly
recommended
for autoclaved

Its
use for non-autoclaved
pipes
is not recommended
