<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Fire Safety Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Frequency of the out-breaks of fire in jute mill: and jute godowns would be appreciatively
minimized if
predetermined safety measures are adopted in the construction of mill building, installation of machinery arrd
in the storage godown. This safety code has, therefore, been formulated with a view to given necessary guidance
regarding the security measures on fire safety precautions, which if followed would safeguard the mill from
fire-hazard to a large extent.
This standard was first published in 1966 and revised in 1979. This revision is
based on developments in the field and comments received subsequently.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to international co-ordination
among the
standards and practices prevailing in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices
in the field in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2: 1960 ‘Rules
for rounding off numerical values (revised)’. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value
should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
