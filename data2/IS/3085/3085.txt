FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institu-
tion
on 20 April
1965,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Permeability
of cement
mortar
or concrete
is of particular
significance
in structures
which
are intended
to retain
water
or which
come
into
contact
with
water.
Besides
functional
considerations,
permeability
is
also intimately
related
to the durability
of concrete,
specially
its resistance
,against
progressive
deterioration
under
exposure
to severe
climate,
and
leaching
due to prolonged
seepage
of water,
particularly
when it contains
aggressive
gases
or minerals
in solution.
The
determination
of the
permeability
characteristics
of mortar
and
concrete,
therefore,
assumes
considerable
importance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
As the test for the permeability
of mortar
or concrete
falls outside
the scope of IS  :  516-1959*
and IS  :  1199-19591_ and in view
of its great
importance,
the
Sectional
Committee
took
up
the formulation
of this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In the preparation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given
to
the need
for international
co-ordination
among
standards
prevailing
in
different
countries
and
the practices
that
are at present
being
followed
in the country
in this field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is
complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960$.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded
off value
should
be the same
as that
of the specified
value
in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1
This standard covers the method for determining
the permeability
of
cement mortar
and concrete
specimens
either cast in the laboratory
obtained by cutting out cores from existing structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  PRINCIPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The test consists in subjecting
the mortar
or concrete
specimen of
known dimensions,
contained
in a specially
designed cell, to a known
hydrostatic
pressure
from
one side, measuring
the quantity
of water
percolating
through it during a given interval of time and computing
the
coefficient of permeability
as described in  8.1.
The test permits measure-
ment of the water entering the specimen as well as that leaving it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Permeability
Cell -
The
permeability
cell shall consist of a metal
cylinder with a ledge at the bottom for retaining
the specimen,
a flange
at the top, a removable
cover plate and a sheet metal funnel which can
be securely bolted to the cell.
Gunmetal,
aluminium
or other suitable
corrosion-resistant
metal
shall be used for fabrication
of the cell and
cover plate, which shall be designed to safely withstand
the maximum
test pressure.
A rubber
or neoprene
O-ring
or other suitable
gasket,
seated in matching grooves, shall be used between the cell and the covet
plate to render the joint water-tight.
Typical
details of the permeability
cell together
with pertinent
dimensions
for use with test specimens
of
various sizes, are show.n in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Wjlter Reservoir
-
A suitable
reservoir
may consist
of a length of
metal pipe, 50 to 100 mm in diameter
and about 500 mm long.
The
reservoir
shall be fitted with a graduated side arm gauge-glass,
and the
necessary
fittings
and valves
for admitting
water and compressed
air
and for draining,
bleeding
and connection
to the permeability
cell, as
shown in Fig. 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The choice of reservoir dimensions is necessarily e matter of compro-
mise between the accuracy with which the water entering the specimen can be
nieasured and the adequacy of the capaoity.
The ideal combination would be the
smallest diameter and sufficient length to provide a capacity for at least 24 hours
of continuous operation.
Lengths much greater than shout 600 mm may be
diEcult to handle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Pressure Lines -  Heavy duty armoured rubber hose or suitable metal
tubing or any other equally
suitable
hose or pipe shall be used for the
various high pressure connections.

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Supply of Compressed Air -
Suitable
arrangements
shall be made for
supplying
compressed
air
at
5 kg/cm2
to 15 kg/cm2
( see 6 ) to
the
permeability
cell assemblies.
Compressed
air ( or nitrogen
) cylinders
or
alternatively
a compressor
of adequate
capacity
may
be used.
Suitable
regulating
valves and pressure
gauges
shall be provided.
Several
cells at
different
operating
pressures
may be served by a common
source as shown
in Fig. 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Supply of De-aired Water -
An adequate
supply
of clean
de-aired
water shall be available
for use in the permeability
tests.
Water
may be
easily de-aired
for this purpose
by boiling
and
cooling.
De-aired
water
may be stored
in closed
containers,
which should,
as far as possible,
be
kept full.
Unnecessary
agitations
and contact
with air shall be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  TEST SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Size of Specimens  -The
specimens
shall be cylindrical
in shape with
height
equal
to the diameter.
The standard
size of specimen
shall
have
diameter
( and height ) of 150 mm.
In the case of specimens
containing
aggregates
whose nominal
size does not exceed
20 mm, the diameter
(and
the height)
of the specimen
may be reduced
to 100 mm.
In the case
of
specimens
containing
aggregates
whose nominal
size exceeds
40 mm,
the
diameter
(and
the height
) of the specimen
should
not be less than about
four times the nominal
size of the aggregate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Casting and Curing -
The mortar
or concrete
mix shall
be cast
in
split moulds
of the required
size, with a removable
collar
of about
hall’
the height
set on the top.
The material
shall be compacted
either by hand
rodding
or vibration,
as proposed
to be done
during
construction.
The
collar
shall then be removed
and the mould
shall be struck  off  level  with
a straight-edge
using
a
sawing
motion
without
further
trovelling
OI
finishing,
which might raise the fines to the surface.
The specimen
shall be
cured for 28 days unless otherwise
specified
by the engineer-in-charge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  PRESSURE HEAD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The standard
test
pressure
head
to be applied
to the water
in the
reservoir
should
be 10 kg/cm”.
This
may,
however,
be reduced
up to
5 kg/cm2 in the case of relatively
more pel,meable
specimens
where steady
state
of flow is obtained
in a reasonable
time,
and may be increased
up
to 15 kg/cm” for relatively
less permeable
specimens
and
whe1.e senlillg
could be ensured
to be fully elfectivc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Calibrating the Reservoir -
Each
reservoir
shall be calibrated
uncle1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS :3085 -1965<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>the  operating pressures of  5  kg/cm2 to 15 kg/cm2 ( see 6 ) as indicated
below:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With  the  reservoir
drain-cock
and
the shut-off
valve
between
the
reservoir
and
the
cell
closed,
and
with
the
air bleeder
valve
open,
the
reservoir
shall
be
filled
with
water.
The
reservoir
drain-cock
shall
then
be opened
to flush
out
any
air and closed
again.
The
reservoir
shall
be refilled
to a
point
above
the
zero
mark
of the
gauge-glass
scale;
the bleeder
valve
shall
be closed
and
the desired
air pressure
applied.
The
drain-cock
shall
be
carefully
opened
to
bring
the water to the zero mark and quickly
closed.
Water
shall then
be drawn
off and caught
in 250 ml increments
in a graduated
jar
and the level
in the gauge-glass
read on the
scale.
The
calibration
constant
for
the
reservoir
shall
be
expressed
in
millilitres
per
division
of the scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2  Preparing the Specimen -
The specimen
shall be thoroughly
cleaned
with a stiff wire brush to remove
all laitance.
The
end
faces shall
then
be sand-blasted
or lightly
chiselled.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3  Sealing the Specimen -
The
specimen
shall be surface-dried
and the
dimensions
measured
to the nearest
0.5 mm.
It shall then be centred
in
tht: cell,
with
the lower
end resting
on the ledge.
The
annular
space
between
the specimen
and the cell shall be tightly
caulked
to a depth
of
about
10 mm using a cotton
or hemp
cord
soaked
in a suitable
molten
sealing
compound.
The rest of the space shall be carefully
filled with the
molten
sealing
compound,
level with the top of the specimen.
Any drop
in the level due to cooling
shall be made up, using a heated
rod to remelt
the solidified,compound
before
pouring
fresh
material
over
it.
A mix-
ture of bees-wax
and rosin,
applied
smoking
hot,
forms an effective
seal.
The proper
proportions
are best chosen
by trial.
Other
suitable
materials
are stearine
pitch,
marine
glue, and various
asphaltic
compounds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4  Testing the Seal -
It
is essential
that
the seal is ,watertight.
This
may
be checked
very
conveniently
by bolting
on the top
cover
plate,
inverting
the cell
and applying
an air pressure
of
1 to 2 kg/cm2 from
below.
A little water poured on the exposed
face of the specimen
is used to
detect
any leaks through
the seal, which
would show up as bubbles
along
ihe ledge.
In case of leaks the specimen
shall be taken out and resealed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5  Assembling the Apparatus -
After a satisfactory
seal has been obtained,
the
funnel
shall
be secured
in position
and the cell assembly
connected
to the water
reservoir,
as illustrated
in Fig.
2.
With
the
air
bleeder
valve, the valve between
the reservoir
and the cell, and the drain-cock
in
the cell
open,
de-aired
water
shall
be allowed
to enter
the
reservoir.
When
water issues
freely through
the drain-cock,
it shall
be closed
and
the water
reservoir
filled.
The
reservoir
water
inlet
and
air
bleeder
valves shall then be closed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  3085 - 1965<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6 Running the Test -With
the system
completely
filled with water, the
desired
test pressure
( see 6 ) shall be applied
to the water
reservoir
and
the initial
reading
of the gauge-glass
recorded.
At the same time a clean
collection
bottle
shall
be weighed
and
placed
in position
to collect
the
water
percolating
through
the specimen.
The quantity
of percolate
and
the gauge-glass
readings
shall be recorded
at periodic
intervals.
In the
beginning,
the rate
of water
intake
is larger
than
the rate
of outflow.
As the steady
state of flow is approached,
the two rates
tend
to become
equal
and the outflow
reaches
a maximum
and stabilizes.
With
further
passage
of time, both the inflow and outflow generally
register
a gradual
drop.
Permeability
test shall be continued
for about
100 hours after
the
steady
state of flow has been reached
and the outflow shall be considered
as average
of all the outflows
measured
during
this
period
of 100 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  The steady
state
of flow is defined as the stage
at which tho outllow
and inflow of water become equal for the first time.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7  Test Temperature  -The
test shall
preferably
be carried
out
at a
temperature
of 27” f
2°C.
In case arrangements
are
not available
for
maintaining
the above
temperature,
a record
shall be maintained
of the
actual
temperature.
An approximate
correction
may
be made
on the
basis that each 5°C increase
of temperature
above
the standard
tempcra-
ture, results
in IO percent
increase
in the coefficient
of permeability
and
vice versa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8 Precautions -
There
are several
precautions
which sha!l be observed,
before
any dependable
estimate
of permeability
can be obtained
from the
test data,
of these the most important
are as follows:
a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The seal around
the specimen
shall be effective.
Leakage
through
it can give rise to entirely
misleading
results.
Obtaining
a good
seal is a matter
of experience
and only a general
guidance
can
be
provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important
that
the air
content
of
the
water
entering
the
specimen
should not exceed
about
0.2 percent.
Excessive
amounts
of dissolved
air can result in air locks
in the specimen
and
appa-
rent reduction
in permeability.
Periodical
samples
shall be drawu
from
the cell drain-cock
and the dissolved
air determined.
The
system
shall be drained
and rel~lcnisl~ccl with fresh de-aired
water,
as soon as the air content
exceeds
the above
limit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The flow should
be permitted
to attain
the steady
state
before
the
coefficient
of
permeability
is calculated.
Examination
of
the
inflow and outflow rate data or suitable
graphs
of the same may be
used to determine
the establishment
of the steady
stnta.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
observation
of outflow
from
the
specimen
is liable
to he
influenced
by evaporation
of the percolate
during
collcc,tion.

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:3085-1965<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>should be made and the necessary
correction
for evaporation
loss
applied.
The inflow measurement
provides
an additional
check.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is very important
that the specimen surface is carefully prepared
by sand blasting
or chiselling,
as even a thin highly -impervious
skin can result in considerable
underestimation
of the permeability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. CALCULATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  The coefficient
of permeability
shall be caIculated
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>K = coefficient of permeability
in cm/set;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Q = quantity of water in millilitres
percolating
over the entire
period of test after the steady state has been reached;
A =  area of the specimen face in cm*;
T =  time in seconds over which Q is measured;
and
H
-
=  ratio of the pressure
head to thickness
of specimen, both
L
expressed in the same units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
