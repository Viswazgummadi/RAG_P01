<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part II ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 22 March 1973, after the draft finalized by the Building Limes
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Hitherto,
methods of tests for assessing qualitative
requirements
of
building limes were included in IS  :  712-1964.
For facilitating
the use of
these tests it has been decided to print these tests as different parts of a
separate
Indian
Standard.
This
part covers determination
of carbon
dioxide content of building limes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,
it shall be done ina ccordance with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  A suitable form of apparatus is shown in Fig. 1.
The system consists
of a U-tube
A  with anhydrous
granulated
calcium
chloride
and another
U-tube  B  with soda asbestos, funnel C with a glass stopcock S and a bent inlet
glass tube ( projecting
below the acid level ) is used to introduce
hydrochloric
acid into the generating
flask  D.
Condenser
E  condenses most of the water
and hydrochloric
acid.
The
U-tube
F  contains
zinc

The
U-tube
Hr
contains
pumice
stone,
impregnated
with anhydrous
copper sulphate to remove traces of hydrogen
sulphide.
Pumice
stone
is prepared
by
crushing
it
to approximately
5 mm size, shifting it free from dust and then transferring
60 g of it to a casse-
role, it is then covered with a concentrated
solution of 30 to 35 g of copper

in each limb to
absorb carbon

Means are provided to pass air through the system either under
pressure or by suction.

funnel C and heat the flask carefully
so that the gases pass through
the
sulphuric acid bubbler
at a moderate rate.
Allow the contents
of the flask
to boil after about 30 to 40 minutes.
After 2 to 3 minutes of boiling,
remove
the flame and connect the flask to scrubbers
A  and  B  by means of stopcock S
and pass air through
the system for 20 minutes at a moderate
rate.
