<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part 1 > was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 30 January 1984, after the draft finalized by the Diversion
Works Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Prior
to the commencement
of actual
construction
of any work
under water, it becomes obligatory
in most cases, to exclude temporarily
water from the proposed
work area during
the construction
period, so
as to permit the work to be done in the dry or semi-dry condition.
An
efficient scheme of diverting
water away from the work area should be
capable
of limiting
the seepage
into the work area
to a minimum
( generally limited to 0’5 cumecs ) so that the work area can be kept dry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 A temporary
diversion scheme essentially
consists of  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)

<<PARAGRAPH>>Reference
may be made
to IS : 9795 ( Part 1 ) - 1981* for the
proper choice of the type of coffer dam after considering all the relevant
aspects mentioned
in the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard
is one of a series of standards
covering
the choice,
design and construction
of coffer dams.
The standards
already publis-
hed,in this series are IS : 9461-19807 and IS : 9795 ( Part 1 ) - 1981*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage has been given to
the practices prevailing
in the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accord-
ance with IS : 2-1960$.
The number of significant
places
retained
in
the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This’standard
( Part 1 ) lays down
guiielines
for the construction
of cellular coffer dams.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. GENERAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Cellular coffer dams are constructed
from steel sheet piles of various
sections interlocked
together
to form cells which are filled up by free
draining
material.
The
cells and arcs form
an enclosure
to exclude
water
from the working
area
inside the coffer dam.
These types of
coffer dams are used in excavation/construction
under water as well as
in soil.
These types of coffer dams are economical
because
stability
is
achieved
by using a soil fill for deadweight
and sheet piles forming a
cellular
ring which takes membrane
tensile stresses and supports the soil
fill.
2.2 There are many types of cellular
structures
as described below and
shown in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  Circular Cellular Type -  These are made up by forming circular
cells of same or different
radii intersecting
each others.
The cell inter-
section
angle is usually
between
30” and 45”.
At
the
joint
tee
made up from sheet pile is provided.
Each cell can be constructed
independently
and forms
a stable unit by itself.
The collapse of the
circular
type
cell is local failure
without
endangering
the stability
of whole
coffer
dam.
Hence
this type provides
high safety during
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2 Diaphragm
Type -
These are  made up of a series
of circular
arcs connected
by cross walls ( diaphragms
). The arcs are connected
to
diaphragms
by Y-pile of 120”. The radius of arc is often made equal to
the cell width that is distance between two diaphragms
in order that the
interlock tension in arcs and diaphragms
may be equal.
The stability of
each unit depends
upon
adjacent cells.
Unlike circular
type, each cell
is not independently
stable
and failure of one cell affects
the others.
This type
is sensitive to differential
filling in
adjacent
cells.
Hence
all cells are to be filled simultaneously.
Holes
in the intermediate
diaphragm
are provided
at suitable
height
for equalisation
of pore
pressures in the cells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3
Clover Leaf Type -
Clover-leaf
type cells consist of four circu-
lar arcs fixed on two transverse
walls perpendicular
to each other, and
connected
by means of small arcs. Each cell is independent
like circular
cellular cells. This type is suitable where the water depth is considerable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

sheet
piles
conforming
to
IS  :  2314-1963$  shall
be only suitable for cellular
coffer dams.
Other
sections Z or U type shall not be used for cellular coffer dams.
Prop-
erties of the sheet piles shall be given by the manufacturer
or should be
in accordance
with IS : 226-1975s or IS  :  961-197511  or IS  :  2062-1980.**<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Fill Material -
Fill material
used in cellular
coffer dam should be
freely draining,
non-cohesive
with high shear
strength
and high unit
weight.
Very fine fill material may flow out with seepage water and is
therefore
avoided.
Properties
of fill materials
should
conform
to the
design requirement
in respect
of unit weight of fill material ( saturated,
moist and dry ), the angle of internal friction for saturated, moist and dry
soils and the angle of repose.
Usually
natural deposits of mixed sand
and gravel
possess
most of the desirable properties
required for cell
fills.
Organic and most deleterious
materials should be removed from
the fill.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Paint -
Steel piles shall be cleaned
and painted
with at least two
coats of special marine
paints over one coat of primer ( see IS  :  1404-
1970*** ) before pitching and driving.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 In cellular
coffer
dams circular
cellular
type is the most commonly
preferred
because
the circular
cell is easier
to form by using
templates.
It forms
a stab12
single
unit
and
each
cell may
be filled individually.
For circular
type even by increasing
the diameter
of cell
the quantity
of
sheet
piling
is practically
constant
for a given
depth
and length

covered,
as the number
of cells will
be reduced.

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
Circular Cellular Type CofSer Dam -
Circular
cell construction
requires
accurate
pitching
and driving
to ensure
closing
of a cell with
the required
number
of standard
piles.
Cell diameter,
spacing,
connect-
ing arcs
radius,
number
of piles,
etc,
may
be adopted
from
Table
1
read
with
Fig.
3 ( see IS  :  2314-1963*).
To construct
circular
cells first
a circular
template
of suitable
shap~e is fabricated
( typical
template
is shown
in Fig. 6 ).
This template’
is located
where
the circular
cells
are
to be constructed,
then
sheet piles are driven
around
the template.
At the intersection
points,
4 tee-piles
are driven
after
completing
the
circular
cell the template
is lifted
up and relocated
for the construction
of another
cell.
After
completion
of the circular
cells, sheet piles are
driven
to form
the connecting
arc.
The
cells
are filled
with
suitable
fill material
( see Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2  Diaphragm
Type Cellular Co#er Dam -
The various
details
are
given in Table
2 read
with Fig. 5 ( see IS  :  2314-1963”
).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3
Following
guidelines
are suggested
for proper
construction
of
circular
as well as diaphragm
type cell  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a ) The
height
of template
should
be about
one-third
the length
of piles
to be pitched.
A tensioned
rope
is put
outside
to
keep the piles conforming
to the ring.
Hence
sheet
piles are
driven
between
outer
periphery
of
template
and
inner
periphery
of ring;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b ) First
sheet pile
shall
be put
very
accurately
ensuring
plumb
in both
planes
and
driven
a few
metres
only.
Subsequent
piles can be pitched
on either
side.
Clutching
is done
as per
manufacturer’s
instructions.
Care should
be taken
to avoid
small
stone
pieces
entering
inside
the
interlocks.

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 10788 ( Part 1) - 1984<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>standard
piles are pitched
with alternate
faces appearing on
either side.
After pitching
7 to 8 piles, next one is driven
after giving due corrections.
Ring should
thus be completed
before down by stages to design level;
Tee-piles
should not be put initially till the ring is completed.
These should
be pitched after the closure of ring when the
ordinary
piles are withdrawn
and tee-piles are inserted in their
places;
Piles are best driven by wire suspended double acting hammers
operated
by steam, compressed
air or diesel combustion.
For
sandy soils, vibrating hammers are very efficient;
Cellular structures
are provided
with a RCC or steel ring on
top and at least alternate
piles are bolted to it.
This helps in
retention
of shape on deflection.
Welding of piles to each
other on top for a distance
of about 30 cm helps in rigidity
of cell and helps in its stability;
Where used as permanent
structure,
sheet piles in tidal zone
are recommended
to be encased in concrete or provided with
cathodic protection
against rusting;
Main cells are to be filled first and then the area enclosed by
connecting
arcs; and
Cellular
structures
can be straight or an arch, shape to over
an opening.
Where there is change of direction,
it should be
ensured
that tee-piles are not closer than one-twelfth
of the
circumference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  l -
The smallest circular
cell that can be built using flat-type
sheet piles is about 3 m in radius,
but construc-
tion can be expedited
by making the radius larger than 3 m.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  2 -
The number
of sheet piles required
to form a cell is always even because
of the shape of the joint.
If an
odd number of sheet piles required,
one special shaped pile shall be used.
