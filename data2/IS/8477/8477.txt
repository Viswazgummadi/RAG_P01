FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 15 November
1985, after the draft finalized by
the Chemical Methods of Test Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Textile Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Jutebags
laminated
with craft
paper
or polyethylene
film using
bitumen
as the bonding
material
are extensively
used these days for
packing
materials
like pesticides,
fertilizers,
etc.
This method
was
evolved for determining
the amount~of
bitumen
used for bonding
the
liner and the jute fabric as its quantity is important
for the performance
of the laminated jute bag.
The standard has been revised to include
a
more simplified method based on conditioning
of the test specimens in a
desiccator
containing
saturated solution of sodium nitrite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Method 1 based on conditioning
of the test specimens in a standard
atmosphere
or in a conditioning
chamber
is time
consuming
and
requires the use of conditioning
chamber.
Method 2 based on condi-
tioning of the test specimens in a desiccator containing saturated solution
of sodium
nitrite
is easier and cheaper and does not require a special
instrument
for conditioning
of the test specimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting
the result of a test made in accordance
with this
standard,
if thee final value, observed or calculated
is to be rounded off,
it shall be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard prescribes two methods for determination
of bitumen
content in laminated jute bags.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Rules for rounding
off numerical
values ( revised ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS: 8477 -1985<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. PRINCIPLE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  A~specimen of laminated fabric of known
mass is taken
and the
liner is removed
by dipping
in a suitable
solvent and then the fabric
portion is extracted in Soxhlet apparatus.
From the mass of the initial
piece, liner and extracted fabric, the bitumen content is calculated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. SAMPLING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Lot -
The quantity of laminated jute bags purporting
to be of one
definite type and quality delivered to a buyer against one despatch note
shall constitute a  lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The sample shall be so drawn as to be the representative
of the lot.
The sample
drawn
in accordance
with the procedure laid down in the
material specification
or as agreed to between the buyer
and the seller
shall be taken as representative
of the lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. PREPARATION
OF TEST SPECIMEN<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 From the sample, cut four pieces of 100 mm  X  100 mm taking
one
piece from the area near the mouth, the other from the area close to the
bottom and two pieces from the middle portions of the bag.
The pieces
shall be taken
in such a way that they contain spot application
portion
in case the bitumen is applied off-set.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. METHOD
1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Conditioning of Test Specimens<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1 Before testing, condition
the specimens to moisture
equilibrium
in standard
atmosphere
at 27 & 2°C temperature
and 65 + 2 percent
relative humidity (see also  IS :  6359-1971” ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.1 When the test specimens have been left in such an atmos-
phere for at least 24 hours
in such a way as to expose,
as far as
possible, all portions of the specimens to the atmosphere,
they
shall be
deemed to have reached moisture equilibrium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2 In  case
arrangements
are not there for conditioning
the test
specimens
in standard
atmosphere,
these may be
conditioned
in a
conditioning
chamber
and
mass
determined
immediately
after the
removal of the test specimens from the conditioning
chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  Condition
all the test specimens
( see 4.1 ) in the desiccator
charged
with
saturated
solution
of sodium
nitrite at 27 + 2°C for at

of the
liner pieces from the test specimens and place them in the thimble ofthe
Soxhlet apparatus.
Take about 400 ml of the solvent in the extraction
flask.
Extract
the fabric
pieces for
14 to 2 hours at a rate of about
6 cycles per hour.
Take
out the fabric
pieces and let the solvent
evaporate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>62.6 Place the fabric pieces in the desiccator charged
with saturated
solution
of sodium
nitrite at 27 & 2°C for at least 24 hours exposing
both sides of
each fabric piece as far as possible to the air inside
the
desiccator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.7 Remove the fabric pieces from the desiccator
and immediately
determine their collective mass to the nearest milligram.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.8 Calculate
the quantity
of bitumen per square
metre as given
in 7.1 and 7.1.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  Calculate the quantity
of bitumen per square metre by the following
formula  :<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X=25[a
-_(b
+ c + d)lglma
where
X = mass of bitumen per
square
metre of the laminated
fabrics;
a = combined mass of the conditioned
test specimens;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B = combined
mass of the liner pieces;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  8477 - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c = combined
conditioned
mass of the extracted
fabric
pieces; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d =  correction
factor for oil content of the fabric.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1 Calculate the value of  d  by the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>CXY
d=  100<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
c = combined
conditioned
mass
of the extracted
fabric
pieces; and
y = oil content percentage of the fabric as specified
in the
material specification,
on conditioned
mass basis ( see
Note ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Generally
five percent
oil content
on conditioned
mass basis is used
for hessian
and double-warp
thread fabrics made of jute.
For other fabrics use
the value as given in the material
specification
based on conditioned
mass.
Five
percent
of oil content
on conditioned
mass
corresponds
to six percent
of oil
content
on dry de-oiled
material
basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
