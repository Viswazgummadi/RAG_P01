<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized
by the Hydraulic
Structures
Instrumentation
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the
River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Increase
in the height of structures
and varied topographical
conditions
have focussed attention
to the
study of the behaviour
of structures
in the construction
as well as operation
stage,
both from the point
of view of safety
and knowledge
of behaviour
pattern.
In addition,
various assumptions
which are
commonly
made either explicitly or implicitly
in the dam design need verification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A number of these structures
in India have been located in regions of seismic activity.
Hence, there is a
need to establish adequate
instruments
both in the structure
as well as the foundation
to evaluate and
understand
the influence of various parameters
in the structural
performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Periodical
and timely observations
will provide the means of evaluating the behaviour of the structure
and,
if need be, take
appropriate
remedial
measures on the basis of observed
data. It is, therefore,
imperative
that adequate
means should be established
within the structure
so that measurements
of
vital significance can be made and compared with design criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is emphasized
that field -measurements
cannot eliminate
all the uncertainties
of earth
and rockfill
dam design,
construction
and operation
and they are no substitute
for proper understanding
of the
problems
involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in. 1974. A revision of the standard
has been taken up to incorporate
certain
changes
found necessary. in the standard
in the light of comments
from the users, The major
changes in this revision are inclustons m clmometers
and choice of instruments
to measure movements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in actor_
dance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.  The number
of significant
places  retained in the rounded
off value should be the
same as that
of the
specified
value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard covers the various types of measurc-
ments nccdcd for monitoring the behaviour of earth and
rockfill dams and provides
guidelines
for choice of
instruments
and their locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.3  Seepage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement
of seepage through and past a dam, may
indicate erosion or blocking of downstream
drains and
reliefwclls,
by increase ordecrease
of seepage, respec-
tively at constant
reservoir
conditions.
Seepage and
erosion along the lines ofpoorcompaction
and through
cracks in foundations
and fills may specially be indi-
cated by such measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.1  Generally
the same type of instruments
are
suitable
for earth and rockfill dams. For the latter,
however, graded material is used between the rockfill
and the instrument
so that the instrument
does not get
damaged-by
the rock pieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  REF-ERENCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The Indian Standards
listed below are necessary ad-
juncts to this standard  :<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Straius
and Stresses<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS No.
Title<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design analysis of earth and rockfill dams is based on
radical simplifications
of the stress pattern
and the
shape of the rupture
planes.
Stress measurements,
therefore,
require
considerable
judgement
in inter-
pretation. Accurate measurement
of stress is difficult
and distribution
of stress in earth and rockfill dams is
complex.
Strains may be calculated
from displace-
ments or measured directly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

OF MEASUREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Pore Pressure,
Movements
and Seepage<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.1  Fore Pressure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Other Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The measurement
of pore pressure is probably the most
important
and usual measurement
to be made in the
embankments.
Their measurement
enables the seepage
pattern
set up after impounding
of reservoir
to be
known, the danger of erosion to be estimated, at least
partially,
and the danger
of slides in the dam and
abutments
to be estimated if the relia~ble shear strength
is known. Valuable informaLion about behaviour during
construction
and drawdown is obtained.
3.1.2  Movements
Measurement
of movements
is as important
as the
measurement
of pore pressures. Movements
conform-
ing to normal expectations
are basic requirements
of a
stable dam. An accurate measurement
of internal and
external movements
is of value in cohtrolling

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Careful
attention
should
bc given to planning
an
instrumentation
system
to  emure that required infor-
mation is obtained both during construction as well as
during  the life of the structure.
The requirements
of the
system and the procedures
to the used for analyzing the
observations
should be formula led in detail and selec-
tion of measuring
devices and their location chosen to
meet these requirements.
4.1.1
In genera 1,from the consideration
of usefulness
of data obtainilble,
no instruments
except for seepage,
rainfall and rescrvoirwater
levels are required for dams
up to  30 m  height. Although this li~i~itmay seem
superfluous,
lhe actual
requi rcments
“may be best
guided by consideration
of fou relation and constmction
ma teria 1s, the
imports nce
of
\he structure,
design
methods and criteria adopted. Provision
of instruments
for measuring
pore pressures and movements should be
provided
fors[ructures
having greater height. Provision
of instruments
[or measuring
strain
and stress
and
dynamic
effects of earthquake
may be made for a few
selected
cases where
dam heights
are more and ade-
quate tra inect sta ff is available.
An earth or rockfiIl dam
with weak soi 1sin the foundation
of embankment
is to
bc treated as a special case irrespective
of its height and
instruments
should be provided
to suit the observation
requirements
from the points
of view of safety
and
collecting
data for future similar designs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
Cross-Arm Installation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It consists
of
telescopic
steel
easing
to  which are
attached  horizontal
cross-arms
at predetermined
verti-
cal intervals. As the soil settles, sections
of casing are
dragged down and these are thus relocated
in their new
positions by lowering down the casing a problem fitted
with retractable claws which engage the bottom of each
section in turn or by using an electrical
probe. Cross-
arms are used in order to eliminate
any possibility
of
the easing sections not settling along with the surround-
ing soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3  Hydraulic Device<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is made from two 50-nun diameter brass pipe nipples
soldered
to a common
diaphragm.
Pipe
caps
are
secured
at both ends of the assembly
which
is then
mounted vertically
on a steel base plate for anchorage
in the embankment.
The diaphragm
separates the upper
(air) chamberfrom
the lower (overflow)
chamber
and
encloses
a plastic
float valve
which
prevents
water
from entering
the air chamber
during
flushing
of the
lower
chamber.
Three
8-n~m outer
diameter
plastic
tubes are embedded
in trenches which are exeavated
to
maintain
continuous
downward
slopes
to the instru-
ment terminal.
The instrument
terminal
is equipped
with a pump, air compressor
and  high precision pres-
sure gauges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>It consists of a three-pronged
tip connected
to a double
rod which is lowered down a bore hole or driven in soft
ground to desired depth. When the outer  rod is  held and
the inner rod driven with hammer, the three prongs are
forecd out in the surrounding
soil. The outer rod is then
uncovered
from, the tip and withdrawn
a few ecn-
timetres.
The top of the inner rod, which
remains
in
contact with the anchored
tip is used as a reference
point to measure the settlement
of the tip. This device
is particularly
well suited for measuring
settlements
of
soft foundations
under-low embankments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

time
lag. Installation
of twin-tube
hydraulic
piezometers
has been a standard
practice.
Factors
considered
in its favour include
relalive
economy
and
availability
of materials
and ease of
installation.
But presence of air-bubbles
in the tubing
which may become difficult to remove is one of the
disadvantages.
Electrical
piezometers
have instan-
taneous
response and are available
indigenously.
A
final choice regarding
selection
will be best judged
upon the accuracy of results required, the importance
of such records, and the cost involved.
6.3  Choice of Location for Installation of Piezometer<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.2 The piezometer consisting of PVC vertical pipe
12 to 15 mm outer diameter extending above ground or
embankment
surface
with
carborandutialundum
porous
tube tip having
37 mm outer diameter
and
length 30 to 60 cm at the measuring point is known as
porous tube type piezometer. It is free frqm electrolytic
action and attack by chemicals
in water.or soil. It has
also less response time compared to ordinary stand pipe
piezometer
with bottom end open or with perforated
bottom section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pore water pressures
indicate
whether
the various
zones in an earth/rockfill dab are functioning
properly.
These also indicate th? effectiveness
of the seepage
barrier provided in case of pervious
foundations,
the
effectiveness
of chimney filters and horizontal
drains
provided in the upstream embankment
in case of earth
dams, etc. As such the piezometers
are required to be
located at critical ~points of a cross-section
and loca-
tions. Typical installation
arrangements
are shown in
Fig. 1. Structures
made up of inferior
materials
or
resting on soft, slow draining foundations
should have
adequate number of piezometers.
Piezometets
located
in the upstream
and downstream
of the filter and
upstream and downstream
side of the under seepage
barriers casing of not freely draining
materials would
indicate drawdown
pore pressures,
and those in the
downstream
casing
would
give
information
about
seepage conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>it  consists of a porous element which is connected by
two plastic tubes to pressure gauges located in a ter-
minal house or terminal
well. The terminal house or
well contains
pumping

an air
trap and a supply of de-aired water besides pressure
gauges. Use oftwo plastic tube makes possible,circula-
tion of water through the porous element to de-air the
system. The pore-water
pressure is noted by means of
gauges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2.1 There are two types oftips. The foundation type

<<PARAGRAPH>>Electrical
piezometer
consists
of. a tip having
a
diaphragm
which is deflected by the pore water pres-
sure against one face. The deflection of the diaphragm
is measured by a suitable strain gauge which may be
suilably
calibrated
to read pore water pressure. The
str;lin gauge is either electrical
resistance
(unbonded
strain gauge) type or vibrating wire type.

<<PARAGRAPH>>In the pneumatic
piezometers,
the diaphragm
deflec-
tion due to pore water pressure is balanced by a known
air/gas pressure and recorded at the outside indicator
end  using
pneumatic
pressure
gauges
or pressure
transducers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Earth Pressure
Cells<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The usual instrument
to measure earth pressure is the
earth pressure cell. It uses a stiff diaphragm
on which
the earth pressure
acts. The action
is transmitted
through an equalizing,
confined,
incompressible
fluid
(Mercury) on to a second pressure responsive element,
the deflection
of which is proportional
to the earth
pressure acting. The deflection
is transformed
into an
electrical signal by a resistance wire (unbonded
strain
gauge) or vibrating
wire strain gauge and transmitted
through a cable embedded
in the earth work tb a
receiver unit on the surface. The measure of the electri-
cal signal indirectly
indicates
the earth pressure
by
appropriate calibration.
8.1.1 The earth pressure
cell may be designed
to
measure effective or total earth pressure or both. When
it measures
total earth pressures
only, piezometers
should be placed by their side to measure pore pressure
which when deducted from the total earth pressure to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  Piezometer observations
are of prime importance
and are to be continued

It is, therefore, imperative
that limitations

posed as to the selection

instruments
because of its reliability

Other factors
that influence the selection are time lag and sensitivity.
The significance
of time lag depends to a considerable
extent on the nature of the anticipated

WAVE
HEIGHTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  Automatic wave height recorders are installed to
measure wave heights. One type of this instrument
provides an electriccircuit,
which is completed by lake
water. The change in level of lake water due to wave,
causes change in resistance/capacitance
of the circuit
which is automatically
recorded by a recorder. Suitable
calibration of change in resistance/capacitance
in terms
of change in water level gives the desired observation.
The installation of such recorders will be required only
for those reservoirs with long fetch which is likely to
experience high velocity winds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
