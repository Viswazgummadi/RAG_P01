<<PARAGRAPH>>(Incorporating Amendment No. 1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. Scope  — Prescribes a gravimetric method for the determination of filterable residue. This method
is applicable to all types of water and waste water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. Principle  — The sample is filtered and the filtrate evaporated in a tared dish on steam-bath. The
residue after evaporation is dried to constant mass at 103-105°C or 179-181°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note  — The value of filterable residue obtained by drying at 179-181°C conforms more closely to those obtained by
summation of various constituents. (Since bicarbonates decompose to carbonates, only half of bicarbonate should be taken
while summing up of the various constituents.)
3. Interferences  — Interferences are the same as those for total residue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1   filter  — Any one of the following may be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1  Glass fibre filter disc  — (Whatman GF/C or equivalent) 2.1 to 5.5 cm in diameter, pore size
1.2 µm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.2  Paper  — Acid washed, ashless hard filter finish; filter paper sufficiently retentive for fine
particles (Pore size 2-2.5 µm equivalent to Whatman filter No. 542.)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.3   Gooch crucible  — 30 ml capacity with 2.1 or 2.4 cm diameter glass fibre filter disc. (Whatman or
equivalent.)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.4   Sintered disc  — G-5 or its equivalent with pore size 1 to 2 µm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.5   Membrane filter  — 0.45 µm membrane.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2   Filtering Assembly  — Depending upon the type of filter selected.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Drying Oven  — With thermostatic control for maintaining temperature up to 180 ± 2°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4   Desiccator  — Provided with a colour indicating desiccant.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5   Analytical Balance  — 200 g capacity and capable of weighing to nearest 0.1 mg.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6   Magnetic stirrer  — With teflon coating stirring bars.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Sample Handling and Preservation  — Preservation of the samples is not practical. Analysis
should begin as soon as possible. Refrigeration or chilling to 4°C to minimise microbiological
decomposition of solids is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Heat the clean evaporating dish to 180°C for 1 hour. Cool in the desiccator, weigh and store in the
desiccator until ready for use.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Filter a portion of the sample through any of the filters mentioned in  4.1 . Select volume of the
sample which has residue between 25 and 250 mg, preferably between 100 to 200 mg. This volume
may be estimated from values of specific conductance. To obtain a measurable residue, successive
aliquots of filtered sample may be added to the sample dish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Stir volume of sample with a magnetic stirrer or shake it vigorously. Pipette this volume to a
weighed evaporating dish placed on a steam-bath. Evaporation may also be performed in a drying
oven. The temperature shall be lowered to approximately 98°C to prevent boiling and
splattering of the sample. After complete evaporation of water from the residue, transfer<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in the successive weighings is less than 0.5 mg. Drying for a long duration (usually 1 to 2 hours) is
done to eliminate necessity of checking for constant mass. The time for drying to constant mass
with a given type of sample when a number of samples of nearly same type are to be analysed has
to be determined by trial.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Weigh the dish as soon as it has cooled avoiding residue to stay for long time as some residues
are hygroscopic and may absorb water from desiccant that is not absolutely dry.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>M  =
mass in mg of filterable residue, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

values above 100 mg/l. Report the temperature of determination.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. Precision and Accuracy  — The precision of the method is about 5 percent. Accuracy cannot
be estimated because filterable residue as determined by this method is a quantity defined by the
procedure followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
