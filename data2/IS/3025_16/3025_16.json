Principle \u2014 The sample is filtered and the filtrate evaporated in a tared dish on steam-bath. The\nresidue after evaporation is dried to constant mass at 103-105\u00b0C or 179-181\u00b0C.\nNote \u2014 The value of filterable residue obtained by drying at 179-181\u00b0C conforms more closely to those obtained by\nsummation of various constituents. (Since bicarbonates decompose to carbonates, only half of bicarbonate should be taken\nwhile summing up of the various constituents.)\n3. Interferences \u2014 Interferences are the same as those for total residue.\n4. Apparatus\n4.1 filter \u2014 Any one of the following may be used.\n4.1.1Glass fibre filter disc \u2014 (Whatman GF/C or equivalent) 2.1 to 5.5cm in diameter, pore size\n1.2\u00b5m.\n4.1.2Paper \u2014 Acid washed, ashless hard filter finish; filter paper sufficiently retentive for fine\nparticles (Pore size 2-2.5\u00b5m equivalent to Whatman filter No. 542.)\n4.1.3 Gooch crucible \u2014 30ml capacity with 2.1 or 2.4cm diameter glass fibre filter disc.

Sample Handling and Preservation \u2014 Preservation of the samples is not practical. Analysis\nshould begin as soon as possible. Refrigeration or chilling to 4\u00b0C to minimise microbiological\ndecomposition of solids is recommended.\n6. Procedure\n6.1Heat the clean evaporating dish to 180\u00b0C for 1 hour. Cool in the desiccator, weigh and store in the\ndesiccator until ready for use.\n6.2 Filter a portion of the sample through any of the filters mentioned in 4.1. Select volume of the\nsample which has residue between 25 and 250mg, preferably between 100 to 200mg. This volume\nmay be estimated from values of specific conductance. To obtain a measurable residue, successive\naliquots of filtered sample may be added to the sample dish.\n6.3Stir volume of sample with a magnetic stirrer or shake it vigorously. Pipette this volume to a\nweighed evaporating dish placed on a steam-bath. Evaporation may also be performed in a drying\noven. The temperature shall be lowered to approximately 98\u00b0C to prevent boiling and\nsplatteringofthe sample. After complete evaporation of water from the residue, transfer",
