<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Environmental
Protection
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Chemical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Phenols, defined as hydroxy derivatives of benzene and its condensed
nuclii may occur in domestic and
industrial wastewaters,
natural waters and portable
water supplies. Chlorination
of such waters may
produce odouriferous
and objectional
tasting chlorophenols.
Phenol removal processes in water
treat-
ment
include super chlorination,
chlorine dioxide
or chloramine
treatment,
ozonation
and activated
carbon
adsorption.
This standard
supersedes
57 of IS 3025  :  1964 ‘Methods
of sampling and
test
( physical and chemical ) for water used in industry’. In the preparation
of this standard,
considerable
assistance has been derived from
Standard
Methods for the Examination
of Water and Wastewater,
17th edition
published
by American
Public
Health
Association,
Washington
( USA ),
1989 and
EPA-1979 ‘Methods for Chemical
Analysis of Water and Wastewater.’<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result  of  a  test or analysis made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final value,
observed or calculated,
is to be rounded off, it shall done in accordance
with 1S 2  :  1960 &Rules for

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.1 This standard prescribes two spectrophoto-
metric methods for the determination
of phenol
in natural
waters,
potable
water
supplies,
domestic and industrial wastewaters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) 4 Amino-antipyrine
method
without
chloroform

and
b) 4 Amino-antipyrine
method with chlorc-
form extraction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Interferences<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To eliminate
or minimize the interferences,
use
steam
distilled
sample.
Phenols
are
distilled
from
non-volatile
impurities.
Because
the
volatilization
of phenols is gradual,
the distilate
volume
shall
ultimately
equal
that
of
the
original sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 It does not app!y to differentiate
between
various kinds of phenols.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
