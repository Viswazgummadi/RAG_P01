FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 January
1981, after
the draft
finalized
by the
Sanitary
Appliances
and Water
Fittings
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Normally
a fluid,
like water,
builds
up pressure
when
it is stored
at
an elevation
or is taken
from
lines
which
are
connected
to motivation
pumps.
In many
applications
fluids
at such
high
pressure
cannot
be
utilized
directly
as they
may damage
other
equipment
connected
to the
line.
For
these
reasons
pressure
reducing
valves
are
installed
on
the
fluid
line
to reduce
and
also
to evaluate
the
fluid
pressure
in the most
economical
and simple
way.
This
standard
has
been
prepared
with
a
view
to providing
guidance
to the manufacturers
and the users
as to the
requirements
of pressure
reducing
valves
of different
sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For
the
purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a test
or
analysis,
shall
‘be rounded
off
in
accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value
should
be the same as that
of the specified
value
in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This

domestic
water
supply
system
suitable
