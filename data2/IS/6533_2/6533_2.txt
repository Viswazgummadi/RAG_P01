<<PARAGRAPH>>Structural Engineering Sectional Committee, CED 7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 2) (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on
20 April 1989, after the draft finalized by the Structural Engineering Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1971. On suggestions by practising engineers and
representatives of various organizations in the country, the Sectional Committee decided to
bifurcate the standard in two parts, separating structural aspects from the mechanical aspects as
follows:
Part 1 Mechanical aspects, and
Part 2 Structural aspects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this part (Part 2), the dynamic effects of wind have been included as a check for resonance
oscillations. More accurate method of determining the natural frequency of oscillation has been
included. Many of the commonly known formulae and calculation steps for design have been
deleted to make the code concise. Further, since the principal load on the chimney is wind load, no
increase in permissible stress is envisaged in this code aligning with the present line of thinking
for wind loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Atmospheric pollution regulations necessitate adoption of tall chimneys which require
strengthening against stresses caused by oscillation due to wind action. Alternative procedures
(a) making an appropriate increase in the design wind loading, and (b) indicating the need of
strengthening or incorporation of devices for suppressing von-Karman type oscillations are given
in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Certain methods of strengthening, such as welding or bolting helical strakes to the top one-third
height of the chimney and the installation of damping devices are recommended (  see   A-2.2  ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design and construction of chimneys have become specialized field with a lot of scope for research
and modifications. It is, therefore, attempted in this standard to cover only the basic requirements.
The designer should use his discretion in the use of research data available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, considerable assistance has been derived from the following:
a) BS 4076 : 1978 Specification for steel chimneys, and
b) Stroitelny Normi E Provila (SNIP-II-VI-1974) USSR (Soviet Norms on Loads and Actions).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (June 1998). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Minimum Thickness of Steel<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 DESIGN
7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1  Chimney Shell
The minimum thickness of the structural
chimney shell in single or multiple shell
constructions, shall be the calculated thickness
obtained
from
stress
and
deflection
considerations plus the corrosion allowance
(  see   7.5  ), but shall not be less than 6.0 mm nor
less than 1/500 of the outside diameter of the
chimney at the considered height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the design of chimney shell and other
components of chimney in steel, the relevant
provisions contained in IS 800 : 1984 shall be
applicable in conjunction with the provision of
this standard.
7.1.1  The provisions covered in IS 800 : 1984
regarding the following shall, however, be
superseded by the requirements of this
standard:
a) Minimum thickness,
b) Allowable deflection,
c) Allowance for corrosion,
d) Allowance for temperature,
e) Allowable compressive stress in circular
shells due to direct force and bending
moment, and
f) Stresses due to earthquake.
7.2 Basic Dimensions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2  Chimney Liner
The minimum thickness of the steel liner in a
double skin or multiple construction shall be
the calculated thickness obtained from stress
considerations plus the corrosion allowance,
but shall be not less than 6.0 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3  Supporting Steelwork
The minimum thickness for hot rolled sections
used for external construction exposed to the
weather shall be 8.0 mm, and for constructions
not so exposed and ancillary steelwork, 6.0 mm.
These provisions do not apply to the webs of
Indian Standard rolled steel sections or to
packings. The minimum thickness of hollow
sections sealed at the ends, used for external
constructions exposed to the weather or other
corrosive influences shall be 4 mm, and for
constructions not so exposed shall be 3 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1  The basic dimensions of the chimney,
namely, clear diameter, height, etc, are decided
on considerations of temperature, composition
of flue gases, adjacent structures, pollution
control, draft requirements, etc, with Part 1 in
accordance with this standard. Nevertheless,
certain recommended proportions should be
maintained for the strength and stability of the
chimney.
7.2.2  The clear diameter of the chimney is the
nominal diameter of the shell if the chimney is
unlined or partially lined. For fully lined
chimney the clear diameter shall be the clear
diameter of the lining at the top. The fully lined
chimney shall have a minimum clear diameter
of 500 mm. If, for technological reasons, it is
necessary to have a smaller diameter, the top
opening shall be reduced by constricting the
passage locally.
7.2.3  A self-supporting chimney of height 40 m
and above shall be provided with a flare at the
base to achieve better stability.
7.2.4  Proportions of the basic dimensions of a
self-supporting chimney shall conform to the
following:
a) Minimum height of flare be equal to
one-third the height of the chimney.
b) Minimum outside diameter of unlined
chimney
shell
at
top
be
equal
to
one-twentieth of the height of cylindrical
portion of chimney and for lined chimney
it shall be one-twentyfifth of the height of
the cylindrical portion.
c) Minimum outside diameter of flared
chimney shell at base be equal to 1.6 times
the outside diameter of chimney shell at
top.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.4  Angle Flanges
The minimum thickness of jointing flanges to
chimney shall be 6.0 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Allowable Deflection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The maximum deflection at the top of the steel
chimney produced by the wind load without
taking into account the dynamic factors,
calculated as acting on the circular cross
section shall not be greater than  h /200. Where
‘ h ’ is the unsupported height of the chimney.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 Allowance for Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total allowance for corrosion shall be the
sum of the external (  T ce  ) and internal (  T ci  )
allowances given in Table 1. This total
allowance shall be added to the thickness of
shell obtained from the calculations of the
stresses and deflection. Internal flanges shall
have corrosion allowance  T ci  , and external
flanges corrosion allowance  T ce  except if they
are encased.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — However, a lower corrosion allowance than
specified in Table 1 may be adopted at the discretion of
the designer/owner, if it can be ensured that the
properties of flue gas and its effect on the chimney shell
will not adversely affect the safety requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Effective Height of Chimney Shell<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If the chimney carries a vertical load other than
its own weight, due for example, to the reaction

that an appreciable compressive stress results,
deflection due to wind may cause the axial load

produced shall be determined, added to that
from the windload and any other live or dead
load and used to calculate the combind stress
which shall not exceed those specified in  7.8 .
This procedure is necessary only if the total
axial load produces stresses greater than
one-third of the bending stress due to wind.

wind

shall
take
into
consideration the dynamic effect due to
pulsation of thrust caused by wind velocity in
addition to the static wind load calculated
under  8.2.3 .
The natural frequency, first mode, for a
chimney of varying diameter or thickness, shall
be calculated by dividing the chimney into a
number of convenient zones as given in  8.2.2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.14 Foundation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The foundation shall be designed for the worst
combination of loads specified in  6 , such that
the resulting pressure on the subsoil by
considering the dead weight, movements and
horizontal forces, is limited to safe bearing
capacity of the soil. Necessary care should be
taken on the effects of the temperature and
seasonal changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

number of factors, such as, mass and its
disposition along chimney height, period and
mode
of
natural
oscillation.
1ogarithmic
decrement of dampening, pulsation of velocity
thrust, etc. Values of dynamic components of
wind load should be determined for each mode

<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Calculation of Static Wind Load<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1  Static wind pressure,  q , acting normal to
the surface of chimney shall be taken as
specified in IS 875 (Part 3) : 1987 for the
appropriate wind zone, terrain and topography.

different heights of chimney, the latter shall be
divided into a number of convenient zones such
that the number of zones shall not be less than
three and the zone height shall not exceed 10 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

12 INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE
12.1  All steel chimneys shall be inspected and
examined at least once a year.
12.1.1  In case of uninsulated and unlined steel
chimneys, the thickness of the shell should be
determined by either ultra-sonic thickness
testing or by drill testing. At the same time,
any decorative or other surface finish on the
exterior of the chimney may be examined. The
internal surface
of
large diameter
steel
chimneys may also be inspected preferably by
close examination from a painter’s trolley or
similar means of support.
12.1.2  Lined chimneys should also be inspected
internally by close examination from a painter’s
trolley or similar means of support to ascertain
that the lining is still in serviceable condition
and fulfilling its task.
12.2  The details of the painter’s trolley are
given in Fig. 7 for information. For chimney of
diameter exceeding 3 m at the top, two such
painter’s trolleys should be provided.
12.3  Flanges should be inspected to see if there
is a build-up of rust between them as the
pressure of rust build-up can overload the
bolts/rivets in tension. In bolted connections,
particular attention should be given to the
conditions of the bolts. Selected bolts in critical
areas should be removed, inspected, tested as
necessary and be replaced with the new bolts.
Should the examined bolts be serviceable, these
shall not be reused.
12.4  The rivet heads on the interior of riveted
chimney should be examined to ascertain that
they are secure and have not eroded to a
dangerous degree.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13 PROTECTIVE TREATMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.1 Surface Preparation for Painting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consideration should be given to the surface
preparation and protective treatment of both
the exterior and interior surfaces of chimney
shells in order to prolong the life and improve
the appearance of the chimney. Immediately
before applying any protective treatment to the
exterior or the interior surface of a steel
chimney shell, the surface shall be cleaned by
chipping, scrapping and wire brushing, or by
other means to remove all dirt, loose scale,
grease, rust or other deleterious materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.1.1  Pretreatment and painting of chimney
shell parts shall generally conform to the
requirements of IS 1477 (Part 1) : 1971 and
IS 1477 (Part 2) : 1971.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.2 Painting of Interior Surfaces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.2.1  Unlined Chimney Shell
There is generally no advantage in applying a
protective treatment except for the application
of one coat of suitable priming paint to the
interior surface of an unlined chimney shell
unless it can be shown that such treatment will
withstand the corrosive, abrasive and thermal
effects of the flue gases and thus prolong the
life of the chimney.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.2.2  Lined Chimney Shell
When it is thought desirable to use a protective
treatment on the interior steel surface of a
lined chimney, such treatment shall consist of
the application of one coat of a suitable priming
paint followed by two coats of a finishing paint

of
a
multi-flue
chimney,
the
treatment
described in  13.3.1  shall be applied.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.4.4.3  The nominal thickness of the coating
shall be not less than 0.18 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.4 Metal Spraying<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.4.4.4  Sealing coats
The sprayed aluminium coating shall be sealed.
For temperatures not exceeding 150°C, certain
organic base sealers or paints are suitable.
Special high temperature resistant paints shall
be selected for use at temperatures exceeding
150°C, that is, resin-modified silicone base
paints. Silicone base paints shall be used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.4.1  General
The exterior of a steel chimney may be
protected from atmospheric corrosion by the
application
of
a
sprayed
metal
coating.
Aluminium is the preferred metal for this
application
(certain
other
metals
have
disadvantages when used for hot surfaces).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The initial metal spray treatment shall be
applied under controlled conditions before
erection and care shall be taken to avoid
damage during transportation and erection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.4.4.5  Application of sealing coats
Sealing coats shall be applied to clean dry
surfaces. Any oil, grease or other contaminants
shall be removed by thoroughly washing with
thinners
until
no
visible
traces
of
contamination exist and the surface shall be
allowed to dry for at least 15 minutes before
applying the coating. Sealing coats shall be
applied heavily enough to produce a wet
appearance and shall be applied in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. The
treatment shall be applied at the contractor’s
works as soon as practicable after spraying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Regions of damage where the coating has been
removed over an area, the maximum width of
which exceeds 6 mm, shall be reblasted and
resprayed, care being taken to avoid damaging
or loosening the bond in contiguous areas.
Minor areas of damage may be rectified by the
application of a suitable aluminium paint after
cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The finished appearance of sprayed chimneys
may not be uniform shading or texture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ANNEX
A
(  Foreword  and  Clauses  8.4.1  and  8.4.3 )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>WIND EXCITED OSCILLATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1 GENERAL
Chimneys are subject to oscillation due to wind
action. This annex explains the procedures to
include the effects of wind excited oscillations
as
enumerated
and
suggests
alternative
procedures for making an appropriate increase
in the design wind loading and indicates when
strengthening or the incorporation of devices
for suppressing von Karman type of oscillations
is advisable.
A-1.1  It has been found that chimneys of
circular cross section oscillate strongly across
wind than along wind. It is, therefore,
reasonable to continue with the current
practice which implies that along wind, the
oscillation will not cause stresses greater than
those calculated for the wind velocities as
specified in IS 875 (Part 3) : 1987 due to static
loading
along
with
dynamic
coefficient
proposed in this standard.
A-1.2  Lateral oscillation due to resonance
effects within the critical wind speed range at
the natural period of a cylindrical structure
may be great enough when its effect is added
vectorially to the down wind deflection, to cause
stresses higher than those calculated for the
short duration wind velocities in accordance
with this code due to static loading along with
the dynamic coefficient as specified in this
standard.
A-2 VON KARMAN VORTEX SHEDDING
The regular fluctuating side force due to
commonly known as Von Karman vortex
shedding, which may be produced in a smooth
air flow, will produce strong oscillation at a
velocity which gives resonance with the natural
frequency of the structure. This effect is
resisted by high damping and may be
prevented by helical strakes or other devices
attached to a circular chimney. If the tendency
is strong, it is not effectively withstood by
increase of strength alone.
A-2.1  In a natural wind, the regular vortex
shedding may be interfered with by fluctuation
of the wind so that the build-up of amplitude is
not continuous as in a wind tunnel, and it may
be more effectively resisted by mass and
stiffness. There are different views as to how
the vortex shedding should be allowed for in
practice but it is clear that low damping, low
mass and large flexibility must increase the
probability and the amount of the oscillation of
chimneys. In many cases, the behaviour cannot
be predicted with certainty.
A-2.2  Even in the worst cases, a chimney can
be made safe by applying guys or strakes at any<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>time after construction if experience shows
them to be required, and provided that the
chimney is made strong enough in the first
place to withstand the additional load from
guys or strakes applied later.
For instance, helical strakes of three rails
having a projection of 0.1 to 0.12 times the
diameter of the chimney, wound, equally
spaced, round the perimeter of the shell at a
pitch of about five times the diameter of the
chimney
for
not
less
than
the
upper
one-third of it.
A-3 STROUHAL CRITICAL VELOCITY
Severe Von Karman type oscillation is not
likely if the calculated velocity, known as ‘the
critical strouhal velocity’, is greater than the
maximum design velocity based on IS 875
(Part 3) : 1987. The strouhal critical velocity  V cr
in m/s for a circular chimney may be calculated
from the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V cr  = 5  D t  ×  f
. . . (1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where
f  = natural
frequency
of
the
chimney
(in Hz) as obtained in  8.3.1 , and
D t  = diameter of chimney at top (in m).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The formula for  V cr  holds good for strouhal
number of 0.2. This value remains fairly constant as
shown by experiments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-4 AERODYNAMIC FORCE
For checking of resonance amplitude, the
intensity of aerodynamic force  F i  (  z  ) at level  z ,
for the  i th mode of oscillation is determined by
the formula:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F i  (  z  ) =  C y q cr d z h z
i  (  z  )
. . . (2)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i  (  z  ) = relative ordinate at level  z  in the
i th mode oscillation;
C y q cr d z h z  = amplitude of force intensity at the
free end of the self-supporting
chimney or at the centre of the
span of guyed chimney and is equal
to  C y ,  q cr ,  d z ,  h z ;
C y  = coefficient of transverse force taken
equal to 0.25;
q cr  = speed

to
critical velocity  V cr  and is equal to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

type structures), only the first mode of
oscillation shall be considered.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>calculated from the height of the chimney and

<<HEADING level=3>>A-5  Inertia forces, amplitude of resonance
oscillations and dynamic bending moment at a
section under consideration of a chimney fixed
at foundation are determined by the following
formulae:<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-8  Checking for resonance is not required for
other short duration forces. The provisions for
checking resonance will not necessarily apply
to pairs, files and groups of chimneys or other
tall structure which may oscillate excessively
particularly
if
they
are
closer
than
approximately 12 diameters. The fitting of
stabilizers is usually beneficial but may not
always be effective. No simple rules can be
suggested. Study of the layout by specialists
and wind tunnel testing may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-9  Chimneys
which
have
a
high
diameter/thickness ratio may be subjected to
wind-generated ovalling oscillation due to
circumferentially
varying
and
fluctuating
pressure.
Besides
causing
circumferential
bending stresses, this can increase vertical
stresses in the lower part of a chimney of large
diameter. It should be avoided by providing
sufficient
circumferential
stiffness
around
chimney at the top. Chimneys having gross
plate thickness of less than 1/300 of the
diameter if not efficiently stiffened by a lining
or encasing, should have stiffened rings added
at the top (and lower down if the height is more
than 20 times the diameter). The distance
between the stiffening rings should be not more
than 1 500 times the thickness of the shell and
should be substantial enough to give a total
circumferential bending stiffness at least
equvalent to that of a uniform shell of thickness<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
