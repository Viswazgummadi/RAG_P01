<<HEADING level=3>>1. Scope
-
Prescribes iodide-iodate
titrimetric method for determination
of sulphite
in water and
wastewater.
This method is applicable to a minimum detectable concentration of 2 mg/l sulphite.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Theory
and Principle
- Acidified water sample containing sulphite reduces iodate to iodine. Any
excess of iodate added after all the sulphite is used up, oxidizes iodide to free iodine under acidic pH
condition.
Iodine oxidizes sulphite to sulphate.
Any excess iodine results in the formation of blue
colour in presence of starch indicator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3. Interferences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Interferences due to the presence of sulphides may be removed by the addition of zinc acetate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Copper ions rapidly accelerate the oxidation of sulphite ions.
Certain heavy metals may also react
n a similar manner as copper.
Proper sampling and immediate fixing by acid addition should minimise
such difficulties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Addition of sulphamic acid helps to eliminate interference due to nitrate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Sampling
and Storage<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 Highly polluted or contaminated
samples should be stored at low temperature,
allowing
as little
:ontact with air as possible.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.2 Since at pH 8’0 or above sulphite may be oxidised to sulphate, pH should, therefore be adjusted
)elow 8-O.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.3 Fix the sample (at about 50°C ) immediately
by adding 1 ml ETDA solution for each 100 ml of
rample.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>i. Reagents<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>i.1  Sulphuric
Acid<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i.2  Starch lndicafor
Solution  -Add
5’0 g starch to 800 ml boiling distilled water and stir.
Dilute to
)ne litre and boil for a few minutes and let settle overnight.
Use the clear supernatant
liquid.
Add a
ew drops of chloroform or salicylic acid ( 1.3 g/l  )  to preserve the indicator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i.3  Sfandard iodide-lodate
Solufion
( 0412 5 M ) -
Dissolve 0.445 8 g primary grade potassium iodate
dried for 4 h at 12O”C), 4.35 g of potassium iodide and 310 mg sodium bicarbonate in distilled
water
md dilute to 1 000 ml.
One millilitre of this solution is equivalent to 500 mg of sulphite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>i.4  Sulphamic
Acid -  Crystalline.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>i.5
EDTA Reagent -
Dissolve 2’5 g of disodium EDTA in 100 ml of distilled water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>i. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>i.1 Add 1 ml sulphuric acid and about 0.1 g of sulphamic acid crystals if lo a 250.ml long necked flask.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.2 Measure a suitable volume of ETDA stabilized sample ( 50 ml to 160 ml ) ( see 4.3 ) and transfer to
he flask keeping the tip of the pipette below the surface of liquid.
Add  1  ml of starch indicator
Lolution (see 5.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sulphites
may occur in natural
waters
or wastewaters
as a result of industrial
pollution
and in
Treatment
plant
effluents
dechlorinated
with
sulphur
dioxide.
Control
of sulphite
ion in wastewater
treatment
and discharge
may be important
environmentally,
mainly
because of its toxicity
to fish and
other
aquatic
life and its rapid
oxygen
demand.
The presence
of other oxidizable
materials,
such
as
aulphide,
thiosulphate,
Fe3- ions can apparently
give higher
readings
of sulphites.
Some metal ions
iike CLP may cataiyze the oxidation
of sulphite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
