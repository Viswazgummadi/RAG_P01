<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Environmental Protection Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Magnesium ranks eighth among the elements in order of abundance and is a common constituent
of natural water. Magnesium salts are important contributors to the hardness of water which
break down when heated, forming scale in boilers. The magnesium concentration may vary from
zero to several hundred milligrams. Chemical softening, reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, or ion
exchange reduces the magnesium and associated hardness to acceptable levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The technical committee responsible for formulation of IS 3025 and IS 2488 and its parts, decided
to revise all the parts covered under them and publish it in separate parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard supersedes  34  of IS 3025 : 1964 and  6  of IS 2488 (Part 5) : 1976. In the preparation
of this standard, considerable assistance has been derived from ‘Standard methods for the
examination of water and wastewater’ published by the American Public Health Association,
Washington, USA, 17th Edition, 1989.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation of this Indian Standard
is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.2 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (September 2000) and Amendment No. 2
(March 2003) . Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of the
amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final
value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2 : 1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Mix the sample pretreated if so required and
transfer a suitable volume (50 to 100 ml) to
250 ml conical flask or a beaker. Add 5 ml

<<PARAGRAPH>>possible (about 10 to 20 ml) before precipitation
or salting occurs. Add 5 ml concentrated nitric
acid cover with a watch glass and heat to obtain
a gentle refluxing action. Continue heating and
adding concentrated nitric acid as necessary
until digestion is complete as shown by a
light-coloured clear solution. Do not let sample
dry
during
digestion.
Add
1
to
2 ml
concentrated nitric acid and warm slightly to
dissolve any remaining residue. Wash down
beaker walls and watch glass with water and
then filter, if necessary. Transfer filtrate to
100 ml volumetric flask, with two 5-ml portions
of water adding these rinsings to the volumetric
flask. Cool, dilute to mark and mix thoroughly.
Take
portions
of
this
solution
for
the
determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 Precision and Accuracy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method is precise to ± 0.5 mg or better, and
the accuracy is comparable if interferences are
absent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 VOLUMETRIC METHOD USING EDTA<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When water sample containing both calcium
and magnesium is titrated with EDTA at  p H
10, using Eriochrome black-T as indicator,
which
estimates
values
of
calcium
and
magnesium. In a separate titration against
EDTA at  p H 12 to 13 range using murexide or
Patton and Reeder’s indicator, calcium is
selectively estimated. From these two values
magnesium content may be calculated. Below
1 mg/l concentration it is desirable to use
atomic absorption spectrophotometric method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.2   Removal of Calcium and Other Metals as
Oxalates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To 200 ml of the sample pretreated if so
required containing about 50 mg of calcium,
add a few drops of methyl red indicator and
1 : 1 hydrochloric acid. Sufficient acid must be
present in the solution
to prevent the
precipitation
of
calcium
oxalate
when
ammonium oxalate solution is added. Introduce
50 ml of ammonium oxalate solution and 15 g
of urea. Boil the solution gently until the
methyl red changes its colour to yellow. Filter
the precipitate and wash with small volume of
cold water until free from chloride.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Interference<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some metal ions form complexes with EDTA
and interfere in the process of determination of
calcium and magnesium by EDTA method by
causing fading or indistinct end points. This
interference is reduced by addition of certain
inhibitors to the water samples prior to
titration with EDTA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.3   Determination of Magnesium<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To the combined filtrate and washings from
5.5.2
containing
not
more
than
60 mg
magnesium add 50 ml of concentrated nitric
acid and evaporate carefully to dryness on a hot
plate. Do not let reaction become too violent
during the later part of the evaporation stay in
constant attendance to avoid losses through
spattering. Moisten residue with 2 to 3 ml of
concentrated hydrochloric acid, add 20 ml of
distilled water, warm, filter and wash. To the
filtrate add 3 ml of concentrated hydrochloric
acid 2 to 3 drops of methyl red solution, and
10 ml of (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4  solution. Cool and add
concentrated ammonium hydroxide drop by
drop, stirring constantly until the colour
changes to yellow, stir for 5 minutes add again
5 ml of concentrated ammonium hydroxide and
stir vigorously for 10 minutes more. Let it
stand overnight and filter through filter paper.
Wash
with
1 : 19
ammonium
hydroxide.
Transfer to an ignited, cooled and weighed
crucible. Dry precipitate thoroughly and burn
paper off slowly, allowing circulation of air.
Heat at about 500°C until residue is white.
Ignite for 30 minutes at 1 100°C to constant
mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1   Indicator Solutions
6.4.1.1  Patton
and
Reeder
and
indicator
solution
This indicator solution permits the direct
titration of calcium in the presence of
magnesium. It produces a sharp colour change
from wine red to pure blue at the end point. It
is prepared by mixing 1 g of Patton and Reeder
reagent
with
100 g
of
sodium
chloride/
potassium chloride.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.1.2  Murexide
(  ammonium

indicator solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This indicator changes from pink to purple at
the end point. An indicator solution can be
prepared by dissolving 150 mg of the dye in
100 g of absolute ethylene glycol. Water
solutions of the dye are not stable for longer
than a day. A ground mixture of the dye powder<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.5  Triethanolamine Solution  — 10 percent
(m/v).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and sodium chloride provides a stable form of
the indicator. It is prepared by mixing 200 mg
of murexide with 100 g of solid sodium chloride
and grinding the mixture to 355 to 300 microns.
The tiration should be performed immediately
after the addition of the indicator because it is
unstable under alkaline conditions. End point
recognition is facilitated by the preparation of
colour comparison blank containing 2.0 ml of
sodium hydroxide solution, 0.2 g of solid
indicator mixture (or 1 to 2 drops if a solution is
used) and sufficient standard EDTA titrant
(0.05 to 0.10 ml) to produce an unchanging
colour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.6   Potassium Cyanide Solution  — 10 percent
(m/v).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE — Preserve in a polyethylene bottle.

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.8   Inhibitor and Complexing Agents  — For
most waters there is no need to utilize an
inhibitor or complexing agent like, Magnesium
salt of 1, 2- cyclohexane diamine tetra acetic
acid (MgCDTA). Occasionally water containing
interfering ions other than Ca ++  and Mg ++<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>requires adding an appropriate inhibitor or
complexing agents to give a clear, sharp change
in colour to the end point. Avoid the use of
sodium cyanide inhibitor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Dissolve 0.653 8 g of pure zinc dust or granules
of 99.9 percent purity in 20 ml of approximately
1 : 1 hydrochloric acid, warm if necessary. Cool
and make up to 1 litre exactly in a volumetric
flask. Preserve this solution in a tightly closed
glass bottle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6.1   Sample Preparation
Because of the high  p H used in this procedure,
the titration should be performed immediately
after the addition of the alkali and indicator.
Use 50 ml of sample or a smaller portion
diluted to 50 ml so that the calcium content is
about 5 to 10 mg. Analyse hard waters with
alkalinity higher than 300 mg/l CaCO 3  by
taking a smaller aliquot and diluting to 50 ml,
or by neutralization of the alkalinity with acid,
boiling for one minute and cooling before
beginning the titration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.3   Buffer Solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Dissolve 70 g of ammonium chloride and
570 ml of 30 percent ammonia solution
(relative density 0.88 to 0.90) in water and
make up to 1 litre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Sodium hydroxide 1 N — Dissolve 40 g of
sodium hydroxide and dilute to 1 litre
with distilled water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6.2  Add 2.0 ml of sodium hydroxide solution
or a volume sufficient to produce a  p H of 12 to
13. Stir. Add 0.1 to 0.2 g of the indicator
murexide-sodium chloride mixture selected (or
1 to 2 drops if a solution is used). Alternatively,
approximately 1 g of the mixture of Patton and
Reeder
reagent
and
sodium
chloride
or
potassium chloride may be used. Add EDTA
titrant slowly with continuous stirring to the
proper end point. Check the end point by
adding 1 to 2 drops of titrant in excess to make
certain that no further colour change occurs.
Let the volume used be  V 1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.4  Standard Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic
Acid  (  EDTA  )  Solution  — 0.001 M.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dissolve 3.75 g of disodium ethylene diamine
tetra-acetate dihydrate in water and make up
to 1 litre in a volumetric flask. Standardize this
with standard zinc solution. Pipette out 25 ml
of standard zinc solution in a 250 ml conical
flask. Adjust the  p H to approximately 10 with
buffer solution. Dilute to about 100 ml and add
3 to 4 drops of EBT indicator solution. This will
give a red colour. Titrate with 0.01 M of EDTA
solution to a clear blue end point free from
violet tinge. This solution will be slightly
stronger than 0.01 M. Dilute the solution to
exactly 0.01 M by adding calculated amount of
water and recheck the strength by titrating
25 ml of standard zinc solution by exactly the
same manner as given above. This should
consume exactly 25.0 ml of standard EDTA
solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6.3   Determination of Magnesium
Take a suitable aliquot of the solution, expected
to contain approximately 10 to 30 mg of calcium

10 ml of hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution,
2 ml of potassium cyanide solution and 25 ml of
triethanolamine solution. Dilute to 150 to
200 ml and add sufficient quantity of buffer
solution to bring the  p H to 10.0 ± 0.1. Add 3 to 4
drops of EBT indicator solution and titrate with<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

been added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.3   Cesium Chloride  — 20 g/l of Cs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — If magnesium is not present, it should be
added as 1 : 1 magnesium EDTA complex, in order to
get the proper colour change at the end point. This can
be done by either adding 1 ml of 0.1 magnesium EDTA
(1 : 1) complex before proceeding for titration, or,
incorporating small amount of Mg 2   +   ions in EDTA
solution before its standardization.
