FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 5 June
1979, after the draft finalized by the Soil Engineer-
ing and Rock Mechanics
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the
Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A series of Indian Standards
on methods of test for soils has already
been published
by ISI.
It has been recognized
that reliable
and inter
comparable
test results can be obtained only with standard testing equip-
ment capable
of giving the desired level
of accuracy.
The
Sectional
Committee
has,
therefore,
decided
to bring out a series of standards
covering the requirements
of equipment
used for testing soils, to encour-
age its development
and manufacture
in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The equipment
covered in this standard is used for the determination
of water content dry density relation of soil covered
in IS  :  2720
( Part
VII
)-1974*
and IS  :  2720 ( Part VIII
)-1974t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the
purpose of decideing
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
cff
in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960:.
The number of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the requirements
of compaction

The equipment
may
also be marked
with the ISI
Certification
Mark.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The use of the IS1 Certification
Mark is governed
by the provisions of
the Indian
Standards
Institution
( Certification
Marks ) Act and the Rules and
Regulations
made
thereunder.
The IS1 Mark on products covered
by an Indian
Standard conveys the assurance
that they have been produced
to comply with the
requirements of that standard under a well-defined system of inspection, testing and
quality
control
which is devised and supervised
by IS1
and
operated
by
the
producer.
IS1 marked products are also continuously checked by IS1 for conformity
to that standard as a further safeguard.
Details of conditions under which a licence
for the use of the IS1 Certification
Mark
may
be granted
to manufacturers
or
processors, may be obtained from the Indian Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
