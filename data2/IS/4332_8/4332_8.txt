FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(Part
VIII)
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 10 June
1969, after the draft finalized
by the Soil
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engi-
neering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Soil stabilization,
in the broadest
sense, is the alteration
of any inherent
property
of a soil to improve
engineering
performance.
The classification
of the methods
of stabilization
is based
on the treatment
given
to the soil
(  for example,
dewatering,
compaction,
etc  ),  process involved
(for example,
thermal,
electrical,
etc), and on additives
employed
(for example,
asphalt,
cement,
lime,
etc).
The
choice
of a particular
method
depends
on the
characteristics
of the problem
on hand.
For studying
the effectiveness
of a
stabilization
technique
under
investigation,
both in the laboratory
and the
field certain
standard
methods
of test are required
and
these
are being
published
in parts.
This part [IS:4332
(Part
VIII)-19691
lays down
the
method
for the determination
of lime content
of lime stabilized
soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in
different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in
this country.
This has been met by basing
the standard
on BS 1924: 1967
‘Methods
of test
for stabilized
soils’
issued
by the British
Standards
Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>’ 0.4 In reporting
the results
of a test or analysis
made
in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS:2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
(Part
VIII)
covers the determination
of the proportion
by weight of the lime present
in a lime stabilized
soil.
It is done by com-
paring
the combined
calcium
and
magnesium
contents
of the stabilized<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:4332(PWtVIII,-1368<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>soil with those of the natural soil and lime and it  is  essential that samples
of these should all be available.
The method is not applicable to soils
containing a large or variable amount of calcium or magnesium salts or to
soils which also contain cement, and in such cases it may not be possible
to determine the lime content by chemical means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 The  bulk sample
may, if desired,
be roughly
broken
up and, in order
to facilitate
further
breaking,
shall be dried either
in air or in the oven at
105-l 10°C and cooled.
It shall then be broken
down by crushing
or other
similar  means
until the whole sample
passes
the appropriate
sieve.
The
fine-grained
materials
shall pass a 2-mm
IS
Sieve,
the
medium-~grained
materials
shall
pass a 6.3-mm
IS Sieve
and the coarse-graincd
materials
shall
p:tss a
12*5-mm
IS
Sieve.
Throughout
these
and all subsequent
operations
it is essential
that there is no loss of fines of any material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The
material
treated
as in 5.1 s!)all then be divided
by successive
rim-
ing on  the appropriate
sample divider to produce
a representative

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1
Throughout
this
and
any
subsequent
operations,
the
material
available
fdr any division
shall be thoroughly
mixed
and all precautions
taken to avoid segregation
during riming.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 The
representative
sample obtained
as in  5.2  shall then be ovendried
at
105-l 10°C
for
not
less
than
16 hours,
and
cooled,
preferably
in a
.desiccator.
The ovendried
material
shall be pulverized,
using  a  mechani-
cal pulverizer
or any other suitable
means,
so that the whole of the sample
passes 425-micron
IS Sieve.
The ovendried
pulverized
material shall then
be sub-divided
by riffling on a sample divider having a width ofopcuing
of
6 mm until a sample weighing
approximate!y
5 g for fine-grained
soils, 25 g
for
medium-grained
soils
and
50 g for coarse-grained
soils is obtained
(in
the case of the medium-and
coarse-grained
soil samples,
riflling
may
more conveniently
be done on the larger sample dividers
but when the size
of sample has been reduced
to 250 g the sample
divider having  a  width of
opening
of 6 mm shall be used).
This sample shall be placed
in the glass
weighing
bottle
and dried at 105-110°C.
The
period required
for drying
may vary with the type of soil and size of sample.
The sample shall be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Analysis
of the Prepared
SoiI and Soil-lime
Samples<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  For soils of low sesquioxide
content,
where effects of co-precipitation
of calcium
can be ignored (see Note),
the procedure
given in 6.1.1.1(a)
to (d)
shall be followed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>XOTE-Two
procedures are  given for extracting
the lime from the stabilized soil.
Hydrochhbric acid is the more effective extractant
but with soils of high sesquioxide
content
it also removes the sesquioxides which may cause interference with the deter-
mination of the calcium.
Ammonium chloride solution extracts the lime but does not
remove
the sesquioxrde and is, therefore, to be preferred with soils of hig.h srsquioxide
content, even though it may take 15 minutes or longer to extract
the hme from the
sample compared
with the 2-3 minutes that hydrochloric
acid takes.
In general,
ammonium chloride should he used in cases where a soil containing
no calcium and a
high proportion
of iron or aiuminium
has been stabilized with a low proportion
of
lime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

except that 10 ml of 50 percent hydrochloric
acid and 25 ml of distilled
water shall be used for the digestion
and  a 2.5 ml aliquot
portion
of the 2.50 ml solution
retained
for
analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2  For
soils of high sesquioxide
content
where
co-precipitation
of
calcium
occurs, the procedure given in 6.1.1.1 (a) to (d) shall be followed
except that a 20 percent solution of ammonium
chloride shall be used in
the place of 50 percent hydrochloric
acid as the extractant.
The soil-lime
mistures,
the soils and the lime samples shall be boiled with the appro-
priate quantity
ofammonium
chloride
solution until no further evolution
of
ammonia
occurs.
This may be checked
by holding a moistened
red litmus
paper over the mouth
of the beaker;
the paper will turn blue if ammonia
is still being evolved.
Care shall be taken during
boiling to ensure that
the solution
is not boiled dry, and if necessary
additional
water
shall be
added
to prevent
this occurring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Analysis
of the Acid or Ammonium
ChIoride
Extracts
-A
small
piece of red litmus paper shall be dropped
into each volumetric
flask and
dilute ammonia
solution
shall be added
(preferably
from a burette)
until
the
litmus
changes
from
red
to blue
(this
may
not. be necessary
if
ammonium
chloride
was used as the extractant).
After the addition
of
the ammonia
solution
the volume
of the suspension
shall be adjusted
to
exactly 250 ml with distilled water and the contents of the flask thoroughly
mixed by shaking.
The flask shall then be set aside until the precipitate
has settled to the bottom.
When the precipitate
has settled, 50 ml of the
clear supernatant liquid shall be removed by means of a pipette, and placed
in a 250-ml conical flask or beaker.
Add 2 ml of the buffer solution and
3 or 4 drops of the indicator.
The EDTA
solution shall then be added<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

colourless and then to pale green (metalphthalein
indicator)
or from pink
to blue ( eriochrome
indicator)
(see  Note).
The
volume
of EDTA
required shall be noted to the nearest 0.05 ml ( Y).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The coiour change of the metalphthalein indicator is from purple to grey or
colourless and then to green.
The end point is best observed in artificial light.
It ir
advisable to carry out practice
titrations in order to obtain experience
of the colour
change at the end-point.
If eriochrome is used the colour change is from pink to blue;
the actual end-point occurs when all traces of pink colour have disappeared when the
solution is viewed in artificial light.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>KOTE
-
A sail-lime
mixture may, on exposure to air, increax
in weight due
to the carbonation
of the lime present.
To  allow for this weight increase in
calculating
the lime content of a mixture
which has carbonated,
it is necessary
to know the calcium
and carbonate
contents of the natural soil, the soil-lie
mixture and the lime.
In addition,
if appreciable
amounts
of magnesium
are
present
in either
the soil or the lime, it is also necessary
to know
the magneai-
urn contents
of the natural
soil,
the soil-lime
mixture
and the lime.
Since,
however,
the error
involved
in ignoring
the weight
increase
due to the carbo-
nation
is in most cases quite
small,
the lime content
for carbonated
soil-lime
mixtures
is usually
calculated
in the manner
described
in 7.1 for uncarbonated
samples.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
