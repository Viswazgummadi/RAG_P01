<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety in Construction
Sectional
Committee,
CED 45<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by
the Safety
in Construction
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A large number of workmen,
skilled and unskilled, are employed in numerous construction
works,
big and small, under execution
in the country.
Due to the increased
tempo of such works
and
large scale mechanization,
hazards of accidents
have increased
considerably.
It has, therefore,
become imperative
that adequate
safety rules are laid down for every phase of work,
and that
these are meticulously
followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety aspects in some of the constructions
may assume such a great
importance
that
instead
of merely deputing
supervisory
staff in adequate
strength
to look
after
the safety
aspects,
it
may become desirable
to have a separate organization
to control
this important
aspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain protective
barriers in and around buildings are required
specially during
demolition
of
buildings and foundation
work for the safety
of workers
and
the
public
in general.
It has,
therefore,
been felt necessary to lay down
the sefety
precautions
required
to be taken
for
protective
barriers in and around
buildings with a view to minimizing
the risk of
accidents
and injuries and accordingly
this standard
has been brought
out.
It does
not cover
special
type of
protective
barriers
like
safety
nets,
protective
coverings
necessitating
separate
scaffolding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
