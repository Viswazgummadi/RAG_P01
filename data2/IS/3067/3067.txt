0.5 This standard
is one of a series of Indian
Standards on water-proofing
and damp-proofing
of buildings.

in the series are:
IS :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was
adopted by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on
22 March 1988, after the draft finalized by the
Water-Proofing
and
Damp-Proofing
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Different types of damp-proofing
and water-
proofing
materials
are
used
in
the
building
industry.
In order
to obtain satisfactory
per-
formance, it is essential that prior to the applica-
tion
of these materials
for the damp-proofing
and water-proofing
treatment,
special care has
to be taken to the design details
and carefully
preparing
the building surface for receiving the
treatment
as recommended
in this standard. This
standard
provides guidance for the preparation
of building’s
surfaces
for damp-proofing
and
water-proofing
treatment.
This
standard
is,
therefore,
an essential adjunct to the standards on
damp-proofing
and water-proofing
of buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard
was first published
in 1966.
The present
revision
was done on the basis of
experience gained over the years on this subject.
In this revision,
instead of giving requirements
of size of rain water pipe for every 40 m2 of roof
area, Table 3 of IS  :  2527-1984* which gives the
required
sizes of pipes depending upon the rain-
fall
intensities for areas
ranging
from
3.3 to
85.4 m*, has been referred
to in 3.2.
A new
clause,
illustrated
with the help of a sketch on
damp-proofness
in basement walls of residential
buildings, has also been added ( see 6.1.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

cular requirement
of this standard is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall
be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2- 1960*.
The number
of significant places retained in the
rounded
off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

IN RELATION
TO
SUBSOIL
DRAINAGE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The following po&ts shall be taken into con-
sideration
for effective
site and
underground
drainage:
a)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Efficient
drainage
of the site shall be
carried
out during the entire
period of
laying the damp-proofing
treatment.
An
adequate dewatering arrangement
shall be
made for pumping
out subsoil water to
keep the water level below the level of
work in progress
( see Fig. 1, 2 and 3 ).
In particular
situations
where
the space
available is limited, alternative
dewatering
arrangement
for pumping
subsoil water
and shoring
of the excavation
shall be
made ( see Fig. 4 ).
For
existing structures,
internal
tanking
for damp-proofing
has
perforce
to be
applied.
This damp-proofing
work
has
to be taken
up during the season
when
water is not there
in the basement.
If
there
is standing
water in the basement,
it
should be drained
out
and
damp-
proofing work started. If, in spite ofdraining
out the water, percolation of subsoil water
continues, dewatering by well-point system
may be adhered to. Where it is not possi-
ble
to
employ
well-point
system
for
dewatering
and the
pressure
of
water
during the dry season is negligible, it is
possible to carry out the work by making
a pump in the floor and pumping the
water
out.
In
this
case, the damp-
proofing
treatment
shall
be carried
out<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  In preparing
a time schedule for the work
involved
in the construction
of basement
and
damp-proofing
treatment,
each operation
shall
be considered
in relation to the other, due con-
sideration
being
given to economical
use of
pumps and other equipment by the general con-
tractor
and the damp-proofing
contractor.
The
time schedule shall include the following so as to
avoid interference
