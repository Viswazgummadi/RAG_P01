FOR
MASTIC CEMENT FOR BEDDING OF
METAL WINDOWS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 30 July 1966, after the draft finalized by the Paints and Allied Products
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Chemical Division Council.
0.2 Mastic cement is used for bedding one metal window into another; for
bedding metal windows into wooden frames; or for bedding metal frames
into masonry or concrete.
An Indian Standard
specification
stipulating
the minimum quality requirements
of this material, it was felt, would help
in the proper development
of this product.
Mastic cement is required to
ensure satisfactory adhesion to wood, masonry, concrete and metal.
Apart
from this, it is expected
to be suitable for taking paint without lifting,
bleeding or cracking.
The setting and keeping properties of the material
*
are also important.
0.3 The Sectional
Committee
felt the need to prescribe tests for flexibility
and its retention in this standard.
However, in the absence of any standard-
ized procedure
for the same,
it was decided
that
these tests may be
considered for inclusion when complete details are available.
0.4 This standard is one of the series of Indian
Standard
specifications
on
fillers, stoppers and putties.
Other
specifications
printed
so far in the
series are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-19607.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
,value should be the same as that of thespecified
value in this standard,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
