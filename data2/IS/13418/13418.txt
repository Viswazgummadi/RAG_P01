<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
by the Cost
Analysis
and
Cost
Estimates
Sectional
Committee
had
River
Valley
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>after

<<PARAGRAPH>>Grouting
is the process
of injecting
mixtures
of cement
slurry
or
other
^
.
~..
. . .
_
_
suitable
materials
into
connned
and inaccessible
spaces
( cracks
and crevices
) so that the whole
formation
may
act as
a monolithic
mass to
withstand
the
high pressures
and
loads to
which
it
may be
subjected.
During
construction
proper
grouting
can
contr-ol
ground
water
flow,
prevent
loose
sand
densification
below
adjacent
structures
due to pile
driving
and
increase
stability
of granular
soil below existing
structures
so as to reduce
the
need
for
lateral
support.
After
construction
grouting
is
done
for underpinning,
reducing
machine
foundation
vibrations
and
elimination
of seepage
through
openings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grout
materials
include
cement
and
sand,
clay-cement,
slag-cement,
resin
gypsum-cement,
clays,
asphalt,
pulmen
seal  j  fuel ash and a large number
of colloidal
and low viscosity
chemicals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grouting
is extensively
used
in
construction
of
river
valley
projects.
As
such
projects
are
being
executed
all
over
the
country,
it
is
essential
that
practices
relating
to
estimation
of grouting
cost are harmonized
and
uniform.
To this end,
this
standard
lays
down
a proforma
for working
out cost analysis
of unit
rate
for
grouting.
This
standard
is one
of a
series of standards
already
published
which
lay down proforma
for analysis
of rates
of concrete,
masonry,
cyclic
drilling
and
blasting,
earthwork,
shuttering/formwork,
rock
excavation
and
embankment
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1  SCOPE
General’ is a necessary adjunct to this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
lays down proforma
intended
for analysis of unit rate of grouting
per kg of
grout when cement based
grout
with additives
wherever required,
is used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 PROFORMA<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The rate of grouting
will involve two com-
ponents,
that is, drilling rate per metre of hole
and grouting
rate per kg of
cement.
The
prcformas
are
therefore
given
in Tables
1
and 2. For evaluating
unit rate of construction
equipment
references
