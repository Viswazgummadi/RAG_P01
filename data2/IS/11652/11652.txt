<<PARAGRAPH>>Textile  Materials Made from Polyolefins (Excluding Cordage) Sectional Committee, TX 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by Textile Materials Made from Polyolefins (Excluding Cordage) Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Textile Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1986and subsequently revised in 1992 to amalgamate IS 11653 ‘Polypropylene
(PP) woven sacks for packing cement’ as the requirements for both were similar. In addition, the requirements for
non-gusseted sacks had been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This revision
of the standard
has been taken up to incorporate the changes suggested by National Council for
Cement and  Building
Materials  (NCCBM) after extensive laboratory testing of samples of HDPE/PP woven sacks
for packing
cement  and also the views of various users. Mainly the following requirements have been modified:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Requirements of, ends, picks, mass of fabric, and breaking load of fabric as well as top and bottom seam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Requirements for elongation at break of the fabric and mass of sack has been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The method for sampling and criteria for conformity has been simplified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960’
Rules for.rounding off numerical values (revised)’. The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be &hesame as that of the specified value in the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard prescribes
the requirements
of high

(PP)
woven
sacks  for packing cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fabric used in the manufacture of HDPE/PP woven
sacks for packing cement shall be woven from high
density polyethylene tapes/polypropylene
tapes. The
width of tapes used for making fabric shall be 2.5 mm,
Min (see  IS 6192 or IS 11197).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The following Indian Standards contain provisions
which through
reference
in this text, constitute
provision of this standard. At the time of publications,
the edition indicated were valid. All standards are
subject to revision and parties to agreements based on
this standard are encouraged to investigate the possi-
bility of applying
the most recent editions of the
standards indicated below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Sack<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sack shall be produced from fabric woven as a
tube and cut to the required length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1  Tubular Woven<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sack tube is woven on circular loom. Alternatively,
the sack tube may be woven on a flat bed loom which
effectively weaves two layers of fabrics. The weft is
passed  via  the shuttle through each layer in such a
way that it forms a tube in which the weft is continuous
around the tube so formed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The stitching shall be done only at the bottom and at
the mouth of the sack excluding valve. The stitching
shall be done with either one row or two rows of chain
stitches (see IS 10789/1S049 15). In case of two rows
of stitches, the same shall be separated from each other
by minimum 5 mm and the outer row of the stitching/
single row stitching shall be minimum 8 mm from
the outer edge of the sack. The stitching shall be done
with a fold over seam to a depth of minimum 25 mm
so that the stitches pass through minimum four layers
of the fabric. The number of stitches per dm shall be
14* 2. The stitching shall be done by rayon, nylon
or any’other suitable thread having breaking load not
less than 75 N.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
