FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part III ) ( First Revision
)  was adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 22 December
1976, after the draft
finalized
by the Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Among
the
field
sounding
tests
the
static
cone test is a valuable
method
of recording
variation
in the in  situ  penetration
resistance
of soils,
in cases where
the  in situ  density
is disturbed
by boring
operations,
thus
making
the standard
penetration
test unreliable
especially
under
water.
The iesults
of the test are also useful in determining
the bearing
capacity
of the
soil at various
depths
below
the ground
level.
In addition
to
bearing
capacity
values
it is also possible
to determine
by this test the
skin friction
values
used for the determination
of the required
lengths
of
piles in a given situation.
Thestatic
cone teq
is most successful
in soft
or loose soils
like silty
sands,
loose
sands,
layered
deposits
of sands,
silts and clays as well as in clayey
deposits.
0.2.1 Experience
indicates
that a complete
static cone penetration
test
up to depths
of 15 to 20 m can
be completed
in a day
with
manual
operations
of the equipment,
making
it one of the inexpensive
and
.fast
methods
of sounding
available
for investigation;
in fact, in Europe
it is
invariably
used for exploratory
stage
of investigations
when
both time
and
money
are at a premium..
In
areas
where
some
information
regarding
the foundation
strata
is already
available,
the use of test piles
and
loading
tests -thereof
can
be avoided
by
conduct_ing
static
cone
penetration
tests.
0.3 This standard
was first published
in 1971.
In this revision
several
changes
have  been made taking
into consideration
the experience
gained
in conducting
the test and in the manufacture
of the equipment.
The
essential
requirements
of the friction
jacket
have
been added;
tolerances
have been indicated
for the essential
requirements;
a rate of travel
has
been specified
for the engine
driven
equipment.
Opportunity
has also
been taken to give the requirements
and example
in SI units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

In  the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practice
in the
field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In reporting
the result
of a test or analysis
made
in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, if shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  Z-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The
driving
mechanism
should
have
a
capacity
of 2 to 3 tonnes
for the manually
operated
equipment
and
10 tonnes
for
the
mechanically
operated
equipment.
The
driving
mechanism
essentially
consists of a rack and pinion arrangement
operated
by a winch.
The reaction for the thrust may be obtained by suitable devices
capable of taking loads greater
than the capacity
of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.1 The
hand-operated
winch
may
be provided

be equipped
for two
speeds controlled
by 2 gears. The gear should be capable of being operated
in slow

of the cone-
friction
jacket assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7 Other Requirements
of the Equipment -
The equipment
shall
be so desiered
as to allow
for pushing
into
the ground
the cone
alone,
and the friction
jacket
fitted immediately
above
the cone
and
the cone
together,
alternatively,
through
depths
of a minimum
of 35 mm each,
each time.
Provision
shall also be made to enable
the entire
assembly
to
be advanced
together
continuously
if skin
friction
readings
are
not
required
to be determined
separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. PROCEDURE
3.1  Basically
the
test
procedure
for determining
the
static
cone
and
frictional
resistances
conksts  of pushing
the cone
alone
through
the soil
strata
to be tested,
then the cone and the friction
jacket,
and
finally
the
entire
assembly
in sequence
and
noting
the respective
resistance
in the
first two cases.
The
cone
is pushed
through
a distance
in accordance
with the design
of the equipment
( see 2.7 ) and
the
need
for the  sub-
strata and the cone resistance
noted. Thereafter,
the cone and the friction
jacket
are pushed
together
for a distance
depending
upon
the design
of
the cone and friction
jacket
assembly
and
the combined
value
of cone
and friction
resistance
noted. This procedure
is repeated
at predetermined
intervals.
The set up for the test is illustrated
in Fig. 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The equipment
shall be securely
anchored
to the ground
at the test
pcint  for obtaining
the required
reaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1
The rack of the driving
mechanism
shall
be brought
to the top
most position.
The cone-friction
jacket
assembly
shall
be connected
to
the
first
sounding
rod
and
the mantle
tube.
This
assembly
shall
be
positioned
over the test point
through
the mantle
tube
guide
a,nd held
vertically.
The plunger
of the driving
mechanism
shall be brought
down
so  as to  rest against
the protruding
sounding
rod.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2 For obtaining
the cone
resistance,
the sounding
rod only
shall
be pushed.
Switching
the gear
clutch
to the
slow
position,
the
drive
handle
shall be operated
at a steady
rate
of 1 cm/s
approximately
( see
Note ) so as to advance
the cone only to a depth
which
is possible
with
the cone
assembly
available
( see 2.7 ). During
this
pushing,
the mean
va;ue
of the resistance
as indicated
by the Bourdon
gauges shall be noted
ignoring
erratic
changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>bi0TE
-
In order to standardize
the test  procedure a rate of 1 cm/s has been  speci-
fied.
Tests  conduct-d at slower rates ( &5 cm/s and  l/3 cm/s ) have shown that in
the -se
of  both cohesive and non-cohesive  soils  the effect  of the time-rate of  pcnrtra-
tion on the cone resistance
was not appreciable
within
the limits
of these rates.
Tests
conducted
at faster rates ( 2 cm/s and 3 cm/s ) have shown the following
c&cts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For *:ohcsive soils with cone resistance
of above
I 000 k;W/ms ( 10 kgf/cm*
)
the effects of these rates were not  significant;
b)
For cohesive
soils with cone resistance
of 400 kX/m*
( 4 kgf/cm* ) and lower,
the values
decreased
appreciably
with increase
in the rate
of penetration;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c)
For non-cohesive
soils with cone resistance
varying
from 1500 to 8 000 kN/m*
( 15 to 80 kgf/cm*
), the cone resistance
increased
by about 20 percent.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
The procedure
givt:n
in
3.2.2  and
3.2.3  should
be repeated
after
pushing
the colnbined
cone-friction
jacket
and
mantle
tube
assembly
to
the
next
depth
at whic!l
the cone
and
friction
resistance
values
are
required.
Extension
sounding
rods
and mantle
tubes
should
be added
:rfter;rvr:ry
one metre
of pushing
as the test proceeds.
Alternatively,
the
resistances
may be determined
continuously,
if so. desired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  i\fter
reaching
the rleepest
point
of investigation
the entire
assembly
shollld
be extracted

<<HEADING level=3>>4.  RECORDS
AND CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The results
of the test shall
be tabulated
suitably.
A recommended
pro forma
for this purpose
with an example
is given in Appendix
A. The
results
should
also be presented
graphically
in twn graphs,
one showing
~  the cone resistance
in kN/m2
( kgf,‘cm? ) with
depth
in metres
and the
other
showing
friction
resistance
in
kN/m’
( kgf/cm2 } with
depth
in
metres
together
with a bore hole log.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The cone resistance
shall
be corrected
for the dead
weight
of the
cone and sounding
rods in use. The combined
cone and friction
resistance
shall be corrected
for the dead weight
of the
cone,
friction
jacket
and
sounding
rods. These values shali also be corrected
for the ratio of ram
area
to the
base
area of the cone
as
illustrated
in
the
example
in
Appendix
A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. LIMITATIONS
OF THE TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The test is unsuitable
for gravelly
soils 3nd
for so;ls with
standard
penetration
value JV ( determined
in accordance
with
IS  :  2131-1963*
‘1
greater
than 50.  Also  in dense sands the anchorage
becomes
too cumber-
some and expensive
and
for such
cases dynamic
cone
penetration
tests
[ see IS : 4968 ( Part I )-1976t
and
IS : 4968 ( Part II )- 1976S]
may
be
carried
out.
The test is also unsuitable
for made-up
or filled-up
earth
since erroneous
values
may
be obtained
due
to the
presence
of loose
stones,
brick bats, etc.
In such
places
either
the made-up
soil shall
he
completely
removed
to expose
the virgin
soil iayer,
or readings
in the
filled-up
depth
shall
be ignored.
