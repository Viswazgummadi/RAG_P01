<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Cost Analysis
and Cost Estimates
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the River
Valley
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shotcreting
and guniting
are versatile
construction
techniques
proven
for several
decades.
They
are
used
without
shuttering
for
horizontal,
vertical
and
overhead
surfaces
of
free
shape.
Shotcreting
and guniting
are two of the elements
of modern
underground
excavation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shotcreting
and
guniting
are extensively
used
in river valley
projects
and as such it is essen-
tial that practices
relating
to their
cost estimation
are harmonious
and uniform.
This
standard
lays down a proforma
for working
out analysis
of unit rate of guniting/shotcreting.
This standard
is one
of a series
of standards
already
published
which
lay
down
proformae
for
analysis
of
unit rate
of concrete,
masonry,
cyclic
drilling
and
blasting,
earthwork,
shuttering/formwork,
rock excavation
and embankment
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
