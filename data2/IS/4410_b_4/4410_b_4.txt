FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This  Indian Standard (Part XI/Set
4) was adopted by the Indian
St~dards
Institution on 7 April 1973, after the draft finalized by the
Terminology
Relating to River Valley, Projects Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number of Indian Standards have already been printed covering
various aspects of river valiey projects and a large number of standards
are in the process of formulation.
These standards include technical terms,
the precise definitions of which are required to avoid ambiguity in their
interpretation.
To
achieve
this end, the Institution
is bringing
out
‘ IS :  4410 Glossary of terms relating to river valley projects  ’  which is being
published in parts.
The other parts of this standard  SO  far’published
are
given on fourth cover page.
8.3 Part XI covers the important field of hydrology
which is a separate
science by itselE
In view of the vastness of this subject, it is proposed to
cover the subject in different sections. Other sections will be the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Section 1
General terms<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Section 2

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.
This has been met by deriving assistance from the follow-
ing publications:

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
( Part XI/See 4) covers the definitions of terms relating
to hydrographs in hydrology.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  HYDROGRAPHS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Base Flow* -  The sustained or dry weather flow of streams resulting
from the outflow of permanent
or perched
ground water, and from the
draining of large lakes and swamps.
Also water from glaciers, snow and
all other possible sources not resulting from direct runoff.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Composite
Unit Graph*  -A
tabular
presentation
of unit hydro-
graph for the important
sub-divisions
of a large area,
with the times of
beginning of rise appropriately
lagged by the times of travel from the out-
lets of the sub-areas to the major gauge station.
The runoff is computed
independently
for each area multiplied
by unit graph ordinates for that
area.
The sum of all flows thus computed in a vertical
column gives the
flow to be expected at the outlet of the basin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Compound
Hydrograph - The  hydrograph
of an
intermittent
storm when the flow on account of one sub-storm continues during the next
substorm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  Depletion Hydrograph  -The
recession,
after the flow created by
direct runoff has ceased, is ground water depletion curve.
A normal or
master ground
water depletion curve is the mean of a number
of such
curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5  Design FIood Hydrograph* -
The hydrograph
of flow adopted to
represent limiting volumes and concentration
of runoff for use in determin-
ing design capacities
of spillways for dams, etc, or other hydraulic studies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Distribution
Graph -  A graph showing the typical distribution
of
runoff from a drainage
basin in terms of the percentage
of the total runoff<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:4410 (Part xI/Sec 4)-I973<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>fiat occurs  in each of a number of equal intervals of time.
In hydrology,
a unit hydrograph
in which the ordinates of flow are expressed as per-
centages of the volume of hydrographs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7  Dimensionless
Unit Graph  -One
plotted in dimensionless units
with respect to time and flow, useful for comparing unit hydrographs of
different drainage areas or those resulting from different storm patterns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.8  Double Mass  Curve-A
plot of accumulated
annual or seasonal
precipitation at an individual
station against the concurrent accumulated
mean precipitation for a group of surrounding stations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.9  Ground Water Depletion Curve--See  2.4.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.10 Ground
Water Reccession Curve-
See 2.4.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.11 Ground Water Storage Curve*-A
curve derived by summing
the area under the ground water depletion curve,  SO  as to show the volume
of water remaining in the ground that is available for runoff, at specific
rates of ground water flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.12  Hydrograph-
A graph showing the stage, volume of flow, velocity
sediment concentration
or sediment discharge or some other
feature of
flowing water with respect to time at a given place.
For example, a graph
showing the discharge of a stream as ordinate against the time as abscissa
is called a discharge hydrograph (see Fig. 1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.13  Hydrograph
Separation -  The
division
of a hydrograph
of a
specific storm into various components, such as surface runoff, interflow,
ground and water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.14  Hydrograph-
A bar graph of average rainfall, rainfall excess rates
or volumes over specified areas during successive units of time  during
a
storm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.15 Instantaneous
Unit Hydxograph -  When the unit duration  of  the
rainfall excess is infinitesimally small, the resulting hydrograph
is known
as the instantaneous unit hydrograph.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.16 Lag
4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Referring
to discharge
or water level,
it is the time elapsing
between the occurrence
of corresponding
changes in discharge or
water level at two points in a river.
Referring
to
the runoff
of rainfall, it is the time between the
centre of mass of rainfall excess to the centre of mass of the result-
ing runoff.
Referring to unit hydrographs, it is the  time  between the centre of
a unit storm and the peak discharge of the corresponding
unit
h ydrograph.
Referring to snow melting, it is the time between the beginning of
snow melt and the start of the resulting runoff.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.27 Rise*  -It
is the period during and following rainfall from the time
when the hydrograph first departs from the normal depletion
curve
until
it again becomes
coincident
with the normal depletion curve.
A rise
consists of a period of increasing flow, which
may result either from
increased ground-water
flow, from surface runoff or both. This culminates
in the crest or peak of the rise which is followed by a recession period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
