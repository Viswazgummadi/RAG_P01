FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
on 30 July
1987, after the draft finalized
by the Water
Supply and Sanita-
tion Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>~0.2 Many
administrative
authorities
controlling
water
supply
have
their
own set3 of bye-laws,
rules and regulations
for water
supply
to suit local
conditions.
These
should
be strictly
conformed
to before operations
are
commenced
for laying
pipe lines or plumbing
systems which are to be con-
nected
to public
water supply. This code is intended
to give the necessary
guidance
on good practices
of plumbing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
(or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
code
deals
with water
supply
in multi-storeyed
buildings
and
covers general
requirements
and regulations,
design considerations,
plumb-
ing systems, distribution
system, storage
of water and inspection
for water
supply in multi-storeyed
buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 Requirements
of water piping,
fittings
and appliances,
inspection,
and
maintenance
covered
in
IS  :  2065-1983t
shall
be applicable

OF WATER SUPPLY DEMAND<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Demand
of water
supply
in each
type building
is not accurately
deter-
minable
due
to various
factors,
for
example,
type
of building,
usage,
economic
conditions
of users,
hours
of supply
and climatic
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The
requirement
of water
for different
types
of buildings
is given
in
IS  :  1172-1~983.
These
requirements
are minimum
recommended
and care
should
be
taken
to
study
each
project
in accordance
with circumstanca
applicable
and the requirement
of water
estimated
accordingly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
Provision
shall be made
for additional
quantities
of water
required
for
special
uses,
for rxample,
air-conditioning
system,
gardening,
for  process
or laboratory
use. For requirements
regarding
water
supply
for fire fighting
reference
may be made
to IS  :  9668-1980t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Provision

building
shall be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

With
limited
pressure
available
in most city mains,
water
from direct supply is normally
not
available
above
two
or three
floors.
This
system
is covered

tank, except for flushing
purposes.
The

are
controlled

Thr start  and stop operations
are accomplished
by a set if pressure
switches arc  installed
directly
on the
line.
Ln some installation,
a timer
switch is installed
to restrict
the operating
cycle of the pump.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2 Direct pumping
systems are suitable
for buildings
where a certain
amount
of constant
use of water is always occurring.
These buildings
arc
all centrally
air-conditioned
buildings
for which a constant
make up-supply
for air-conditioning
cooling towers is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3 The system depends
on a constant
and reliable
supply of power.
Any failure in the power system would result in a breakdown
in the water
supply system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.4 The system
eliminates
the requirements
of overhead
tanks
for
domestic
purposes
( except
for flushing
) and
requires
minimum
space
( see Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Hydro-pneumatic
Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1  Hydro-pneumatic
system is a variation
of direct pumping
system.
An air-tight
pressure
vessel is installed
on the line to regulate
the opera-
tion of the pumps.
The vessel is arranged
to consist of approximately
half
the capacity
of waler.
As pumps operate,
the incoming
water in the vessel,’
compresses the air on top. When
a predetermined
pressure
is reached
in
the vessel, a pressure
switch installed
on the vessel switches off the pumps.
As water is drawn
into the system, pressure
falls into
the
vessel starting
the pump
at preset pressure.
The air in the pressure
tank
slowly
reduces
in volume
due to dissolution
in water and leakages
from pipe lines. An air
compressor
is also necessary
to feed air into the vessel so as to maintain
the required
air-water
ratio.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.2 There
are various
types of system
available
in
the market
and
the designers
has
to select the system according
to the needs
of each
application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.3 Hydro-pneumatic
system generally
eliminates
the need for an over
head
tank and may supply water at a much higher
pressure
than
availa-
ble from overhead
tanks particularly
on the upper floors, resulting
in even
distribution
of water at all floors ( see Fig. 3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.1  This is the most common

In buildings
where division
of the building
in vertical zones is not
practical
or -possible, supply from each riser or drop should be restricted to
a maximum
of 8- 10  floors
so
as
to restrict
the maximum
static head to
30 m. Alternatively,
pressure in the lower floors may be restricted
by use
of pressure reducing values, orifice flanges or other similar devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7  Designing

It is recommended
that the velocity of water

<<HEADING level=3>>8. STORAGE
CAPACITIES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  The quantity of water to be stored shall be calculated taking into
account the following factors:
a) Hours of supply at sufficiently high  pressure  to fill up the over-
head tanks. ( in case of direct supply systems ) or underground
storage reserviors;
b) Frequency of replenishment of overhead tank during 24 hours;
c) Rate and regularity of supply; and
d) Consequences of exhditsting the ‘storage, particularly in buildings
like hospitals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 When a single supply is provided, it is not necessary for health ,reasonsa
to have separate storage
for flushing and domestic
requirements.
The
storage tank shall, however, not be connected directly with the supply pipe
of the authority.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3  Dual Supply<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Wherever two separate types of supply are being used, for exam-
ple, municipal supply and tubewell supply, it is advisable to have
their pumping and rising main system separate and independent
of each other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Wherever
systems using recycled
treated
water
is used in  a
.building for flushing or air-conditioning
purposes,
the entire
system of storage, pumping, rising main and distribution system
shall
be separate
and
independent of the domestic
supply
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4  Underground
Storage -
The storage capacity of water for a building
should be provided for one day requirement
of water and the storage
capacity of underground tanks should be 50 percent of overhead tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

SYSTEM<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 Wherever
direct
pumping
or hydra-pneumatic
systems
are provided
( se6 6.3 and 6.4 ), the pumping
systems are provided
to meet the designed
peak flow in the system by one or more
pumps.
The
systems
should
be
arranged
so that, if the first pumps
fails to meet
the
demand,
the second
pump will go in operation
until
the demand
is met.
One additional
stand
by pump shall always be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Where overhead
tank supply system is adopted
and .adequate
overhead
tank
capacity
is available,
the pumping
rate should
be
l-5 times- the
average requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 In areas with power supply
available
in
limited
hours,
the pumping
rate may be correspondingly
increased.
Wherever
emergency
power supply
is available,
it may be advisable
to connect
the
pumping
sets to such a
source of power.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
