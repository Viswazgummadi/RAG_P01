<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee,
CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 1 ) ( Third Revision .) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had beenapproved
by
the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Portland-pozzolana
cement can be produced
either by grinding together
Portland cement clinker
and pozzolana
with addition
of gypsum or calcium
sulphate, or by intimately
and uniformly
blending
Portland
cement and fine, pozzolana.
While grinding
of the two materials
together
presents no difficulty, the mixing of dry powders intimately is extremely
difficult.
The blending
method
should, therefore, be resorted to only when the grinding method is impossible
or proves
uneconomical, in a particular case. Where blending method is adopted, every care should be taken
to see that the blending is as intimate as possible.
Generally,
if the blending is not uniform, it is
reflected in the performance
tests. The Sectional  :  Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of
this specification is of the opinion that the blending method should be confined to such factories/
works where
intimate and uniform
blending is feasible
with
the
employment
of requisite
machinery so as to ensure uniformity
of product and its guaranteed
performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Portland-pozzolana
cement
produces less heat
of hydration and
offers greater resistance to the
attack of aggressive
waters than normal Portland
cement.
Moreover,
it reduces
the leaching
of
calcium hydroxide liberated
during the setting and hydration
of cement.
It is particularly
useful
in marine and hydraulic
construction
and other
mass concrete
structures.
Portland-pozzolana
cement can generally be used wherever 33 grade ordinary
Portland cement is usable under normal
conditions.
However, it should be appreciated
that all pozzolanas need not necessarily contribute
to strength at early ages. In view of this fact, this specification
has been prepared
to enable
manufacturers
to produce
PortJand-pozzolana
cement equivalent to 33 grade ordinary
Portland
cement on ihe basis of the 3, 7 and 2%days compressive
strength.
For
construction
of structures
using rapid
construction
methods
like
slipform
construction,
Portland-pozzolana
cement shall be used with caution
since 4 to 6h strength
of concrete
is
considered significant in such construction.
This standard was first published in 1962 and subsequently
revised
in 1967 and 1976. In this
revision the standard has been split into two parts based on the pozzolana used in the manufacture
of such cements in view of the special needs of some hydraulic structures which require
pozzolana
cement manufactured
only with fly ash pozzolana,
This would also enable
the user to identify
the pozzolana used in the manufacture
of cement. Part I of this standard
covers pozzolana cement
manufactured
by using only fly ash pozzolana
and Part 2 covers pozzolana cement manufac-
tured by using either calcined clay or a mixture of calcincd clay and fly ash as pozzolana.
In this revision both chemical and physical requirements
have been kept
the same as was given
in 1976 version
of this standard
as amended.
Various
rcquiremrnts
of Portland-pozzolana
cement
given in 1976 version
oi this
standard
had been modified
from time
to
time by
issuing amendments
based on the
experience
gained with the use of the standard
and the
requirements
of the users and also 1teepin.g in view raw materials
and fuel available
in the
country for manufacture
of cement.
The Important
amendments
include
lowering
the value
of compressive strength in lime reactivity test from 5 MPa to 4 MPn, incorporating
a value
of
3-days compressive strength as 16 MPa, modifying the requirement
of sulphuric
anhydride
(SOS)
and insoluble
residue,
deleting
the requirement
of pozzolanicity
test, increasing the value of 28-
days compressive strength from 31 MPa to 33 MPa, making autoclave soundness
test compulsory
irrespective
of the magnesia
content in cement, incorporating
a provision for retest in respect of
autoclave soundness test after aeration of the cement, incorporating
a clause on false set of cement
and permitting packaging of cement in 25 kg bags.
All these amendments
have been taken
care
of in this revision.
Mass of cement packed in bags and the tolerance
requirements
for the mass of cement packed in
bags shall be in accordance wrth the relevant provisions of the  Standards of Whghts and Measures
( Packaged Commodities ) Rules, 1977  and B-l.2 (see Annex B ). Any modification
in these rules
in respect of tolerance on mass of cement would apply automatically
to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This siandard contains clauses 4.1.4, 4.2 and 12.4.1 which permit the purchaser to use his option
and 10.2. 1 and 10. 3 call for agreement between the purchaser
and the manufacturer.
The composition
of the technical committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard is
given in Annex C.
For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
rressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in
accrdance
witn IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
