FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 3 ) ( First Revision ) was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 30 April 1984, after the draft finalized by
the Cement and  Concrete  Sectional  Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A series of National
Standards
on the cellular concrete has been
formulated
so as to provide standard
products
for the construction
of buildings.
Cellular concrete
is a class of material
which has been
developed commercially
abroad and is coming in vogue in this country
also.
This specification is intended for cellular ( aerated ) concrete blocks
and its manufacture using the method of generation of gas by chemical
action, the details of which are broadly indicated in Appendix A.
The
Sectional Committee responsible--for the preparation of this standard has,
however, no intention’to freeze the method of manufacture
to any one
particular method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Concrete masonry,
already extensively  U+
in  building construction
abroad,
is likely to make very consider&e-
headway
in this country
because of the many advantages,
such as durability,
strength
and
structural
stability, fire resistance,
insulation, and sound absorption it
possesses.
Concrete masonry construction is also economical
because of
the following aspects:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The units are relatively largeadd
true in size and shape.
This
ensures rapid qonstruction so that more wall is laid-per man-hour
than in other types of wall construction;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Fmm  jointr  result in considerable saving in mortar as compared
to normal
masonry
construction,
and also in increasing the
strength of the wall, and<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:.2lSS(Part3)-1984<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  The true plane surfaces obtained obviate necessity of plaster for
unimportant buildings situated in low rainfall areas; even when
plaster is used br
any reason, the’ quantity
required for
satisfactory coverage is significantly small.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 Concrete masonry has an attractive appearance and is readily
adaptable to any rtyle of architecture.
It lends itself bo a wide variety of
surface fmishes for both exterior and Werior
walls.
It may also be
finished with cement plaster, gauged with ltie or a plasticizer.  Concrete
masonry units provide a strong mechanical key, uniting the concrete
masonry backing and the plaster finish in a strong permanent bond.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.2  Autoclaved cellular ( aerated ) concrete’blocks are ,used for both
load bearing and. non-load bearing internal walls, partition and panel
walls, inner leaf of cavity walls or as backing to brick masonry and for
external load-bearing walls aa” wd! as panel walls in steel or reinforced
concrete frame construction when protected From weather by rendering
or by some other efficient treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard was first published in 1969 as “IS  :  5482-1969
Specification for autoclaved cellular concrete blocks”.
This first +sion
is being issued as IS  :  2185 ( Part 3 > 19W under the modified
title
“Spec.&ation.for
concrete masotiry units: Part 3 Autoclaved
cellular
( aerated )
concrete
blo&ks”
and
supersedes the
former
standard
IS  :  W-1969.
.Part 1 of this standard Covers hollow as& solid concrete
blocks of normal weight and Part 2 Covers hollow and solid light weight
concrete blocks.
Thii &cation
in title is inte&ed far frcilitating the
co-ordination of requirements of various types of concrete masonry units,
covered under various Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1 This standard incorporates significant modscations specially with
regard to materials and physical requirements such as dimensions, surf&e
finish and texture. Requirement of fire resistance has heen omitted from
this revision and thermal conductivity has been retained.
A clause on
terminology has been added in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a  particular  requirement of
this standard is complied with, the 6nal valw, ohserved or calculated,
expressing the result of
a test or analysis, shall he rounded off in
accordance with IS  :  2-196W.
The number of sign&ant
places retained
in the rounded off value should he the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

asbestos cement products, hydrous calcium silicate insulation Products, or

<<PARAGRAPH>>22 Block - A concrete masonry unit, any one of the external dimensions
of which is greater than the corresponding dimension of a brick as
specified in IS : 33520197W, ,and of such sixe and mass as to P&nit

<<PARAGRAPH>>( Clause 6.1 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>MABithACTURE  OF AUTOCLAVED CELL&
CONCRETE BLOCKS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.  Cellular concrete blocks involve the use of aerated concrete which
is made by introducing air or other gas into a slurry composed of  cement
( JU  51) br  lime ( sdc 5.2 ) and a siliceous filler ( scu 5.3 ) so that when the
mixture
sets hard
after
autoclaving,
a uniform
cellular
structure
is
obtained.
There are several ways in which air-cells or other voids may<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_15>>
<<HEADING level=3>>he formed in the slurry as to result in a cellular structurea fter autoclaving,
the principal ones of which are the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) By the formation of gas by chemical
reaction
within the  mass
during the liquid or plastic stage, in the same way as carbon
dioxide is formed
and used in aerating
bread
and baked’
products; and
.
. .
.
b) By introducing air from without,
either by adding to the durry
in the mixer a preformed
stable foam such as is used in fh’e-
fighting or by incorporating
air by whipping (with the aid of
an air-entraining
agent ), in the manner in whichegg-white
may
be whipped to a light cream or foam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2. Suitable steam-curing is practically
unavoidable in making cellular
concrete blocks with cement as binder’and the same is absolutely essential
when lime is used.
Generally,
auto claving is done for about .14 to
18 hours at about 788 kPa and about 185”C, the heating and raising
of pressure or cooling and lowering of pressure being generally gradual
over a period of few hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3. Although
simple
in principle,
the
commercial
production
of
autoclaaed
cellular concrete
blocks is quite elaborate
in.practice.
The
sand or  0th~  siliceous material is generally ground in ballmills to their
required degree of fineness which is usually comparable
with the fineness
of ordinary Portland cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
