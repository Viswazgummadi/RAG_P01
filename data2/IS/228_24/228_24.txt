<<PARAGRAPH>>Method of Chemical Analysis of Ferrous Metals Sectional Committee, MTD 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 24 ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
Methods of Chemical Analysis of Ferrous Metals Sectional Committee had been approved by the Metallurgical
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1S228, which was first published in 1952 and subsequently revised in 1959, covered the chemical analysis of plain
carbon and low alloy steels, alongwith pig iron and cast iron. It was revised again to make it comprehensive
in
respect of steel analysis and to exclude pig iron and cast iron which were being covered in separate standards.
During its second revision the standard has been split up in several parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Determination of nitrogen in steel by steam disti Ilation, has been covered in IS 228 ( Part 19) and Determination of
nitrogen in steel by optical emission spectrometer is under preparation and will be covered in a separate standard
which will form a part of the above series.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers the method for determination of nitrogen ( 0.001-0.2 percent) in steel by inert gas fusion thermal
conductivity method.

SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard ( Part 24 ) covers the determination of
nitrogen in steel in the range 0.001 to 0.2 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Purge the gas line and the thermal conductivity
cell for sometime for the time period as recommended
by the manufacturer before starting the analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  SAMPLE
PREPARATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sample may be in the form of chips, drillings or
solid pin. The size of the solid pin should be such to
permit free introduction through the loading device
of the equipment or directly into the graphite crucible.
The sample may be cut for nitrogen analysis in such
a way that excess heat is not generated.
A hacksaw
may be used for cutting.
If drillings so desired, they
should be taken under argon atmosphere avoiding
excess heat. The sample to be analyzed may be rinsed
in acetone, air-dried and  used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Set the analyzer to operate in automatic or manual
mode depending upon the nature of the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — If the standard or sample is in pin form, calibrate
with pin standard by automatic mode and subsequently
analyze the sample also in automatic mode.
However,
if the sample/standard is in the form of drillings, calibrate
by manual mode and also subsequently analyze the sample
in manual mode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Weigh the standard sample and enter the weight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Place the weighed standard sample in pin form in
the loading device for automatic analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3
PRINCIPLE
OF THE METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sample, contained in a small graphite crucible, is
fused under a flowing helium atmosphere.
Nitrogen
present in the steel is released as molecular nitrogen
into the flowing helium stream.
The nitrogen
is
separated from other liberated gases such as hydrogen
and carbon monoxide and finally measured by thermal
conductivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6 Place an empty graphite crucible on the furnace
lower electrode assembly and close the furnace.
In
automatic mode, the analysis begins automatically and
at the end displays the percentage nitrogen on the
control console and also prints on the paper. However,
in manual mode, after closing the furnace, press the
analyzer switch. The purging and degassing will start.
Then lower the piston, keep weighed standard in the
graphite crucible and again close the furnace.
Now
press again the analyzer switch. Atler the analysis
cycle, the percentage of nitrogen will get displayed
on the control console and also will give a print out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
