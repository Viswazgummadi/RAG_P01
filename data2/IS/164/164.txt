<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-0.1 This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards Institution on 10 June 1981, after the draft finalized by the Paints
and Allied Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Chemi-
cal Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard was first published in 1951 and was largely based on the
interim coordinated
draft prepared by the Coordinating
Subcommittee on
Specifications for Paints and Allied Stores of the Subcommittee of the No. 5
.Standing
Coulmittee
on Specifications for Paints and Allied Stores of the
General Headquarters,
India ( now Army Headquarters ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This revision was taken up with a view to improving the performance of
traffic paints on a specific request received from the Ministry of Shipping ar&
Transport,
Government
of India, and the Indian Roads Congress, New.
Delhi. It was first intended to prescribe a performance
test under actuul
service conditions, but due to difficulties expressed by testing laboratories in
conducting the test, this was not found possible.
Therefore, a collaboratiwi
investigation
was taken up to develop an accelerated laboratory
test and
correlate it with the performance of the material under actual service con&
tions to determine the relative life span of traffic paints.
For this ~purpose,
laboratory
tests and field trials were conducted
on one-way and two-way‘
traffic roads in New Delhi over a period of 18 months.
Further, it was
brought out that a laboratory test for wear resistance for over 6 hours would
correspond to actual performance of the material to approximately 7 months
on roads.
However,
two grades
of the material,
depending on its wear
resistance, have been included in this revision.
Grade -1 for over 6 hours of
wear resistance, where quality would be decidedly better, and Grade 2 for
1  to 6 hours of wear resistance.
It was recognized by the Committee that
paints below one hour of resistance would be substandard.
Further, the
limit given for Grade 2 should be narrowed
down later as and \khen more
data are available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 Even though
service trials were conducted
at New Delhi, it is
expected that this would generally hold good for all over the country. It has,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS :  164 -  1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>however, been decided to ‘undertake similar service trials in other parts of the
country to make the correlation
more realistic,
It may, however, be noted
that laboratory tests indicate general suitability of traffic paints and also the
uniformity
of one lot to another
in a consignment made on one paint
formula;
these tests may not predict the performance
of any one paint
formula under all possible end uses.
It is, therefore, desirable that a test
paint should be applied in a repeatable manner under careful study condi-
tions and then be tested and evaluated at intervals throughout the useful life
of the paint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.2 The correlation
coefficient
obtained
between laboratory
test and
field performance at the two sites were moderately high, showing that there
was conformity
between the laboratory
and field
observations.
It is,
however, intended to further
improve the equipment used for testing to get
still closer correlation in due course.
It is also proposed to incorporate the
use of an abrasive
material like sand with prescribed hardness and grit
to, improve the test procedure.
The Committee was also aware of the need
to incorporate
a requirement
and method of test for fungistatic properties.
However, in absence of any commercial testing facilities inclusion of this test
would be considered when such facilities become available in due course.
0.4 In this revision, the title of the standard has been simplified.
Additional
requirements for recoating property and flash point have been specified. In an
experimental investigation carried out by the concerned Sectional Committee
responsible for the preparation
of this revision,
solvent based material was
found
to be better
in
performance
than
water
based paint.
Water
based paints have limitations in their use during rainy season.
However,
the Committee was of the opinion that technically it is possible to manufac-
ture water based paints conforming to the requirements of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 The Committee responsible
for preparing
this standard
also recom-
mended
that time taken for wearing of the paint, as determined
by the
method given in Appendix D, in relation to unit cost of the material, should
be the main guiding factor in the choice/purchase
of traffic paints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 In preparation of this revision, substantial assistance has been derived
from the recommendations
of the experimental investigation taken up by the
Central Road Research Institute, New Delhi, on the sample of traffic paints
supplied by M/s Addisons Paints Ltd, Madras; Alkali & Chemical Corpo-
ration
of India Ltd, Calcutta; Asian Paints ( I ) Ltd, Bombay; Garware
Paints Ltd, Bombay;
Goodlass
Neralac Paints Ltd, Bombay; Modi Paints
& Varnish Works, Modi Nagar ( UP ); Nagrath Paints ( Pvt ) Ltd, Kanpur;
and Shalimar Paints Ltd, Calcutta.
The assistance so derived is gratefully
acknowledged.

Heat the bitumen
and sand separately
at
150 to 190°C.
When dry, thoroughly
mix them at the same temperature
and add the filler.
Fill the hot bituminous
material ( see  A-1.1.1 ) in  the
circular cavity of the test track and level the surface suitably by means of a
spatula,
Subsequently,
compact
it as follows or by any suitable~compac-
ting machine. Keep a circular disc made of mild steel sheet of about.3.5 mm
thickness
and diameter
of about 298 mm to the inner side of the, test
track
over the surface.
Compact
by
means of Marshall Compaction
Hammer
( see Fig. 1 ) first at
the centre
of the plate and later at
4 uniformly‘distributed
diagonal points over the remaining area by lifting and
dropping the hammer 10 times at each point.
This hammer consists of a
flat circular tamping face and a 450 grams sliding weight with a free fall of
450 mm as shown in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in A-1.1.1, not less than 20 mm in thickness on a suitable base.
Air dry for
24 hours.
Expose the panel outdoor under dry Conditions at an angle of
45 degrees facing south for 25 days. At the end of the 25-day period, subject
the panel to a fine spray of water at a temperature
not above 30°C for
6 hours daily, from 0800 to 1400 hours for 6 days.
During the spray of
water, the panel shall remain exposed facing south at an angle of 45 degrees.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

weight being determined at point of contact by a spring
balance.
During the test, keep the painted sulfate wet with water sprayed
on the inner edge of the Inner wheel track at a rare of 600 ml

Examine visually the wear on both the tracks at regular intervals till
the paint wears out completely in one of the tracks.
After 6 hours of

Continue the testing after 18
hours. Again allow rest till the paint wears out completely in one of the
tracks.
