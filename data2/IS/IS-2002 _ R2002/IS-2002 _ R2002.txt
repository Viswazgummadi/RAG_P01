<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalised
by
the Wrought

Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by
the
Metal!urgical

FOR INTERNAL USE AT THIS LOCATION ONLY, SUPPLIED BY BOOK SUPPLY BUREAU.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the present revision assistance has been drawn from German Standard
DIN 17155 : 1983 ‘Creep
resistance
steel plate and strip; technical delivery conditions’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the purpose
of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated, expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be
rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960
‘Rules of rounding off numerical values ( revised)‘.
The
number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When the steel maker has collected
a sufficient
number
of tests for application
to a statistical
I
definition
of  Et,  on the grade of steel;
Et should
be equal to the average value of the test
results
at temperature
‘t’ less two standard
deviation;
b)  When a sufficient number
of test results
are not
available
Et  should be taken as a minimum
value
guaranteed
by the steel maker which
should
be
checked
at the time of acceptance.
For carban
steels the value of the proof
stress given
by the
ratio  Et/Rzo (  taken .from Table 8 ) may be taken
without
verification
at the time of acceptance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
