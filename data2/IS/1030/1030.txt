<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Fifth Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the drawl finalized
by the Steel Castings Sectional Committee had been approved by the Metallurgical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1956 and was revised in 1962, 1974, 1982 and 1989. While reviewing the
standard in light of the experience gained during these years the committee has decided that the standard may
be further revised. In this revision various clauses have been aligned with the recent standards on steel castings.
Amendments No. 1 and 2 have also been incorporated in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, assistance has been derived from IS0 3755  :  1991 ‘Cast carbon steels for
general engineering purposes’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places retained in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers the requirements for carbon steel
castings for general engineering purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the benefit of the purchaser, particulars to be
specified while ordering for steel castings to this
specification are given in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standards listed in Annex A are necessary
adjuncts to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 CHEMICAL COMPOSITION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 The ladle analysis of steel when carried out either
by the method specified in IS 228 and its relevant parts
or any other established
instrumental/chemical
methods shall be as given in Table 1. In case of dispute
the procedure given in IS 228 shall be the referee
method. However, where the method is not given in
IS 228, the referee method shall be as agreed to
between the purchaser and the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of this standard,

<<PARAGRAPH>>If specified at the time of enquiry and order, product
analysis may be carried out from a test piece or from a
casting representing each melt. Drillings for analysis
shall be taken from not less than 6 mm beneath the

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 Residual Elements<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Included in 8 grades are 4 grades with chemical
composition restricted to ensure ease of welding at
the purchaser’s
end and these grades carry the
suffix ‘W’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.1 Elements not specified in Table 1 shall not
ordinarily be added to the steel and all reasonabic
precautions shall be taken to prevent contamination
from scrap, etc, to keep them as low as practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.2 Analysis and reporting of the analysis in test
certificate for the residual elements shall be done only
when so specified by the purchaser in enquiry and order.
However, the manutacturer shall ensure that the residual
elements are within the limits, when such limits are
specified by the purchaser in enquiry and order.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

such operation
is to be done before final heat
treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
