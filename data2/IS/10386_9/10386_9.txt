<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Safety in
Construction,
Operation
and Maintenance
of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee
had been approved by
the River Valley Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Structures
for conveyance
of water at depths more than 0.6 m and velocity greater than 0.9 mlsec, constitute
safety hazards, both to the public and to construction
and operating personnel,
which require to be considered
by the designer. The many variable factors to be considered
in determining
the requirements
for safety make it
impossible
to establish exact predetermined
standards for all features; the best that can be done is to set up general
guidelines
to serve as technical guides in the final determination
of proper safety facilities.
Such guidelines
are
presented in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The importance
of adequate and safe equipment
as a factor in preventing
accidents shall not be overlooked.
Only
machinery,
equipment,
tools, and supplies which are standard, so far as safety provisions
are concerned
shall be
considered
in design and in purchases made. All specifications
for the purchase of power driven machinery
and
equipment
shall include provisions
for built-in shields or guards and safety devices. The necessary
safety and
first-aid equipment
and fire extinguishers
shall also provided for the safety of employees.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The climatic conditions
and the weather in an area have a major influence
on the satety facilities to be provided
at a given structure. These shall be considered
in all designs from the safety point of view, whether the structure
is large or small.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 9) lays down guidelines
for safety
measures
to be adopted during operation
of a canal/
cross drainage work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
For the purpose of the above clause the canal is
deemed to include all types of canal and their appurtenant
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

OF HAZARD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 TYPES OF SAFETY
DEVICES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In evaluating
the need
for safety
facilities
at a
particular
structure, one of the most important things
to be-considered
is the size of canal and the frequency
of visits of the general public to the site, which has a
direct
bearing
upon
the likelihood
of accidents
occurring
there.
The following
classification
of
accident/hazard
may be considered:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Fences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fences are one of the most common protective devices
used to keep unauthorized
persons and domestic
and
wild animals
from getting
into places
where they
might be hurt or where they might damage installed
equipment.
Fence designs vary from four strands of
barbed wire on wood posts to a high-quality
link mesh
fence supported by steer posts set m concrete. Special
attention shall be given to make it very difficult for a
person to squeeze around tht ena of a fence and enter
restricted
areas.
In any
event
Lne design
data
transmitted
by the field must include
information
regarding the fencing needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

modified
to perform the functions
of a guardrail
as
well; for instance,
the handrail
along the side of a
stairway might be covered with wire mesh to prevent
children from getting between the rails. Handrails may
be made of steel, aluminium,
or wood depending
upon
their location and their function.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Signs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The proper use of signs to point out particular hazards
to operating
personnel,
or to the public,
is very
important. A well-worded
sign advising of the specific
danger will warn persons and may prevent danger to
life and property. Signs pointing
out specific dangers
are much to be preferred
over signs which merely
threaten
dire consequences
to trespassers,
although
‘No Trespassing’
signs do serve a useful purpose.
Signs which might serve to call the attention of trapped
person to escape devices shall be considered.
In case
areas are likely
to be frequented
by persons
not
familiar with the English language the warning
signs
shall be worded in Hindi/regional

<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Guardrails<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guardrails
are classified
into two general types, those
used to protect
vehicles
and those used to protect
pedestrains.
Guaidrails
are often used to serve both
purposes. Guardrails
installed to protect vehicles, such
as those at dangerous
turns on a canal bank road,
usually consist of short heavy posts set in the ground
along the smaller of the rod supporting a cable or sheet
steel deflector
on the traffic
side of the rail. The
function of the guardrail is two fold. It marks tp safe
limit of the roadway and also tends to deflect vehicles
which may contact it. Since the guardrail
serves as a
marker, it is important that guard rails along roadways
be made and kept clearly visible. Reflectors
may be
installed
on the posts to make them more visible at
nights. Guardrails
to protect pedestrains
may be made
of planks and wood posts or pipe rails and metal posts
set in concrete.
For the protection
of children
it is
desirable
to place wire mesh on the pipe guardrail to
prevent passage between the pipes. As in the case of
other
safety
devices,
the selection
of the type of
guardrail
to be used will depend upon what is to be
accomplished
and the class of hazard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Information
signs, dedication
plaques,
etc, shall be
located away from roadways
so that traffic shall not
effect
the visibiliy
of the sign boards
and thus
eliminate
a traffic
hazard.
Road
signs
of the
conventional
type shall be installed
along principal
access roads where needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4  SAFETY DEVICES
REQUIRED
FOR
CANALS AND THEIR STRUCTURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sharp turns in canal bank roads shall be~protected with
guardrails,
and signs shall be posted along the roads
warning drivers that the road is private and that they
travel at their own risk. Signs shall also be posted to
warn ‘would be’ swimmers
of deep water or other
hazards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design
shall provide for suitable guardrails,
fences,
walls, and enclosures,
where needed, to be constructed
as an integral
part of the structure.
Guardrails
are
needed on both sides of all bridges, on the open side
of all stairways,
ramps, walkways and similar places
where the vertical height above the surrounding
area
is 1 .O m or more.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lined canals having a vertical lining height of 0.9 m
or more
shall be equipped
with escape ladders (see
Fig. 4) installed opposite each other at intervals of not
more than 500 m, on each side of the canal,
and
immediately
upstream
of siphons,
falls and similar
structures. The canals shall be fenced where justified
by the degree of hazard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guardrails
are required
around
all uncovered
hatchways
and openings
in floors and platforms,
and
all windows
and other wall openings
if the bottom of
the opening is less than 1 .O m above the floor, or if the
design of the opening makes such a guard necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Escape Devices at Canal Structure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to ladders in canals, other escape devices
may be provided
to assist persons
in extricating
themselves
from a canal or other canal structures that
are particularly
hazardous.
Among these facilities are
suspended
cables with drop lines, floats or booms
across channels,
escape
nets, and trashracks.

if properly made, offer a
trapped person something that he can get an arm or leg
over and possibly
get upon and work his way to the
bank.
Escape
nets are usually
hung from cables
stretched across the channel or from a light steel truss
structure. The
net is installed
so that it reaches
below the normal minimum
operating
water surface;
a
person
being
carried down the canal is swept
against it and if he is conscious
he has a good chance
to save himself. In designing
a boom, the individual

structure could be adopted to keep humans or animals
from being drawn into the structure. The modification
required
would probably be no more than flattening
the slope of the trashrack
and providing
an escape

<<PARAGRAPH>>Tunnel reaches shall be protected in the same way as
those of siphons since the hazards are similar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stilling basins constitute
definite safety hazards and,
depending
upon the class of hazard, shall be guarded
by adequate protective
devices. Where the top of the
walls
are flush
or nearly
f-lush with the ground,
guardrailing,
possibility
of a chain-link
type, shall be
installed on top of the wall in such a way that there is
no room for a person to stand on top of the wall inside
of the fence. Where the top of the walls extend as much
as 1.2 m above the ground level, so that guardrailing
is not necessary, the top of the wall shall be designed
so that it is not possible for a person to stand upon it
or to walk upon it. Wing walls at the inlets to spillways
shall be protected in a similar manner.
Guardrailing
and fencing are discussed in 3.1 and 3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3  Bridges<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Foot and vehicular bridges shall be well guarded with
guardrails.
The type of railing
used shall give the
protection
needed under the class of hazard existing
(see 2 and 3.2). For combination
of pedestrian
and
vehicular
bridges
located
within
thickly
populated
areas,
and which
have
guardrails
separating
the
vehicular
and pedestrian
traffic lanes, consideration
shall be given
to making
the separating
guardrail
splashproof
to protect pedestrians.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Operating

railing.
Public
entry shall be banned

bridges by a suitable barrier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.7  Inlet and Outlet Works<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the protection recommended
in 4.2.6 for
stilling basins constructed
in connection
with inlet and
outlet
works,
log booms
or safety
nets shall be
provided near tailraces and inlet and outlet works on
bodies of water where boatsmen or swimmers may be
endangered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4  Falls and Chutes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rectangular
section falls and chutes of 1.5 m depth or
more and under Class A, B, or C hazard, shall be
fenced or have guardrailing
constructed
along each
side of the structure. In those cases where a canal fall
or escape carries more than a 1.2 m depth of water into
the structure,
the need for a safety net or cable and
drop-line device across the water prism upstream from
the intake of the structure to facilitate escape from the
water shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.8  Stop Logs and Bulkhead Gates<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the temporary
closing
of openings
such
as
penstock inlets or draft-tube outlets, it has been found
that bulkheads
are to be preferred
over stop logs if
suitable
hoisting
equipment
is provided.
Some
projects
have found
that the use of bulkheads
is
preferable to the use of stop logs on canal structures.
Where the former is used a truck-mounted
crane is
usually necessary
to handle the bulkheads.
Stop-log
grooves shall be designed with this possibility
in mind.
In all the above mentioned
cases the use of bulkheads
is preferable so that the closing operation is simplified
and is made safer as well as faster. Further, a tighter
seal is usually
obtained
and better
protection
is
afforded to the men working behind the bulkhead.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.5
Trashracks<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Trashrack
operating
decks are hazardous
primarily
because the wet trash removed from the racks is often
deposited on the deck, making it wet and slippery.
It
is desirable therefore to have a rough, nonslip surface
on the operating
deck floor and to have a guardrail,
across the front of the deck, against which the operator
can brace himself
while removing
debris from the
racks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
