<<HEADING level=3>>CODE OF PRACTICE FOR
MAINTENANCE AND PRESERVATION
OF STONES IN FUILDINGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 November
1977, after the draft finalized
by the Stones
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The durability
of stones depends
mainly
upon
its physical
structure
and
chemical
composition.
The
deterioration
takes
place
when
their
inherent
properties
are changed
by the
action
of various
unavoidable
external
agencies.
It
is always
desirable,
therefore,
to
use
a good
durable
stone in the very first instance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This code of practice
has been framed
to enumerate
those
principal
factors
which cause decay of stone in buildings
and to suggest preventive
measures
for their least
decay.
The
preventive
measures
included
are
based on the practice
being followed
in this
country
and are applicable
to sedimentary
rocks,
particularly
porous stones which
are not plastered.
The
Indian
Standards
on some of the preservatives
recommended
in this
standard
are given in Appendix
A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test
or
analysis,
shall
be
rounded
off in
accordance
with IS : Z-1960”.
The number
of significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that ofthe
specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE ,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
lays down the practice
for
maintenance
and
preser-
vation
of stones in buildings.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules for rounding off numerical valves ( rcnised ).<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 8759 - 1977<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 Generally
atmospheric
agencies
bring
about
physical
and chemical
changes
in building
stones and cause its deterioration.
For maintenance
and preservation
of stones in building
it is desirable,
therefore,
to know
the agencies
which
deteriorate
the stones in buildings.
The following
are
the main agencies
which cause deterioration
of stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Rain -
The stone is subjected
to alternate
wetting
and drying
due
to rain and sun, causing
temperature
stresses and weathering.
The rain
water contains
different
gases and acids which also disintegrate
stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Temperature
Variation
-
At places
where
the
temperature
of
atmosphere
changes,
the stones
are subjected
to alternate
heating
and
cooling
due
to variation
in the ambient
temperature.
At such places
stresses
are
induced
in
the
stone
which
cause
its disintegration
or
cracking.
In thinner
walls of single stone, temperature
variation
may not
be much.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
Wind
-
Stones subjected
to strong
winds suffer abrasion
due to grit
and
dust.
Strong
winds
also accelerate
weathering
due to variation
in
moisture
content
and help in consequent
disintegration
of stones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Frost
-
In very
cold
places
moisture
present
in atmosphere
gets
deposited
on
stones
and
fills
the
pores.
On
reaching
the
freezing
temperature,
the water  in  the pores expands
and causes disruption.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5  Atmospheric
Impurities
-
In an industrial
town the atmosphere
is generally
polluted
with smoke and acid gases.
Limestones,
calcareous
p
sand stones and those containing
carbonate
of lime
are greatly
affecte,’
wben used in such places.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6
Movement
of Chemicals
-
If limestone
and sandstone
are laid
close
to each
other
in a structure,
the chemical
formed
by the reaction
of the atmospheric
gases
with
the
limestone,
enters
the
sandstone
and
causes its disintegration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7  Binding
Material
-
The nature
of certain
binding
material
is such
that they adversely
affect
the stones.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.8  Vegetable
Growth
-
Certain
trees
and
creepers
penetrate
their
roots in the joints
of stones in search
of food and for their stability.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.9 Damage
Due to Iron
Fixtures
-
Some damage
occursto
buildings
with the use of iron or steel clamps
and dowels.
in the process expand
and fracture
the stone.
These
get rusted
and
Hence
anti-corrosive
paint
or other suitable
coating
should be applied
to these fixtures
for prevention
of rust.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:8759-1977<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. MAINTENANCE
OF STONE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.0  The
principal
factors
in
the
decay
of stone
being
the
action
of
atmospheric
agencies,
the
preventive
measures
must
aim
at
denying
access
to the stone
of these
destructive
agencies.
The
use of preservatives
is to check
their
action
by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) filling
the pores
of the stone,
b) providing
a coating
to the
surface
of the
stone
to prevent
the
access
of moisture
to its interior,
and
c) reacting
with
constituents
of
the
stone
to
form
a
hard
and
durable
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
Surface
Coating
Preservatives
-
These
are applied
to the surface,
after
expelling
the
moisture
by sun-drying
from
the surface
of the
stone.
The
preservatives
should
be applied
before
sunset.
The
usual
types
are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Coal
tar,
bitumen.
colourless
paraffin
oil, linseed
oil either
mixed
or
unmixed
with
paint.
These
interfere
with
the
pleasing
appearance
of the stone
and require
constant
attention.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A solution
of silicate
of potash
or soda
which
hardens
the surface
of the stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Preservatives
Which
Impregnate
the Stone Without
Chemical
Action -
The important
type
is silicone
based
products
which
repels
water
by soaking
into
the capillary
pores
of stones
and
providing
water
repellent
film both
on the surface
and
in depth.
It is diluted
in a toluene
or white
spirit
mixture
and
applied
either
by
brushing,
dipping
or
spraying.
This
method
has given
successful
results
on museum
exhibits
kept
indoors
under
dry
conditions.
methacrylate
are also used.
Polyvinyl
acetate
and
polymethyl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Preservatives
Which
Act by Chemical
Action
with
Stone -
These
include
barium
hydroxide
and
magnesium
fluosilicate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1
Silicon
ester
has ‘no
more
than
a temporary
influence
on
the
normal
processes
of weathering
and
decay.
Impregnation
with
silicon
ester
may
be helpful
on
occasion
for
consolidating
special
features,
if
these
can
be dismantled
for
saturation
by immersion
or can
be dealt
with
by feeding
the
solution
through
holes
drilled
through
the friable
zone
into
the core.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
Silicones
water-repellent
treatments
used
are, either
a solution
of
a silicone
in an
organic
solvent
or a solution
of
a metallic
siliconate
( usually
sodium
siliconate)
in
water.
The
siliconate
decomposes
on
exposure
to the
air, releasing
the silicone
with
the
formation
of sodium
carbonate
( or sulphate
) as a by-product.
In appropriate
circumstances
silicones
promise
to
be
useful
for
reducing
grain
penetration
through
leading
walls
and
on occasion
for controlling
staining
of stone
work from
various
causes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4 Paints -  Painting
and
other
remedial
measures
afford
useful
measure of protection but are inacceptable
for monumental and historical
buildings because they mask the colour and texture of stones.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5 Limewash -  Limewash though ‘widely used in the belief
that it
would help to preserve the stone, is not recommended
as it spoils the
appearance
of old buildings.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6  Limewater
-  Appreciable
strengthening
effects are now reported to
have been obtained
on friable
stone by repeated
applications
of clear
limewater.
The intention
is to deposit calcium
carbonate
by reaction
with carbondioxide
in the air, though under present conditions
of air
pollutions
some part of the product
may be expected
to be calcium
sulphate.
Lime is so slightly soluble in water, that 30 to 40 applications
are needed;
This would not be practicable
on a large scale and it has
not yet been proved that the ultimate effects warrant the time and effort
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7  Cleaning
of Stones -  The
cleaning
of stones
also
forms
an
important
part
of maintenance.
Cleaning
is essential
to restore
the
natural
look and to remove
the
unwanted
deposition
which
may
subsequently
cause the deterioration
of stones.
This is done by washing
the stone with water or steam, sand blasting or using suitable chemicals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
