<<PARAGRAPH>>Method of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering ( Excluding River Valley Projects ), CED 44<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Method of Measurement
of Works of Civil Engineering ( Excluding
River Valley Projects )
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement occupies a very important place in the planning and execution of any civil engineering
work from the time of first estimates to the final completion and settlement of pavements of projects.
Methods
followed
for measurement
are not
uniform
and considerable
difference
exist between
practices followed
by different
construction
agencies and also between
various Central and State
Government
Departments
and their undertakings.
While it is recognized
that each system of
measurement has to be specifically
related
to administrative
and financial
organizations
within a
department responsible for the work, a unification of the various systems at technical levels has been
accepted as very desirable,
specially as it permits a wider range of operation
for civil engineering
contractors
and eliminates
ambiguities
and misunderstandings
arising
out of
inadequate under-
standing of various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since different trades are not related to one another, the Sectional Committee
decided that for each
separate standards shall be issued as different
parts as it would be helpful to users in using the
specific standard. This Part 28 covers method of measurement
of sound insulation on work applicable
to building as well as to civil engineering work.
Sound insulation work is required to be done in some of the insulation buildings.
The method of
measurement of insulation varies from organization to organization.
The technical committee responsi-
ble for formulation
of this standard has, after considering practices being followed
by some of the
major organizations,
decided to prepare this standard which adopts simplest type of measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a measurement, shall be rounded  off in
accordance with IS 2  : 1960 ‘Rules
for rounding off numerical
values (  revised 1’.  The number
of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
