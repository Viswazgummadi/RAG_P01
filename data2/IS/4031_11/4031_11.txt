FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part 11 )  (  First
Revision
)  was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
on
22 April 1988, after the draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of individual
tests.
Further,
since publication
of the original standard in 1968, a number
of
standards covering the requirements
of different
equipment used for testing of cement,
a brief
description of which was also covered
in the
standard, had been published.
In this revision,
therefore,
reference
is given to different instru-
ment specifications
deleting
the description
of
the instruments, as it has been recognized
that
reproducible
and repeatable
test results can be
obtained only with standard
testing
equipment
capable of giving desired level of accuracy.
This
part  t  Part  11 )  covers determination
of density
of hydraulic cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Standard
methods
of testing
cement
are
essential
adjunct
to the cement
specifications.
This
standard
in
different
parts
lays down
the
procedure
for
the
tests
to
evaluate
the
physical
properties
of
different
types of
hydraulic cements.
The procedure for conduct-
ing chemical tests of hydraulic cement is covered
in IS  :  4032-1985*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose
of
deciding
whether
a
particular
requirement
of
this
standard
is
complied
with, the final value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or
analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant
places
retained in the rounded off value should
be the
same as that of the
specified
value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Originally
all the tests
to
evaluate
the
physical properties
of hydraulic
cements
were
covered in one standard  ;  bdt for facilitating
the
use of this standard and future revisions,
it has
been decided
to print
the different
tests
as
different parts of the standard
and accordingly,
this revised
standard
has been brought
out in
thirteen parts.
Thus will also facilitate

<<PARAGRAPH>>either of the liquids specified in 5.1 to a point on
the stem between the zero and the l-ml
mark.
The inside of the flask above the level of the
liquid shall be dried, if necessary, after pouring.
The first reading shall be recorded after the flask
has been immersed in the water bath (sreNote
2)
in accordance with 6.3. A weighed quantity
of
cement ( about 64 g for Portland cement ) shall
then be introduced in small amounts at the same
temperature
as the liquid ( see Note  1 ).  Care
shall be taken to avoid splashing and to see that
the cement does not adhere to the inside of the
flask above the liquid.
A vibrating
apparatus
may be used to accelerate the introduction
of the
cement into the flask and to prevent
the cement
from sticking to the neck.
After all the cement
has been introduced,
the stopper shall be placed
in the flask and the flask rolled in an inclined
position
( see Note 1 ), or gently whirled
in a
horizontal
circle,
so as to free the cement from
air until no further air bubbles rise to the surface
of the liquid.
If a proper amount of cement
has
been added, the level of the liquid will be in its
final position at some point of the upper series of
graduations.
The final reading
shall be taken
after the flask has been immersed in the water
bath in accordance
with 6.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
