FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 29 September
1987,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the
Jute
and Jute
Products
SectionaI
Committee
had been approved
by the Textile
Division
Council,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
The work for development
of alternative
bags in place of conventional
jute bags for packing
cement
with
a view
to reducing
the
wastage
of
cement
as well as cost of packing
was taken up by the National
Council
for Cement
and Building
Materials
( NCB ), New Delhi,
at the instance
of
Ministry
of Industrial
Development,
Government
of India.
NCB with the
help of Indian
Jute
Mills
Association
and cement
industry
evaluated
a
number
of bags, made out of different
fabric constructions,
in their
labora-
tory and in actual field trials for performance.
The
Sectional
Committee,
acknowledging
the
work done
by NCB in the development
of these bags,
decided
to cover the requirements
based
on their
work in this standard.
The performance
of these bags-is comparable
to the traditional
jute
bags
for packing
cement
( see IS  :  2580-1982*
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is
complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a trst
or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accor-
dance with IS  :  2-1960-j_. The
number
of significant
places retained
in the
rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>

the stitches
at
the top

Lay the bag flat on the table,
turn the
