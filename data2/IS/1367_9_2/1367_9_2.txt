FOREWORD
This
Indian
Standard
IS  1367
( Part S/Set 2 ) which
is identical
with
IS0
6157-3
: 1988
‘Fasteners

Surface

Part 3 : Bolts, screws
and studs for special requirements’
iss_ued by International
Organization
for Standardization
( IS0 ) was
adopted
by the Bureau of
Indian
Standards
on the
recommendation
of
the
Bolts,
Nuts
and
Fasteners
Accessories
Sectional
Committee
(  LM  14 ) and approval
of Light Mechanical
Engineering
Division
Council.
The second revision
of the standard
[ IS 1367 ( Part 9 ) ] published
in 1979 was based on Draft
international
Standard
ISO/DlS
6157/l
‘Fasteners-surface
discontinuities-Part
1 : Bolts, screws
and studs with
thread sizes M5 to M39’ issued by ISO.
The standard was covering
the surface
discontinuities
of fasteners for general applications
as well as special
applications.
The revision
has
been
made
to
harmonize
with
the
International
Standards
IS0
6157-1 : 1988
and
IS0 6157-3 : 1988 to cover
general
applications
as well
as special
applications
separately
in
Section ,I and Section 2 of IS 1367
( Part 9 ).
The following
major changes
have been made
in  this revision:
a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

adopted
standard,
certain
terminology
and
conventions
are not
identical
with
those
used in Indian
Standards;
attention
is specially
drawn to the following:
a) Wherever
the words ‘International
Standard’
appear referring
to this standard,
they should
be read as ‘Indian
Standard’.
b) Comma ( , ) has heen used
as a decimal
marker
in the
International
Standard
while
in
Indian
Standards,
the current
practice
is to use a point
( . ) as the decimal marker.
In this adopted
standard
reference
appears to certain
International
Standards
for which
Indian
Standards
21~0 exist.
The corresponding
Indian
Standards
which
are to be substituted
in their
place are listed below along with their degree of equivalence
for the editions
indicated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

all products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Damages,

Inspection
and evaluation
procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>suitable tests, e.g. magnetic techniques or eddy current. If no
defective product is found the lot shall be accepted (see also
4.4). If defective products are found these shall form the lot size
for the procedures given in 4.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>For the acceptance inspection procedure, see IS0 3269. Sur-
face coatings shall be removed before examination if identifi-
cation of the surface discontinuities is impaired.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The 1984 edition of IS0 32654 gives no specifications on
sampling plans for surface discontinuities of fasteners. Until this has
been completed, the applicable sampling plan is given in the annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3
Destructive
testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If defective products are detected by the procedures given in
4.2, then a secondary sample shall be taken from the defective
products, in accordance with table 3 in the annex, consisting of
the products indicating the most serious defects and sectioned
at !W through the discontinuity where the greatest depth is
expected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1
Principles<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The manufacturer is entitled to use any inspection procedures
but due care shall be taken to ensure that products conform to
this pat-t of IS0 6157.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purchaser may use the inspection procedure specified in
this clause at his acceptance inspection in order to decide
whether a lot of fasteners may be dccepted or rejected. This
procedure shall also be applied when conformance to specifi-
cation is disputed, unless some other acceptance procedure
has been agreed between the manufacturer and the purchaser
at the time of ordering the fasteners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4
Evaluation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If on visual inspection any product is found with quench cracks
in any location, or folds at interior corners or below the bearing
surface, except “clover leaf” folds in non.circular shoulder
fasteners, the lot shall be subject to rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If on the destructive test any product is found with forging
cracks, bursts, seams and laps, voids, tool marks or damages
which exceed the allowable limits as specified for the applicable
type of discontinuity, the lot shall be subject to rejectinr,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
