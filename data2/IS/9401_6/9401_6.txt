<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(Part
6)
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards Institution on 14 December
1984, after the draft finalized by
the Measurement
of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 In measurement
of quantities, in construction of river valley projects
a large diversity of methods exists at present according to local practices.
This lack of uniformity
creates
complication
regarding
measurements
and payments.
This standard is intended to provide a uniform basis for
measurement
of ventilation
pipes and other embedded
materials
in the
construction of river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 The provisions contained
in this standard
shall generally
have
precedence
over the provisions in IS  :  1200  (  Part 2 )-1974*.
However,
the provisioris of both the standards
may be considered
complimentary
and supplementary
to each other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the result of measurement
made in accordance
with this
standard, if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded off,
it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-19607.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
( Part 6 ) covers the
method
of
measurement
of
ventilation pipes and other embedded
material
in river valley projects,
such as dams, hydraulic structures, canals and power houses.<<HEADING_END>>
