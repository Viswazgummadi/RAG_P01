<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Fourth
Revision)
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards.
after the draft
finalized
by the Wrought
Steel Products
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
m 1955 and
subsequently
revised
in 1962, 1970 and 1980.
As a result
of the experience
gained
during
these years it has been decided
to revise this
standard.
In this revision
the following
main
modifications
have been made:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Silicon
and silicon
free electrical
steel sheets and strips
in hot rolled/cold
rolled
conditions
and
fully processed/semi
processed
condition
have been
covered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Grades
have been modified.
c) Guaranteed
maximum
core losses have been specified
at
l-5
Tesla
and
values
for
maximum
core loss at 1-O Tesla have also been given for guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With a view to facilitate
the supply
of electrical
steel sheets
and strips of the exact requirements
to the
consumers,
certain
detailed
information
has to be provided
along
with
each
inquiry
and
order.
The
information
is given in Annex
A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A conversion
factor
table
is given in Annex
D for information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the
purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall
be
rounded
off in
accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960
‘Rules
for
rounding
off numerical
values
( revised)‘.
The
number
of
significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the
same as that
of the
specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

-
The coil should then be wrapped
with
waterproof
anti-rust
crape
kraft paper by lapping
axially all around the circumference.
STEP
III
-
The coil shall then be covered by polythelene
sheet or waterproof
kraft paper and the ends sealed properly.
STEP
IV
-
A galvanized
sheet
should
be wrapped
on the outside of the coil
and the two ends.
Care
should
be taken to ensure
that the ends
extend
sufficiently
over the inside diameter
of the coil.
STEP
V
-
A galvanised
sheet
should
be wrapped
on the inside of the coil;
care should be taken that it overlaps
sufficiently
over the ends of
the sheet mentioned
in (IV) above.
STEP
VI
-
Steel rings made from thick
angle
sheet
should be placed
on the
rims of the inner and outer diameters
at both ends of the coil. The
rings should be held at either ends at four points by steel bands.
STEP
VI1
-
The coi! should then bc mounted
on wooden
skids held
together
by steel bands.
STEP
VI11 --  The packing
should ensure
that
there
is no seepage
of moisture
and the sheets reach BHEL in completely
rust
free condition.
It
should be strong enough to withstand
handling
at the docks, at
sea and on the road.
STEP
IX
-
Coils should be sufficiently
tight
wound to prevent
collapse
to an
extent
that
would
preclude
their
being
mounted
on a mandrel
appropriate
to the ordered
internal
diameter.
STEP
X
-
The strip shall be of constant
width and wound in such a way that
the edges
are superimposed
in a regular
manner and that the side
faces of the coil are substantially
flat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

RESISTANCE
TEST METHOD BASED ON
FRANKLIN
TEST METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method covers
testing
of single strips or
punchings of flat rolled electrical
steel for sur-
face
insulation
resistance under predetermined
conditions
of voltage, pressure and temperature.
An average
current
from
multiple
contacts,
through one insulating coating to the metal core
of the lamination
is measured
at the contact
pressure
desired. The test range is found zero to
laOA. This
current
can be converted
into an
equivalent surface resistance
by proper conside-
ration of the test voltage and circuit resistance.
This method is particularly
suitable for quality
control in the application
if insulatmg coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
When conducting
a test in accordance
with
this  method,
single readings
should not be considered
significant
since
the nature
of the test device and
specimen are such that successive
measurements
of  a
specimen
often yield different
values.
The minimum
average of 10 known
overlapping
resistance
measure-
ments ( five on each side of sheet 1 should
be taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method
applies ten metallic
contacts
of
fixed area to the coated surface under specified
load and temperature
conditions.
The effective-
ness of the coating
insulation
between
the
surface
of these contacts
and the base metal
may then be evaluated
on the basis of a current
measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
