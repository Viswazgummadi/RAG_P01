<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee, CED 53<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This specification has been prepared with a view to clarifying and defining design requirements for different
types of reinforced
cement concrete poles used in overhead
electric power transmission,
telephone
and
telegraphs circuits. The specification relates to concrete poles in the manufacture of which mechanical compacting
methods, such as vibration, shocking, spinning, etc, have been adopted, and does not relate to hand compacted
poles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1957 and subsequently revised in 1964. The present revision has been taken
up with a view to incorporating the modification found necessary in the light of experience gained with the use
of this standard and due to revision of various referred standards, This revision incorporates significant modifications
in respect of materials, design, depth of planting, testing, sampling and inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical
committee responsible for the formulation
of this standard is given in
Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2:
1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
