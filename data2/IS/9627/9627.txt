FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution on 30 October
1980, after the draft finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Asbestos cement pressure pipes are being used in this country for a
number ofyears
and considerable
experience
is available
in regard
to
their manufacture
and use for water supply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 There are several manufacturing
units in the country manufacturing
asbestos cement
pressure
pipes ( light
duty ) used for water
supply.
Therefore,
the Sectional
Committee dealing with this subject
decided to
evolve an Indian Standard covering the requirements
of asbestos cement
pressure pipes ( light duty ) for the benefit of the manufacturers
and
users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Addition of ground silica or pozzolana to replace ordinary Portland
cement in the manufacture
has been permitted
in this specification
in
case of autoclaved pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose. of deciding
whether
a particular
requiement
of
this standard is complied with, the final
alue, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS: 2-1960”.
The
number
of sigr. ‘&ant
places
retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
