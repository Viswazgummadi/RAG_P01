FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 November
1983,
after
the draft
finalized
by
the Terminology
Relating
to River
Valley
Projects
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number
of Indian
Standards
have
already
been
published
covering
various
aspects
of River
Valley
Projects
and
a large
number
of similar
standards
are
in
the
process
of formulation.
These
standards
include
technical
terms and precise definitions
of terms which are required
to avoid
ambiguity
in
their
interpretation.
To
achieve
this
end, the Sectional
Committee
on Termiuology
Relating
to River
Valley
Projects
is bringing
out ‘Glossary
of terms
relating
to River Valley
Projects
’  which
is being
published
in parts. This
( Part VI ) contains
definitions
of terms relating to
reservoirs
and to its various
components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This
standard
was first published
in 1968.
The revision
of the stan-
dard has been taken
up in the light
of the experience
gained
during the
last few years in the use of this standard.
Some terms have been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in
this
country.
This
has
been
met
by deriving
assistance
from the
following

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard

definitions
of terms
relating

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5  Inflow Turbidity Currents -
Turbidity
currents flowing between
the lighter water and heavier water, for example, water in a reservoir at
the surface is warmer and lighter and at bottom it is colder and heavier.
This difference in densities of water will induce interflow turbidity currents
in the reach where the interflowing water has a greater density overlying
top water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Turbidity currents formed by the

The case occurs when the turbid water of the river enters the salt water
( heavier ) of the ocean.
These currents
can also occur with the water
streams discharging into comparatively
cold lakes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Undezflow Turbidity Currents, Settling Typ*
-
The flowing muddy
water not diving under the clear water, but pushing it downstream and
forms a considerable body of muddy water in which the sediment slowly
settles to the bottom, which later on flows down into the reservoir as in
the form of underflow turbidity currents.
The existence of these currents
is indirectly inferred from the deep deposit of fine materials in the stream
bed near the upper ends of some large reservoirs ( see Fig. 4  ) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
