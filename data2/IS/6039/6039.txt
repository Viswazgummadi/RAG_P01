<<HEADING level=3>>A-1. DETERMINATION OF TESTING CONSISTENCY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l .l Apparatus
-
The type of apparatus
shall be essentially
that shown
in Fig 1. It consists of a glass tube ( internal
diameter
10 mm approximately
)
which delivers
9.5 ml of mixed
cement,
two flat glass plates, and a weight.
The combined
weight
of the top-plate
and the weight
shall be 2 500 g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l .2  Procedure -
Mix trial amounts
of the powder
with 0.4 ml of the
liquid.
Then
place 0.5 ml of the mixed but unset cement
with the help of
the glass tube on a flat glass plate.
Three
minutes
after the mix is started,
place carefully
the other glass plate and the additional
weight
on -the soft
cement.
Ten minutes
after starting
the mix, measure
the average
of the
major
and
minor
diameters
of the slumped
mass of  cement.
Note
the
amount
of powder required
for making
the mix which gives the average of the
major
and
the minor
diameters
as 25 & 1 mm.
Carry
out
three
such
determinations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.3
The mean of the amounts
of powder used in the three determinations
shall be taken to be the standard
testing consistency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
