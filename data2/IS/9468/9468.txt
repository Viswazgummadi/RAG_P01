FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
1 April
1980,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the  Wrought
Steel Products
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Structural
and Metals
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With
the rapid
industrialization
in the country,
quite
a number
of
mini-steel
plants
have
come
up.
AS there
is no standard
specification
available
for ingots or cast billets,
it is felt that there may be a possibility
of
sub-standard
material
being
introduced
in
the
engineering
and
constructional
purposes
which
is not
desirable.
The
Government
of
India,
Ministry
of Industrial
Development
has desired that the mini-steel
plants should be registered
for the manufacture
of steel ingots of different
categories.
In order
to assure the quality
of ultimate
products
it has
become
necessary
to issue
standards
covering
their
products.
This
standard
is one of the standards
published
in this series.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
For
the
benefit
of
the
purchaser,
an
informative
appendix
(see Appendix
A ) giving
particulars
to be
specified
by
the
purchaser
while ordering
material
conforming
to this standard
has been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For
the
purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with, the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a test
or
analysis,
shall
be
rounded
off
in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960”.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the
rounded
off
value
should
be the same
as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
covers the requirements
for ingots ( including
cast billet
ingots ) and billets ( including
continuous
cast billets ) for the production
of mild steel rivet bars for shipbuilding.<<HEADING_END>>

under a well-defined
system of inspection,
testing
and quality
control
which is devised and supervised by IS1 and operated
by the
producer.
IS1 marked products are also continuously
checked by ISI for conformity
to that
standard
