<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after the draft finalized
by the Sanitary Appliances and Water Fittings Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Looking to the widespread use of rotational moulded polyethylene tanks for the storage of potable water
in India, the committee felt the need to bring out an Indian Standard in order to safeguard the user of
such tanks against quality and performance requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Standard was first published in 1989. In this revision of the standard following major modifications
have been made:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-
Wall thickness and weight of the tanks have been modified based on the feedback from the manufacturers
and users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-
Methods of installation and fittings have been made recommendatory
and are separately given at
Annex E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-
Method for carrying out flexural strength test has been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the preparation of this standard is given in
Annex F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values ( revised)‘.
The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>E-8
The water storage tank should not he installed

to heaters or other direct
sowces
of heat.<<HEADING_END>>

pipe is provided near the top
with mosquito
and insect proof cap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-2 The flat base  of  cylindrical  vertical or rectangular
water storage tanks should he fully supported
over
its whole bottom
area by a durable,
rigid, llat and
level platform sufficiently
strong to withstand without
dcllcction
the weight of the tank when filled fully
with the water.
In case, the tank is placed
on a
suitable
M. S. platform
then it is essential
that the
latter is fret li-om sharp edges, corners

tank may
be similar to that  shown
in  Fig 4. The different
