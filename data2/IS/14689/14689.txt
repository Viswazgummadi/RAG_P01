Committee,
CED 36<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard has been adopted by the Bureauof
Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Fire
Safety Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Printing
and Publishing
activities have established
themselves as an important industry in India.
The buildings
housing these industries
are prone to fire hazards due to the materials in these industries.
Different
materials
used and operations
involved pose fire risks due to different reasons.
Thus electrically
operated machines
may
cause fires due to sparking, overloading
and short-circuiting,
while letterpress operation produces ink mist which
adheres to walls, ceilings and being a flammable
substance, poses a risk  of  fire.  Also, many volatile substances
having low flash points are used in different operations such as offsetting, wetting, etc. All raw materials such
as paper, ink, solvents and thinners are highly flammable
materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considering
the high fire proneness
of printing and publishing
industries
and their ubiquitous
presence in all
sorts of buildings
alongside other activities makes it very important that utm~ost preventive
as well as protective
fire safety measures are provided for such buildings,
housing these industries.
This standard has been prepared
with a view to give guidance for providing
adequate safety against fire hazards in buildings,
housing printing
and publishing
industries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provisions
of this code are supplementary
to the-relevant
statutory requirements
applicable
to a particular
area
and the general
guidelines
for tire safety covered in relevant Indian Standards on fire safety.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the technical
committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard is given at
Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 SOURCES
OF FIRE HAZARDS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
lays down the essential requirements
for the fire safety
of the printing
and publishing
industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  Building Housing the Industry<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1  Most of the big printing
establishments
are
housed in buildings having mixed occupancy,
thereby
posing plural fire risks. Thus, many buildings housing
printing
press
are found
to have
business
and
mercantile
activities carried on in the same building.
Some buildings housing these industries are also partly
used
as residential,
educational
or institutional
buildings.
One building
may, thus pose several
hazards in addition to printing press hazards. Besides
above,
the printing
and publishing
industries
themselves usually have a storage godown for storing
raw materials, especially paper and ink.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian
Standards
listed
in Annex
A contain
provisions
which
through
reference
in fhis text,
constitute
provision
of this standard.
At the time of
publication,
the editions
indicated
were valid.
All
standards
are subject
to revision,
and parties
to
agreements
based on this standard are encouraged
to
investigate the possibility
of applying the most recent
editions of the standards as given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7J.2
Hence,
in cases where fire risks cannot
be
seggregated
by fire resistant
walls, the strictest fire
protection measures for highest risk shall apply to the
whole building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of this standard, the definitions
given
in IS 11097 (Part 1) shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 APPLICABILITY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2  Machinery<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 These
fire
safety
requirements
should
be
applicable
to all types and sizes of printing
industry
engaged in either the total process of paper printing or
part thereof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Electrically
operated
machines
are fraught
with
hazards of sparking, overloading
and short-circuiting
which may cause major fires.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3  Operational Process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 In
this
standard
only
the
fire
safety
requirements
involved
in printing
industry are dealt.
Other general
safety
requirements
as given in IS
I26 19 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.1  Letterpress OperGiion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This operation produces an ink mist which adheres to
walls and ceilings
and which,
because
of its oil
content, present a fire hazard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 CLASSIFlCATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.2  Offsetting Operation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of this standard, the buildings housing
these industries
should
be classified
as Group G
(moderate
hazard
occupancy)
in accordance
with
IS 1641.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This operation
may require
gas fired, oil fired or
electric
driers
to obtain
proper
paper
humidity.
Isopropyl alcohol is generally
used as wetting agent,
which has a flash point of 12â€™C. Sheet based offset is
usually
dried by spraying
with a cornstarch
based
powder which has an explosive potential greater than
that of coal-dust.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All buildings of permanent
nature should be of Type I
Construction
having external shell and load bearing
elements
of 4 hour fire resistance
rating;
while
internal/non-load
bearing walls should have 2 hour fire
resistance
rating.
Floors
should
have same fire
resistance
as that of external shells as laid down in
IS 1642.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.3
Washing and Cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>PFinting
usually
involves
frequent
washing
and
cleaning
with highly
volatile
solvents
which may
include naphtha, toluene and gasoline, all of which are
highly flammable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Raw Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.1  The raw materials used in printing, such as ink,
solvents,
thinner and paper are all highly flammable
or combustible.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.2 Any movement
of paper may generate
static
electricity
and in such a situation,
-paper dust may
provide
an ignition
source
as well as explosive
atmosphere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.2 In
motion
through
presses
and
other
equipments,
the paper may ~develop static electricity
and provide an ignition source.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 FIRE SAFETY
MEASURES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 Storage of Paper<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.51
Indoor storage of roll paper present serious fire
hazards.
Fire growsrapidly
in the flue like spaces
formed due to stacking differing diameter rolls on ends
in columns.
Fire
spread
can
quickly
raise
temperatures
so high that exposed
steel may fail
structurally.
Steel failure may rupture sprinkler piping
and~deprive
roll paper of fire protection
at a time of
maximum
need. Fire spreading up the side of a paper
column
quickly
burns through
the outer ply paper
which
then
unwinds
and peels
away from rolls,
thereby increasing
the burning surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The usual causes of fires in printing
and publishing
industries
include
electrical
equipment,
static
electricity,
cutting
and welding,
lower humidity,
surreptious
smoking and bad house keeping.
These
causes
should
be given
particular
attention
while
deciding about fire safety measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2  Fire Safety Measures in Buildings<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.1  The
constructional
details,
electrical
installations
and fire protection
installations
as
recommended
in relevant
Indian
Standards
shall be
provided.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.1.1
Initial
fire development
and intensity
differ
only slightly
for different
papers.
Hard, thin and
laminated papers burn somewhat faster than soft, thick
and coated papers.
Difference
in types of papers are
not important
in regard to fire protection
in on-end
storage,
because
the extremely
high temperatures
developed
are common to all types of papers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.2 Internal
decorations
shall be of tire resisting
materials, as specified in IS 1642.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3 The buildings
15 or more in height shall be
provided with wet riser system as per IS 3844.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.4 Refuge
area, not less than
15 m2, shall be
provided on external walls as per IS 1642.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.1.2
Although rolls stored on side avoid dangerous
peeling, a fire in this case, which is well shielded from
fire fighting efforts, may involve a larger portion of the
storage
and become
quite
intense
in the vertical
columns created between rolls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.5 All electrical
installations
shall be done as
recommended
in IS 1646 and National Electrical code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.6 Service ducts shall be enclosed
by walls and
doors, if any, of 2 hours ratings. If the ducts are larger
than 1 m2 area at the floor then proper sealing should
be done.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.1.3
Paper is sometimes
supported horizontally
on
racks by rods which run axially through the rolls. Such
an arrangement
because
of the separation
between
rolls,
has the same general
fire characteristics
as
separated vertical stocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.7 The airconditioning
ducts where provided shall
be as per the requirements
given in IS 1642.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.8 Flame
proof
electrical
equipments,
light
fittings, etc, should be provided
in the process areas
where flammable
vapours are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6  Negligence or Prohibited Activity by Workers<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6.1  Errors in operation or maintenance
of machines
and improper
handling
or storage of materials
may
cause fire.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.9 Adequate space shall be provided all round the
building
for fire brigade approach as required under
the building byelaws applicable
to that area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.2 Surreptious
smoking and such other prohibited
activities
in risk areas may also cause fires.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.10 Water
supplies
for fire fighting
shall
be
arranged as per IS 9688. Sprinklers shall be provided
in adequate numbers, keeping in view the fact that the
sprinklers
are best suited
and most reliable
fire
protection measure for majority of fire risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7  Canteen<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7.1  One or more staff canteens
are very often
operated in the printing
press building.
Hence, the
risks
generally
associated
with
LPG cylinders
constantly
remain present in these buildings
also.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.11 All high rise buildings
(compared
to other
surrounding
buildings)
shall have lighting protection
as per IS 2309.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8  Wastes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.1 Every operation
generates
wastes and fire can
flash across such deposits and spread. A large number<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.12 Portable fire extinguishers
of appropriate types
should
be deployed
throughout
the premises<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
