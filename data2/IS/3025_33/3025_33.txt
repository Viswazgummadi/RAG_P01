<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope
-
This
standard
prescribes
a method
for
determination
of
iodide
in
water
and
wastewaters.
The spectrophotometric
method shall
be followed
as a referee
method in case of
difference
of opinion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Principle
-
Iodide can be determined
in water by using its ability
to catalyze the reduction
of
cerium (IV)
by arsenious acid.
For given
reaction
conditions
and pH,
the catalytic
effect
is
proportional
to concentration
of iodide.
At the end of the fixed reaction
time,
the reaction
is
stopped
by
cooling,
The concentration
of ceric ion remaining
is determined
by measuring the
absorbance
of the
solution
at 520 nm
and comparing
with a calibrated
graph based
on the
absorbance
of iodide standard solution
treated similarly.
The detection
limit is 5 rg/l,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. Interference
-
The formulation
of non-catalytic
forms
of iodine
and inhibitory
effects
of
silver and mercury are reduced
by adding excess of sodium
chloride
that sensitized
the reaction.
The interference
of organic materials that can be oxidized
by cerium (IV)
is removed
by digesting
sample in an alkaline medium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Sample Pre-treatment
-
To eliminate
interference
from organic
materials
capable
of being
oxidized
the samples
are digested
in an alkaline
medium.
To a 6 ml sample
placed
in a test
tube, add 1 ml of zinc sulphate,
2 ml of 2 N potassium
hydroxide
and 2 drops
of a saturated
solution
of potassium chlorate solution,
and mix,
Evaporate
to
105°C
until dry.
Heat for 30
minutes
at 5OO”C, then for 1 hour
at 600°C.
After
cooling,
add 6 ml of distilled
water and
centrifuge
for 15 minutes.
If the solution
is not turbid,
it can be used for analysis.
necessary to clarify
further
by filtration.
It may be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 A 2 ml volume
of sample, standard or blank having a potassium
hydroxide
concentration
of
0.66 N is placed in a test tube.
The iodide
content
should be 0.005 to O*lOO pg.
The test tube
is placed in ice water bath and the sample permitted
to equilibrate
after which
2.0 ml of arsenious
acid solution,
ceric ammonium
sulphate
solution
are added and solution
is carefully
mixed.
The
sample is then placed in a water bath at 40’C for exactly
20 minutes. The reaction is then stopped
by placing
the test tube
in ice water bath where it is allowed
to stand
for exactly
10 minutes.
After this period, measure
the absorbance
at 520 nm using
distilled
water as a reference.
The
absorbance
of the blank is subtracted
from that
of the sample
to obtain the net absorbance
of
the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Calibration
Graph Preparation
-
Add 33 ml portions
of 2 N potassium
hydroxide
solution
to
each of a series of 100 ml volumetric
flasks.
Prepare standards and blank by adding 0 to 50.0 ml
portions
of the iodide
working
solutions
and diluting
to 100 ml.
Aliquots
of these are treated in
the same manner as are samples except that they need not be subjected to the digestion
procedure.
Plot a graph absorbance
versus  concentration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
