FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part XXX111
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 24 September
1971,
after
the draft finalized
by
the
Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
With a view to establish
uniform
procedures
for the determination
of
different
characteristics
of  soils  and also to facilitate
comparative
studies of
results,
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
is bringing
out
this
Indian
Standard
methods
of test for soils ( IS  :  2720 ) which
will be published
in
parts.
Thirty-one
parts of this standard
have been published
so far.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This part ( Part XXX111
) deals with the determination
ofdry
density
of  soil  in-place
by the water
replacement
method
using a ring.
The
in-
place  density of natural
soil is needed
for the
determination
of bearing
capacity
of soils, for the purpose
of stability
analysis
of natural
slopes,
for the determination
of pressures
on underlying
strata
for
calculation
of settlement,
etc.
In
compacted
soils the
in-place
density
is needed
to
check
the
amount
of
compaction
that
the
soil
has
undergone
for comparison
with design data.
The
correct
estimation
of the in-place
density of both natural
and compacted
soils is therefore
of importance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In reporting
the results of a test or analysis
made
in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value, observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
( Part
XXX111
) covers the method for determining
the
in-place
density
of a coarse grained soil including
gravels,
cobbles,
boulders
and rock by the water replacement
method
using a circular
ring on the
surface and a plastics film to retain the water ( see Notes 1 and 2 >.
Norx 1-
If desired,
successive
density
tests may be performed
as the hole
is pro-
gressively  deepened
to  determine the vartion
of density with depth, for example,
when placing  and compacting
material
in relatively.

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Density
Ring and Steel Spikes  (if required)
-The
ring diameter
shall be at least 3 to 4 times the size of the largest particle.
The
diameter
usually ranges between
O-5 and 2.5 m in multiples
of 0.5 m.
The
rings
may be made of 4 to 8 mm
mild steel sheet,
either
in one
unit
( when
smaller ) or in segments
( when bigger)
with
suitable
provisions
for
assembling
in the field.
The rings may be of any
construction
provided
the inner
surface
is that of a right
cylinder
approximately
10 to 20 cm
high
and
horizontal
flanges
of 10
to 25

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.1
For small test holes, and for test holes located
in sites which
are
not readily
accessible,.
the most convenient
and
economical
method
of
delivering
and measurmg
water may be by hand or by syphon hose from a
small calibrated
container
( waler can).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.2
For
larger
test
holes
in readily
accessible
sites,
it
is
usually
advantageous
to use one or more
calibrated
water
tanks
for measuring
the water
when
filling the hole covered with plastics film, and to provide
a portable,
power driven, self priming
pump for removing
the water
after
each
filling.
Each
calibrated
tank
should
be provided
with an outlet
valve and an attached
volume
measuring
gauge.
Delivery
holes
from
such tanks shall be fitted with a valve at the delivery end so that the flow
of water into the hole covered with the plastics
film
can be suitably
con-
trolled when the water level approaches
the level of the pointer gauge,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.2.1
The
area
of each
calibrated
tank should
be
such that
the
graduations
on its volume
measuring
gauge
can be easily
read.
Tanks
used for filling holes of large capacity
should have volume gauges
graduat-
ed at
10  and
1 litre intervals;
gauges
on tanks
used for filling
holes of
smaller
capacity
should be graduated
at 2 and 0.2 litre intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.2.2
The graduations
on the volume measuring
gauges of calibrated
tanks shall be verified.
To verify the graduations
proceed
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Fill each tank with water to the top graduation
on the gauge
and
draw off successive
volumes so that the water level drops
to each
graduation
in turn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Calculate
the volumes
drawn
off from the weight
of each with-
drawal and compare
with the volumes
read on the gauge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Remove
the pointer
gauge bar to a safe position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  -  For  small rings the  pointer  is often mounted on a datum
bar supported
on
legs driven into the ground outside the ring.
The datum should be made so that it
can be removed
between readings, and replaced with the pointer in precisely the same
position. For large rings, which are usually more stable, it is usual to lay a small datum
bar on the rim of the ring if it is a flat flange, marking the position so that the bar can
be returned accurately to the same position, or the bar may be suitably clamped to the
ring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4
After
checking
for punctures,
spread
the plastics
film over
the test
surface and the ring taking care
to remove all the wrinkles.
Replace
the
pointer gauge bar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5
Fill the plastics film-ring
assembly
with water to the precise level of the
pointer
(see Note 1 ). While
filling,
ensure the film makes full contact
with
the test surface
and the inside surface
of the ring.
Check
for leaks (see
Note 2 ).
The measured
volume
of water
used is the initial
reading
Vi
for the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -The
required accuracy of volume measurement depends on the volume of
the test hole and the diameter of the ring used.
For smaller test holes and rings, record
the volume to the nearest 09 litre.
For larger test holes and
rings, a lesser accuracy
may suffice.
Since the test cannot be easily repeated,
all observations
and recordings
should be independently checked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7
Excavate,
as nearly as practicable,
a cylindrical
cavity
within the ring
using the digging
tools.
When
excavating
very coarse materials,
it may be
necessary
to employ a mechanical
device,
such as a tripod
with
either
a
block
and  tackle or a chain
hoist,
for lifting
large
rocks from
the cavity.
Make
the wall of the cavity
as near vertical
as possible;
but avoid under-
cutting
the  ring  and deformation
of the cavity.
The
movement
of heavy
equipment
in  the immediate
test area should
not be permitted.
Leave
in
place
any  large rocks near the cavity boundary.
Keep
the floor and wall
of the  cavity
as  even as possible
and free from sharp
protrusions
which<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>may puncture
the plastics film. When
the desired depth
(see Note 1 under
1.1 )  has been reached,
clean all loose material
from the cavity.
Carefully
collect
all the excavated
material
in containers
( see Note 1 ) and weigh
each to the nearest 0.1 kg.
Sum
the individual
weights of the material
in
the
containers
to obtain
the total weight (  W, )  of the excavated
material
(see Note 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -Use
containers with close fitting lids when testing soils and
absorbent
rocks holding significant amounts of water.
To avoid undue loss of moisture, the cover
shall be kept on the container at all times when the soil is not being pIaced in it.
In
hot and dry climate, shade for the test area and a damp cloth over the container
shall
be provided.
When the material consists predominantly of hard,
non absorbent
rock
of negligible moisture content, open containers are satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 -
If practicable,
large rocks in excess of scale capacity
may be broken into
smaller pieces.
Alternatively, their volume may be determined
by water displacement
and their weight computed using the specific gravity of the stone.
If larger
rocks are
broken, it shall be ensured that all fragments from each rock are weighed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.7.1  The
gradation
of particles
in the
excavated
material
may
be
determined,
if desired by sieving it through
sieves specified in 2.12.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8
When
the moisture
content
of all or part of the material
will have a
significant
effect
on the field dry density,
determine
the moisture
content
i  of the soil in accordance
with IS  :  2720 ( Part II )-1969*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8.1
The
sample
for
moisture
content
shall be representative
of the
whole of the soil excavated
except that, if only the density
of the material
smaller than a given size is required,
any stone coarser
than this size shall
first be removed.
The moisture
sample should be as large as is practicable
and
convenient.
It should
be
collected
in an airtight
moisture
content
container
by incrementally
sampling
the excavated
soil during
the course
of
the
digging
operations
and
after
the increments
of  W,
(see  3.7 )
have been weighed.
In taking moisture content
sub-samples
of soil contain-
ing coarse
rock fragments,
neglect
rocks larger
than
80 mm if these
are
predominantly
non-absorbent
and in surface dry condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9 After checking
for punctures,
and taking
care to remove all
wrinkles,
spread the plastics film properly
into the cavity
thus formed.
Replace

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10
Fill the cavity
covered
with plastics
film  with water
to the precise
level of the pointer
as set for the initial
volume measurement
( see Note 1
under 3.5).
When delivering
water to larger test cavities
from calibrated
tanks, run an exact number
of litres of water rapidly
into the film-covered
cavities,
from a larger tank equipped
with a delivery hose capable of supply-
ing the bulk of the water in a relatively
few minutes.
A smaher
tank may
then
be
used
for slowly
bringing
the water
level
to
the
tip
of
the

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.12.1
Sieve
the
material
excavated
from the cavity.
Determine
the
weight
W, and volume  V,  of stones retained
on the sieve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.12.2
The volume  V,  of the stones in the sample
may
be determined
directly
by displacement
of water
from a graduated
flask or syphon
can
from which the overflow can be accurately
measured
or by weighing
the
stones,
or
by weighing
the
stones
in air
and
water,
calculating
their
specific gravity
( see Note ) and determining
their volume by dividing
their
weight by their specific gravity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  For  construction control,-the  volume of stones need not be measured
every
time a test is made.
From  the experience gained after a number of successive tests, if
it is found that the specific gravity of stones from particular source is constant,
a suit-
able value for the specific gravity
may be assumed
and the volume computed
by
obtaining the weight of stones in a wet surface-dry condition
and dividing the weight
by the assumed specific gravity of the stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
