FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institu-
tion on 3b May 1969, after the draft finalized by the,Safety in Construction
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Pile driving and well sinking are specialized jobs involving a lot of
hazards which sometimes lead to accidents.
It is necessary that certain
safety rules are laid down for every phase of work involved and that these
are meticulously followed by each member of the crew working on the jobs,
not only for his own safety but also for the safety of his fellow workers and
onlookers.
This standard has, therefore,
been formulated
to lay down
safety requirements
for pile driving and for preparing deep foundations
including well sinking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination among the standards and practices prevailing in
different
countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard
is one of a series of Indian Standards eon safety in
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shail be rounded off in accordance’ with
IS: 2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard lays down the safety requirements
for piling and other
deep foundations as stated below:
a) Safety measures while working with a piling rig, and
b) Safety measures while preparing other deep foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules’ for rounding off numerical values (  revised ).<<HEADING_END>>
