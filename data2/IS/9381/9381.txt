FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 20 December
1979,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Bitumen
and Tar Products
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by
the Civil Engineering
Division
Council
and Petroleum,
Coal and Related
Products
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A compilation
of methods
of test
for testing
tar and
bituminous
materials
for their
various
characteristics
has already
been
prepared
( see IS  :  1201-1978
to IS  :  1220-1978*
).
However,
it has now been felt
necessary
to establish
a method
of test to determine
the behaviour
of
bituminous
materials
under
low temperatures
and to find out whether
these products
would stand
the low temperature
or  not.
Accordingly,
this standard
has been
prepared
to cover
the method
of test
for the
determination
of
FRAASS
breaking
point
of
solid
and
semi-solid
bitumens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for
the
preparation
of
this
standard
has taken
into consideration
the views of producers,
consumers
and technologists
and has related
the standard
to the manufacturing
and
trade
practices
followed
in the country
in this field.
Due weightage
has
also
been
given
to
the
need
for
international
co-ordination
among
standards
prevailing
in different
countries
of the world.
These considera-
tions
have
led the Sectional
Committee
to derive
assistance
from
the
publications
of Institute
of Petroleum,
United
Kingdom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In reporting
the result of a test or analysis
made in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value, observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-19601_.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
covers
the method
of test
for the
determination
of
FRAASS
breaking
point of solid and semi-solid
bitumens.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard,
the following
definitions
and those
given in IS  :  334-1965*
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  FRAASS Breaking Point -
It is the temperature
at which
bitumen
first becomes
brittle
as indicated
by the appearance
of cracks
when
a
thin
film
of the
bitumen
on a metal
plaque
is cooled
and flexed
in
accordance
with the specified
condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Bending Apparatus -
It consists
of two concentric
tubes
(A) of
insulating
materials:
such as Pyrex glass or porcelain,
at the lower
end of
which steel clips
or jaws
(Bj
are tightly
fixed.
The
part of the inner
tube
which
lies between
the IWO clips is slotted
so that
the bulb
af the
thermometer,
which
firs  into ihe inner
tube, is exposed.
I3y rotating
a
handle
(C)
which
operates
a cone-and-peg
mechanism
the inner
tube
may be moved up and down relative
to the outer tube,
thereby
va.rying
the distance
between
the clips.
Ten
to twelvr
rotations
of the handle
shall
decrease
the distance
between
the clips
by 3’5 & 0.2
mm
from
maximum
of 39.9 f
1 mm ( see Fig.
1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Plague -
It
is
made
of
springy
steel
41 f
0’05
mm
long,
20 & 0.2
mm wide and 0.15
& 0.02
mm thick.
The
plaque
shall
be
kept Bat when  not
in use.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Cooling
Appas-atus -
It ci,nsists
of
a wide
test-tube
!E)
held
eccentrically
in a second wider test tube (G)
by means
of a rubber
bung
which
also holds
a small
funnel
[H).
The
larger
test-tube
is, in turn,
held by a large rllbber
or cork bung in an outer cylinder
(K;.
The
test-
tube
(E)
and
the
cylinder
(K)
contain
a small
quantity
of calcium
chloride
or anhydrone.
The
bending
apparatus
is supported
in (E) by
means
of a rubber
bung
(0’).
The
wider
test-tube
(Gj  and the outer
cylinder
(K) may be replaced
by an unsilvered
vacuum
flask of suitable
dimensions
( see Fig.
1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5  Plate
and Stand -
It consists
of a metal
heating
plate
approxi-
mately
5 mm
thick
with
an iron
baffle
plate,
1 to 2 mm
thick,
at a
distance
of  about
50 mm below its upper surface.
The plates
which
are
of suitable
shape
and
size,
are
supported
on a stand
equipped
with
levelling
screws.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Preparation
of Test Sample
-
Soften
the material
to the pouring
consistency
at a temperature
not more
than
60°C
for tars
and
pitches
and not more than
90°C
for bituminous
materials
above
the respective
approximate
softening
point and stir it thoroughly
until it is homogeneous
and is free from air bubbles
and water.
Prepare
the convenient
number
of plaques
as given in 4.1.1
and 4.1.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1
For Materials of Softening Point Below 70°C -
Place
an amount
of
the sample
corresponding
to 0’40 + 0.01
ml in the unheated
liquid or
solid state
on a clean
tared
plaques.
For
normal
bitumens
of specific
gravity
l-03
& 0.4
at 27”C,
a weight
of O-4 f
0’01
g may
be used.
Place
the plaque
on heating
plate and heat the baffle plate
continuously
until the bitumen
just flows.
Manipulate
the plaque
by hand,
replacing
on the heating
plate, if necessary,
until
the plaque
is uniformly
coated.
Obtain
the final
smooth
film by replacing
the
plaque
on
the
heating
plate for a short
time.
Reweigh
the plaque
when it has cooled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS :  9381 - 1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2  For Materials of Softening Point Above iO”C -
Place
an amount
of
the sample
corresponding
to 0.40 & 0.01 ml in the unheated
state
on a
clean
tared plaque.
The
amount
of bitumen
shall be the same
as given
in 4.1.1.
Place the plaque
on the heating
plate until the bitumen
is soft
enough
to mould yet not soft enough
to stick
to the fingers.
A rough
uneven
film is obtained
by moulding
the bitumen,
reheating,
if necessary.
Obtain
the final
smooth
film by replacing
the
plaque
on
the heating
plate for a short time.
Reweigh
the plaque
when it has cooled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
conveniently
conducting
the test and
to make
measuring
of
bitumen
more
accurate,
the prescribed
quality
of bitumen
for each
test
may
either
be weighed
directly
on the steel
strip
or extruded
from
a
small press shown
in Fig. 2.
The
mould
of the press is cylindrical
in
form,
measuring
20 mm in diameter
by 20 mm in height,
having
a slit in
the bottom
20 mm long by 0’5 mm
wide through
which
is extruded
a
04-ml
strip of standard
dimension.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3
If necessary,
remove
bubbles
from
the surface
of the film by
shock cooling
the heated
bitumen
and subsequent
reheating.
The sudden
cooling
can conveniently
be achieved
by pressing
the heated
plaque
on
the powdered
solid carbon
dioxide.
Protect
the plaque
from
dust and
allow it to stand for one to four hours before
testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
Fill the annular
space between
wide test-tube
(E)
and eccentric
test-
tube (G) to about half its height
with acetone.
Place the plaque
between
the clips of the bending
apparatus,
bending
the plaque
gently
to do so,
and mount
the bending
apparatus
in the wide
test-tube
(E).
Add solid
carbon
dioxide
through
the funnel
to the acetone
at such a rate
that the
temperature
falls
at
a rate
of
1°C
per
minute.
Commencing
at
a
temperature
of at least
10°C
above
the expected
breaking
point,
bend
the plaque
once
every
minute
by turning
the handle
at a rate
of one
rev/set
until
it is checked
and
then
turning
it backwards
at the same
speed.
Record
the temperature
at which
one or more cracks
appear on
bending
as the breaking
point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  REPORTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  Calculate
the
mean
of three
determinations
which
lie between
a
