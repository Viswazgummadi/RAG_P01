<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized
by the
Foundation
Engineering
Sectional
Committee,
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This code is meant to provide necessary information
and assistance in the choice of vibration
isolators
in machine foundation
so as to ensure a smooth working of the machinery
supported by it as well as to
reduce the transmitted
vibration into the surrounding
environment.
It does not imply,
however,
that
use of external isolators is obligatory
in a machine foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.  The number of signifi-
cant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Further, the stiffness
of the rubber pad depends
on the level
of the static
stress and the amplitude
of
vibration ( or dynamic strain ). Laboratory
tests in the form of steady state resonance
tests
are,
therefore,
recommended
on
randomly
chosen product
samples under
the expected
static
stress and dynamic
strain
levels. This will provide
the true
picture
of
the
dynamic
stiffness
and
damping
present
in vibration
isolators,
that
are
being
commercially
marketed
today.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The dynamic characteristics
of cork pads
show
considerable
scatter
and
non-
linearity.
Tests
have
shown
that
the
thickness of the cork pad, the static stress
level
and
the
amplitude
of vibration
influence its dynamrc properties.
Besides,
considerable
creep
deformation
occurs
under
a given static stress level and this
tends to increase the stiffness and reduce
isolation efficiency.
All the above factors
are required
to
be
considered
in the

<<PARAGRAPH>>Bearing Pressure -
The allowable bearing
pressure on cork pads usually varies be-
tween 1 and 4 kg/cm*. The true value shall
be ascertained
from the manufacturers’
recommendation
based on tests.
Cork
sheets
lose their
strength
under
compressive loads if the edges of the pads
are left free.
Hence,
the side faces have
to be enclosed in steel frames to prevent
their lateral
expansion.
Contact
with oil or water
reduces the
efficiency of cork pads and hence shall be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the depth
of the trench

the Rayleigh

length of the shear wave ( L,).
The latter
is
given by [( G/P )1/s/f] where G is shear modulus,
