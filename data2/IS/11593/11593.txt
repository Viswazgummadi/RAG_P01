<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This-Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian Standards Inslitu-
tion on 18 March 1986, after the draft finalized by the Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Indian Standards
Institution
has already
published a series of
standards
on methods
of testing soils.
It has been recognized that
reliable
and intercomparable
test results
can be obtained
only with
standard
testing
equipment
capable
of giving
the
desired
level of
accuracy.
Series
of Indian
Standards
covering the specifications
of
equipments
used for testing
soils are therefore
being formulated
to
encourage their development
and manufacture
in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The equipment
covertd
in this standard
is used as a part of the
assembly for the equipment
used for the laboratory
determination
of
shear strength of the soil [ see 1s  :  2720 ( Part 39/Set  1 ) -  1977* 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting
the rtsult of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard, if the final value,
observed
calculated,
is to be rounded
off,  it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2 - 19tO?.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  The
equipment
covered
in
this
standard
is used as a part of the
assembly for the equipments
used for laboratory
determination
of direct
shear strength of the soil material with particle size up to 25 mm, that is,
soils containing moorums, sands, gravels and other aggregates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. GENERAL
REQUIREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The shear box shall consist of the following
( see Fig. I ):

with the
requirements
of that standard
under
a well-defined
system of inspection,
testing
-and quality
control
which is devised
and supervised
by IS1 and operated
by the
producer.
IS1 marked products
are also continuously
checked
by IS1 for confor-
mity to that standard
as a further safeguard.
Details
of conditions
under which
a licence for the use of the 1.31 Certification
Mark may be granted to manufacturers
or processors
may be obtained
from the Indian Standards
