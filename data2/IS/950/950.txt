water is necessary for fire fighting and a high degree of
manoeuvrability is also desired of the fire appliance at the same time.
This standard was first published in 1959 and revised in 1970. The
second revision is being based on the experience gained in the past 10
years. The revision includes provision of higher capacity of water

and Amendment No. 2 (October 1984). Side bar indicates modification
of the text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.
0.4  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
