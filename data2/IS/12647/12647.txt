<<HEADING level=3>>FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 28 February
1989, after
the draft finalized by the Solid Wastes Sectional Committee
had
been approved
by the Chemical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Solid waste management
system ( SWMS ) for a city consists of various stages, such as, collection,
transportation,
processing and disposal.
The refuse &commonly
collected
in different areas of the
city in dustbins.
Nearby residents and
road sweepers deposit the solid waste in such dustbins.
As
the dustbin ,is common for the population
in particular
area,
it can be termed
as ‘community
dustbin’.
The community dustbin serves as an intermediate
storage
for solid wastes from which
the refuse is transported to processing or disposal site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In developed countries,
‘house to house’ collection is adopted,
namely,
collection vehicle
goes to
every house and collects the refuse.
The citizens are also more
cooperative
to this public service.
Level
of public awareness
to the importance
of this system is quite appreciable
and hence the
citizens expect
still better services.
Civic agencies
in order
to give better
services
expect more
cooperation from the citizens. For this purpose, number of bye-laws are framed to ensure a sanitary
and hygienic process of collection.
In India, due to the absence of any effective bye-laws, the job
of municipal corporations
becomes more difficult.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In India, normally community
bin system is adopted
for collection of solid wastes.

<<PARAGRAPH>>4 COLLECTION
OF REFUSE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.0 During
collection
of refuse,
normally
swee-
pers
are
allotted
specific
areas,
A sweeper
is
supposed
to  sweep
the
road
with
his broom.
With
the
help
of a steel
pan
or a basket,
he
takes the swept
refuse
to a community
dustbin.
Such type
of collection
procedure
requires
three
types
of equipment,
namely,
brooms,
collection
receptacles
and r:
xge receptacles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2  Sttrl  Pans ( GHAMELAS

and 200 mm in depth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This should
be made
out
of high
carbon
steel
sheet of size 300  X  300  X  6  mm and given a protec-
tive coating
of black paint.
The
spade
should
have 750 mm
long teak
handle
having
40 mm
diameter
( stt IS 2238  :  1979 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Brooms<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These
are used
for sweeping
the
area.
These
can
be of short handle
and
long handle
types.
Long handle
brooms
should
be used as the worker
need not
bend
while
sweeping,
leading
to lesser
contact
of dust
and
lesser
strain
due
to
the
straight
posture
while
sweeping.
The
specifica-
tion of commonly
used brooms
are as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

These
are of the follow-
ing types.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1 Spacing of  Dustbin<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
efficient
collection,
it is necessary
to have
community
dustbins
placer1  at  suitable
sites.
If
these
dustbins
are
not
placed
properly,
the
generated
quantity
will not reach
there
comple-
tely.
This will result
in
reduction
in
efficiency

The
governing
factors
for
spacing
of dustbins
can be detailed
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.1  People
are #rormally
reluctant
to have a
community
dustbin
~  installed
near to their place.
Therefore,
it is very
difficult
to locate
it at the
most
appropriate
place.
These
dustbins
are,
therefore,
commonly
located
at
intersections
of
roads,
near community
garden
or public
utilities
and similar
other places.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>circular,
it will have
a radius
of 50 m.
TllllS,
this dustbin
will be able to serve up to a distance
of 50 m
giving
a distance
of 100  m  between
consecutive
dustbins.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.3
As the
population
density
reduces,
tire
area served
by
a dustbin
of capacity
1 ms \\ill
be more.
This will result
in increase
in distance
through
which
the residents/sweepers
will have
to transport
the refuse.
Obviously,
this will not
be accepted
by the residents
and
will result
in
creation
of open collection
points.
To avoid this
phenomenon,
dustbins
of lesser
capacity
should
be installed
so that the average
distance
to be
travelled
is within
the acceptable
limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>!
4.3.1.2
Population
density
plays a very
impor-
tant role
in
this aspect.
Normally,
population
density
varies
between
500
to  2 000
persons/
hectare.
Dustbins
of 1 ma capacity
can accommo-
date 509 kg of refose.
If the frequency
of refuse
removal
is assumed
as once
in
three
days,
on
daily basis
about
165 kg of refuse can be stored
in such
a dustbin.
This means
that ~about
400
persons
can bc served
by this dustbin
( assuming
refuse generation
rate of 0.4 kg/capita/day
). At
the
population
density
of 500 personsihectare,
the area occupied
by
400 persons
will
be about
0.8
hectares.

this
area
is
considered
as<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

they can
