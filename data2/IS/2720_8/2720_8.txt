<<HEADING level=1>>(Second Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Second
Revision
) was adopted
by  the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 28 November
1983, after the draft
finalized
by
the
Soil
Engineering
and
Rocks
Mechanics
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Purpose
of
a laboratory
compaction
test is to determine
the proper
amount
Df mixing
water to be used, when
compacting
the soil in the field
and
the
resulting
degree
of
denseness
which
can
be
expected
from
compaction
at
optimum
moisture
content.
To
accomplish
this,
a
laboratory
test which
will give
a degree
of compaction
comparable
to
that
obtained
by the field
method
used is necessary.
This
procedure
is
satisfactory
for cohesive
soils but does not lend itself well to the study of
the compaction
characteristics
of clean
sands or gravels
which displace
easily
when
struck
with
rammer.
Some
nearly
cohesionless
soils
compact
satisfactorily
in the standard
test although
in many
cases the
water
density
curiae is not well defiued.
Frequently,
too in these cases
indicated,
maximum
density
is not as great as can be achieved
readily
in
the
field
under
available
conlpaction
methods.
With a knowledge
of
the water density
relation
as determined
by this test, better control
of the
field
compaction
of soil fill is possible
because
the
optimum
moisture
content
and the density
which
should be obtained
are known by using this
test
procedure
and
these
can
be checked
by field control
tests.
This
part
which
was first published
in 1965 and revised
in I974
covers the
method
of test based on heavy
compaction.
The method
of test based on
light
compaction
is covered
in IS  :  2720 ( Part 7 )-1’~80*.
This revision
is
prepared
so as to cover
such
cases
when
soil could
be susceptible
to crushing
~during compaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of this

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Soil
Not
Susceptible
to Crushing
During
Compaction
( see
Note under
4.1 ) -
The procedure
is as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
A 5-kg
sample
of air dried soil passing the 1%mm
IS test sieve
shall
be taken
(see Note

to fill the mould,
leaving
not more
than
about
6 mm
to be struck
off when
the extension
is removed
(see
Note
4 ),
The
extension
shall
be removed
and the compacted
soil shall be levelled
off carefully
to the
top of the mould by means of the straightedge.
The
monld
and soil shall then be weighed
neaIest
to 1 g ( ~2“ ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3
The
compacted
soil specimen
shall be removed
from the mould
and placed
on the mixing
tray.
The
water
content
of a representative<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>sample
of the specimen
shall
be determined
as in
IS  :  2720 ( Par:
2 )-

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4
The
remainder
of the soil specimen
shall be broken
up, rubbed
through
the
19-mm
IS test sieve,
and
then
mixed
with the remainder
of the original
sample.
Suitable
increments
of water ( SCE Note 5 ) shall be
added
successively
and mixed
into the sample,
and the above procedure
from
operations
5.1.2
to 5.1.4 shall
be repeated
for each
increment
of
water
added.
The
total
number
of determinations
made
shall
be at
least
five,
and the moisture
contents
should
be such
that
the optimum
moisture
content,
at which
the maximum
dry density
occurs,
is within
that range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2
Soil
Susceptible
to
Crushing
During
Compaction
(see
Note
under
4.1 ) -
The procedure
is as follows  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1
Five or more 2.5 kg samples
of air-dried
soil passing the 1%mm
IS sieve,
shall
be taken
( see Note 1 ). The samples
shall each be mixed
thoroughly
with
different
amounts
of warer
to give a suitable
range of
moisture
contents
(see Notes 2 and 3 ).
The
range
of moisture
content,
at which
the
maximum
dry density
occurs,
is within
that
range
( .W
Kate 5 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2
Each
sample shall be treated
as in 5.1.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3
Each
specimen
shall be treated
as in 5.1.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4
The remainder
of each soil specimen
shall be discarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3
Compaction
ilm
Large
Size
Mould
-
For
compacting
soil
containing
coarse
material
up to 37.5 mm
size,
the
2 250 cm3
mould
should
be used. A sample
weighing
about
30 kg and passing the 37.5 mm
IS sieve is used for the test.
Soil is compacted
in fibe layers,
each
layer
being
given 55 blows of the 4*9-kg rammer.
The
test of the procedure
is the same as in 5.1 or 5.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
The removal
of small
amounts
of stone
( up to 5 percent
) retained
on
a 1%mm
IS sieve
will
effect
the density
obtainable
only

<<HEADING level=3>>IS ,: 2720 ( Part 8 ) - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>with the experimental
error
involved
in measuring
the
maximum
dry density;
The
exclusion
of a
large
proporation
of stone
coarser
than
19-mm
may
have
a major
effect
on the density
obtained
compared
with
that
obtainable
with soil as a whole,
and
on the optimum
moisture
content.
There
is at present
no generally
accepted
method
of
test
of
calculation
for
dealing
with
this
difficulty
in
comparing
laboratory
compaction
test
results
with
densities
obtained
in the field.
For
soils
containing
larger
proportions
of gravel,
the use of a bigger
mould
( 2250  ems  )  will
avoid
major
errors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2-The
amount
of
water
to be
mixed
with
air-dried
soil
at
the
commencement
of the test will vary with the type of soil under
test.
In general,
with sandy
and gravelly
soils a moisture
content
of 3 to 5 percent
would
be-suitable,
whiie
with
cohesive
soils a moisture
content
about
12 to 16 percent
below
the plastic
limit
of the soil should
usually
be suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NWTE 3 -
It  is important
that
the water
is mixed
thoroughly
and adequately
with
the
soil,
since
inadequate
mixing
gives
rise
to variable
test
results.
This
is
particularly
important
with
cohesive
souls when
adding
a substantial
quantity
of
water
to the
air-dried
soil.
With
clays
of high plasticity,
or where
hand
mixing
is
employed,
it may be difficult
to distribute
the water
uniformly
through
the air-dried
soil by mixing
alone,
and it may be necessary
to store the
mixed
sample
in a sealed
container
for a minimum
period
of about
16 hours
before
continuing
with
the test,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  4.-
It  is  necessary
to control
the total
volume
of soil compacted,
since
it
has
been
found
that
if the amount
of soil struck
off after
removing
the extension
is
too great,
the test results
will be inaccurate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 5 -
The
water
added
for each
stage
of the test should
be such
that
a
range
of moisture
contents
is obtained
which
includes
the
optimum
moisture.
In
general,
increments
of
1 to 2 percent
are suitable
for sandy
and
gravelly
soils and
of 2 to 4 percent
for cohesive
soils.
To increase
the accuracy
of the test it
is often
advisable
to reduce
the increments
of water
in the region
of the
optimum
moisture
content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and quoted
to the nearst O-2 for values
below 5 percent
to the nearest
0.5 for values from 5 to 10 percent,
and to
the nearest

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5 The
method
of obtaining
the result shall be stated,
( 4*9-kg
rammer
method
).
The procedure
used shall also he stated that
is single

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  -For~sorne
highly permeable
soils such
as clean
gravels,
uniformily
graded
and coarse
cleen
sands the results of the laboratory
compaction
test ( 4.9-
rammer
method )
may
provide
only. a poor
guidr
tor specifications
on !ield
compaction.
The laboratory
test often Indicates higher values of optimum
moisture
content
than would be desirable for field compaction
and thr maximum dry density
is often much lower than the state of compaction,
that can readily be obtained in the
field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
