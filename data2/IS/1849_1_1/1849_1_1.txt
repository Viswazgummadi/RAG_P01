<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian
Standard
(Part
l/Set 1 ) (Second
Revision
)  was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 23 May
1990, after the draft finalized
by the Building
Lime
and Lime Products
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For refinement
and standardization
of the technique
of manufacture
of building
limes,
which
are mostly produced
in small scale industries,
it was felt that guidelines
for the design of lime
kiln based on studies carried
out by the Central Building Research
Institute,
Roorkee,
Khadi
and
Village
Industries
Commission
and Gujarat
Engineering
Research
Institute,
Vadodara
could be
formulated
so that it will be helpful in setting up kilns for the manufacture
of building
lime in
the villages and small-scale
industries.
For efficient
design of kiln a number of factors, such as
chemical
composition
of limestone,
type of the fuel and output required
are to be considered.
This standard
give general
guidance
for the design and installation
of lime kiln in which
the
charge
is fed from top and lime is drawn
from
the bottom
of the shaft
through
discharge
opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1967 and subsequently
revised
in 1976 based
on studies
conducted
by Khadi

Commission.

Part
1 of this standard
has been split into
two sections,
Section
1 covering
the masonry type shaft and Section 2 covering the reinforced

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules
for rounding
off numerical

The
number of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
