<<PARAGRAPH>>Stones Sectional Committee,
CED 6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by
the Stones Sectional Committee,
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Granite
is an important
structural
and ornamental
stone because of its high compressive
strength
and  durability.
Dimensioned
granite
should take and preserve high polish as it is susceptible of
being carved for ornamental,
monumental
and inscription
purposes. Uniformity
in grain size and
the uniform distribution
of the constituent
minerals
generally
control the colour, appearance,
quality and the strength of the rocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Based on appearance,
granites may be broadly classified as
i) Pink granites
( mostly covers alkali granites ); and
ii) Grey and multi-coloured
granites ( covering mostly talc alkali granites ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Granites occuring in several parts of India are widely distributed
through out the archean terrain.
Pink, red, grey and other multi-colour
granites are presently
being produced
and exported
from
the country.
This standard
h.as therefore
been formulated
to guide the users as well as exporters
about the various quality parameters
of polished granite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
is formulated
in parts. Part 1 of this standard has been formulated
for granite only.
The other parts of this standard
covering rest of the building stones are under preparations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values ( revised )‘. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The compsition
of the technical
committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard
is
given at Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Slabs may be marked
in a suitable manner
with the manufacturer’s
identification
mark or
initials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
Indian
Standards
listed in Annex A are
necessary adjuncts to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 BIS Certification
Marking<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The product may also be marked with Standard
Mark.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Granites
should be free from
all imperfec-
tions and injurious minerals
that may interfere
with the appearance,
strength,
structural
inte-
grity and its amenability
to take good
polish.
Imperfections
are
mostly
imparted
by the
textural
variations which is a function
of degree
of uniformity
and
the
distribution
of the
constituent
minerals.
Hair
line cracks/joints,
flowers, moles, knots, white
and dark lines due
to segregation
of light
coloured
minerals
in
multi-coloured
granites
and
ferromagnesium
minerals
in light
coloured
granites are consi-
dered to be the imperfections.
Granites
should
be free from deletereous
minerals such as pyrite,
marcasite
and minerals such as biotite,
chlorite,
ilmenite,
etc, which interfere
with the
colour
and appearance
on weathering
and also affect
polishing characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1 The use of the Standard Mark is governed
by the provisions of Bureau
of Indian Standards
Act, 1986 and the Rules and Regulations
made
thereunder.
The details of conditions
under
which the licence for the use of Standard
Mark
may be granted to manufacturers
or producers
may be obtained
from
the Bureau
of Indian
Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Lot
In any consignment
all the slabs of the same
quarry shall be grouped together to constitute
a
lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.1  Samples
