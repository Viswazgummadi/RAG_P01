<<PARAGRAPH>>arrangements
for storage of  kapas,  cotton
seeds,
waste cotton,
if any, and fully pressed
bales.
This standard
has been formulated to cover all
these aspects. This standard
was first published
in 1964. Based
on
the
recommendations
of
Tariff
Advisory
Committee
on
the
basis
of
experience
gained by them in the past 24 years,
this revision has been prepared.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard ( First Revision > was
adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
on
29 February
1988, after the draft finalized by the
Fire
Safety
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.
0.2 Fires
occur
quite
frequently
in the gin
houses, delintering machines and cotton
openers
usually installed in press houses due to frictional
heat of high speed machines and also sparks from
foreign material
coming
in along
with  kupas,
cotton
or cotton seeds. Further, oily and greasy
cotton
waste and cotton
seeds are subject to
spontaneous
heating. The other
causes of fire
in this type of factories
are bad house-keeping,
congestion
and faulty
electrical
equipment.
In
order to reduce fire losses, besides installation
of
adequate fire-fighting equipment,
it is necessary
to plan carefully and layout of buildings and the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The number of significant
