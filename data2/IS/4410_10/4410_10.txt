Some of the terms have
been added in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 10 ) ( First Revision )
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 20
September

tional Committee

coordination
among
the standards

prevailing
in
different countries
in addition to relating it to the
practice
in the field
in this country.
This has
been met by deriving considerable
assistance from
‘Multilingual technical
dictionary on irrigation

to avoid
ambiguity in their interpretation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
