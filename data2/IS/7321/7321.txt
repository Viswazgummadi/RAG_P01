FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 21 February
1974,
after
the draft
finalized
by the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineer-
ing Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number of Indian Standards on reinforced
concrete and prestressed
concrete, lighting columns and poles for overhead power and telecommuni-
cation lines have been published.
Notwithstanding
the intrinsic
quality
of the concrete
poles for which guidance has been given in the standard
specifications,
safe and efficient service
from the concrete
poles can be
ensured only by proper selection,
handling and erection of concrete
poles
for difIerent purposes.
The Sectional
Committee has therefore decided to
lay down certain
guidelines
for selection,
handling
and
erection
of
different
types of concrete
poles.
The recommendations
given
in the
code will be found useful by the user as well as the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>L  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard lays down guidelines for selection,
handling
and erec-
tion of concrete
poles for overhead power and telecommunication
lines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose of this standard,
the foIlowing definition shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Major
Axi* -Major
axis of the pole is the geometrical
axis of the
cross section ~of the pole about
which  the pole  has greatest

<<HEADING level=3>>3. SELECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The reinforced
cement concrete poles and prestressed cement concrete
poles shall
conform
to IS : 785-1964*,
IS  :  167&1960t,
IS  :  1332-1959$,
and IS: 2193-1963s.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The length of poles shall be determined
depending upon the type of
line, that is power transmission
(high
voltage ) or power distribution
(low voltage ) lines, required clearance
of conductors
from ground level,
expected sag ( which depends upon spacing of poles and allowable tension
in conductor ), position of cross-arms and the planting
depth.
Guidance
may be obtained from Rule 77 of the Indian Electricity
Rules, read with
amendment,
if any, of the State Government
under exercise
of Rule 133
of the same rules; and the relevant
Indian Staxidards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1
For poles to be used for 11 kV lines and medium or low tension
lines, the length of the poles should normally be 8 m and 7’5 m.
,,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Keeping
in view the strengths
specified
in
the
relevant
Indian
Standards,
the poles shall be of required strength, to meet .the loads that
are expected
tg act on the support during normal
working conditions,
iith
specified factors of safety.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Apart from length and strength requirements
of the poles, it shall be
ensured that:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the dimensional tolerances
and uprightness
of the poles is as per
requirements
of relevant specifications;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) sufficient
number
of suitable

<<HEADING level=3>>4.  HANDLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Reinforced
cement concrete
poles and prestressed
concrete
poles are
heavy items and their resistance to impact is low in comparison to that of
metal poles.
Sufficient
care shall, therefore,
be taken in handling
and
transport of these poles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The poles shall preferably
be handled with major axis in horizontal
position.
4.3 The handling and lifting conditions shall be considered in design and
indicated
on the pole unless otherwise specified by the designer, poles shall
be lifted from at least two points, one point being roughly at a distance of
1/5th of length from bottom, and the other at a distance of 1/4th of length
from top.
Poles having self weight more than 500 -kg shall
referably
be
lifted at four points, the position of point of lift shall be 1 6th of length

In case
of
manual
handling,
the
pole may be uniformally
supported all over its lengths and not at its ends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Loading and Unloading<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1
Poles shall preferably
be loaded and unloaded by means of crane
or other similar mechanical
device.
If mechanical
loading and unloading
is not practicable
or economical,
manual loading and unloading
may be
done, according to the procedure described in 44.2
to 4.4.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2 While poles are to be loaded into truck, wagon, trailer, etc, either
wooden sleepers or steel rails of sufficient length shall be put in a gentle
slope against body of the vehicle
at 3 or 4 places.
For loading, poles
shah be dragged one by one, gently and uniformly
on those supports by
means of rope.
As soon as pole comes on the floor of the vehrcle, the
same shall be carefully
shifted by crow-bar
or other suitable
means to
suitable position to avoid striking the next pole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.43
Similar procedure
shall be followed
for unloading
of the poles.

so that after sliding down, the
poles may sit on sand cushion without appreciable
impact.
Shifting
of
the unloaded poles shall be done simultaneously,
so that no pole remains
along the junction
line of the slanting sleeper/rails and the ground.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.4 While
loading
and
unloading,
care
shall
be taken
to avoid
dropping,
dropping
with a jerk
or striking
of the poles against
each
other.
4.4.5
Poles may be stacked in body of vehicle in multiple layers.
Two
uniform sized wooden battens
of suitable
cross section shall be put in
-between the layers of poles running across the length of the poles.
The
poles shall have complete bearing over these wooden battens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5  Transport
4.5.1  The
poles may be transported
either
by 8 wheeler
wagons or
trucks or trailers
depending upon distance and convenience.
These may
also be carried by bullock cart for short distance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2
While transporting,
the poles shall preferably
be placed parallel
to the direction
of -haulage and with major axis in horizontal
position.
Poles may-be
stacked
in the body of the vehicle
in multiple
layers, as
mentioned
in 4.4.5.
All the poles shall be tightly secured to the body of
the vehicle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.3 Where poles are longer than truck body by more than 3’5 m, they
shall be placed in such a manner that there is balanced overhang at both
the ends of truck.
To ensure better security, four or more poles shall be
bound together.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>45.4
For convenience
of loading
and unloading,
the poles may be
placed with minor axis vertical
( flat position ), on the vehicle,
provided
the poles are contained  fully  in the body of the carrier vehicle without any
overhang.
In that case, separate wooden battens
( between
the layem)
shall be increased
by 25 percent.
Sufficient
cushioning
with materials,
like straw and/or waste gunny should be provided between the layers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.5
For transportation
in bullock cart, the poles shall be hung from
the bottom of bullock cart at least at four points as mention-ed in 43, and
at such a level that those do not touch ground at any part during trans-
portation;
alternatively,
the poles may Abe stacked on the wooden body of
the bullock cart,
suitably
balanced;
or supported on wheels at suitable
locations and pulled by bullock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. ERECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Concrete
poles shall be erected and positioned in such a way that the
major axis is in line with the direction of the power line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS t 7321- 1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Spacing ( conductor
span ) of the poles shall be such  as to maintain
the loading conditions assumed in the design.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 The poles shall be buried in the ground at least up to the distance of
minimum
specified
planting
depth from bottom
according
to relevant
Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Foundation
pit may be cut with suitable
equipment
such  as earth
auger.
The
size of the pit will depend
upon the size of base plate
required to be put under the pole and space required for working.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 As reinforced
cement
concrete
poles are generally
bigger
in cross
section, these may be erected without foundation, provided the soil at the
bottom of pole is not of poor bearing capacity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.1 However, where poles are likely to be subjected
to gale, cyclonic
storm and soil erosion due to rains and flood, or in soils of poor bearing
capacity,
concrete base plate shall be provided as per 5.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 For prestressed concrete
poles, a concrete
base plate shall be provided
at the bottom of trench, size of which will depend upon bearing capacity
of soil.
In normal soil condition,
the size of concrete
base plate shall
be 450  x  450  x  75 mm. Alternatively,
with the approval of the engineer-
in-charge,
one or two baulks of reinforced
cement
concrete
or timber
of
size 800  X
300  X
100 mm may be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7 If the soil is non-cohesive,
concreting
shall be done right from bottom
up to 150 mm above the planting
depth to safeguard
from overturning
moments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8 The
details
of preparing
foundations
and
erection
are given
in
IS  :  5613
( Part I/Section ~2 )-1971*.
The
concrete
poles are generally
erected
by direct
pole method.
Use of tractor-trailer
unit, if available,
may also be made in the direct pole method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.1
