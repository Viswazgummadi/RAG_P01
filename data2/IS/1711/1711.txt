FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Second
Revision
) was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 May
1984, after the draft finalized
by the Sanitary
Appliances
and Water
Fittings
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Conservation
of water is an important
duty
of the
civic
body
in
every
growing
city
or
town
and prevention
of the wastage
of water in
public amenities
is a major
step
towards
achieving
this
objective.
In
order to minimize
the wastage
of water,
the taps provided
at such places
should be of the self-closing
type so that they
automatically
close
when
not
in use.
With
this objective
this Indian
Standard
was first issued in
1960 prescribing
performance,
construction
and other
essential
require-
ments.
The standard
was subsequently
revised
in 1970.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
The revision
of this
standard
has
been
taken
up
to incorporate
further
changes
necessary
in the light of the comments
received
by usage
of this standard
since
its publication.
This
revision
includes
modifi-
cations
relating
to materials
for different
component
parts, finish, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
Self-closing
taps are available
in many
designs
and
the
illustrations
given in this standard
are not intended
to limit them to the types
shown.
The illustrations
are only
indicative
of the
general
construction
and
component
parts ofself-closing
raps
and
any
type
of
design
may
be
accepted
provided
the minimum
requirements
laid down in the standard
are complied
with.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
For
the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test, shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value
should
be
the
same
as
that of the
specified
value
in
this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard lays down requirements
for self-closing
taps with or
without stuffing box.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose of this standard, the following definition shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Self-Closing
Tap -
A self-closing
tap
is a draw-off
tap which
remains in the open position so long as a lever handle is kept pressed up,
down or sideways, or a pushbutton is kept pressed in, and closes by itself
or when the button or the lever handle is released;
the self-closing
taps
may incorporate
a device which closes the tap even without
the release
of the button or the handle after a fixed quantity is discharged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. NOMINAL
SIZE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Self-cIosing taps shaI1 be of the following nominal sizes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) 15 mm, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) 20 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1 Nominal
size shall
refer to the
nominal
bore
of
the
inlet
connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. MATERIAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Suitable materials for the manufacture
of the body and
component
parts of self-closing taps are given in Table
1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. MANUFACTURE
AND WORKMANSHIP<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 All castings shall in all respects be sound, free from laps, blow holes
and pittings.
External
and internal
surfaces
of the castings
shall
be
clean,
smooth and free from sand.
The castings shall be neatly dressed
and no casting shall be burned, plugged, stopped or patched.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. DESIGN<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Operation
-
The opening of the tap shall be performed
by hand
pressing of the handle up or down or turning sideways or by pressing
in
of the pushbutton, and the tap shall close when the handle or pushbutton
is released.
The force required for operating the self-closing
tap for its
full opening
shall not exceed 70 N.
For self-closing taps which operate
against heads exceeding
2 m, a non-concussive
function is essential
and
provision to this effect shall be made in the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4  Galvanization
of

shall be done
by the hot-dip
process
( SC IS  :  2629-1966*

of the body and handle
may also be
painted
if so desired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  When the tap is assembled
complete
with
its component
parts,
it
shall
withstand
an internally
applied
hydraulic
pressure
of 2 MPa
for a
minimum
period of 2 minutes
without
leakage
or sweating.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2
In
the
open
position
of the tap, the flow of water at the outlet end
shall be steady
and uniform,
and
when
the
handle
or
pushbutton
is
released,
the flow shall cease completely
without
dripping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3  Endurance
Test
-
When
the tap is subjected
to 50 000
operations
of actuating
the
handle
or pushbutton
from its normal
shut position
to
the full open position
and releasing
it, it shall not show any
leakage
or
failure of the spring
or other working
parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.  SAMPLING
AND CRITERIA
FOR CONFORMITY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 Lot -
In
any
consignment,
all the taps of the same nominal
size,
manufactured
under similar
conditions
of production,
shall
be
grouped
together
to cor)stitute
a lot.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2
All the tais in a lot shall be examined
for finish and subjected
to the
tests given in 8.1
and
8.2.
The
taps
which
do not
conform
to
the
corresponding
requirements
be rejected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 The
number
of the taps to be subjected
to endurance
test ( see 8.3 )
shall be in accordance
with
Table
2.
These
taps
shall
be
selected
at
random
from the lot.
For ensuring
randomness
of selection,
procedures
given in IS  :  4905-1968$
may be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.4
The
lot
shall
be
considered
as conforming
to the requirements
of
endurance
test if all the taps selected
as in 9.3
satisfy
the
test
require-
ments.
In case 1 or 2 taps fail, twice the number
of taps shall be selected
from
the
lot
and
subjected
to the test.
The lot shall be considered
as
conforming
to the requirements
of the test if all the taps
retested
satisfy
the
test
requirements.
If
the number
of taps failing
in the first sample
exceeds
two or three is a failure
in the retest, the lot shall not be accepted
unless every tap is verified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
