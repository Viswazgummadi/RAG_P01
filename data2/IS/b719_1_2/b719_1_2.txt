2.1  Fixed
Rack
Sfrucfures
-
For the
purpose
of this
standard,
a fixed
rack structure
is defined
as a series
of
pairs
of vertical
members,
spaced
on a predetermined
pitch,
fixed
to the floor
at the
bottom
and
to the
ceiling
and/or
wall
at the top.
Each pair of vertical
members
will
allow
the attachment
of panels,
etc, in accordance
with
IS : 9606-1980 ‘Dimensions
of panels
and
racks
(482.6
mm system )‘.
The
pitch
of the fixed
rack structures
is equal
to the theoretical
centre
distance
of a plurality
of racks.
Each
rack vertical
member
may be separated
from
or
combined
with the vertical
member of the adjacent
rack provided
the pitch is maintained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  Pifches
of Fixed
Rack
Structures
-
The
pitches
of fixed
rack structures
are the
distances
between
