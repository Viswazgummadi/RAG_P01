<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 20 November
1978, after
the
draft
finalized
by the Apiary
Industry
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Agricultural
and Food Products
Division
Council.
0.2 The comb foundation
mill
is used
for embossing
plain
and
pure
beeswax
sheets with the exact
cell outline
of the honeycomb
for fixing
into the frames
of a beehive.
Such
embossed
comb
foundation
sheets
form a base for the bees to build
up new combs.
This helps to conserve
the
energies
of bees
to secure
drawn-out
combs
of adequate
cell-size
duly
related
to natural
body-size
of local
races
of bees
for
which
IS :  2072-1976*,
has  already
been issued.
Thus, in order to serve the
needs of the entire country there have to be different cell sizes.
0.3 The
main
structure
of the comb foundation
mill consists of two
rollers
fixed horizontally
close
together
in a cast
iron frame.
The
surface of these rollers has a honeycomb
cell design which embosses the
comb foundation sheets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This
standard
was first published in 1966.
The present revisi0.n
incorporates
a number of modifications,
namely:
a) The
length
of the rollers
has been changed to the minimum
necessary to effect economy,
b) requirement
as to matching
of the honeycomb
cell engravings
with the
revised
cell-size
specified
in
the
relevant
Indian
Standard
has been included, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) additional
requirements
for galvanization
of the
mechanical
parts, and packing of the mill have been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960t.

places retained<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
