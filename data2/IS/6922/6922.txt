FOR,EWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indiiln
Standards
Institution
on 24 March
1973, after the draft finalized
by the Earthquake
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Underground
blasting operations
have become
almost a must for excava-
tion purposes.
It is of. utmost
importance
to define
the damage
criterion
in terms of maximum
permissible
vibrations
for the safety ofnearby
structures
during
underground
explosions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This standard
is intended
for the safety of normal
structures
on/in more
or less homogeneous
medium.
It covers the criteria
for safety of such struc-
tures from
cracking
and also specifies
the effective
accelerations
for their
design in certain
cases.
In the case of important
structures
or complex
soil
and rock conditions,
monitoring
of vibrations
is suggested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
If the existing
structures
have cracks
and other defects due to various
causes before blasting
operations
are carried out, further damage could occur
during blasting.
It would, therefore,
be desirable
to carry out survey of such
defects in nearby
structures
before undertaking
blasting
operations
and fix
appropriate
telltales
across
old cracks
for monitoring
widening
of cracks,
if any.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
It is assumed
that
adequate
precautions
will be taken
against
flying
debris
due to the underground
blast by installing
shielding
devices above
the blast area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6
This standard
is based on the currently
accepted principles and practices
in this field in this country
and in other
countries
of the world.
In the
formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given to international
literature
on the subject.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
deals with the safety of structures
during
underground
blasting
and is applicable
to normal
structures
like buildings,
elevated
structures,
bridges,
retaining
walls, concrete
and masonry
dams constructed
in materials
like brickwork,
stone masonry
and concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this code, the following
definitions
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1
Charge
-
An explosive used in blasting in rock excavations
and quarry
blasts.
Straight
dynamite
containing
nitroglycerin
( 60 percent
), sodium
nitrate,
wood meal and an antacid
is the most common
explosive
used in
blasting
and the same is considered
in this code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2
Underground
Blasting
-
Detonation
of explosive in drill
holes
and
bore
holes for rock
excavation
and quarry
blasts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
Detonator
-
Device
used for exploding
the charge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Delay
Datonator
-
Devise for exploding
charge in two or more volleys
with one application
of electric
current.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5
Natural
Frequency
of Structure
( N ) -
Frequency
at which
the
amplitude
of vibrations
of the structure
becomes
maximum
when forces of
different
frequencies
and of same magnitude
are applied.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6
Frequency
of Ground
Motion
( f  )  -
Predominant
frequency
in the
seismic
waves produced
due to underground
explosion1<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7
Damping-The
effect
of internal
friction,
imperfect
elasticity
of
material,
slipping,
sliding,
etc, in reducing
the amplitude
of vibrations.
It is
espressed
as a fraction
of critical
damping.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.8
Critical
Damping
-
The damping
beyond which the motion will not
be oscillatory.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.9
Hard
Rocks -
Granite,
basalt,
quartzite,
marble,
crystalline
schists,
massive slates and.iither
hard massive crystalline
rocks.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.10
Soft
Rocks -
Shale,
sandstone
phyllites,
laminated
slates,
mica
schist,
weathered
hard
rocks and other
soft rock material.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.11
Threshold
Damage-Formation
of new plaster
cracks,
widening
of old cracks.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  GENERAL
PRINCIPLES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Underground
explosions
cause
movement
of ground
on which
the
structure
is situated which.sets the structure into vibrations,
These vibrations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 6922 -  1933<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>can be resolved
in three mutually
perpendicular
directions,
longitudinal,
transverse
horizontal
and transverse
vertical.
Usually
the transverse
hori-
zontal
component
is much
smaller
than the other two.
The longitudinal
and transverse
vertical
components
are comparable
in magnitude,
therefore
either of the two could be taken as a measure
of the safety criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2
The parameters
associated
with ground particle
vibrations
are accelera-
tion,
velocity
and displacement
and
their
respective
frequencies.
It is
observed
that the peak ground
particle
velocity
in the medium at the site of
the structure
represents
a good general index of damage independent
of the
frequency.
It may, therefore,
be adopted
for specifying
the safety criteria
against
threshold
damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3‘The
ground
particle
velocity
(v) at any point mainly
depends
on the
amount
of charge
exploded,
distance
between
the shot point and the station
of observation
and the local geology of the medium.
The other less important
variables
are the explosives
used, its coupling
state with the surrounding
medium
and structural
peculiarities
of the medium,
which generally
do not
figure in velocity
charge
distance
relationship.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4
The threshold
of human
perception
of vibrations
is far below the thres-
hold
of damage,
whereas
the
vibrations
become
intolerable
at ground
velocities
higher
than the velocity
of threshold
damage.
Therefore,
if the
vibrations
are kept
below
threshold
of damage,
they though
perceptible,
will not be intolerable
to human
beings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5
At short range a wave radiates spherically
and the amplitude
of vibration
diminishes
approximately
inversely as the distance.
At long range, the wave
splits’into
different
types
travelling
at different
speeds and variations
in
medium
cause
scattering.
Geological
discontinuities,
such as faults may
prevent
propagation
in a particular
direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6
As the range increases,
the charge
required
to cause damage
increases
and also the duration
of vibration
increases
with the result that the area of
damage in the structure
would increase.
For large charges and long ranges,
an earthquake
type analysis
will be appropriate
using response spectra
for
the ground
motion
caused
by underground
blast.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7
The response of a structure
to the ground vibration,
as mentioned
in 3.6,
is a function
of the natural
frequency
of the structure
(N),
frequency
of
ground motion
(f),
the damping
in the material
of the structure
and dura-
tion and the intensity
of ground vibration.
It may be assumed that resonance
is not likely to occur since the explosion
causes impulsive
ground
motion
which is complex
and irregular
in character,
changing
in
frequency
and
amplitude
and lasting
for small durations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>structures
for seismic effects of the blasts, the following
equation
may be used
for finding
the design acceleration
‘in the horizontal

K, Q!““”

R2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a =  design

g = acceleration
due to gravity
in cm/ss;
K,
= constant
( which may be taken as 4 for soil, weathered
and
soft rock and 6 for hard rock )  ;
Q  =  charge
per delay in kg; and
R =  distance
of structure
from blast point in m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
The design acceleration
so obtained
should be uniformally
applied
to the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  MONITORING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Monitoring
of ground
vibrations
may be necessary
for various reasons
as follows:
a)
To determine
by pilot tests, the maximum
charge
Q that may be
used in blasting
operations
to keep. the ground particle velocity at
the site of structures
within the safe values given in 4.1.1.1
or for
determining
the accelerations
for design;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
To determine
by pilot tests the constant
El, to be used in 5.1 and
longitudinal
wave velocity
for use in 4.2.2;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
To control the charge during actual excavation
operations
by keep-
ing the ground
particle
velocity
within
the safe values given in
4.111.2.
This
will particularly
be useful for excavations
in built
up areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2
For measurement
of ground vibrations,
three types of instruments
could
be used, namely,
accelerometer,
velocity
pick up or displacement
meter.
Of
the three, the velocity pick up will be most appropriate
for small charges
and
short ranges
and the accelerometer
for large charges and long ranges.
The
frequency
response
of velocity
measurement
should be Aat above 10 c/s and
in the case of acceleration
measurement
it should
be flat in the range
0 to
100 c/s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1
Where
a threshold
ground velocity is specified, peak velocity sensors
could be used which would activate
a warning
system, either visual in the
form of light indication
or sound in the form of alarm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3
In case a displacement
meter is used, the peak ground
particle
velocity
shall be obtained
from the displacement
vs time record
by measuring
the
maximumslope
of the curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4
Subsidence
of the structure
could also be monitored.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
