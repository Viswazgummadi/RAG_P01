<<PARAGRAPH>>Irrigation
Canals and Canal Linings Sectional Committee,
RVD 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft finalized
by the Irrigation
Canals
and Canal
Linings
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the expansion joints in the concrete
lining are sealed with sealing compound,
the same has
to be done in a manner so that these are watertight
and stop ingress of foreign
matter into them
without affecting the usefulness of the joints for the purpose they are meant.
This standard
has
been formulated
for sealing such joints so that watertight
joints
would be provided
in canal
lining.
This standard
was first published
in year
1968.
This
revision
has been done so as
to revise the procedure,
based on the prevalent
practice
and further
specification
part is deleted
and covered in a separate
standard
( see IS 13143  :  1991 Joints in concrete
lining on canals -

<<HEADING level=1>>SEALING EXPANSION JOINTS IN CONCRETE
LINING OF CANALS-
CODE OF PRACTICE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>(  First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>with minimum loss of temperature
after trans-
ferring to a molten
pourer
from main
heater-
boiler.
In
the
absence
of molten
pourer,
pouring
may be done
by suitable
cans with
extended
spouts.
For a length of 100 running
metre of joint of 12 mm thickness
and 75 mm
depth not less than 40 kg of sealing compound
should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
covers
the requirements
of the
method
of application
for filling in sealing
joints in concrete
lining on canals
when these
are sealed with the sealing compound.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  PRIME WORK<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sealing
process
should be taken
up after
concrete
curing period
is over.
The joints
should be thoroughly
cleaned
of dust and grit
before the sides are printed by a portable air-
blow
or brush.
Before
applying
the sealing
compound
the sides
should
be sprayed
or
brushed with a primer
conforming
to IS 3384 :
1985 ‘Specification
for bitumen
primer for use
in water proofing
and
damp-proofing
(first
revision )‘.  The primer is applied cold either by
spraying
machine
or by brush.
The primer
should
be allowed
4 to 12 hours
to dry out
thoroughly
before
sealing
compound
is poured
into the joints.
One litre of primer should be
used for a length
not
more
than
80 running
metre of joints of depth of 25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It wll be helpful if suitable size of wooden
or
metallic
pieces
are laid on each
side of the
joint
in the sealing
compound.
The
sealing
compound
should be poured till the horizontal
joints
are filled
up to the
lower edge.
The
wooden board or metallic pieces
are
removed
after
sealing
compound
starts hardening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 PRECAUTIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Primer
is inflammable
and should
not be
placed near a naked flame.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The bottom
of the heater-boiler
vessels
should
always be covered
with
the
molten
sealing compound
while firing is in progress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 PROCEDURE
FOR SEALING
JOINTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Temperature
in the heater-boiler
should be
carefully controlled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
sealing
compound
( see IS 13143  :  1991 )
should be heated ( working temperature
175” to
185°C ) in a suitable heater-boiler
vessels.
The
sealing compound
is cut in pieces smaller
than
15 cm cube by a wetted axe prior
to heating.
Molten sealing compound poured into the joints<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 The sealing compound should be poured into
the joints slightly over the side surface.
Weeds
from joints area should be removed
completely
so that infestation
does not spread.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
