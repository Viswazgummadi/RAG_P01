FOREW’ORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian Standard
( Second Revision)
was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution on 30 August 1978, after the draft finalized by the
Refrigeration
and Air Conditioning
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved by the Mechnical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard first issued  in  1959 was revised in 1971 to allow for the
use of more readily available
materials as alternative
to stainless steel for
the construction
of storage tanks of storage type water coolers.
The main
-modifications made in this second revision are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) It does not specify any particular, material
for the storage tank
but instead stipulates that the materials
used shall be corrosion-
resistant, non-toxic, non-absorbent
and durable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The
requirement
relating
to the performance
factor
has been
deleted in view of lack of authentic
data available in this regard
and the difficulties experienced
by the manufacturers
to meet this<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>requirement.
The classification
of the various types of water coolers has been
aligned with the practices prevailing in other countries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It specifies only 35°C ambient
temperature
for capacity
rating
test condition and also includes maximum operating condition of
43°C
ambient
and the related
requirements
so as to provide
guidance to the consumers about the performance
of these units
at adverse ambient conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expres-
sing
the result of a test, shall be
rounded
off in
accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 cooling
Capacity Rating of a Water Cooler -
It  is the quantity
of water, it will cool under given.ambient
temperature
conditions with a

made
assembly;in
one structure which includes a complete mechanical
refrigera-
ting system, and which has the primary function of cooling potable water
and also provides for dispensing suchwater,
by either integral
or remote
means, or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Pressure
Type  Water
Cooler -  A type of water
