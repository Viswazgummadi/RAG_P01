<<PARAGRAPH>>Flooring, Wall Finishing and Roofing Sectional Committee, CED 5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Flooring, Wall Finishing and Roofing Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been formulated with a view to laying down a new specification for bitumen
mastic flooring for areas where light hydrocarbon products are handled. In the petroleum
industry, bitumen mastic particularly of anti-static, electrically conducting grade is used
extensively for the flooring of LPG bottling plants and other such areas, to ensure that no sparks
are produced not only due to production of static electricity, but also due to impact of LPG
cylinders and other metallic objects with the flooring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen suitably incorporated with certain materials can be made to acquire electrically
conductive and anti-static properties. One of the materials commonly used in bitumen mastics is
carbon black/graphite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is known that for anti-static purposes, the discharge path through a product should normally
have an upper limit of electrical resistance around 5 × 10 4  ohms to give adequate protection
against fire and dangerous electric shock, if the equipment becomes defective when operated at
voltages up to 250 V. Hence, the carbon black/graphite content in the bitumen mastic should be
adjusted to this level. In addition to this the requirement of impact, sparking resistance can be
stated to be achieved if the finished flooring, while being sufficiently hard as to leave minimum
local indentations on impact, should be resilient enough for these indentations to recover and
substantially heal up in the course of time, and also no spark is produced due to such impact.
These properties have to be achieved by adjusting the proportion of various ingradients in the
bitumen mastic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard shall be read in conjunction with IS 8374 : 1977 Specification for bitumen mastic,
anti-static and electrically conducting grade, IS 1196 : 1978 Code of practice for laying bitumen
mastic flooring. To provide guidance for preparation of base, laying of bitumen mastic flooring
conforming to this standard, an Indian Standard IS 13974 : 1991 ‘Code of practice for laying of
bitumen mastic flooring for industries handling LPG and other light hydrocarbon products’ has
been formulated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (January 1993). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
