<<PARAGRAPH>>& Procedure
i-e Prepare dilution
series In the seme way as in case of odour threshold
testing.  Take
16 ml 8dWle
In 8 E@ml  beaker and pair each  sample
with  known blank  sample
and
present
to
each
Panelist. Ask the panelist
to  hold
water at  40”~
in as much quantity
as is comfortable
for several
naconds
and discharge
it  without swallowing,
tnottuet
the subjrct
to rt!cord
whether
a taste
or
after-
Mat@
IS  detectable
in the unknown sample.
Submit the samples in an ltlr*rp;lsing order of concentra-
tion Until the subject’s taste threshold has been passed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If possible, provide
:arbtbn-filtered air at constant temperature and humidity
because without
such precautions
the test
neasutes f&our

<<PARAGRAPH>>taste. like odour is one of the chemical senses.
The odour sensation
is  stimulated
by vapours
without physicel contact with  a  water sam$le,
while taste requires contact of the taste buds with
the
Mate1 sample
to determine its palatability.
Taste is simpler than odour as there  may be  only four basic
aste sensations: Sour, sweet, salty and brtter, The complex sensation experienced in the mouth during
he act of tasting
is a combination
of taste, odour, temperature and feel, this combination
is of?en
;alled flevour.
Taste
tests
usually
have to deal
with
thbs complex combination.
If a water sample
;ontains no detectable
gdour and is presented at near body temperature.
the resulting
sensation
is

we utj%t\,lr;t purposes of taste tests. The fhrst is to measure taste intensity by the taste threshold
