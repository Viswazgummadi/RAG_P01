<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Soil
Quality and Improvement
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Food and Agriculture
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nitrogen
is one of.the most essential
nutrients
required
for successful
crop production.
It promotes
vegetative
growth
of the plants.
Several
Indian soils are deficient
in nitrogen
content
and no standard
method
is available
for testing of nitrogen
in soils. Hence, need was felt to provide appropriate
analytical
procedure
for determination
of nitrogen
and nitrogenous
compounds
in soils.
This standard
may help various
research
organizations
and
those engaged
in organized
farming
including
plantation
and forestry
crops.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the result of a test made in accordance
with the standard,
if the final value, observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(revised)’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

EXTRACTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ammonical
nitrogen
in
solutions
containing
glutamine
or other
alkali
labile
organic
nitrogen
compounds
may be estimated
quantitatively
from the
ammonical
nitrogen
liberated
by distillation
of these
solutions
with a small
amount
of magnesium
oxide
and determining
ammonical
nitrogen
titrimetrically.
The solution is then cooled, powdered
Devarda’s
alloy
is added and redistilled
to recover ammonical
nitrogen
formed
as a result
of reduction
of nitrite
and nitrate
forms of nitrogen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To
determine
ammonical
nitrogen
liberated
by
digestion,
place a 500 ml Erlenmeyer
flask containing
50 ml of boric acid under the condenser
of distillation
apparatus
so that the end of the condenser
is below
the surface
of the boric
acid.
Hold
the distillation
flask. Cool, dilute and digest at 45° angle. Add glass
beads
and pour
about
150 ml of sodium
hydroxide
solution
(see 3.2.4), down the neck of the flask so that
the alkali
reaches
the bottom
of the flask
without
mixing
appreciably
with the digest.
Attach the flask
quickly
to the distillation
apparatus,
mix the contents
throughly
by gentle
swirling
and heat.
Control
the
heating
to prevent
sucking
by back of boric acid and
to minimize
frothing
during
distillation.
Check
the
flow of cold water through
the condenser
is sufficient
to keep the temperature
of the distillate
less than 35”C.
Collect
about
150 ml of distillate,
rinse the condenser
with
water
and
stop
distillation.
Determine
total
ammonical
nitrogen
in the distillate
by titration
with
standard
sulphuric
acid.
The colour
change
at end
point of titration
is from green to pink.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Procedure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1  Extraction
of Inorganic
Nitrogen
from
Soils<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Take
about
50 g of fresh,

sample
in an
Erlenrneyer
flask, add 250 ml IN acidified
potassium
chloride
solution,
stopper
the flask
and shake
on a
mechanical
shaker
for one hour.
Filter the contents
of the flask using a v~cuum
pump
or using a funnel
and Whatman
N’o.1 filter paper
or equivalent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Transfer the filtrate to a 1000 ml Kjeldahl digestion flask
and add about 2 to 4 g magnesium
oxide carefilly.
Place
a 250 ml Erlenmcyer
flask containing 20 ml of 2 percent
boric
acid
(see
3.2.6)
indicator
solution
under
the
condenser, the tip being placed below the boric acid level
in the flask. Connect the Kjeldahl flask to the condenser
and distill by heating.
Collect
about
40 to 45 ml of
distillate, and stop distillation,
Titrate
the ammonia
against standard su!phuric acid.
1 ml of O.02 N standard

allow the mixture
to stand
overnight,
add 5 g of sodium

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE --- To tictwmine
ammonical,
nitrite and nitrate forms of
nitrogen, fresh ond moist sample is used. Determine the moisture
content ofthe
soil by drying a suitable aliquot in an air-oven at
105°C for 6 hours. Cool, weigh and calculate
moisture
content,
