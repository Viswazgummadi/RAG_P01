<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1  In
designing
structures
for
oxy-acetylene
welding,
it
is
recommended
that fillet welds be avoided
and butt welds be employed
as
far as possible.
Fillet welds should
not be used for structures
subject
to
dynamic
load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
The arrangement
of welds shall be such that uncertainty
as to the
distribution
of stress is minimized.
Where an eccentric
connection
cannot
be avoided,
the bending
effect shall be computed
and adequate
provision
made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3
In structures
subjected
to dynamic
load, only complete penetration
butt welds shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4
In all cases, the location
of the weld and the form and dimensions
of the weld surfaces
shall be such as will provide access for the filler rod
.and the blow pipe to the surfaces
to be welded,
and enable
the welder to
see clearly the work in progress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5
Adequate
provisions
shall be made
for controlling
the ultimate
dimensions
and configurdtion
to offset the effects
of distortions
due
to
welding.
Some
general  _  guidelines
on
distortion
control
are given in
Appendix
B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Butt  Weld<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  Size -
The size of butt welds shall be specified
by the effective
throat
thickness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2
Effective Throat Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2.1
The effective throat thickness
of a complete
penetration
butt
weld shall be taken
as the thickness
of the thinner
member
joined.
Rein
forcement
shall be provided
to ensure
full cross sectional
area,
but shall
not be considered
as part of the effective
throat
thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2.2
The effective
throat thickness
of an incomplete
penetration
butt weld
shall
be taken
as the minimum
thickness
of the weld
meta]
common
to the members
joined,
excluding
the reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2:3
Efictive Length -The
effective
length of a butt weld shall be taken
as the length
of the continuous
weld having
minimum
effective
throat
thickness.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS: 1323 - 1982<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>512.3.1  Intermittent
butt welds -
The effective
length
of intermittent
butt
welds
shall
be not
less than
four times
the
longitudinal
space
between
the e%ctive
length
of welds nor more than
16 times the thinner
part joined.
Such welds should
be used for shear load only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3.2
Transverse skewed butt weld -
Such weld shall not be assumed
in computations
to be longer
than
the width
of the joint
or member
perpendicular
to the direction
of stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4
Effective Area of Butt Welds -
The
effective
area
of a butt
weld
shall be considered
as the effective length multiplied
by the effective throat
thickness
for the purposes
of design calculations
for load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4.1
Load_carrying
butt weIds -
Butt welds shall
be considered
as
the parent
metal
for purpose
of design
calculation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4.2
.hron-load
carrying
butt welds -
Incomplete
penetration
butt
welds due to non-accessibility,*shall
be considered
as non-load
carrying
for the purposes
of design calculations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5
Sealing -
In all cases, where welded joints are liable to be exposed
tpdetrimental
conditions,
the joining
edges of the contact
surfaces
shall
be sealed
by welding;
or the
parts
shall
be effectively
connected
by
welding,
so that the contact
surfaces are securely held in contact to prevent
the entry of moisture
or other deleterious
substances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.6  Reinforcement
-
Only
sufficient
surface
convexity
shall
be
provided
by reinforcement
to ensure
full cross-sectional
area at the joint.
The reinforcement
shall not be considered
as part
of the effective
throat
thickness
and may be removed
to provide
a flush surface,
if desired.
For
a butt
weld
of parts
of equal
thickness,
the reinforcement
shall be as
follows  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of Unequal
Thickness
-
Where
members
of different
thicknesses
are butt welded
and
the surfaces
of the members
are-out
of plane
by more than
3 mm, the thicker
member
shall be tapered
down so that the slope of the surface
from the thinner
part
shall not be
steeper than one in three before
butt welded

members
of
