<<HEADING level=3>>PART 1 PRESTRESSING
STEEL<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.  FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part 1 ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 19 March 1984, after the draft finalized by the Building
Materials
and Components
Sampling Sectional
Committee
had been
approved  by the Civil Engineermg Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This Indian Standard has been prepared with a view to unifying the
quality
control
and
sampling
provisions
applicable
to
all types
of
prestressing
steel used in prestressed
concrete.
Some broad
guidelines
regarding
the
provisions
for process control have also been
indicated
besides giving an objective sampling procedure
helpful in large
scale
transactions.
0.3 Such process
control
and sampling
procedures
will help in the
development of adequate
quality
assurance
system in the manufacture
and also in assuring adequate protection to the users against poor
quality.
Further, proper quality control during the process of manufacture
would
substantially reduce quality fluctuations of the various characteristics
and
thus, ensure supply of uniform quality of prestressing steels. For effective
process
control,
the use of statistical
quality
control
techniques
is
imperative,
for which helpful guidance may be obtained from IS : 397
( Part 1 )-1972*,
IS  :  397 ( Part 2 )- 1975* and
IS  :  397 ( Part 3 )-1980*.
The
purchasing
organizations
need
guidance in economic and effective
sampling inspection
of the lots of materials
being received by them
to evaluate their quality before their actual use. The sampling procedures
recommended
in this standard,
therefore,
include
provisions
both for
process control and lot inspection.
0.4 The reinforcing steel used in reinforced concrete is separately
covered
in Part 2 of this standard.

<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard ( Part 1 ) prescribes the methods
for
sampling,
sample
sizes and the crrterla for conformity for prestressing steel used in  prestres-
sed concrete. Broad outlines with regard to the controls to be exercised
during the manufacturing
proces.s have also been indicated.
2. ‘IXRMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose
of this standard,
the following
definitions
shall
apply.
2.1 Acceptance Number -
The maximum allowable number of defectives
in the sample for acceptance of the lot.
2.2 Coil -
One continuous length in the form of a coil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Bar -  A rolled rod or bar of steel of circular cross section.
2.4 Item -  A coil or a  bar on which inspection will be performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5  Lot -
The quantity of material of the same grade and nominal
size
manufactured
from steel fully tested in respect of physical,
chemical and
surface characteristics
and
processed
under
similar
conditions
shall
constitute a lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6 Lot Size -  The number of items in a lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7  Mean (2) -
The sum of test results divided by the number
of test
results.
2.8  Range (R) -
The difference
between
the maximum
and minimum
values of test results in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.9 Sample -
Collection of coils or bars of prestressed
steel selected for
&pectiOll
and testing from a lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.10 Sample Size -
Number of items in the sample.
2.11 Acceptable Quality Level ( AQL ) - The maximum percent
defective
that, for the purpose of sampling inspection, can be considered satisfactory
as a process average.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.  PROCESS
INSPECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The object of inspection by the purchaser is to ensure conformity
of
the material offered to him to the specification
requirements,
whereas the
inspection done by the manufacturer
during the production
is not only
to ensure  th&  conformity'
to  relevant specifications,
but also  ’  to ntaihtain
overall uniform
quality, For
ptcicesl; control, the manufacturer
should
test representative
samples  of  the.~+teridl at regular intqvals.  during
manufacture to control
the quality
vab,at$n
,at various
manufacturing
stages. .The ins@ction

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The  manufacturer
should
maintain
control of various chsracteristics
of
the  prestressing
ste:l on  the basis of the following considerations.
3.2.1 Following an unsatisfactory
test  reS.Uh?,  the manufacturer
should
take all necessary steps to rectify the deficiencies and shortcomings
in the
process.  Products
which do not satisfy
the
requirements
are to be
segregated.
3.2.2
Results of the inspection
and testing should
be recorded
and
evaluated statistically. The records may be preserved
for adequate
period
of time
say 2 to 3 years so that they can be referred
to in
case
of
difficulties and complaints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.1

appropriate.
The variables approach
shall normally be applied for proof
stress, tensile  strength,
elongation,
weight, dimensions,
rolling
and
cutting
tolerances
and chemical
requirements.
The attributes
approach
might
be
applied in respect of bendin, u test and
