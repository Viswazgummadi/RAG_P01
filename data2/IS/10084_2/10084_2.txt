<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Part 2 ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized by the Diversion
Works Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the River valley
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to the commencement
of actual construction
of any work in the bed of a natural
river,
it
becomes obligatory
in most cases to exclude temporarily
the river flow away from
the
proposed
work area during the construction
period, so as to permit the work to be done in the dry or
semi-dry areas. Diversion
works provide working area free from water and river
flow for
cons-
tructing
hydraulic
structures.
These works, as far as possible,
are so designed
that when the
diversion needs are over, these may be utilised partially
or fully in the main projects as spillways,
bottom
outlets,
irrigation
outlets, head race or tail race
tunnels.
The method
and magnitude
of diversion works will depend primarily
upon the cross section of the valley,
the type of dam,
diversion discharge and the bed material
in the river.
However,
in some specific
cases,
the
choice of a dam may depend on diversion arrangement,
for example an earth
dam is not
feasi-
ble where diversion works cannot prevent overtopping
of the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part  1  of this standard covers the criteria for design of coffer dams
of different types,
namely
masonry/concrete/colloidal
concrete,
earthen,
rockfill,
steel and timber
coffer dams.
The pas-
sage for diversion of water can be broadly classified into three categories,
namely
open channel,
open cut or conduit in the permanent
works and tunnels.
Part 2 of this
standard
has been
prepared
to cover the design criteria for diversion channel and open cut or conduit in the body
of the dam.
Part 3 of this standard
will cover the design criteria for tunnels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers the criteria
for design
of
open
channel
and open cut or conduit
in the
body of the dam as diversion works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concrete
or masonry
dams
could
be allowed
to get overtopped
during floods when construct-
ion activity
is not in progress.
The resulting
damage
is -either
negligible
or
could
be
tolerated
without
much concern.
Therefore,
it is customary
to adopt diversion
flood which
is just
adequate
to
be handled
during non-
monsoon
season,
when
construction
activity
of the dam is continued.
Generally
the largest
observed non-monsoon
flood or non-monsoon
flood of 100 year return period is adopted as a
diversion
flood. This is generally a small fraction
of the design flood of the spillway
and, there-
fore, diversion channel required to handle
this
flood is obviously
small.
Advantage
is also
taken of passing the floods
over
partly
com-
pleted
dam
or
spillway
blocks,
thereby
keeping
the
diversion
channel
of relatively
smaller size.
In such a case a small
excavated
channel either
in the available
width
of the
river or one of the banks of the river
proves
to
be
adequate.
Construction
sluices
are
located
in such excavated
channels which allow
passage of non-monsoon
flows without
hind-
rance
to
the
construction
activity.
Such
sluices are subsequently
plugged tihen the dam
has been raised
to
adequate
height.
If the
pondage is not allowed even when the dam has
been raised to sufficient
height,
the river
out-
lets are often provided
in the body d the non-
overflow
or
overflow
dam to pass the non-
monsoon
flows
which
later
on are kept
for
permanent
use after completion
of cpnstruction.
If the diversion
channel
is excavated
on one
of the river banks, it is possible to use the same
for locating an irrigation
outlet, a power
house
or a spillway depending
upon the magnitude
and
purpose of the project.

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  At sites where
diversion
of flow through
tunnels or close conduits is not possible
( due
to topographical
considerations
) or proves
to
be uneconomical,
diversion
through
excavated
channels called diversion
channels
is effected.
Diversion
channtls
are often
classified
accord-
ing to the
type
of
diversion
namely,
single
stage or multiple
stage diversion
scheme.
In
the former which is more
suitable
for narrow
valleys, the same set of diversion
channel
and
coffer dams is utilised
throughout
the period of
construction.
In the latter, which is generally
suitable
for wide valleys,
the
channels
and
coffer dams are shifted
from place to place
in
accordance
with phasing of the work.
A more
useful classification,
however,
is based on the
type of the dam to be constructed
namely
diversion
channel
for
masonry
or concrete
dams and that for the earth
or rockfill
dams.
The following guidelines
are followed for their
design.

Capacity
of
the
diversion
flood should
be
worked
out
on
the
basis
of the
standard
‘Design
Flood
for River Diversion
Works-
Guidelines
(  under
preparation )‘.
Because
of the large volume of flood
to be negotiated
and
the fact
that
earth
dams are generally
located
in the
main
river
gorge,
diversion
channels have to be excavated
on one of the
river banks in the case of narrow
valleys.
The
layout and principal
dimensions,
specially
the
cross-section
of
the
diversion
channel
is
governed
by several
considerations
such as
topography,
volume
of flood to be handled,
water levels
during
passage of monsoon
and
non-monsoon
floods in consonance
with rais-
ing of the dam and requirement
of excavated
material
from
diversion
channel
for use in
constructing
earth dam, etc.
The
coffer
dams
in such a case which form integral
part
of the
earth or rockfill dam in the finally
completed
stage, are also not allowed
to be overtopped
( though
a few examples
exist when
earth
or
rockfill
dams have
been allowed to
be over-
topped during diversion~with
special protection
on their slopes with concrete
blocks or gabions,
etc ).
Because of the considerable
expenditure
and time involved in the construction
of diver-
sion channel
for earth
dams, these
channels
are designed
to be useful
for other
purpose
also such as spillway
tail
channel
or power
house
tail
channel.
Although,
initially
such<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2.2 In a wide river
channel,
provided
the
height of the earth dam is small enough,
diver-
sion could be managed by a temporary
channel
involving a gap through earthfill dam while the
remainder
of
the
embankment
is
being
constructed
( see Fig. 4 ).
Before
the stream
is diverted,
the foundation
required
for the
dam should
be completed
in the area where
the temporary
opening
will be left through
embankment.
This preparation
would
include
excavation
and refilling of a cut-off
trench,
if
one is to be constructed.
The stream
is then
channelised
through this area after
which
the
foundation
work in the remainder
of the stream
bed is completed.
The portion
of the embank-
ment on either
side of the diversion
opening
may then
be completed.
The
side slopes
of
the
opening
should
not
be
steeper
than 4
vertical to 1 horizontal
to facilitate
filli~ng up
of the gap at the end of the construction
period
and to decrease the danger of cracking
of the
embankment
due
to differential
settlement.
The flat slope also provides
a good
bonding
surface
between
the
previously
constructed
embankment
and
the material
to be placed.
The bottom
level

channel<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>through
embankment
should
be the same as
the original stream bed, so that
erosion in the
channel will be minimised.
The width
of the
opening will depend on the magnitude
of the
diversion
flood and consideration
of the equip-
ment
capabilities
for
filling
the
gap
which
would
be
available.
The
average
rate
of
embankment
placement
should
be such that
the gap could be filled faster
than
the water
rise in the reservoir.
Care should be exercised
during filling of the gap so that
the quality
of
the work is not sacrificed
due to exigencies
of
the
situation.
This is ~of great
importance
because frequently
the diversion
gap is in the
area
where
the
dam would
be of
maximum
height.
Special attention
should also be given
to bonding of the newly
placed
material
with
earthfill previously
placed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the
work
to continue
uninterruptedly.
Provision
of a fair weather
channel
also
facilitates
placing
construction
sluices
within the dam body
so that
diversion
of the fair
weather
flow could
be con-
veniently handled
even after
raising
of
the dam to
a considerable
height
( see
Fig. 3 ).
Likelihood
of silting up of the
fair
weather
channel
by the monsoon
floods
should,
however,
be kept
in
mind.
When the dam is raised
and operation
of construction
sluices becomes
difficult,
diversion
of non-monsoon
flows could
be effected
through
river
outlets
pro-
vided in the body of the spillway or dam,
Often these outlets are used for irrigation
outlets after completion
of the dam.
Although diversion
of flow through
open
channel is for temporary
use, the require-
ment
of diversion
continues
for
some
years.
In such a condition,
it becomes
necessary
to
ensure
equitable
distri-
bution of discharge
across
the width
of
the diversion channel.
For this purpose
groynes
or spurs
could
be effectively
used to ensure
satisfactory
flow condi-
tions
in
the
diversion
channel
(see
Fig. 3 ).
For the diversion
channel
excavated
in
overburden,
it is also necessary to ensure
that the banks
are not
eroded
due to
flood flows.
While
provision
of a spur
could
help
ensuring
concentration
of
discharge in the central
portion
of the
channel with minimum
velocities
along
the
banks,
it
nevertheless
requires
protection
to avoid erosion of the banks.
If the diversion
channel is to be utilised
as spillway channel or power
house
tail
race
channel,
the
protection
measures
are designed
such that
those
could
be
useful during permanent
stage also.
In
other
cases,
pitching
with
stones,
rip
rap or gabions is. normally adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Design Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>The following points
should
be considered
in
the design of open channel for diversion:
a><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although the alignment
of the diversion
channel
is governed
by
topography,
circular
alignment
is by far the
most
efficient
alignment.
The radius
of the
circle should be 3 to 5 times the bed width
of the channel to obtain
equitable
flow
across the channel.
However,
radius as
small as twice the bed width may also be
adopted because of  the  restraints
due to
other considerations.
Channels are designed
on
the basis of
Manning’s
formula,
after
adopting
suitable
value
of
rugosity
coefficient
depending
on
site
conditions.
The
velocity
in the unlined
section
should
not
exceed
5 m/s.
In lined
channels
velocity
may go up to 15 m/s.
It is also advantageous
to provide a fair
weather flow channel
within the
diver-
sion channel
so as to restrict
the non-
monsoon
flow through
the fair weather
channel
thus keeping
the rest
of the
diversion
channel high and dry to enable<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

It
would
be
desirable
to flare

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1  Hydraulic
model
studies
for
evolving
suitable
arrangement
of the
diversion
through
open
channel
are
almost
indispensable.
The
model
studies
help deciding
the
most
efficient
alignment
of the diversion
channel,
heights
of
the
upstream
and
downstream
coffer
dams,
protection
measures
for the coffer dams if they
are to
be
overtopped,
flow
conditions
in
the
diversion
channel
and
protection
measures
for
the diversion
channel
depending
on its utility
during
diversion
as
well as during
permanent
stage.
The
discharging
capacity
of
partly
constructed
spillway
blocks
could
only
be
assessed
through
model
studies
as
no
accurate
theoretical
approach
is still available
for such a
complex
three
dimensional
flow situation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the
conduit/sluice
is used
as a permanent
structure,
permanent
gates and hoisting
arrange-
ment
should
be provided.
In ease the conduit/
sluice
is to be closed
after
diversion,
there
is
no necessity
of providing
a gate
in the bod~y of
the sluice
but a bulk-head
gate on the upstream
with proper
guidance
for closing
purposes
may
be provided.
The
permissible
velocity
in
the
conduit
may be limited
to 20 m/s.
It is neces-
sary to see that diversion
channels
and diversion
tunnels
are
steel
lined
from intake
to end
of
transition
to avoid
damage
to
the
invert
and
sides
due
to
rolling
boulders,

expensive.
The
only
is to
have
them
passed

although
this
does
apply
mostly
to cortcrete

<<PARAGRAPH>>The conduit
should
