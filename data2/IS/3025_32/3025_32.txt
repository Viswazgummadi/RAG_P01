<<PARAGRAPH>>1. scope -
This standard
prescribes
four
methods
for the determination
of chloride.
The argento-
metric
method
is suitable
for
use
in relatively
clear waters
when
O-1 5 to 10 mg of chloride
is
present
in the
portion
titrated.
The
end
point
of
mercuric
nitrate
method
is easier to detect
Potentiometric
method
is suitable
for coloured
or turbid
samples.
The ferricyanide
method
is ar
automated
technique.
In case of any difference of opinion, the argentometric method shall be the
referee method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.1
Use IO0
ml sample
or a suitable
portion
diluted
to 100 ml.
If the sample is highly
coloured.
add 3 ml of aluminium
hydroxide
suspension,
mix, let settle and filter.
If sulphide,
sul-
phite or thiosulphate
is present, add 1 ml of hydrogen
peroxide and stir for I minute. Directly titrate
the
samples
in the pH range 7 to IO.
Adjust sample pH to 7-10 with sulphuric
acid or sodium
hydroxide
if it is not in the range.
Add I.0 ml of potassium
chromate
indicator
solution.
Titrate
with standard silver nitrate solution
to a pinkish
yellow
end point.
Standardize
silver

solution
and establish
reagent blank value by titration

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.  Mercuric Nitrate Method<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Principle -
Chloride can be titrated
with mercuric nitrate
because of the formation
of soluble,
slightly
dissociated
mercuric
chloride.
In the pH range  2.3 to 2.8.  diphenyl
carbazone
indicates
the end point by the formation
of a purple complex
with excess mercuric ions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  interference -
Bromide
and iodide
are titrated
in the same manner as chloride.
Chromate,
ferric and sulphite
ions interfere,
when present in excess of 10 mg/I.<<HEADING_END>>

Indicator-acidifier
reagent -
The nitric acid concentration
of this reagent is an impor-
tant factor in the
success
of the
determination
and can be varied as indicated
in ( a ) or ( b ) to
suit the alkalinity
range of the sample.
Reagent ( a ) contains
-sufficient
nitric acid to neutralize
a total alkalinity
of 150 mg as CaC03/l to the proper pH in a 100 ml sample.
Adjust
amount
of
nitric acid to accommodate
samples of alkalinity
different
from 150 mg/l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Dissolve,
in the order named. 250 mg s-diphenylcarbazone,
4-O  ml. concentration nitric acid
and 30 mg xylene
cyanol FF in 100 ml 95 percent
ethyl
alcohol
or isopropyl
alcohol.
Store in a dark bottle
in a refrigerator.
This reagent is not stable indefinitely.
Deteriora-
tion causes a slow end point and high results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Because
pH
control
is critical,
adjust pH of highly
alkaline or acid samples to  2.5 & 0  1
with  0.1
N nitric
acid or sodium
hydroxide
not
with
sodium
carbonate
(  Na&Os ).
Use  a pH
meter
with
a nonchloride
type of reference
electrode for pH adjustment.
If
only the usual chloride-type
reference
electrode
is available
for pH adjustment,
determine
amount
of acid or alkali required to obtain a pH of 2.5 f
0.1 and discard this sample
portion.
Treat a separate sample portion with the determined
amount of acid or alkali and
continue
analysis.
Under these circumstances,
omit nitric acid, from indicator
reagent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Immerse stirrer and electrodes.
Set instrument to desired range of millivolts or pH units.
Start stirrer.
Add standard silver nitrate
titrant, recording scale reading after each addition.
At the start large increments of silver nitrate
may be added, then as the end point is approached, add small and equal increments at longer
intervals so that the exact end point can be determined.
Determine
the volume
of silver nitrate
used at the point at which there is the greatest change
in instrument
reading per unit addition of
silver nitrate.
Plot a differential

curve if the exact end point cannot be determined by
inspecting the data. Plot change in instrument reading for equal increments of silver nitrate against

<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Chloride
is one of the major inorganic anion in water and wastewater.
In potable water, the
salty taste produced by chloride concentrations is variable and dependent on the chemical compo-
sition.
Chloride concentration is higher in wastewater than in raw water.
A high chloride content
may harm metallic pipes and structures as well as growing plants.
