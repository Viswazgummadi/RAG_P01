<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  The Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was
adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards on
2 May 1988, after the draft finalized by the Fire
Safety Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Further the
calorific values and list of hazardous
materials
as existing have been deleted as the same are
available in all standard text Books.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  The information relating to calorific values
and hazardous, materials in detail is covered in Hand-
book on Fire Protection (  under preparation

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A series of Indian
Standards
covering
fire,
safety of buildings
in general principles
of fire
grading details of construction,
exit requirements
and exposure
hazards
have
been
formulated.
This Indian Standard
covers general principles
of fire grading and classification, which has been
adopted in various Indian standards in respect to
fire safety aspects.
This standard was first issued
in 1960. Based on considerable
research done
on field of fire protection
in the past 25 years in
advanced countries like USA, UK and Canada, the
method
of classification
of building
has been<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a parti-
-
cular requirements of this standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be
rounded
off in
accordance
wilh IS  :  2 - 1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules for rounding off  numerical values (  revised ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>again, some burn more rapidly than others, some
materials when heated on fire liberate
dangerous
fumes, and some may readily
cause ignition of
other materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This code covers
the general principles
of
fire grading of buildings and classification.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  FIRE LOAD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 The content of a building
are rarely distri-
buted uniformly over the whole floor area. ,From
the fire protection point, it would be undesirable
to have all combustible material concentrated on
a fraction of the floor area, as the average taken
over the whole area
would not give
a true
representation
of the actual conditions,
and the
resulting effects on the
structure
immediately
surrounding would be out of all
proportion
to
these expected on the basis of average fire load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Classification -  Fire load is the amount of
heat in kilocalories which is liberated per square
metre of floor area
of a compartment
by the
combustion of the contents
of the building
and
any combustible parts of the building itself.
This
amount of heat is used as the basis for classifica-
tion of occupancies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The fire load is determined
by multiplying
the weight of all combustible
materials
by their
calorific values and dividing the figure by the
floor area under consideration.
2.3 Different materials having the same weight
and same calorific
value may present
different
hazards on account
of their other
properties,
such as ease of ignition, speed of burning,
and
liberation
of
heat
and
fumes.
Thus,
some
‘inateirals are more readily
ignited than others,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
