<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Fifth Revision) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian Standards,
after
the
draft -finalized by the Wrought
Steel Products
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Metallurgical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published in 1958 and subsequently
revised in 1962, 1968, 1973 and 1988.
While
reviewing
this standard
in the light of experience
gained during these years,
the Committee
decided to revise it to align with the present practices being followed by the Indian Industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision, the following changes have been made:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) Only
Grades
0,
D, DD and EDD of hot rolled carbon steel sheets and strips have beeD
retained. The other three grades, that is Gr,ades Fe 330, Fe 410 and Fe 590 have been deleted
which are now covered in IS 5986  :  1992 ‘Hot rolled steel plates, sheets, strips and flats for
flanging and forming operation’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii) Tensile properties
have been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the purpose
of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standardis
complied with,
the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.  The numbcr-
of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that
of the specific&
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

does not afford the same opportunity
to reject
the
portion

defects as with cut

rejection.
