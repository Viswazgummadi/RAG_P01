<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 3) (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Hydraulic Gates and Valves Sectional Committee had been approved by the Water Resources
Division Council. Noting lack of adequate systematic information on procedures for inspection, testing and
maintenance of radial gates and their hoists after erection, the Hydraulic Gates and Valves Sectional Committee
decided that a set of recommendations on this subject be drawn up for reference and guidance of the personnel
engaged in these duties. This standard has accordingly been prepared @ provide guidelines for radial gates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been published in parts. Part 1 deals with inspection, testing and assembly at manufacturing
stage. Part 2 deals with inspection, testing and assembly at the time of erection. Part 3 deals with inspection,
testing and maintenance after erection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 3) was first published in 1982. In the first revision in 1992, the provision in respect of
inspection was elaborated in detail. This second revision of standard had been taken up to incorporate the
knowledge gained during use of this standard. In this revision an additional clause has been added regarding
maintenance of gates to be operated in winter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no 1S0 standard on the subject. This standard has been prepared taking into consideration the practices
prevalent in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)’. The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>gates,
they
should
be
maintained
as
per
recommendations contained in M 7718.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 3) lays down the recommendations
for inspection, testing and maintenance of radial gates
and their rope drum hoists after erection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 INSPECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Periodical inspection of gate installations should
be carried out to detect normal wear and tear, defects,
if any. It should be done as and when necessary, but
at least thrice in a year, one being prior to the onset of
monsoon and one immediately after the monsoon and
one at other times. The gates should be operated up
and down several times to make sure that everything
is in order.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standard given below contains provisions
which
through
reference
in this text, constitute
provisions of this standard. At the time of publication,
the edition indicated was valid. All standards are
subject to revision, and parties to agreements based
on this standard are encouraged to investigate the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>possibility of applying the most recent edition of the
standard indicated below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Inspection work may consist of visual inspection
of exposed surfaces of embedded parts, such as sill
beam, wall plate including seal seats, gate leaf, arms,
trunnion
assembly,
trunnion
girders,
hoisting
equipment, hoist supporting structures and checking
of important dimensions. In cases of inaccessible parts,
inspection may be necessary
by other means like
divers, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3 GENERAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Drain holes in the horizontal girders and arms
should be checked so that they do not get clogged with
silt causing accumulation of water in the horizontal
girders and arms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Inspection
of Radial Gates<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No piece of equipment, however well designed and
sturdy, will run efficiently unless it is well kept and
maintained. Therefore the details of inspection to be
done and the schedule of maintenance are given here.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Rope drums, pulleys and rope connection should
be checked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1  Periodical Inspection<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Functioning
of the limit switches, interlocking
devices, indication lamps, etc, should be checked for
proper working.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to detect normal wear and tear, defects, if
any, periodical inspection of gate installation should
be carried out. The periodical inspection of gates and
hoists should be done as and when necessary, but at
least thrice a year and corresponding to the periods
when the water level in the reservoir is at its highest
and lowest levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 The operating
systems of the gate should be
checked for their proper functioning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5  TESTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection to check that:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The gate should be tested for its travel up and
down to see that it moves smoothly without excessive
sway throughout the length of travel.
5.2 The operation should be trouble-free
and there
should not be any unusual sound. There should not be
any undue pressure or extra efforts when the gate is
operated under no load condition.
Any extra current being taken by the motor should be
taken note of.
5.3 On load (that is, when there is water) there should
be no undue vibrations in the gate and structure during
operation of the gate. In case vibrations are noticed,
the positions of gate openings and water levels should
be noted and the reasons thereof should be investigated.
5.4 Based on the inspection
and testing,
suitable
remedial measures should be taken (see 6).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gate operation should be trouble free and
there should not be unusual sound,
On load (that is, when there is water) there
should be no undue vibrations in the gate and
the structure.
Observe the current drawn by motor at the time
of lifting of gate.
If any excessive current
drawn is noticed, operation of hoist should be
stopped immediately and reason for the same
may be investigated for lubrication of various
parts of gates and hoists and rectified.
Check the supply voltage.
Check the lubrication at various points.
Checkthe condition ofpaintihg of vaiious parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should be kept in view.
Trunnion bearing should be greased wher-
ever required. Keeping trunnion bearings in
perfect working condition is very important.
All other bolted connections should also be
checked for proper tightness.
Bolts and trunnion bearing housing should
be tightened wherever required.
The seals of the gate should be checked for
wear and tear and deterioration. These should
be adjustedheplaced, as and when necessary.
Wire ropes should be properly greased.

6.3 In case of gates to be operated during winter,
generally water leaking through water tight parts gets
frozen and grows to be ice lumps. Chances are that
such ice lumps adhere to the gate leaf or embedded
parts causing troubles. Therefore in case of such gates
following remedial measures shall be taken in addition
to the maintenance work given in 6.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>be maintained by suitable replenishment. Oil
seals should also be replaced, if required.
Lubrication of other parts of the hoists, such
as chains,
position
indicators
and limit
switches should also be done.
The stroke of the brake should be reset to
compensate for lining wear. Worn out brake
linings should be replaced in time.
Flexible couplings should be adjusted, if re-
quired.
Repairs and replacement of electrical relays
and controls should be attended to.
Maintenance of alternative sources of power,
such as diesel generating sets and alterna-
tive drives wherever provided should be car-
ried out.
The list of essential spare parts to be kept
available should be reviewed and updated
periodically.
The availability
of essential
spare parts should be ensured. The condition
of spares should be checked periodically and
protective coating given before use.
