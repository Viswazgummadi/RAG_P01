<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian Standards,
after the
draft finalized by the Environmental
Protection
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the
Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lead is  a serious
cumulative
body
poison.
Natural
waters
seldom contain more than 20 pg/l,
although
values as high as 4OO.~(g/l have been
reported.
Lead in a water supply may come from
industrial,
mine and smelter discharges
or from the dissolution
of old lead plumbing.
Tap waters
that.are
soft, acidic and not
suitably treated
may contain lead resulting
from an attack.on
lead
service pipes.
It is toxic and therefore,
a stringent
limit has been
specified for lead in potable
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Also, lead is to be specially
tested when pollution/plumbo
solvency
is suspected.
Therefore,
the
test for lead is essential.
These tests serve to determine
whether the lead .content of potable water
and *waste water is within the acceptable
limit or not..<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard,
considerable
assistance
has been derived
from American
Standard
Test Methods
( ASI M Annual Book Section
11, 1983 ) and Analytical
Chemical Acta,
164 ( 1984 ) l-21.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The, composition
of the technical
committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this Indian
Standard
is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the result of a test or analysis
made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done
in accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values ( revised)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The
water
samples should
be collected
and
stored
preferably
in poly-
propylene
or chemically
resistant
glass
con-
tainers. For preservation,
the samples should be
acidified
with
concentrated
nitric
acid ( 2 ml
of AR grade nitric acid in 1 litre
of the sample
just to bring down the pH to below 2 ). For
dissolved lead filter the sample
in the field and
acidify the filtrate
with nitric acid
to a pH of
or lower.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
prescribes
the following
three
methods for determination
of lead:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Atomic absorption
method ( Direct ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Atomic
absorption
method ( Chelation -
Extraction
), and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Differential
Pulse
Anodic
Stripping
Voltammetry
( DPASV ).  ,,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
Avoid excess
nitric acid. Add 5 ml of O-1 N
iodine
solution
to avoid
losses
of volatile
organ0
lead
compounds
during
handling
and

of
samples.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Principle
For the purpose
of this standard,

of the sample is determined
by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

directly
aspirating
the sample
into the flame of
an atomic absorption
spectrophotometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 APPLICATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is applicable
in the range from 1.0
to 10.0 mg/l
of lead.
However,
the concentra-
tion range will vary with the sensitivity
of the
instrument
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depending
upon
the
concentration
range and
interference
levels,
choice
of the
method
is
made. When the concentration
levels are below
500 pg/l, pre-concentration
is carried out either
by chelation
and extraction
prior
to atomic
absorption
spectrophotometer
( AAS ) or by
deposition
on a mercury
drop electrode
as in
DPASV
method.
For
dissolved
lead content,
filtration
through
0.45 pm membrane
filter is
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2  Interferences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other metals usually do not interfere.
However,
high concentrations
of calcium
do interfere
and
give high values
for
lead.
In these
cases the
chelation-extraction
procedure
should be used.
Background correction
should be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.5  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5.1  For dissolved
lead, filter
100 ml of the
sample through @45 pm membrane
filter
paper.
For total lead, add 5 ml of concentrated
hydro-
chloric acid and evaporate
the sol,ution
to 15
to 20 ml.
Cool and filter the sample
through
acid washed filter paper.
Make
up to 100 ml
in a volumetric
flask.
Add to this solution
it
the filtrate ( in case of dissolved
lead )  2  drops
of bromophenol
blue indicator
solution
and
mix.
Adjust the pH
by adding
sodium hydr-
oxide solution till a blue colour
persists.
Add
diluted
hydrochloric
acid
( 1  :  49 ) drop
by
drop until the colour just disappears;
then
add
2.5 ml in excess
to bring the pH to 2-3-2.5.
Add 10 ml of pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamic
acid
-
chloroform
reagent
and shake well.
After
the phases separate out, collect the chloroform
phase by taking care to avoid any trace of water
in the flask.
Repeat
the extraction
till
the
chloroform
layer becomes colourless with fresh
6 to 7 ml portion
of chloroform;
combine
the
extracts
and make up the volume
to 25 ml.
Aspirate the organic extracts
direqtly
into
the
the flame
( zeroing the instrument
on a water
saturated
chloroform
blank ) and record
absor-
bance.
To
avoid
problems
associated
with
instability
of
extracted
metal
complexes,
determine
immediately,
after
extraction.
Alternatively
evaporate
the extracts
just
to
dryness and dissolve
the residue
by dropwise
addition
of 2 ml of concentrated
nitric
acid by
holding the beaker
at an angle.
Again
eva-
porate to dryness and add 2 ml of hydrochloric
acid ( 1  :  2 ) and heat for 1 minute.
Cool
and
make up the solution in a 10 ml standard
flask.
Aspirate
the
sample
and
measure
the
absorbance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lead is deposited
on a hanging
mercury
drop
at a negative
( - ve ) potential
of -  O-6  V
versus
saturated
calomel
electrode
( SCE ).
Thell the lead is stripped back into the solution
by applying a positive ( + ve ) potential
scan.
The anodic current peak which
is measured
is
representative
of the lead
concentration
in the
sample.
For total dissolved lead the sample
is
filtered through a 0.45 pm membrane filter paper
prior to acidification
and analysis.
This method
is applicable
in the concentration
range
1.0 to
100 ,g/l
of lead.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2  Interferences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Selenium interferes
when it is present
in excess
of 50 Erg/l. This may be overcome
by adding
ascorbic acid which
reduces
selenium ( IV ) to
selenium
metal.
Irorl ( III ) interferes
when
present at levels greater
than
lead.
However,
this may be overcome
by warming
the solution
with hydroxylamine.
Also, the presence
of any
other neighbouring
stripping peaks which is less
than
100 mV
from
that
of the
lead
will
interfere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1
Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An acidified sample containing microgram quantities of lead is extriteted with
dithizone solution in chloroform. The extraction is carried out in the presence of
strong ammoniacal citrate-cyanide reducing agent (pH 10 to 11.5). The quantity
of lead present in the sample is determined spectrophotometrically by measuring
the absorbance
at 510 nm of the chloroform
extract containing
the lead
dithizonate complex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Minimum Deteetion Lirdt<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.0 ~g Pb/10 ml dithizone solution (extract).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3 Interference<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method uses a high pH, mixed colour and single
dithizone extraction. The
method is without interference. In strongly ammoniacal citrate-cyanide solution
(pH 10 to 11.5) dithizonesofSn(11)
and Tl (1) are unstable and extracted only<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
