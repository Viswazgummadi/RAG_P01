FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part
XLVII
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 19 September
1977,
after
the draft
finalized
by
the
Basic
Standards
on Electronics
and
Telecommunication
Sectional
Committee
in consultation
with Electronic
Measuring
Equipment
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Electronics
and Telecommunication
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With progressive
formulation
of Indian
Standards
on various
types of
digital
electronic
equipment,
the need
for uniform
definitions
of terms
relating
to these types of equipment
was felt.
With
a view to ensuring
this and avoiding
repetition
of these
terms
and
definitions
in individual
standards,
this standard
has been prepared.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This standard
is one of a series of Indian
Standards
on electrotechni-
cal vocabulary.
A list of the standards
so far brought
out in this series
related

and Telecommunication
is given on page 34.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
Where
the term  c  apparatus
’  is used without
any special
reference
in
this standard,
it covers both measuring
instruments
and convertors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where
the term  ‘  conversion
’  is used in a general
sense without
any
special reference
in this standard,
it covers
the overall
action
performed
by measuring
instruments
or convertors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Throughout,
this standard,
wherever,
‘  output
information
’  is men-
tioned,
the indication
( for example
the output information
in visual form )
is also implied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5

of Operation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  1 -
Depending
on the origin of the conversion
command,
the following
modes of operation
are the most typical:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Triggered,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) repetitive,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) tracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  2 -
Other
modes of operation
are,
for example,
maximum
seeking
and
minimum
seeking.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1
Triggered
Mode
of
Operation -
In
this
mode,
the
conversion
command
is of external
origin
( manual
or electrical
).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
Repetitive
( Cyclic ) Mode of Operation -
In this mode,
the conver-
sion command
is initiated
by an internal
clock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3
Tracking
Mode
of
Operation -
In
this
mode,
the
conversion
command
is initiated
by internal
circuits
sensing a change
of the quantity
to be measured/converted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3
Operating
Principles<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1
Instantaneous
Value Conversion -
Conversion
resulting
in a digital
representation
of the instantaneous
value
existing
during
the conversion
time of the input quantity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -Typical
principles
of operation
of apparatus
for measuring/converting
the instantaneous
values of the input
quantity
are given in 4.3.1.1 to 4.3.1.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.1
Successive approximation
ape -
An operating
principle
in which
a feedback
voltage
generator
provides
a set of regulated
voltages,
the
values
of which correspond
to binary
or decimal
digits.
Comparison
of
these
voltages
with
the
scaled
input
voltage
is made
in a prescribed
sequence
by steps of decreasing
magnitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.2
Sewo-balancing
ype -
An
operating
principle
in which
the
feedback
generator
consists
of servo-controlled
feedback
element
coupled
to a numerical
indicator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
feedback
voltage
is continuously
compared
with the scaled
input voltage.
A difference
between
them
causes the servo-element
to re-
establish
the balanced
state and to change
simultaneously
the numerical
indication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.3
Linear ramp type -An
operating
principle
in which a voltage
generator
periodically
or upon command
produces
a voltage which changes
linearly
with time ( ramp
signal ) and is compared
with the scaled input
voltage
by an error
detector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_14>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Synchronized
with the initiation
of the ramp or with the coincidence
of a value
of
the
ramp
with
a reference
voltage,
a gate
on a clock
oscillator
is opened
and kept open for the time interval
required
for the
ramp to become
equal to the scaled input value at which instant
the gate
is closed.
During
this interval,
the number
of clock
pulses gated
out is
counted
by a counter
circuit.
By relating
the slope of the ramp
to the
clock frequency,
the value of the output
information
is made
numerically
equal to the value of the input quantity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.4
Stepped
ramp
type -
In
operating
principle
similar
to the
linear ramp type, except
that the ramp is made

A count
of the number
of cycles
occurring
in
a fixed

interval
gives the measure
of the

value of the input quantity
during this interval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2.2
Linear dual slope &be -
An operating
principle
in which
the
sealed input quantity
is converted
to a proportional
current.
A capacitor
is charged
by this current
over a defined
period of time and subsequently
discharged
linearly
by a current
having
a defined value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The period of time required

Injluence Error -
The
error
determined
when
one
influence
quantity
assumes
any value within
its rated
range
of use ( or an influen-
cing characteristic
assumes
any value within
its effective
range ), all others
being
at reference

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-
When  over the whole rated range of use a substantially
linear relation-
ship exists between the influence error and the effect causing
it, the relationship
may be conveniently
expressed in coefficient form.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.11  Stability
Error-The
error in the output information
or in the
zero indication of an apparatus
during a specified time, other condition
remaining
constant.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.11.1
Stability
error
in
the
out&t
information
-
Stability
error
manifesting itself by changes of the output information
over a specified
period of time, the value of the input signal being held constant at a
specified value which is significantly
different from zero.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE-
According
to the time
interval
considered,
a distinction
is drawn
between short-term
and long-term
stability error.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.11.2  Stability
error of the electrical
zero -
Stability
error manifest-
ing itself by changes of the zero indication
over a specified
period
of
time, the input being connected to a specified passive network.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.11.3
Components of the stability
error -
The stability error is divided
into fluctuation
and
drift.
Above
a frequency
limit
specified by the
manufacturer,
this stability error is considered as fluctuation,
while below
the limit it is considered as drift.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.11.4
Fluctuation
( PAKD
-
Periodic
and
random
deviations ) -
Periodic and/or random deviations from the average of the output informa-
tion or of the electrical
zero.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.11.5
Drift -
The generally slow and continuous but not necessa-
rily unidirectional
deviation of the output information
or of the electrical
zero as a function of time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>iYo~r:-According
to the time
interval
considered,
a distinction
is drawn
between short-term
and long-term
drift.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.12  Limits of Error -The
maximum
values of error assigned by the
manufacturer
to a measured ( converted ) quantity of an apparatus operat-
ing under specified conditions,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.13
zero Shift -
The difference between two values of the electrical
zero  when one influence quantity assumes successively two specified values
within its rated range of use, all other quantities being at constant values
within the rated operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.14
Variation
( In Output Information
)  -may
be expressed according
to one of the following definitions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The
difference
between
the output information
signal
values
( indications  )  for a constant
input value when one influence
quantity
assumes
successively
two specified
values within
its
rated range of use, all other quantities
being at reference
condi-
tions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>27<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_29>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 18& ( Part XLVU ) - 1977<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The
difference
between the required
input signal values for a
constant
output
information
signal
( indication ) when
one
influence
quantity
assumes successively two specified values, all
other quantities being at reference conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.15
Repeatability-The
ability
of the apparatus
to give identical
results when measurements
( conversions ) are performed
successively but
nevertheless
under
constant
conditions.
In
general,
repeatability
is
expressed in statistical terms, that is, by the consistency
and the related
confidence
level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-The
period
of elapsed
time over which the successive measurements
( conversions ) are taken should be short with respect to the period over which short-
term drift is determined
in order to separate
these effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
