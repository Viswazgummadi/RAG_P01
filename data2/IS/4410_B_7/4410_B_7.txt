FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part
11/See
7 ) was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
28 February
1984, after the draft finalized
by
the Terminology
Relating
to River
Valley
Projects
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
A number
of
Indian
Standards
have
already
been
printed
covering
various
aspects
of
river valley
projects
and a large
number
of
standards
are in the process
of
formulation.
These
standards
include
technical
terms,
the
precise
definitions
of
which
are required
to avoid
ambiguity
in their
interpretation.
TO achieve
this end,
the
Institution
is bringing
out
glossary
of
terms
relating
to river
valley
projects
( IS :4410
) which
is being
published
in parts.
The
other
parts
of
this
standard
so
far
published
are given
on page
8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
( Part
11 )
covers
the
important
field
of
hydrology
which
is
a
separate
science
by itself.
In
view
of
the vastness
of
this
subject,
the
subject
is being
covered
in different
sections.
Other
sections
will
be
the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

In the formulation
of
this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in
addition
to
relating
