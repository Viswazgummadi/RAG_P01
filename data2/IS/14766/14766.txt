<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Soil
Quality and Improvement Sectional Committee had been approved by the Food and Agriculture Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Soil mass consists of mainly sand, silt and clay fractions. However, these primary soil particles do not exist as
such, but are bound together in varying degrees into larger secondary units termed ‘aggregates’ by cementing
materials such as organic matter and its by-products. The size distribution of these aggregates determines the
physical environment of soil for root growth and its proliferation and consequently crop production potential.
The binding forces between the primary soil particles and their ability to withstand the impact of dispersive
forces such as kinetic energy of rain, water and wind determines the aggregate stability. Scientists have
developed a technique for simulating the impact of dispersion forces in laboratory to quantify the degree and
extent of aggregation and its stability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, help have been derived from the following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Baver, L.D. and H.F. Rhoades (1932). Aggregate analysis as an aid in the study of soil structure
relationships. Journal of American Society of Agronomy, 24:920-930.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

soil structure. Report 2, pp. 77-122, Perm. Agriculture Experimental Station. Division of Agricultural

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
