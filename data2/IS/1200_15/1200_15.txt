<<HEADING level=1>>( Fourth Revision /<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part 15 ) ( Fourth
Revision ) was adopted
by
the Indian Standards Institution on  20  March 1987, after the draft finalized
by the Civil Works Measurement Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies a very important place in planning and execu-
tion of any civil engineering work from the time of first estimates to final
completion and settlement of payments of the subject. The methods follow-
ed for measurement
are not uniform
and considerable differences exist
between practices followed by one construction
agency and another and
also between various Central and State Government departments.
While
it is recognized that each system of measurement
has to be specifically
related
to the administrative and financial organizations within the depart-
ment responsible for work, a unification of the various systems at technical
level has been accepted
as very desirable, specially as it permits a wider
circle of operation for civil engineering contractors and eliminates ambigui-
ties and misunderstandings
arising out of inadequate
understanding
of
various systems followed.
0.3 Among the various civil engineering items, measurement of building
had been first to be taken up for standardization
and this standard,
having
provisions
relating
to all building works, was first published in 1958 and
then revised in 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the course of usage of this standard
( IS  :  1200-1964* ) by various
construction
agencies in the country, several clarifications and suggestions
for modifications were received and, as a result of study, the Committee
decided that its scope, besides being applicable to buildings, should be
expanded
so as to cover method
of measurement
applicable
to
civil
engineering works, such as industrial project works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  1200 ( Part 15 ) - 1987<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  Since various
trades are not related
to one another, the Committee
decided that each type of trade
as given in IS : 1200-1964* be issued
separately
as a different
part,
which will be helpful to specific users in
yari’ous trades. This part covering
method
of measurement
of painting,
polishing,
varnishing,
etc, applicable to building as well as civil engineer-
ing works was, therefore, issued as a second revision in 1968 and third
revision in 1976.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 In the course of use of this standard in the past ten years, suggestions
for improvement of some of the clauses were received. This fourth revision
covers modifications
in respect of painting of steel work and inclusion of
painting of flush doors, besides updating the requirement so as to bring it
in line with revisions of relevant Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expres-
sing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-19601_. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
( Part 15 ) covers the method of measurement of paint-
ing, polishing, varnishing, etc, in buildings and civil engineering works.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Method
of measurement
of painting
of building surfaces are covered in
IS  :  1200 (,Part 13 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. GENERAL RULES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
