<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Junction of Parapet, Wall and Roof -
Glass fibre in-situ treatment
shall be applied as flashings wherever junctions of vertical and horizontal
structures occur with minimum overlap of 100 mm. Glass fibre tissue shall
be cut to the required size and hot bitumen poured on the surface to the
extent required
and simultaneously
embed the glass fibre tissue into it.
The lower edge of the flashing shall overlap the in-situ treatment
laid on
the horizontal
surface of the roof and the upper edge of the flashing shall
be tucked into the chase ( 50 mm wide and 50 mm deep ) 150 mm above
the finished roof level on the vertical face of the wall.
In case of multi-
layer treatments,
the joints in the glass fibre tissue between
successive
layers are staggered with those of the layer beneath it. After the flashings
are properly
bonded,
the chase shall be filled
up with cement mortar
( normally
1  :  4 ) or lime mortar ( 1  :  3 ) or cement concrete
( 1  :  3  :  6 )
which when set will satisfactorily
secure the treatment
to the wall.
The
chase when filled shall be cured by watering for at least 4 days after filling
to ensure satisfactory
strength and to avoid shrinkage
cracks.
Figures 2
and 3 give typical details of joint between junction
of masonry
and RCC

by the bitumen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
