<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part VIII
) was adopted
by the Indian
Stand-
ards Institution
on 3 December
1981,
after the draft
finalized
by
the
Acoustics
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Electronics
and Telecommunication
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The purpose
of this standard
is to establish
a method
for determining
the noise reducing
value of a floor covering
under standard
test conditions.
The test is limited to the specification
of procedures
for the physical measure-
ments by means of an artificial
source
( standard
tapping
machine
) under
laboratory
conditions
and is not concerned
with the subjective
significance
of the results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard,
which covers laboratory
measurements
of the reduction
of transmitted
impact
noise by floor covering
on a standard
floor is one
of the series of Indian
Standards
on measurement
of sound insulation
in
buildings
and of building

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This
standard
Part
( VIII
) specifies
a method
for
measuring
the
acoustical
properties
of floor coverings
from
the viewpoint
of
reducing

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 This
standard
is applicable
to all floor coverings,
whether
single or
multi-layered,
as installed
on a standardized
floor structure.
In the case
of multi-layered
coverings,
they
may be factory-assembled
or assembled
at the test site. The test method
applies only to laboratory
measurement.
It does not contain
any provision that permits an assessment of the effective-
ness of a floor covering
in situ.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Preparation
and
Installation
of Test
Specimens<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1  Classijcation -
Depending
upon
the
type
of floor
covering,
the
test specimens
should be samples
which are either slightly
larger than the
tapping
machine
or of room size.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.1
Category  1 ( Small  Specimens ) -
This
category
includes
flexible
coverings
( plastics, rubber,
cork, matting,
or combinations
thereof ), which
may be installed
loosely or adherently
to the floor surface.
The method
of
installation
should be described
clearly
in the report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.2
Category II
( Large Specimens ) -This
category
includes
rigid
homogeneous
surface materials
or complex
floor coverings
of which at least
one constituent
is rigid. The assembled
floor covering
may be tested under
load. In this case, the average
load should be 100 kg/m2 (see for example,
Fig.
1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.3
Category  III
( Stretched Materials ) -
This
category
includes
flexible
coverings
which cover the floor from wall to wall. Large specimens
should be tested, but loading
is not required.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.4
Materials of uncertain classijcation -
In the case of uncertainty
as to the appropriate
category
for a material,
the testing
laboratory
will
decide whether
small or large specimens
will be tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2
Installation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>~4.3.2.1 Adhesive mounting -
Coverings
to be mounted
with
adhesive
should be installed
with great
care,
normally
with adhesive
covering
the
entire
surface.
If the adhesive
is applied
in isolated
patches,
the exact
procedure
should be described.
The manufacturer’s
instructions
for use of
the adhesive
should
be followed,
especially
with regard
to the amount
and the open-time.
The
type of adhesive
and the open-time
should
be
reported.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2.2
Curing period prior to test -
Coverings
such a concrete
floating
slabs cast in place
should not be tested until after the customary
curing
period,
for example,
three weeks for ordinary
concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Categories II and III -
The
specimen
should
cover the whole
surface
from wall to wall, or in any case at least IO_mZ with a minimum
dimension
of 2.3 m.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4  Influence
of Temperature
and Humidity-Generally,
and cer-
tainly in the case of surfaces whose acoustical
properties
are likely to depend
on either
temperature
or humidity,
the temperature
at the centre
of the
upper floor surface and the humidity
of the air in the source room should
be measured
and reported.
The
floor temperature
thus observed
should
preferably
be in the range
27&2X.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  TEST
PROCEDURE
AND
EVALUATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Generation
of Sound Field<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  The
impact
sound
shall
be generated
by the tapping
machine
( see 3 ). The position of the tapping machine
shall be in accordance
with 5.5.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
On the bare floor slab or on a floating floor, the duration
of measure-
ments should be sufficiently
brief so that the surface is not damaged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3
On a resilient
surface,
the measurements
should not begin
until
after the noise level has become
steady.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Measurement
of Impact
Sound
Pressure
Level<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1
The
impact
sound
pressure
level in the receiving
room
should
be an average
obtained
by using a number
of fixed microphone
positions
or a continuously
moving
microphone
with an integration
of ~2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2
When
in any
frequency
band
the sound
pressure
level
in the
receiving
room
is less than
10 dB above
the background
level, then
the
background
level should be measured
just before and after the determina-
tion of sound pressure
level due to the sound source and a correction
as
given in Table
1 shall be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3
The
above
corrections,
if any, are to be made
to the individual
readings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4
If the difference
is less than 3 dB, that is, the impact sound pressure
level is less than the background
level, a precise value of the impact sound
pressure
level cannot
be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

or corresponding
pressure
levels.
If a sound level
meter
is used, it should
conform
to IS  :  9779-1981*
for precision
sound
level meters.
It is recommended
to use the meter
response
“slow”.
The
complete
measuring
system
including
the microphone
shall be calibrated
before
each
series of measurements
to absolute
values for measurements
in diffuse
sound
fields.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Frequency
Range
of Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1  The
sound
pressure
level
should
be measured
by using
third-
octave
or octave
band
filters.
The
discrimination
characteristics
of the
filters should be in accordance
with IS  :  6964-19737.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2
Third-octave

<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.3  If octave band filters are used, as a minimum
the series beginning
with centre frequency
125 Hz and ending at 2 000 Hz should be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 1 -
Use of lower frequency is dependent on the distribution of natural
frequency.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The minimum reverberation times for the empty room are adjusted
to a volume of 180 m3. For other volumes, these times should be multiplied by
the factor ( V/180)
l/3 ( V being the volume of the room expressed in cubic
meters ) except at high frequencies, where the air absorption is the predominant
factor influencing the decay rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

impact
machine
should
be placed
successively
on each
specimen
of floor covering,
being wholly on the sample in each case, and
on the bare floor slab on either side of the sample and as close to it as possible,
the axis of the hammers
being
always
parallel
to the long dimension
of
the sample
( see Fig.
2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.2.2
For
each
specimen
of floor covering,
the impact
noise level
corresponding
to the bare floor is the arithmetic
mean of the levels deter-
mined for the two machine
positions
on either side of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-When
the impact levels are measured at a single point only in the
receiving room, the measurements should be made within a sufficiently short
time so that there will be no variation in equivalent absorption area of the receiving
room during measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.1
The impact machine should be placed successively on the
bare floor and on the floor when entirely covered by the floor covering.
Machine locations should not be too close to the edges ( minimum 0.5 m )
nor in a corner of the room.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.2 Each set of measurements ( bare floor and covered floor )
should be made with as many machine positions as are necessary to yield
a reliable mean value; in any case the number of positions should be not
less than three.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

OF RESULTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  For the statement
of the test results,
the reduction
in impact
sound
pressure
level due to the floor covering
under
test should
be calculated
according
to 2.1 and given for all frequencies
of measurement
in the form
of a curve.
Also the normalized

<<HEADING level=3>>TEST
PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-l. EXAMPLE
OF A TEST PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.1  Where
the receiving
room is substantially
rectangular
with a volume
of about
50m3 it will contain
at least three randomly
orientated
diffusing
elements
or an equivalent
area of rotating
vane, the former having a typical
edge length of l-2 m each. The diffusers should not be suspended
from the
ceiling
under
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.2
The
conditions
of placement
of the tapping
machine
and specimen
are clearly stated in 5.5.1,
5.5.2 and 5.5.3.
It is required
that two different
random
microphone
positions
are used for each of the three tapping
posi-
tions, each reading
from each position
having an averaging
time of 5 s in
each frequency
band, No microphone
position should be nearer than 0.7 m
to the room
boundaries
or diffusers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.3  As an alternative,
the sound field sampling
procedure
can be carried
out using a rotating
microphone
device
having
a sweep radius
between
1 m and 1.5 m. In this case, the plane of the traverse is inclined
in relation
to the room
boundaries
and the device
should
have an averaging
time
equal to the traverse
time, which should be a minimum
of 30 s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.4
The equivalent
absorption
area should be determined
from readings
taken
using
three
microphone
positions
with
two
reverberation
time
analyses
at each
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
