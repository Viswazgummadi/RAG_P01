<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 48) (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by the Environmental Protection Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organic and inorganic mercury salts are very toxic and their presence in the environment,
especially in water, should be monitored. Therefore, it is desirable to ascertain the limit of
mercury present in water and wastewater. In the preparation of this standard, considerable
assistance has been derived from Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater,
16th Edition, 1985.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The technical committee responsible for formulation of IS 2488 and IS 3025 : 1964 decided to
revise all the parts covered under them and publish as separate parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This standard supersedes  13  of IS 2488 (Part 2) : 1968 Methods of sampling and test for industrial
effluents Part 2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation of this Indian Standard
is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (October 2000). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final
value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2 : 1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5 COLD VAPOUR ATOMIC ABSORPTION
SPECTROMETRY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard prescribes two methods for the
determination
of mercury
in water and
wastewater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The flameless atomic absorption procedure is a
physical method based on the absorption of
radiation at 253.7 nm by mercury vapour. The
mercury is reduced to the elemental state and
aerated from solution in a closed system. The
mercury
vapour
passes
through
a
cell
positioned in the light path of mercury hallow
cathode
lamp
of
an
atomic
absorption
spectrophotometer. Absorbance (peak height) is
measured
as
a
function
of
mercury
concentration and recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Cold vapour atomic absorption spectro-
photometric method, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Calorimetric dithizone method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

spectrophotometric method is suitable for all
types of samples such as natural waters,
potable
waters,
domestic
and
industrial
wastewaters. Lower detection limit of 0.2  µ g/l

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of this standard, definitions
given in IS 7022 (Part 1) : 1973 and IS 7022
(Part 2) : 1979 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  Atomic Absorption Spectrometer  (  AAS  )
and Associated Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instrument settings recommended by the
manufacturer shall be followed. Instruments
designed specifically for the measurement of
mercury using the cold vapour technique may
be substituted for the AAS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 SAMPLE PRESERVATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sampling bottles should be cleaned
thoroughly with dilute nitric acid (6 N) prior to
final rinsing with water. The water samples
should be collected and stored preferably in
polypropylene or chemically resistant glass
containers. For preservation, the sample should
be acidified with concentrated nitric acid (2 ml
of AR grade nitric acid in one litre of the sample
just to bring down the  p H below 2). For
dissolved mercury, filter the sample in the field
and acidify the filtrate with nitric acid to a  p H
of 2 or lower.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2   Mercury Vapour Generation Assembly<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consists of an absorption cell, peristaltic pump,
flow meter, aeration tubing and a drying tube
containing magnesium perchlorate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3   Mercury Hollow Cathode Lamp<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4   Recorder  /  Printer  /  Display Meter<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any multi-range variable recorder that is
compatible with the UV detection system is
suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Avoid excess nitric acid. Add 5 ml of 0.1 N
iodine solution to avoid losses of volatile organo mercury
components during handling and digestion of samples.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

5.4 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2   Nitric Acid  — Concentrated.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.3   Stannous Chloride Solution
Dissolve 25 g of stannous chloride (SnCl 2 ) in
water containing 50 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric acid and dilute to 250 ml. If a
suspension forms, stir reagent continuously
during use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.1   Instrument Operation
Follow the procedure of the manufacturer’s
operating manual. Connect the mercury vapour
generating assembly as shown in Fig. 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.2   Standardization
Transfer 100 ml of each of the 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0
µ g/l standard mercury solution and a blank of
100 ml water to 300 ml BOD bottles. Add 5 ml
of concentrated sulphuric acid and 2.5 ml of
concentrated nitric acid to each bottle. Add
15 ml of potassium permanganate solution to
each bottle and let stand for at least 15
minutes. Add 8 ml of potassium persulphate
(K 2 S 2 O 8 ) solution to each bottle and heat for 2
hours in a water bath at 95°C. Cool and add 6
ml of sodium chloride-hydroxylamine sulphate
solution to reduce the excess permanganate.
After decolourization add 5 ml of stannous
chloride
solution
and
attach
the
bottle
immediately to the aeration apparatus forming
a closed system. As mercury is volatilised and
carried into the absorption cell, absorbance will
increase to a maximum within a few seconds.
As soon as recorder returns approximately to
the base line, remove stopper holding the
aeration frit from the reaction bottle and
replace with a bottle containing distilled water.
Flush the system for a few seconds and run the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.3   Analysis of Sample
Transfer 100 ml of sample or portion diluted to
100 ml containing not more than 5.0  µ g/l
mercury to a 300 ml BOD bottle. Treat as
in  5.4.2  samples containing high (sea waters,
brines and effluents high in chloride) chlorides
require as much as an additional 25 ml
potassium permanganate solution. During this
step, chloride is converted into free chlorine
which is absorbed at 253.7 nm. Hence remove
all free chlorine before the mercury is reduced
and swept into the cell by using an excess (25
ml) of hydroxylamine sulphate solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6 COLORIMETRIC DITHIZONE METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.7   Dithizone Solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mercury ions react with dithizone solution in
chloroform to form an orange colour which is
measured
at
490
nm
using
a
spectrophotometer. The colorimetric dithizone
method is suitable for estimating higher levels
of mercury in potable waters (more than 2  µ g/l)
and has a minimum detection limit of 2  µ g/l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dithizone is often contaminated with the
oxidation product diphenyl thiocarbodizone or
with metals. To purify dithizone dissolve
100 mg of dithizone in 50 ml of chloroform in a
beaker and filter under slight vacuum using
Whatman No. 42 or equivalent filter paper.
Wash beaker and filter paper with 5 ml
portions of chloroform. Transfer the filtrate to
500 ml separatory funnel. Add 100 ml of 1
percent ammonium hydroxide and shake
moderately for
1
minute only. Transfer
chloroform layer to 250 ml separatory funnel
retaining orange-red aqueous layer in a 500 ml
funnel. Repeat extraction process keeping each
time chloroform layers separately in 250 ml
separatory funnels and using 1 percent a
minimum hydroxide. After three extractions,
transfer aqueous layer to 500 ml funnel.
Discard chloroform layer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Interference<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Copper, gold, palladium, divalent platinum and
silver react with dithizone in acid solution.
Copper in the dithizone extract remains in the
organic phase while the mercury dissolves in
the aqueous phase. The other contaminants
usually
are
not
present.
The
mercury
dithizonate being photosensitive should be
measured quickly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

portions, mixing each time till dithizone
precipitates
completely.
Add
25
ml
of
chloroform, shake well and orange-red colour
appears with three 25 ml portions chloroform.
Dilute the combined extract to 1 000 ml with
chloroform; 1 000 ml = 100  µ g dithizone. Dilute
