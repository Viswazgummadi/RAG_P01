<<PARAGRAPH>>Building Construction Practices Sectional Committee, CED 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 2) (Second Kewsion) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Building Construction Practices
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 2) was first published in 1971 and subsequently revised in 1981. In view of comments
received and further knowledge that has become available, the Committee responsible for formulation of this
standard decided to take up its revision. Considerable assistance has been provided by Central Building Research
Institute, Roorkee in revising this standard. In this revision, apart from other changes, Chlorpyrifos and Lindane
have been recommended for anti-termite treatment. Part 1 of this standard deals with constructional measures
and Part 3 deals with treatment for existing buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Termite control in buildings is very important as the damage likely to be caused by the termites is huge. Wood
is one of the cellulosic materials which termites damage, cellulose
forming their basic nutrient. They also
damage materials of organic origin with a cellulosic base, household articles like furniture, furnishings,
clothings, stationery, etc. Termites are also known to darnage non-cellulosic substances in their search for food.
Rubber, leather, plastics, neoprene as well as lead coating used for covering of underground cables are damaged
by termites. The widespread damage by termites, high constructional cost of buildings have necessitated
evolving suitable measures for preventing access of termites to buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On the basis of their habitat, termites are divided into two types, namely (a) Subterranean or ground nesting
termites, and (b) Non-subterranean or wood nesting termites having no contact with soil (see Annex A). The
subterranean termites are most destructive and are mainly responsible for the damage caused in buildings.
Typically, they form nests or colonies underground in the soil, near ground level in a stump or in other suitable
piece of timber, and some species may construct a conical or dome shaped mound. These colonies may persist
for many years and, as they mature, contain a population running into millions. All at@cks by subterranean
termites originate from the nest but timber either lying on or buried in the ground maybe reached by means of
shelter tubes constructed within, or over such materials or else by the erection of an independent, free standing
mud structure. Chemical barriers which prevent the termites from reaching the super-structure of the building
will protect the building and its contents. Treating the soil beneath the building and around the foundations
with a soil insecticide is a good preventing measure which is attracting attention throughout the world. The
purpose of this treatment is to create a chemical barrier between the ground from where the termites come and
woodwork, celhdosic materials and other contents of the buildings which may form food for the termites. Timber
which is seasoned and is naturally durable in heartwood may be used in the building structure.
However,
non-durable timbers and sapwood of all timbers should be treated to withstand the attack of drywgod termites
(see IS 401 and IS 1141).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given in Annex D.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)’. The number of significant places retained in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

CHEMICAL
TREATMENT
MEASURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>(Second Revision)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>might be established.
In order to ensure uniform
distribution
of the treating
solution and to assist
penetration, some site preparation, may be necessary.
The information given in 4.1.1 to 4.1.4 is for guidance
in preparing a building site for chemical treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 2) gives recommendations for the
chemical
treatment of soils for the protection of
buildings from attack by subterranean termites.
It
includes reference to the chemicals to be used, lays
down minimum rates of application for usage, and
outlines procedures to be followed while the building
is under construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.LI
Heavy Soils and Sloping Sites<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On clay and other heavy soils where penetration is
likely to be slow and on sloping sites where run off of
the treating solution is likely to occur, the surface of
the soil should be scarified to a depth of at least 75 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standards
given in Annex B contain
provisions,
which through reference
in this text,
constitute provision of this standard. At the time of
publication, the editions indicated were valid.
All
standards
are subject to revision,
and parties to
agreements based on this standard are encouraged to
investigate the possibility of applying the most recent
editions of@e s@dm,ds indicated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.2  Sandy or Porous Soils<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On loose, sandy or porous soils where loss of treating
solution through piping or excessive percolation is
likely to occur, preliminary moistening to fill the
capillary spaces in the soil is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.3  Levelling, Excavations
and Filling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All sub floor
levelling
and grading
should
be
completed; all cuttings, trenches and excavations
should be completed
with backfilling
in place,
borrowed fill must be free from organic debris and
should be well compacted.
If this is not done
supplementary treatments should be made to complete
the barrier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of this standard,
the following
definitions shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Chemical Barrier<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The layer of chemically treated soil in immediate
contact with the foundation and floor structure of a
building which kills or repels termites thus forming a
barrier which is impervious to termite entry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.L4
Concrete Formwork<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All concrete formwork, Ievelling pegs, timber off-cuts
and other builder’s debris should be removed from the
area to be treated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Soil Treatment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The application of chemicals (toxicants) to the soil
adjacent to and under a building to form a chemical
barrier which is lethal or repellent to termites.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 CHEMICALS AND RATE OF APPLICATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Basic Principle<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Pre-Construction
Soil Treatment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Chemical toxic to subterranean termites maybe used
effectively to check termite infestation in the soil.
These are useful in the treatment of new building sites
and may also be used to eradicate existing infestation
in buildings
and to prevent
reinfestation.
The
effectiveness and/or residual activity depend upon the
choice of the chemicals, the dosages adopted and the
thoroughness of application. The chemical solutions
or emulsions are required to be dispersed uniformly in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is a process in which soil treatment is applied to
a buildlng during the early stages of its construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 SITE PREPARATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The removal of trees, stumps, logs or roots from
a building site reduces the hazards from subterranean
termites. Similarly, the sub floor area should be kept
free from all debris in which new colonies of termites<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_4>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1S 6313 (Part 2) :2001<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the soil and of the required strength so as to form an
effective
chemical
barrier
which is lethal and
repellent to termites.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>chemical emulsion has been absorbed by the soil and
the surface is quite dry.
Treatment should not be
carried out when it is raining or when the soil is wet
with
rain
or sub-soil
water.
The
foregoing
requirements applies also in the case of treatment to
the filled earth surface within the plinth area before
laying the sub-grade for the floor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Mound Treatment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If termite mounds are found within the plinth area of
the buildings these should be destroyed by means of
insecticides
in the form of water suspension
or
emulsion which should be poured into the mounds at
several
places
after
breaking
open the earthen
structure and making holes with crow-bars.
The
quantity to be used will depend upon the size of the
mound. For a mound volume of about 1 m3,4 litres of
an emulsion in water of one percent Chlorpyrifos
20 EC or Lindane 20 EC may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Dkturbance<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once formed,
treated
soil barriers
shall not be
disturbed.
If, by chance, treated soil barriers are
disturbed, immediate steps shall be taken to restore the
continuity and completeness of the  barrier  system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 TREATMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1
Soil Treatment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Soil Treatment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The chemical emulsions described in 5.3 shall be
applied uniformly at the prescribed rate in all the
stages of the treatment.
A suitable hand operated
compressed air sprayer or watering can should be used
to facilitate
uniform
disposal
of the chemical
emulsion. On large jobs, a power sprayer maybe  used
to save labour and time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Treating the soil beneath the building and around the
foundations with a soil insecticide is a preventive
measure. The purpose of the treatment is to create a
chemical barrier between the ground from where
termites come and woodwork or other cellulosic
materials in the buildings.
The following chemicals
conforming
to relevant
Indian Standard in water
emulsion are effective when applied uniformly over
the area to be treated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.1
In the event of waterlogging
of foundation, the
water shall be pumped out and the chemical emulsion
applied when the soil is absorbent.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The chemicals
described in this code are insecticides
with a persistent
action
and are regarded
highly poisonous.
These chemicals
can have an adverse effect upon health when
absorbed through the skin, inhaled as vapours or spray-mists
or
swallowed.
Derailed precautions
for the safe handting of these
chemicals
are given in ,%rrex C. Persons carrying out chemical
soil treatment
in accordance
with tlds code should familiarize
themselves
for these precautions
and exercise
due care when
handling the chemical whether in concentrate
or in diluted form.
The use of the chemical
should be avoided where there is any
risk of wells or other water supplies becoming contaminated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2 After the masonry foundations and the retaining
wall of the basements
come up, the backfill
in
immediate contact with the foundation structure shall
be treated at the rate of 7.5 l/m2 of the vertical surface
of the sub-structure for each side. If water is used for
ramming the earth fill, the chemical treatment shall be
carried out after the ramming operation is done by
rodding the earth at 150 mm centres close to parallel
to the wall surface and spraying the chemical emulsion
at the above dosage.
After the treatment, the soil
should be tamped in place.
The earth is usually
returned inlayers and the treatment shall be carried out
in similar stages.
The chemical emulsion shall be
directed towards the masonry surfaces so that the earth
in contact with these surfaces is well treated with the
chemical (see Fig, 2 and 3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 ESSENTIAL
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
BARRIER AND METHOD OF APPLICATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Conditions of Formation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Barrier shall be complete and continuous under the
whole of the structure to be protected. All foundations
shail be fully surrounded by and in close contact with
the barrier or treated soil. Each part of the area treated
shall receive the prescribed dosage of chemical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3  Treatment for RCC Foundations
and Basement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Time of Application<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1
The treatment described
in 7.2.1
and 7.2.2
applies
essentially
to masonry foundations
where
there are voids in the joints through  which termites are
able to seek entry
into buildings.
Hence
the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Soil treatment should start when foundation trenches
and pits are ready to take massconcrete in foundations.
Laying
of mass concrete
should start when the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 6313 (Part 2) :2001<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>foundations require to be completely enveloped by a
chemical barrier. In the case of RCC foundations, the
concrete
is dense
being
a 1:2:4
(cement:
fine
aggregates: coarse aggregates, by volume) mix or
richer, the termites are unable to penetrate it, it is
therefore, unnecessary to start the treatment from the
bottom of excavations.
The treatment shall start at a
depth of 500 mm below the ground level except when
such ground level is raised or lowered by filling or
cutting after the foundations have been cast. In such
cases, the depth of 500 mm shall be determined from
the new soil level resulting from the filling or cutting
mentioned above, and soil in immediate contact with
the
vertical
surfaces
of RCC foundations shall be
treated at the rate of 7.5 I/m*. The other details shall
be as laid down in 7.2.2 (see Fig. 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>building be graded on completion of building, this
treatment should be carried out on completion of such
grading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.1 In the
event
of
filling
being
more than
300 mm, the external perimeter treatment shall extend
to the full depth of filling upto the ground level so as
to ensure continuity of the chemical barrier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7  Treatment
of Soil Under Apron Along
External
Perimeter
of Building<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Top surface of the consolidated earth over which the
apron is to be laid shall be treated with chemical
emulsion at the rate of 5 l/m2of the surface before the
apron is laid.
If consolidated earth does not allow
emulsion to seep through, holes up to 50 to 75 mm
deep at 150 mm centres both ways may be made with
12 mm diameter mild steel
rod
on
the surface to
facilitate saturation of the soil with the chemical
emulsion (see Fig. 3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Treatment
of Top Surface of Plinth Filling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The top surface of the consolidated earth within plinth
walls shall be treated with chemical emulsion at the
rate of 5 l/m2 of the surface before the sand bed or
sub-grade is laid.
If the filled earth has been well
rammed and the surface does not allow the emulsion
to seep through, holes up to 50 to 75 mm deep at
150 mm centres both ways maybe made with 12 mm
diameter mild steel rod on the surface to facilitate
saturation of the soil with the chemical emulsion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8
Treatment
of Walls
Retaining
Soil
Above
Floor Level<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Retaining walls like the basement walls or outer walls
above the floor level retaining soil need to be protected
by providing chemical barrier by treatment of retained
soil in the immediate vicinity of the wall, so as to
prevent entry of termites through the voids in masonry,
cracks and crevices, etc above the floor level. The soil
retained by the walls shall be treated at the rate of
7.5 l/m2 of the vertical surface so as to effect a
continuous outer chemical barrier, in continuation
with that of the one formed under 7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5  Treatment
at Junction
of the Wall
and
the
Floor<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Speciai care shall be taken to establish continuity of
the vertic *Ichernic?l barrier on inner wall surface from
ground level (where it had stopped with the treatment
described in 7.2.2) up to the level of the filled earth
surface. To achieve this, a small channel 30 mm x
30 mm shall be made at all the junctions of wall and
columns with the floor (before laying the sub-grade)
the rod holes made in the channel up to the ground
level 150 mm apart and the iron rod moved backward
and forward to break up the earth and chemical
emulsion poured along the wall at the rate of 7.5 l/m2
of vertical wall or column surface so as to soak the soil
right to the bottom. The soil should be tamped back
into place after the operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9  Treatment
of Soil Surrounding
Pipes, Wastes
and Conduits<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When pipes, wastes and conduits enter the soil inside
the area of the foundations, soil surrounding the point
of entry shall be loosened around each such pipe, waste
or conduit for a distance of 150 mm and to a depth of
75 mm before treatment is commenced.
When they
enter the soil external to the foundations, they shall be
similarly treated at a distance of over 300 mm unless
they stand clear of the walls of the building by about
75 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Treatment
of Soil Along External
Perimeter
of
Building<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10 Treatment  for Expansion
Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the building
is complete,
the earth along the
external perimeter of the building should be rodded at
intervals of 150 mm and to a depth of 300 mm. The
rods should be moved backward and forward parallel
to the wall to break up the earth and chemical emulsion
poured along the wall at the rate of 7.5 l/m2of vertical
surfaces.
After the treatment, the earth should be
tamped back into place. Should the earth outside the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Expansion joints at ground floor level are one of the
biggest hazards for termite
infestation.
The soil
beneath these joints should receive special attention
when the treatment under 7.4 is carried out.
This
treatment should be supplemented by treating through
the expansion joint after the sub-grade has been laid,
at the rate of 2 litres per linear metre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of ants which have two pair of wings
of unequal size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-1
CLASSIFICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.1
Termites  constitute a separate order of insects
called  ‘ISEPTORA’. Although, they are commonly
called white ants, they are not telated to ants. The front
pair of wings of the ants are longer than their hind pair
whereas in termites, both pairs are equal. There are
over 2300 species of termites of which about 220 are
found in India. All these species are not conside~d to
be serious pests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.2 According
to their habits, termites can be
divided into two well defined groups-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Subterranean or ground nesting termites which
build nests in the soil and live in them, and
b)
Non-subterranean
or wood nesting termites
which live in wood with no contact with soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.6
The food  of the termite is cellulosic material
like timber, grass, stumps of dead trees, droppings of
herbivorous animals, paper, etc. Once termites have
found a suitable foot-hold in or near a building, they
start spreading slowly from a central nest through
underground and over-ground galleries in the case of
subterranean
termites,
and galleries
within
the
structural member.
Once they get direct access to
them in the case of drywood termites. In their search
for food they by pass any obstacle like concrete or
resistant timber to get a suitable food many metres
away.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.3 Subterranean
termites
require
moisture
to
sustain their life. They normally need access to ground
at all times. They build tunnels between their nest and
source of food through
covered runways. These
covered tunnels provide humidity conditions thus
preventing
desiccation
and protection
against
predators, darkness necessary for their movement and
for maintaining contact with earth. The subterranean
termites enter a building from ground level, under the
foundation,
working
their way upwards through
floors, destroying all before them. So little is seen of
these termite operations that sometimes the structural
member attacked is found to be merely a shell with the
inside completely riddled and eaten away.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.7 In subterranean termite colony, the workers
feed the reproductive,
soldiers, winged adults and
young nymphs.
One of the habits of the termites
which is of interest is the trophallaxis by means of
which food and other material remain in circulation
among different members of the colony. Workers are
also in the habit of licking the secretions of exudating
glmds of the physogastric queen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.4 The wood nesting species comprise drywood
and dampwood termites.
Drywood termites which
predominate are able to live even in fairly drywood
and with no contact with soil.
These frequently
construct nests within large dimensional timbers such
as rafters, posts, door and window frames, etc, which
they destroy, if not speedily exterminated. However,
they are not as prevalent and common as subterranean
termites, and are generally confined to coastal regions
and interiors of eastern India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2 DEVELOPMENT
OF TERMITE
COLONY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1 At certain periods of the year, particularly after
a few warm days followed by rain, emergence of
winged adults on colonizing
flights, occum. This
swarming, also called the nuptial flight, may take place
any time during the monsoon or post-monsoon period,
The fight is short and most of the adults perish due to
one reason or the other. The surviving ~errnitessoon
find their mates, shed their wings and establish a
colony if circumstances are favorable.
The female of
the pair or queen produces a few eggs in the first year.
The first batch of the brood comprises only of workers.
The rate of reproduction however, increases rapidly
after 2 to 3 years. Although a colony may increase in
size comparatively rapidly,
very little darnage may
occur in a period less than 8 to 10 yearn. Any serious
damage that may occur in a short time is-+erhaps due
to heavy infestation in the initial stages due to large<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.5 A termite
colony
consists
of a pair
of
reproductive,
the so-called king and queen and a large
number of sterile workers, soldiers, and nymphs. If,
however, the queen is lost or destroyed, her place taken
by a number of supplementary reproductive in some
group of termites; thus by removing the queen, the
colony will not be destroyed. All the work of the
colony is carried out by the workers. Guarding the
colony is the work of the soldlers. The adult workers
and soldiers are wingless. The workers are generally<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

RECOGNIZING
THE PRESENCE
OF
TERMITE
INFESTATION
IN BUILDING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.2 Drywood termites on the contrary may be
recognized
by
their
pellets
of
excreta.
Non-subterranean termites excrete pellets of partly
digested wood. These may be found in tunnels or on
the floor underneath the member which they have
attacked.
These termites may further be noticed by
blisters
on wood surfaces
due to their forming
chambers close to the surface by eating away the wood
and leaving only a thin film of wood on the surface.
Also the hollow wand on tapping structural timber
will indicate their destructive activity inside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1
Swarms of winged reproductive
flying from
the soil or wood are the first indication of termite
infestation in a building. Often the actual flight may
not be observed but the presence of wings discarded
by them will be a positive
indication
of a well
established termite colony nearby.
Termite darnage
is not always evident from the exterior in the case of
subterranean termites, since they do not reduce wood
to a powdery mass of particles like some of the wood
borers or drywood termites. These termites are also<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
