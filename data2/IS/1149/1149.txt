FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Third Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 November
1582, after the draft finalized
by
Wrought
Ste&l Product: Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Structural
and Metals Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
was first published
in 1957 and was revised in 1064
and 1973.
In view of the experience
gained
during the subsequent
years
the committee
has decided
to revise this Indian
Standard
incorporating
the following
main modifications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) Strengths
have been specified
in term of MPa, in alignment
with
adoption
of SI units both nationally
and internationally;
and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) Clause
on
retest
has been
deleted
as it is duly
covered
in
IS  :  8910-1978*<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accord-
ance with IS  :  2-196Ot.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the
rounded
off value
should
be the same as that of the specified
value
in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.i  This standard
covers the requirements
for high tensile steel rivet bars
in sizes  up to  40  mm diameter
for structural
purposes.<<HEADING_END>>

bars,
when not secured
in bundles,
shall
each be legibly
marked as specified in 13.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  The use of the Standard
Mark
is governed
by the provisions
of the
Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1936 and the Rules
and Regulations
made
there-
under.
The Standard
Mark on products
covered by an Indian Standard conveys
the assurance that they have been produced to comply with the requirements
of that
standard
under a well defined
system
of inspection,
testing and quality control
which is devised and supervised by BIS and operated
by the producer.
Standard
marked
products
are also continuously
checked
by BIS for conformity
to that
standard as a further safeguard.
Details of conditions
under
which a licence for
the use of the Standard
Mark may be granted to manufacturers
or producers
may
be obtained from the Bureau of Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
