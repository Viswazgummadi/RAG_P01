<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 2 ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
Hydraulic Structures Instrumentation
Sectional Committee had been approved by the River Valley Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stress and stability analysis of concrete and masonry dams is carried out by considering the existence of uplift
across different horizontal planes, having uplift intensity-distribution
in accordance with the design criteria
in practice. The effect of the uplift is to induce instability on account of resulting buoyancy in weight of the
material in dam above the horizontal section under consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Arrays of pore pressure cells in concrete and masonry at different elevations, spaced at suitable distances from
the upstream face, would provide information on the status of pore pressure at the time of observation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Large concrete and masonry dams are provided with a row or rows of internal formed drains. A record of the
pore pressure development and its variations would indicate the effectiveness and adequacy of these drains. At
the same time, any sudden and significant variations in the pore pressure development may be indicative of
some structural damage or deficiency in the dam material, warranting timely remedial measures being undertaken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For measuring the pore~pressures in the body of concrete and masonry dams, the following device/instruments
are used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Uplift pressure pipes; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Electrical pressure cells which maybe of two types, namely<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Electrical resistance Jype pore pressure cells, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Vibrating wire type pore pressure cells.
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Uplift pressure pipes and electrical resistance type pressure cells are covered in IS 6532: 1972 ‘Code of practice
for design, installation, observation and maintenance of uplift pressure pipes for hydraulic structures on permeable
foundations’ and IS 8282 ( Part 1 )  :  1976 ‘Code of practice for installation, maintenance and observation of
pore pressure measuring devices in concrete and masonry dams: Part 1 Electrical resistance type cell’ respectively.
This standard, Part 2 covers the vibrating wire type pressure cells only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to international
co-ordination
among the
standards and practices prevailing in different countries. In addition, the practices in the field in this country
have also been considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numeiical values  (  revised )‘.  The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard ( Part 2 ) covers the details of installation,
maintenance and observation of vibrating wire type
pore pressure measuring cells in concrete and masonry
dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Representative blocks of the dam should be selected
for the installation of these cells. Generally one of
the deepest overflow and non-overflow sections should
be selected for instrumentation.
The cells should
be installed in two or three levels in rows. The bottom
row of pore pressure cells may be located a little
above the foundation level ( say about 1.5 m ) or as
may be required by the design. The second row may
be installed at one-third or half the height of the dam.
The spacing of the cells in each row may be 10 to
15 metres along the width of the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5 EQUIPMENT
3 INSTRUMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The equipment consists of vibrating wire type pore
pressure transducer, a signal cable and a frequency
indicator/read out unit.
The basic principle of the vibrating wire transducer
is that the change in natural frequency of stretched
wire depends on the change of the tension in the wire.
In this instrument, one end of the gauge wire is attached
to the centre of circular membrane and the other
end is secured to the top of the transducer housing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Operating
Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Transducer<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A  typical vibrating wire type piezometer assembly
is illustrated in Fig. 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pressure
transducer
consists
of a hollow
cylindrical body made of non-corrodable metal like
ferro-manganese, bronze or stainless steel. The body
houses a stainless steel membrane to which one end
of the vibrating wire element is secured. The other
end of the vibrating wire element is secured to the
body. Close to this wire element a magnet assembly
is mounted.
Cable connections are taken out from
the magnet assembly through the top end of the
piezometer body and sealed with protective seal to
prevent leakage of water.to the vibrating wire assembly.
The magnet assembly connected through the cable
to the frequency indicator should be capable of exciting
and picking up the frequency of vibrations that are
read on the indicator.
The transducer
should
incorporate suitable diodes for over-voltage protection
to avoid damage from transient voltages and lightening,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fluid pressure applied to the membrane
causes
deflection of the membrane with consequent change
in the tension of the wire and its resonant frequency.
Thus~the frequency of the gauge wire is a measure
of the deflection
of the membrane
which is
proportional to the pressure change.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1 The main advantages of vibrating wire type
instruments are given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Easy to read.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Effects of signal cable resistance, contact
resistance’, leakage to ground or length of
signal cable are negligible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Frequency signal permits datatransmission
over long distance and thus suitable for
remote observation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Cable to connect the transducer to the-readout unit
should be selected depending on the environments
in which the cable is laid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The permeability and bubbling pressure ( pressure
of entry of air ) of filter element should be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For normal environment; cables with two core single
pair cable with annealed copper conductors and with
copper shielding;
heavy PVC coating should be
adequate.’ However in adverse environments, steel
armoured
petroleum jelly filled and polyethylene
insulated cable should be used.
Heavily armoured
cables with 10, 20 or more pairs should be used to
connect junction boxes to the instrument houses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

converting
the frequency

<<PARAGRAPH>>near the top of a lift, where placement
can be
accomplished after concreting in the area has been
completed. A hole just large enough to accommodate
the instrument and about 300 mm deep should be
dug at the desired location.
Fine sand cushioning
should be provided before placing mortar around the
instrument.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sophisticated
Datalogging

<<HEADING level=3>>6  CALIBRATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2 Frames or brackets to hold the cell in position
during embedment, should not be used, since these
would possibly provide a leakage path directly, to
the cell. Concrete or mortar (as the case may be)
should be placed by hand around the instrument and
tamped lightly so as to obtain contact between the
body of the cell and the surrounding concrete/masonry.
Excessive tamping of the concrete/masonry
should
be avoided as this would result in a highly impermeable
zone around the cell and affect the normal build-up
of
hydrostatic
pressure.
After embedment,
a
temporary cover of boards laid over the cell locations
provide protection
until the concrete/mortar
has
hardened.
The ends of cables attached to the pore
pressure cells which remain uncovered for a while
until these are properly terminated in a terminal board.
should be protected by cable protection caps. This
precaution is considered necessary with..a view tb
prevent moisture and water entering the pore pressure
cells through the cable ends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each transducer should be calibrated separately on
a suitable calibrating system in the laboratory prior
to taking the instrument to field for installation.
It
is not practicable
to recalibrate
a sensor after
installation and therefore good long term stability
of the sensors is important to obtain reliable results,
The sensor should be capable of being overloaded
to 1.5 times its rated capacity.
While calibrating
the sensors, the transducers should be over-loaded
by 10 percent at least 10 times to stabilize the
calibrated readings.
Each transducer
should be
provided with a separate calibration certificate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Usually the gauge wire and the body of the transducer
are made of materials having similar coefficient of
thermal expansion so that temperature variations,
if any, have minor influence on the readings.
The
transducers are to be calibrated in various temperatures
within its working range and the thermal coefficient
should be recorded in calibration certificate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3  Cables and  Conduits<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7  INSTALLATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is advisable to calculate in advance the exact length
of cable required to be attached with each_of the cells
as the splicing should be avoided to the extent possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Saturation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1 The tip of the piezometer containing the filter
element should be detached from the transducer. The
ceramic element should be boiled in clean water for
about 10 minutes. The water with the filter should
then be cooled and the transducer body should be
attached to the filter element under water.
The
assembly should be kept-soaked in water for at least
24 h before installation.
In case of Sintered Bronze
~element, only immersion in distilled water for about
30 min is sufficient.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1 In estimating the length of the cable to be added,
a suitable route between the point of embedment of
the instrument and the terminal station in the~gallery
should be selected by study of the drawings.
In
selecting the route, due consideration should be given
to the construction procedures involved in placing
the concrete/masonry where the instrument is to be
embedded and to possible obstructions along the
chosen route.
After the selected route has been
verified, the length of the cable required should be
estimated, and a small amount usually 10 percent or
2 m, whichever is larger, should be added to allow
for extra length required due to normal variations
from the selected route.
The length of the cable
should-be limited as far as possible. In any case it
should not exceed 80 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the piezometer is used in a borehole, the tip and
filter should be covered by a rubber membrane to
prevent escape of water from the filter element before
the piezometer reaches the ground water level. A
string should be connected to the end of this rubber
membrane for pulling the membrane off the filter
element when the water level is reached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2 In general, cables are run horizontally without
conduit in the concrete
and in conduits in the
masonry
and run in downward
and upward<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Placement
of Piezometer<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1 The pore pressure cells are usually located<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 8282 ( Part 2 )  :  1996<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>directions in conduits both in the concrete and the
masonry. The conduit may be of any material which
will not collapse in the fresh concrete/masonry.
The
size of the conduit may be chosenin accordance with
the procedure given in IS 10334  :  1982.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>consequently. The normal prefix used for pore pressure
cells is PP. When the cable lead is connected to a
cell, an identification
band with the instrument
identification number should be stamped or punched
on it and crimped to the cable about 900 mm from
the cell. A similar band should be crimped about 300
mm from the free end of the cable. In addition a
few more markers, consisting of the identification
number marked on white tape and covered with linen
and friction tape, should be placed around the cable
near the reading end.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3 If the cable leads are to cross contraction
joints in the structure, a slack cable recess should
be provided at the crossing point. This may consist
of a wooden box block out, forming a recess into
which the cable is run. During placement of concrete/
masonry in the adjacent block, a 300 mm loop of
slack cable should be left in the unfilled block out
and the remaining length of cable laid in the usual
manner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5  Terminal
Boxes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.1
Location
of Terminal
Boxes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Permanent facilities for taking readings are provided
in terminal recess usually located in blockouts on
walls of galleries nearest to the instruments.
The
reading stations for all embedded instruments in a
monolith should be located in same monolith if
possible, to avoid running of cable leads across
contraction joints.
Separate terminal recesses for
cable leads from different types of instruments are
not required.
Where a gallery or similar
semi-
protected location is not available, a conveniently
accessible exterior location may be selected and
secured against unauthorized tampering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.4 Cables should be threaded individually into
the conduit, so that each cable could support its own
weight. At the entrance of the cables into the conduits
suitable protection such as padding with burlap, should
be provided around each cable and in the interstices
between the cables to prevent sharp bends and to
prevent the entry of concrete/mortar
and grout into
the conduit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.5
Group of cables running horizontally
in a
concrete lift may be taped together at intervals and
laid on the top of the last but one layer of concrete
in the lift, covered with pads of fresh concrete/mortar
at several points along the length. The placement of
the final concrete lift layer
should be allowed to
proceed in the normal manner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.2  Lighting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normal gallery lighting is usually not adequate and
a supplementary fixture for lighting should be provided
at the terminal reading station.
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.6 The layout shouId be so planned that cells and
terminal boxes are located in the same block.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.3  Moisture
Prevention<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.7 In cases where a number of cables from widely
spread points are collected at one central point and
run downward into a conduit, a very successful plan
is to run the cable in two steps. A collecting box or
concrete form is erected around the grouped conduits
so that the lift is left about 450 mm low at the
conduits. During the placement of the concrete in
which the cells are embedded, the cables arebrought
horizontally to the collection point, coiled and hung
out of the fresh concrete.
As soon as the concrete
has set sufficiently to bear traffic, the cable coils
are taken down the conduit to the terminal boxes.
The advantage is that it is much easier to sort out
and run the cables when they are not muddled with
fresh concrete/mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To reduce corrosion at the cable terminals and panel
board connections, which is usually a serious problem
in dam galleries,
an electrical
strip heater
or
incandescent lamp should be installed within the
terminal recesses and permanently kept on. A bulb
provided in the recess for lighting may also serve
this purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.4  Installing
Terminal
Equipment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After all the cable leads have been brought into a
terminal recess, the surplus lengths of cables should
be cut off and the end of individual conductors prepared
for permanent
connection
to the panel board or
terminal strip.
Proper care should be taken for
identification
of the cables and cells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
