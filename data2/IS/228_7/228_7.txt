<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 7 ) ( Third Kevision > was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 23 February
1990, after the draft finalized
by the hlethods
of Chemical
Analysis
of Ferrous
Metals Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Metallurgical
Ehgineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 228 which was first-published in 1952 and subsequently
revised in 1959, covered
the chemical
analysis of plain carbon
and low alloy steels, alongwith
pig iron and cast iron.
It was revised
again to make it comprehensive
in respect of steel analysis and to exclude pig iron and cast iron
which are being covered in separate standards.
During its second revision, the standard was split
up in several parts and 14 parts have already been published covering
only chemical
analysis of
steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard IS 228 ( Part 7 ) was published in 1974.
