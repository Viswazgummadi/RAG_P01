<<PARAGRAPH>>Pig Iron and Cast Iron Sectional Committee,
MTD 6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by the
Pig Iron and Cast Iron Sectional
Committee had been approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The essential requirements
for any form of joint are simplicity,
reliability and flexibility.
Various
types of joints are used for joining
AC pipes.
These joints mostly incorporate
rubber
sealing rings
in their design.
Rubber is generally
accepted as the ideal sealing medium for pressure joints;
in
addition to imparting
flexibility,
it enables the joint to withstand
vibration from traffic and other
sources.
Also, in the case of burried pipes, the conditions such as moisture, darkness and compression
are ideal for the preservation
of rubber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In detachable joints, the components
comprise of a cast iron centre collar and two flanges together
with two rubber rings.
The assembly is bolted together.
It should be noted that the joints
are not
intended to resist and thrust, and it is essential to adequately anchor end caps and bends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reference may be made to IS 1363 ( Part 1 )  :  1984 ‘Hexagon head bolts, screws and nuts of product
grade C  :  Part 1 Hexagon
head bolts ( size range M5 to M36 ) ( second  revision )’  and IS 1363
( Part 3 ) : I984 ‘Part 3 Hexagon
nuts ( size range M5 to M36 ) (  second revision )’  for use of bolts
and nuts with these joints and to IS 12988 : 1990 ‘Rubber sealing rings for CID joints
for light duty
AC pipes -
Dimensional requirements’ for use of rubber sealing rings with CID joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Only essential dimensions
required for proper
functioning and interchangeability
of joints have been
specified in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specitied value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Standards
referred
to in this
standard are listed in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If any test I;iece representing a lot fails to pass
the test in the first instance, two additional tests
shall be made on test pieces made from the same
metal used from the same lot.
Should either of
these additional test pieces fail to pass the test, the
Jot shall be deemed as not complying
with the
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 SUPPLY OF MATERIAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The general
requirements
relating

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Hydrostatic
test may
be carried
out
for
collars only.
For this test the collar shall be
kept under; pressure for
15 seconds, minimum; it
may be struck moderately
with a 700 g hammer.
It should withstand
the pressure
test without
showing any leakage, sweating or other defects
of any kind.
The
hydrostatic
test should
be
conducted
before coating the collar,
as far as
possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The metal used for the manufacture
of joints
shall be of requisite quality conforming
to any of
the grades of LS 210 : 1978.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The various parts of detachable
joints
shall
be stripped
with all precautions
necessary to
avoid warping or shrinking
defects,
They shall
be free from defects,
other than any unavoidable
surface
imperfections
which
result
from
the
method of manufacture and which do not affect
the use of the joints.
By agreement
between the
purchaser and the manufacturer,
minor defects
may be rectified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1 The collar shall withstand the test pressure
specified in Table 1 of IS 9627 : 1980 for the class
of asbestos cement pressure pipes with which they
