<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Bolts, Nuts and Fasteners Accessories Sectional Committee and had been approved by the Basic and
Production Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was originally issued in 1982. Subsequent to the publication, three amendments have been issued.
This revision has been taken up to incorporate these amendments as well as to make in line with the actual
products which are being used by the electrical transmission and tower erection industries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step bolts are used to gain access to the top of steel structures including transmission towers. For safety reasons,
while gaining access to the top of the structure, with the help of step bolts, the maximum total weight of a person
including the bolts, nuts, tools and tackles that he may carry with him, should not exceed 150 kg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hexagon bolts intended for fabrication of general steel structures are covered in IS 6639 ‘Hexagon bolts for
steel structures’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised)’.  The number of significant places retained in
the rounded off values should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
