<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 22 January 1990, after the
draft finalized by the General Metallurgical Standards Sectional Committee
had been approved
by
the Metallurgical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1974.
This revision has been done keeping in view the manu-
facturing and trade practices followed in this field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard assistance has been derived from:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS0 4948/l  :  1982 Steels - Classification - Part 1  :  Classification of steels into unalloyed and
alloy steels based on chemical composition<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS0 4948/2 : 1981 Steels -
Classification - Part 2  :  Classification of unalloyed and alloy steels
according to main quality classes and main property or application characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.
The number
of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
covers
the
classification
of
steels on the basis of chemical
composition
but
provision is also made for subdivision
according
to specific characteristics or use.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) tellurium; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  For the purpose of classification,
steel is an
iron base alloy generally suitable for working to
the required
shape in the solid state having a
carbon content generally less than 1’5 percent and
containing v;rymi amounts of other elements.
A
limited number of high alloyed steels may have
more than 2 percent carbon but 2 percent
is the
usual dividing line between steel and qast iron.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) lanthanides
and other specified elements ( except
S, P, C and N ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1  For determining whether the steel is unalloy-
ed or alloyed, the composition given in the stand-
ard or specification or order shall be considered.
This usually refers to ladle
analysis.
In
the
absence of a standard or specification
or ordered
composition, the classification shall be based on
the ladle analysis reported by the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  CLASSIFICATiON
ON THE BASIS
OF
CHEMICAL
COMPOSITION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It may be necessary to certify the chemical com-
position of the material being supplied by analysis
of the product.
In such cases, the number of
samples taken, the location of such samples, the
meThods of analysis used and the
permissible
deviation
from the specified range of chemical
composition
shall be in
accordance
with the
product
specification
to which material is being
supplied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Steel shall be classified as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Unalloyed steels, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Alloy steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Unalloyed Steels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unalloyed steels are those steels in which specified
content of any element is less than that indicated
below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the elements are defined by a range or by
a minimum
value, the minimum
value of that
range or the minimum
specified shall determine
the class of the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The  term
‘unalloyed
quality

applies
to  those

size control,
decrease
of sulphur

im-

of surface finish or increased
production
control,
etc ) to achieve,
in comparison
with base
steels, special quality characteristics
such as improv-
ed
resistance
against
brittle
fracture,
improved
cold-forming
properties,
etc.
