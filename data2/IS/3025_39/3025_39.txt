<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian
Standard-(
First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft finalized by the Environmental
Protection
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Oil and
grease
are primarily
composed
of fatty
matter
from
animal
or vegetable origin and
petroleum
hydrocarbons.
Hence in the determination
of oil and grease instead
of quantifying
a
particular
substance,
a group of compounds
with similar properties
are determined
quantitatively
an the basis of their common
solubility
in trichlorotrifluoroethane.
The
methods
covered
in
this standard
are suitable
for assessment
of biological liquids, mineral hydrocarbons,
industrial
wastewater
or treated effluents containing
these materials.
The methods
shall not be applicable
to low boiling
fractions
that
volatalize
at temperatures
below 70°C.
This standard
supersedes
13 of IS 2488 ( Part 1 ) : 1966 ‘Methods
of sampling
and test for industrial
effluents,
Part 1’
and
59 of IS 3025  :  1964 ‘Methods of sampling
and test ( physical and chemical ) for water
used in industry’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Jn the preparation
of this standard,
considerable
assistance has been derived from the Standard
‘Methods
for the Examination
of Water
and Wastewater’,
published
by the American
Public
Health Association,
Washington,
USA. 16th Edition, 1985.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the result
of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final
value,
observed
cr calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it &all be done in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960
‘Rules for rounding
off numerical values ( revised)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Acidify to pH 2 by

Collect
a separate
sample for oil and grease determina-
tion and do not
subdivide

Loss of grease
will occur on sampling equip-
ment hence
collection of a composite sample is
not practical.
Individual

to obtain average concentration
over
an extended period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>percent benzene.
Store in a sealed container
to
prevent loss on evaporation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>30  ml of trichlorotrifluoroethane
and add the
solvent washings to the separating funnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shake vigorously
for about 2 minutes.
However,
if it is suspected that a stable emulsion will form,
shake gently for 5 to IO minutes.
Let the layers
separate.
Drain
the solvent
layer
through
a
funnel containing
solvent moistened
filter paper
into
a clean, tared distillation
flask.
If a clear
solvent
layer
cannot
be obtained,
add
1 g of
sodium sulphate
( Na2S04 ) crystals to the filter
paper
cone and slowly drain emulsified solvent
on to the crystals.
Add more sodium
sulphate,
if necessary.
Extract two more times with 30 ml
of solvert
each time, but first rinse the sample
container
with the solvent.
Collect the extracts
in a tared distillation
flask and wash filter paper
with an additional
10 to 20 ml of the solvent.
Distil solvent from distillation
flask over a water
bath at 70°C. Quantitatively
transfer the residue
using a minimum
quantity
of solvent
into
a
clean, tared, dried beaker.
Place the beaker
on
water bath for 15 minutes at 70°C and evaporate
off all the solvents.
Cool the beaker  in a desic-
cator
for 30 minutes
and weigh.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Follow
the steps for acidification,
extraction,
etc, as given in 3.1 and 5.5.
Collect
the com-
bined
extracts
in a loo-ml volumetric
flask and
adjust the’final volume to 100 ml with solvent.
Prepare a stock solution of known oil by rapidly
transferring
1 ml of oil or 0’5 to 1 g of grease to
a clean tared lOO-ml volumetric
flask.
Stopper
the flask and w.eigh to the nearest milligram.
Add solvent to dissolve and dilute to the mark.
If the oil identity is unknown, use reference
oil
as standard.
Using volumetric
techniques,
pre-
pare a series of standards.
Select
a pair
of
matched near infra-red silica cells.
A 1 cm path
length
cell
is appropriate
for a range of ,about
4 to 40 mg/l of oil and grease.
Scan
standards
and tamples
from
3 260 cm-l to 2 700 cm-l
with
solvent,
in reference
beam and
record
results
on absorbance
paper.
Measure
absor-
bances of standards and samples by constructing
a straight
base line over the scan range and
measuring absorbance
of the peak maximum
at
2 980 cm-l and subtracting
base line absorbance
at that point.
If the absorbance
exceeds 0’8 for
a sample,
select a shorter path length or dilute
as required.
Use scans of standards
to prepare
a calibration
curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tract oil and grease in a Soxhlet apparatus,
using
trichlorotrifluoroethane
at a rate of 20 cycles per
hour for four hours
counting
