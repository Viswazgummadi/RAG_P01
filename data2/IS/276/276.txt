<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
(Fifth Revision)
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
hy -the Steel
Castings
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
was first published
in 1953 and was revised
in 1963,
1969,
1978 and 1992. While
reviewing
the standard
in light of the experience
gained
during
these years the committee
has decided
that the standard
may be further
revised.
In this revision
various
clauses
have been aligned
with the recent
standards
on steel
castings.
In view
of the
increasing
quality
consciousness
and
in order
to align
the
standard
with
the
International
Standads,
the
limits
of silicon,
sulphur
and
phosphorus
have
been
revised
to update
the
chemical
composition
of Austenitic
Manganese
Steel Castings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In preparation
of this standard,
assistance
has been
derived
from:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1  The relatively
high austenitising
temperature
in combination
with high carbon content canses marked surface decarburization
by furnace atmosphere
and some loss of manganese.
The skin
may hence be partiafly martensitic
which can lead to formation
of fine and shallow surface cracks. These cracks for most of the
ordirmzy applications
are not functionally
harmful unless severe
impact or tensile stresses
ate involved.
This is for informatidrr
only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
— Contamination
of the drillings
by  drill  chips must
be avoided.
Ffat drills
of the best high speed
steels,
or drills
of
some
of
the
newer
tool
materials,
will
generally
be
satisfactory
for drilling
manganese
steel. Manganese
steel may
be drilled
best after it has been annealed
for several
hours at<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 The changes
that occur in composition
of the surface
of the
castings
during heat
treatment
may
produce
a magnetic
skin.
This surface magnetism
thus developed
is usually
not harmful.
It can be substantially
diminished
by grinding,
if required.
This
is for information
only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>500  to 600”C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4  Residual
Elements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.1
Elements
not
specified
in Table
1 shall
not
ordinarily
be added
to the steel
and all reasonable
precautions
shall be taken
to prevent
contamination
from
scrap,
etc, to keep them as low as practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 (a) After heat treatment,
the microstructure
of the material
is ordinarily
fully austenitic.
However,
in case of heavy section
thickness,
due to the relatively
slow rate of sol edification
and
cooling,
a substantial
quantity
of carbides
separate
out during
the original
casting
process.
Such carbides
are rather
slow to
dissolve
back
into
the
austenite
during
heat
treatment.
Attempting
to totally
eliminate
carbides
from microstructure,
especially
in the interior
regions
of thick walled castings,
may
call for very prolonged
soaking
periods
at the austenitizatioa
temperature.
Such
a prolonged
soaking,
in turn,
coa]d
result
in some degree of degradation
of the surface,
in the nature
of
scaling,
decarburisation,
etc. as also grain
growth
which
can
be harmful.
Heuce,
the
presence
of a small
percentage
uf
carbides
in heavy section
thickness
castings,
especially
in the
inner
region,
is tolerated
as a practical
compromise
and
is
usually
not harmful.
It is open to the parties
to agree
on the
extent
of presence
of carbides
for a given
section
thickness.
However,
unless specially
agreed
upon between
the pafiics,
or
so
stipulated
in
the
enquiry
and
order,
microstructural
examination
51 is not a criterion
for acceptance
of castings
to
thk
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.2
Analysis
and reporting
of the analysis
in test

for the
residual
elements
shall
be done
only
when
so specifie(’
by the purchaser
in enquiry
and order.
However,
c[~e manufacturer
shall ensure
that
the
residual
elements
are
within
the
limits,
when
such
limits
are specified
by the purchaser
in
enquiry

of such letters,

as may
be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3  (b)  To overcome,
or to minimise,
the problem
of presence
of carbides
in the heat treated

and the consequent
loss of toughness

for applications
involving
heavy section thicknesses
and high impact
Grades
4 and 5 are
recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 The purchaser
shall specify
the tolerances
on all
important
dimensions.
On
other
dimensions,
tolerances
specified
in IS 4897
shall
apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — For the sake of information
it is stated that to ensure
proper
fitting
it is often
necessary
to keep
the tolerances
on
exiernal

the purchaser
and the
manufacturer,
all
castings
shall
be
suitably
“heat
treated
to
render
them

This
treatment
shall
consist
of
uniformly
heating
the
castings
to a suitable

holding
them till
they
are
uniformly
heated
throughout,
and
quenching
them
with
a minimum
time lag in water
from
a minimum
temperature
of
1 040°C.
Water
shall be adequately
agitated
to prevent
formation
of
a vapour
blanket
around
castings
during
quenching.
In case of Grade
4 castings,
alternatively
they may
be air cooled
from above
1 040°C
if the maximum
section

does
not exceed
60 mm and if so
agreed

The mechanical

specified
are those
which
are to be obtained
from
test bars cast either

to which
they refer and heat treated
as given
in 12. The

so exhibited,
therefore,

laid down in IS 5530.
If castings
have
been
subjected
to non-destructive
testing
by agreement

concerning
-the extent
of repair:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Whether
all, or what proportion,
of the castings
are to be tested;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Weld
repair
involving
a depth
not exceeding
20
percent
of
wall
thickness
or
25
mm,
whichever
is lower,
shall be termed
as a minor
repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The severity
level defining
the acceptability
or
non
acceptability
of
defects
which
may
be
revealed;

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Whether
the
manufacturer
is
or
is
not
contractually
responsible
for carrying
out the
tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Any weld repair
exceeding
the above
shall
be
termed
as a major
repair.
Further
any
single
repair
having
an
area
exceeding
250
mm
square
for every
millimeter
of wall
thickness
shall
also
be deemed
to be
a major
repair,
regardless
of the considerations
mentioned
in
(a) above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15.2
Unless
otherwise
agreed
upon,
when
non-destructive
testing
is to be done,
the castings
shall
