Indian
Standards
Institurio.1
on 12 December
1981, after the draft finalized
by the Method
of Measurement
of Works
of Civil
Engineering
( Excludimr
River Valley Projecis
1 Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civs
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
a very
important
place
in the planning
and
execution
of any  civil engineering
work
from
the  time of first estimates
io
the
final
completion
and
settlement
of payments
of the
projtct.
The
methods
followed
for the measureme:lt
are
not
uniform,
and considerable
.._
dtnerences
exist
between
the practices
foiiowcd
by one construction
agency
and another
and
also
between
various
Central
and
State
Government
departments.
While it is recognized
that
each
system of measurement
has
to be specifically
related
to the administrative
and
financial
organizations
within
the
department
responsible
for
the
work, a unification
of the
various
systems at the technical
level
has
been accepted
as very desirable,
specially
as it permits
a wider circle
of operation
for
civil
engineering
contractors
and
eliminate
ambiguities
and
misunderstandings
arising
out
of inadequate
understanding
of the various
systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Among
the various
civil
engineering
items,
measurement
of building
had been the first to be taken up for
standardization
and a consolidated
standard
( IS  :  1200 j, having provisions
relating
to building
works, was firat
published
in 1958 and subsequently
revised in 1964 and 1970.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the course
of usage
of this
standard
by
various
constructiocr
agencies
in the country,
several clarifications

responsible
for the
preparation
of this
standard
decided
that its scope
besides being applicable
to building,
should
be expanded
so as also
to
cover the method
of measurement
applicable
to civil engineering
works,
such as industrial
and river va!ley project
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1200  (Fart  14 I-  1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Since measurement
of one type of trade is not related to that of
another one, and aiso to facilitate the second revision of IS  :  1200 - 1964*,
the Sectional Committee decided
that each type of trade as given in IS:
1200-I 964* be issued separately as difl’crent parts. This will also be helpful
to the specific users in various trades in using the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5.1 This part
14 covering
glazing was, therefore, issued as a separate
standard
for the first time in 1970 and has now been revised in order
to keep the provisions in line with the latest practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose of decid;ng whether a particular
requirement of this
standard is complied with the tinal value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a measLI<ement, shall be rounded
ofT in accordance
with
1s  :  2-1960t
7‘he number of significant places retained in the rounded off
va!ue should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
