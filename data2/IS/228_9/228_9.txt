<<HEADING level=3>>FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Part 9)  (  Third Revision  )  was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on  26 December
1989, after the draft finalized by the Methods of Chemical Analysis of Ferrous
Metals Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 228, which was first published in 1952 and subsequently revised in 1959, covered
the chemical
analysis of plain carbon and low alloy steels, along with pig iron and cast iron.
This standard
was again revised to make it comprehensive
in respect of steel analysis and to exclude
pig iron
and cast iron which are being covered in separate
standard.

<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
(Part 9) covers method
for
determination
of sulphur in plain carbon
and
low alloy steel by evolution method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Outline
of the Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sulphur is evolved as hydrogen
sulphide
and
precipitated
as cadmium sulphide in ammoniacal
cadmium chloride solution. Solution is acidified
and excess of potassium iodate-potassium
iodide
is added. Excesses of liberated iodine is titrated
against sodium thiosulphate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE - This method is not suitable for steel samp!es
containing selenium.<<HEADING_END>>

and some quantity
left in
the
thistle funnel also.
Heat the flask gently
until the sample is completely
dissolved.
The
evolved gas  (  H,S ) is passed into the ammoniacal
cadmium

solution, and cadmium
sul-
phide is precipitated.
At the completion  of  the
reaction the delivery tube is disconnected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
