<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 October
1981, after the draft finalized
by the
Wood
Products
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Wood
wool building
slabs consist essentially
of wood wool chemically
treated
and
bonded
by pressing
together
with
an inorganic
cementing
filler and adequately
matured.
Wood wool building
slabs are being manu-
factured
in the country
and such slabs are in actual
use in a number
of
constructions.
This standard
lays down the essential requirements
of wood
wool building
slabs for use in constructions
and provides
the necessary
guidance
for manufacture
of wood wool building
slabs in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
This standard
was first published
in 1969 and this is the first revision
of the standard.
In this revision
modifications
have
been
made
in the
provisions relating
to sound absorption,
weight stipulation,
sizes permissible,
etc. Since
wood wool slabs of 25 mm thickness
only are most commonly
used for accoustical
purposes,
requirements
for sound absorption
coefficient
are included
for 25 mm thick
slabs only;
there
being
no data
available
with regard
to sound absorption
coefficient
relevant
to other
thicknesses
( see  10.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been
given
to international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS : 2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

building
slabs shall be of two types designated
as given
below:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Tyfie  1  Light
Weight Slabs-These
slabs are intended
primarily
for non-load
bearing
partitions,
ceilings,
wall linings,
permanent
shuttering
and roof insulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Ty@e 2  Heavy Duty Slabs-These
slabs
are
intended
for
load
bearing
situations
and for use in roof construction.
These

of timber
which
satisfies the require-
ment of density and quality of wood wool slabs may be used for magnesium-

wood wool slabs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1
For manufacturing

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.2
Place 5 cm x 5 cm x 10 mm thick steel plates on the top and bottom
surfaces of the slabs at the point to be measured
and measure the thickness
by means of calipers
placed over the centre
of the steel plates, that is, the
thickness
measured
is that
of the slab plus that
of the two steel plates.
Obtain
the thickness of the slab by subtracting
the measured
total thickness
of the steel plates from the measured
thickness
of slab and plates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
