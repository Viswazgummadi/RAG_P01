<<HEADING level=3>>METHOD OF T-EST FOR
DETERMINING
SETTING TIME OF
CONCRETE BY PENETRATION
RESISTANCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 8 July
1976, after the draft finalized
by
the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Information
obtained
from the penetration
resistance
test for setting
of concrete
can provide
useful guidance
to the engineer
at site regarding
removal of formwork,
maximum
permissible
time lapse between
placement
of successive layers of concrete
and such other operations,
where assessment
of the degree
of hardening
of the concrete
is necessary.
The method may
be used
for determining
the effects
of variables,
such
as temperature,
cement,
concrete
mix proportions
and admixtures,
upon the time of setting
and
hardening
characteristics
of concrete.
It may be  used as  a  part of
performance
specifications
to determine
compliance
with specified time of
setting requirements
and will also be useful in the laboratory
for comparative
studies of above aspects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
The
method
is suitable
only for those cases where required
infor-
mation on the above aspects can be obtained
from the tests on the mortar
fraction
of the concrete.
Since
the hardening
of concrete
is a gradual
process,
any definition
of setting
time will necessarily
be arbitrary.
The
temperature
of storage of specimens
employed
in this test is to be selected
by the user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for
the
preparation
of
this
standard has taken into consideration,
the practices
followed in this country
in conducting
the test for determining
setting time of concrete by penetration
resistance.
Due weightage
has also been given to the need for international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
of the world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Is r8142 -  1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
covers the method
for determining
the setting
time of
concrete
with slump greater
than zero,
by testing
mortar
sieved from the
concrete
mixture.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 In this method of test, the initial setting time and the final setting
time
are
the
time intervals
required
for the mortar
sieved from the concrete
mixture
to reach
the prescribed
penetration
resistance
after
the initial.
contact
of cement and water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMlNOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Final
Setting
Time
-
The

Round,

<<HEADING level=3>>4.  PREPARATION
OF MORTAR
SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  From the concrete
mixture under test, select a representative
sample of
concrete
of sufficient volume to provide enough mortar to fill the test con-
tainer, or containers,
to a depth of at least 140 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Remove
essentially
all of the mortar
from the sample of concrete
by
sieving it through
a 4.75-mm
IS sieve onto a non-absorptive
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Thoroughly
remix the mortar
by hand
on the non-absorptive
surface
and place it in the container,
or containers
in layers of 50 mm each, and
compact
by rodding
each
layer.
Rod
the
specimen
by means
of the
tamping
rod held so as to penetrate
the mortar with the round
end.
Rod
the mortar once for each 6.5 cm2 of top surface
area of the specimen
and
distribute
the strokes uniformly
over the cross-section
of the specimen.
After
completion
of the rodding,
tap the sides of the containers
lightly with the
tamping
rod to close voids left by the tamping rod and to further
level the
surface
of the specimen.
Upon
completion
of specimen
preparation,
the
mortar surface shall be at least 13 mm below the top edge of the container
to provide space for the collection
and removal
of bleeding
water and to
avoid
contact
between
the
mortar
surface
and
the
protective
covering
specified in 5.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  STORAGE
OF MORTAR
SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Store
and
maintain
the
specimens
at the temperature,
selected
for
testing the specimens.
TO prevent excessive evaporation
of moisture,
keep
the
specimens
covered
and protected
with a suitable
tight-fitting,
water-
impermeable
cover for the duration
of the test, except when bleeding water
is being removed or penetration
tests are being made.
The specimens shall
be shielded from the sun.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  NUMBER
OF SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  At  least three separate
batches
shall be made for each test condition.
One rate of hardening
test shall be made on each batch.
An equal number
of batches for each condition
shall be made on any given day.
When
it is
impossible
to make at least one test for each variable
on a given day, the
mixing
of the entire
series of batches shall be completed
in as few days as
possible and one of the mixtures shall be repeated each day as a standard of
comparison.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 8142 - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Remove
bleeding
water from ‘the surface of the mortar  specimens  just
prior to making
a  penetration
test
by means
of a pipette
or a suitable
instrument.
To facilitate
collection
of bleeding
water,
tilt the
specimen
carefully
to an angle of about
12” from the horizontal
by placing a block
under one side 2 minutes
prior to removal of the bleeding water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Insert
a needle
of appropriate
size, depending
upon
the
state
of
hardening
of the mortar,
in the penetration
resistance
apparatus
and bring
the
bearmg
surface
of the needle
into contact
with the mortar
surface.
Gradually
and uniformly
apply a vertical force downward on the apparatus
until the needle penetrates
the mortar to a depth of 25 mm as indicated
by
the scribe mark.
The time required to penetrate
to the 25 mm depth shall
be approximately
10 seconds.
Record
the force required
and the time of
application,
measured
as elapsed time after initial
contact
of cement and
water.
In subsequent
penetration
tests take care to avoid areas where the
mortar
has been disturbed
by previous tests.
The clear distance between
two needle impressions shall be at least two diameters
of the needle
being
used, but not less than
13 mm.
The
clear distance
between
any needle
impression
and the side of the container
shall be not less than 25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 Make
penetration
tests at hourly intervals
for normal
mixtures
and
normal
temperatures,
the initial
test being
made after an elapsed time of
3 to 4 h.
For accelerated
mixtures or high temperatures,
it may be advisable
to make the initial test after an elapsed time of 1 or 2 h and subsequent
tests
at + h intervals.
For
low-temperature
conditions
or retarded
concrete
mixtures,
the initial penetration
test may be deferred for an elapsed time of
4 to 6 h, and perhaps longer.
Subsequent
tests may be made at intervals of
1 h, unless
the
rate
of increase in penetration
resistance
indicates
that
shorter intervals are desirable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 Not less than six penetration
resistance determinations
shah be made in
each
rate
of hardening
test and the time intervals
between
penetration
resistance
determinations
shall
be such
as to give a satisfactory
rate of
hardening
curve, as indicated
by equally spaced points.
Continue
the tests
until one penetration
resistance
of at least 26.97
N/mm’
(275
kgf/cmz)
is
reached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  Calculate
the penetration
resistance,
in N/mm2 (kgf/cmz ), as the force
required
to cause a 25 mm depth of penetration
of the needle
divided
by
the area of the bearing face of the needle.<<HEADING_END>>
