FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
(Parr
XL )
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards Institution on 30 December
1977, after the draft finalized by the
Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establish uniform procedures for the determination
of
different
characteristics
of soils and also
for
facilitating
comparative
studies of the results, the Indian Standards Institution has brought out this
Indian
Standard
Methods
of test- for soils ( IS  :  2720 ) which is being
published in parts.
Forty-one parts of this standard have been published.
This part [IS:
2720 ( Part XL)-19771
deals with the method of test for
the determination
of free swell index of soils.
Free swell is the increase in
volume of a soil, without any external
constraints,
on submergence
in
water.
The possibility of damage to structures due to swelling of expensive
clays need be identified,
at the outset, by an investigation
of those soils
likely to possess undesirable
expansion
characteristics.
Inferential
testing
is resorted ‘to reflect the potential
of the system to swell under different
simulated conditions.
Actual magnitude
of swelling pressures developed
depends upon the dry density, initial water content, surcharge loading and
several other environmental
factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,
it shall be done  in  accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules for rounding
off numerical
values ( IID~SC$).<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.  SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard ( Part XL ) covers a test for the determination
of free
swell index of soil which helps to identify the potential of a soil to swell
which
might
need
further
detailed
investigation
regarding
swelling
and swelling pressures under different field conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Sieve -
425-micron
IS Sieve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Glass
Graduated
Cylinders
-
Two, lOO-ml capacity (see IS  :  878-
1956. ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Take
two 10 g (see Note  )  soil specimens of oven dry soil passing
through 425-micron
IS Sieve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  -In
thccase
of highly
swelling
soils, such as sodium
bentonites,
the  sample
size may he 5 g or alternatively
a cylinder
of 250  ml  capacity
may be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Each soil specimen shall be poured in each of the two glass graduated
cylinders
of 100 ml capacity.
One
cylinder
shall then be filled with
kerosene oil and the other with distilled writer up to the 100 ml ( see Note
under 3.1)
mark.
After removal of entrapped air ( by gentle shaking or
stirring with a:tglass rod ), the soils in both the cylinders shall be allowed
to settle.
Suffident time (not less than 24 h ) shall be allowed for the soil
sample to attain equilibrium state of volume without any further change in
the volume of the soils.
The final volume of soils in each of the cylinders
shall be read out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. CALCULATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The level of the soil in the kerosene graduated cylinder shall be read
as the original volume of the soil samples,
kerosene being
a non-polar
liquid
doea not cause swelling of the soil.
The level of the soil in the
distilled water cylinder shall be read as the free swell level.
The
free
swell index of the soil shall be calculated as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Free swell index, percent = 7  v, -
Vk x ,o()
k
where
V d=  the volume of soil specimen
read from the graduated
cylinder containing distilled water, and<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>v, = the volume of soil specimen
read from the graduated
cylinder containing kerosene.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
