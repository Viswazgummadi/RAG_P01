FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This  Indian Standard ( Part II ) was adopted by the Indian Stau-
dards Institution on 22 August
1963, after the draft finalized by the
Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee bad been approved by the
Building Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 One of the major contributing factors to the quality of concrete is the
quality of aggregates
used therein.
The
test methods given in this
standard are intended to assist in assessing the qualily of aggregates.
In a given situation, for a particular aggregate, it may not be necessary
to assess all the qualities and therefore it is necessary to determine before-
hand the purpose for which a concrete is being used and the qualities
of the aggregate which require to be assessed_
Accordingly, the relevant
test methods may be chosen from amongst the various tests covered in
this  standard.
For the convenience of the users. the test methods are
grouped into the ,following eight parts of Indian Standard Methods of
Test for Aggregates for Concrete ( IS  :  2386-1963 ):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Particle Size and Shape<<HEADING_END>>

The Sectional
Committee
responsibk
for the preparation of this
standard has taken into consideration the views of the concrete spe&Wa,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>testing authorities, consumers and technologists and has related the stand-
ard to the practices followed in this country.
Further the need for
international
co-ordination
among
standards
prevailing
in
different
countries of the world has also been recognised.
These considerations
led the Sectional Committee
to derive assistance from the published
standards and publications of the following organizations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>British Standards Institution<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>American Society for Testing and Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4 Wherever a reference to any Indian Standard appears m these methods,
it shall be taken as a reference to its latest version.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, ex-
pressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS : 2-1960 Rules for Rounding
Off Numerical Values (  Revised ).
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.6 This standard is intended chiefly to cover the technical provisions
relating to testing ofaggregates
for concrete, and it does not cover all the
necessary provisions of a contract.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 This standard
( Part II  )  covers the following tests for aggregates
for concrete:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) Determination of clay lumps,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) Determination
of clay, fine silt and fine dust  (  sedimentation
method ),<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c) Determination of light-weight pieces ( coal and lignite ),<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d) Determination of soft particles, and<<HEADING_END>>

At  the end of
15 minutes,
the suspension
shall be poured
into the 1 000-nd measuring cylinder
and the residue washed
by gentle
swirling and recantation
of successive
150-ml portions of sodium oxalate

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.2  Method Jor Coarse Aggregate —  The
weighed
sample
shall be
placed in a suitable container,
covered with a measured volume of sodium
oxalate
solution
{ 08
g
per litre ),
agitated
vigorously
to
remove
all
adherent
fine
material
and
the
liquid
suspension
transferred
to the
1000-mi measuring cylinder.
This process shall be repeated as necessary
until all clayey material has been transferred to the cylinder. The volume
shall be
made up to

in 3.5.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.3 The suspension in the measuring
cylinder
shall be thoroughly
mixed by
inversion and
the tube and
contents
immediately
placed
in
position under the pipette.
The pipette A shall then be gently
lowered
until the tip touches the surface of the liquid,
and then lowered a further
10 cm into the liquid.
Three minutes after placing the tube in positio~
the pipette
A and the bore of
tap
B shall be
filled by
opening  B and
applying gentle suction at C.
A small surplus may be drawn up into the
bulb between
tap 1? and tube C, but this shall be
allowed to run away
and any solid matter shall
be washed
out
with distilled water
from
E.
The pipette shall then be removed
from the
measuring
cylinder
and
its
contents run into a weighed contaihcr,
any adherent
solids being wahsed
into the container
by distilled water from  E  through the tap  B,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The contents
of
the container
shall
be
