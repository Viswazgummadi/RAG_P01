<<PARAGRAPH>>Dams and Reservoirs Sectional Committee, WRD 9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, afler the draft finalized by the Dams and
Reservoirs Sectional Committee had been approved by the Water Resources Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The contraction joints in masonry and concrete dams provide passages through the dam which unless sealed,
would permit the leakage of water from the reservoir to the downstream face. To check this leakage, water-stops
are installed in the joints adjacent to the upstream face. The recent advances in the manufacturing of PVC have
increased confidence in the use of this material for water-stops in dams. This standard has been formulated to
cover the complete specification for PVC water-stops used in the masonry and concrete dams. The method of
use of such water-stops has been covered in IS 12200:2001
‘Code of practice for provision of water-stops at
transverse contraction joints in masonry and concrete dams’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no 1S0 standard on the subject. This standard has been prepared based on the data received from
indigenous manufacturers’ and also taking into consideration the practices prevalent in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in Annex E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revise~.’ The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
