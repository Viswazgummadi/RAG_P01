<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
(Part III)
(First Revision)
was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 1 October 1974, after the draft finalized by
the Stones Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Building stones are available
in large quantity in various parts of the
country and to choose and utilize them for their satisfactory performance,
it is necessary to know the various strength properties determined according
to standard procedure. Thisstandard
had, therefore, been formulated to cover
the standard
method for determining
the strength properties
of various
stones.
This standard covering compressive, transverse and shear strength
properties was published in 1957 and is being revised based on the actual
use of it in the,past 17 years and the experience gained in testing of building
stones for these properties in the various research laboratories of this country.
In this revision, property of tensile strength has also been added, which is
also an important property for assessing the suitability of stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
This standard is now being issued in four parts, each part covering
a specific property to facilitate the use of this standard. Part III covers the
determination
of tensile strength of natural building stones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,
it shall be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard (Part III)
lays down the procedure for determination
of
split tensile strength
of natural
building stones used for
constructional
purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

grade of s i one under consideration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The sample shall be selected from the quarried stone or taken from the
natural rock, as described in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and shah be of adequate size to
permit the preparation of the requisite number of test pieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  -Stones from Ledges or Qwrries -
The ledge or ‘quarry face of
the
atone shall be inspected to determine any variation in different strata.
Differences in colour, texture and structure shall be observed.
Separate
sam les of stone weighing at least 25 kg each of the unweathered specimens
shal P be obtained from all strata that appear to vary in colour, texture and
structure.
Pieces that have *been damaged by blasting, driving wedges,
heating, etc, shall not be included in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Field Stone and Boulders -
A detailed inspection shall be made, of
the stone and boulders over the area where the supply is to-be obtained.
The different kinds of stones and their conditions at various quarry sites
shall be recorded.
Separate samples for each class of stone that would be
considered for use in construction as indicated by visual inspection shall be
selected.
2.3 When perceptible variations occur in the quality’ of rock? as many
samples as are necessary for determining the range in propertres shall be
selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

PIECES
AND CONDITIONING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1. Test pieces shall be made from samples selected in accordance with 2
and shall be in the form of cylinders.
They shall be drilled from the
samples.
,The diameter of the test piece shall be not less than 50 mm and
the ratio of diameter to height shall be 1  :  2.
3.2 Three test pieces shall be used for conducting the test in each of the
conditions mentioned in 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
3.2.1
The test pieces shall be immersed in water maintained at 20 to
30°C for 72 h before testing and shall be tested in saturated condition.
3.2.2  The test pieces shall also be tested in dry condition and shall be
dried in an oven at 105 f 5°C. for 24 h and cooled in a desiccator to room
temperature
(20 to 30°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 A testing machine of sufficient capacity for the tests and capable of
applying load at the specified rate shall be used.
The machine shall be
equipped with two steel bearing plates not less than 10 mm thickness with
hardened faces.
One of the plates preferably the one that normally bears
on the upper surface of the specimen shall be fitted with a ball seating in the
form ofa portion of a sphere, the centre of which coincides with the central<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
