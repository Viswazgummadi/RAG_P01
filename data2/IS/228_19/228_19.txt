<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
(Part 19) (Second Revision)
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after the
draft finalized
by the Methods of Chemical Analysis of Ferrous Metals Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 228, which was first published
in 1952 and subsequently
revised in 1959, covered the chemical
analysis
of plain carbon
and low alloy steels, alongwith
pig iron and cast iron.
It was revised
again to make it
comprehensive
in respect of steel analysis
and to exclude pig iron and cast iron which were being covered
in separate
standards.
During
its second revision
the standard
has been split up in several parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers the method for determination
of nitrogen
by steam distillation
method.
The other parts of
this series are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
