<<PARAGRAPH>>RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR
INSPECTION, TESTING AND MAINTENANCE
OF RADIAL
GATES AND THEIR HOISTS~<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>PART 2
INSPECTION,
TESTING
AND ASSEMBLY
AT THE TIME
OF ERECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian  Standard ( Part 2 ) was adopted ‘by the Indian Standards
Institution on 28 November 1983, after the draft finalized by the Hydraulic
Gates and Valves Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Almost every river valley project has a reservoir or diversion
work for
the control of floods or to store water for irrigation and power generation
or for both, and a spillway with spillway gates for release of flood waters
during monsoons. Controlled releases of water are also affected by control-
led gates provided in conduits in the body of the dam and tunnels. One
method of providing such control in spillways and conduits
is by radial
gates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard is being published
in three parts. Part 1 deals with ins-
pection, testing and assembly at the manufacturing
stage. Part 2 deals
with inspection, testing and assembly at the time of erection and Part 3
deals with inspection, testing and maintenance
after erection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expres-
sing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard ( Part 2) lays down the recommendations
for inspection,
testing and assembly of radial gates and their hoists at the time of erection.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 General  Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  It  shall be ascertained that the gate parts received
at erection
site
have been
manufactured
according
to the design and have necessary
markings of shop inspection wherever prescribed.
It shall be ensured that
all exposed surfaces of embedded parts
have been
protected by painting,
greasing, etc, as specified. The surfaces of embeddeaparts
in contact with
concrete shall be free from grease, paint,
etc, for better
bonding
with
concrete. A coating
of cement wash/cement
latex may
be applied,
if
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2 Dimensional
differences, if any, shall be accounted
for before
erection and the drawings corrected accordingly.
For erection
the critical
dimensions shall be worked out from the drawings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3 The reference/centre
lines of piers and
bays,
and levels having
relations to completed
civil structure
shall be established at site so as to
facilitate erection
at proper locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.4 It shall be ensured that the various
components
of the hoisting
arrangement,
such as motors,

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1
It should be ensured that correct block outs are kept for accommo-
dating the embedded parts as
manufactured
according
to
the design.
It
shall also be ensured that the required dowel bars having ad<quate
lengths
are left out in the block outs. The entire block out is roughened
properly
for further
concreting
to give necessary

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Inspection
of Pier Anchorages<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.1 The inspection
of pier
anchorages
shall
be carried
out
at
the
following stages:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Trunnion
bracket and support girder,
b) Load carrying anchors or ties and embedded girder (if insulated
anchors or ties are used ),
c) Anchor girder or yoke girder, and
d) Thrust block/trunnion
tie.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.2 The pier anchorages
shall be checked with respect to the centre line
of the pier and the trunnion
axis ( line parallel to the cr~st axis and passing
through the centre line of trunnion
pins ). Control
survey
marks
shall be
given on each pier to
check
the
location/alignment
of pier
anchorages.
These shall include the lines parallel to
the
end
at

angle to
the
dam/barrage
axis and a bench mark for level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.3 Centre to centre distance of adjacent piers shall
be
checked
by a
steel tape. It will be preferable
to put a
steel girder
across the
span for
taping the distance over the span. In case taping is
done across
the span
in air, the steel tape shall be given a predetermined
pul 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.4 The trunnion
bracket/supports
shall be
placed
on
top of a stool
and kept in position
with the help of
struts and
their

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.7 Before erection the tie bars/rods shall be checked on a level plat-
form for straightness and defects should be rectified if any. After erection
the slope and spacing of the tie bars/rods shall be checked.
For checking
the spacing, a spacer gauge shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.8 After assembly the entire pier anchorage shall be checked. The two
anchorages for each gate shall also be checked with respect to each other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.9 Before concreting the pier after erection
of pier anchorage,
it is
necessary that a  second  check of all the parts is made to ensure against
any possible displacement
during
welding,
riveting,
etc. For
safety of
erected anchorages the grouting/concreting
operations shall be commenced
after minimum possible interval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.10 For insulated anchors/ties, the insulation
shall be provided and
checked before starting the grouting/concreting
operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5 Inspection  of Sill Beam<<HEADING_END>>

assembly shall be put on adjacent piers and its position should be checked.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5.2 Before erection, centre line of sill beam shall be marked
on pier
faces. The centre line of gate shall be inscribed on the crest shifted
by
300  mm or so on upstream side.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.3 The sill beam centre line shall be checked
in relation
to the
trunnion centre line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.4 After erection, the alignment and angular setting of silI beam shall
be checked. For angular setting of sill beam 3 to 5 frames can be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.5 After aligning the sill beam, all the bolts and nuts shall be put in
position. The reinforcement bars and dowels be welded with anchor
bolts
so that the complete assembly is firmly held in position
and is not distur-
bed during grouting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.6 The aggregate used for grouting shall not be more than 20 mm.
The concrete mix shall be hand-compacted
by using rods. No mechanical
vibrators should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.7  Inspection of Gate<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7.1  The subassemblies of the gate which are received at site duly ins-
pected in workshop
should be reinspected at site before lowering of assem-
bly in the bay.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7.2 Checking
of all the dimensions of the gate shall be done after
skeleton assembly of each gate is made and before final welding/riveting
is allowed. This dimensional check shall be repeated after welding is done.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7.3 Visual inspection of all welds and bolts/rivets shall be made to the
extent of 100 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7.4 The following critical dimensions should be checked:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Centre to centre distance between side guide rolIers and shoes,

<<PARAGRAPH>>3. TESTING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The gate shall be tested in a dry condition
with hoist duly connected
for its smooth working. The gate should be fully closed and fully opened
and it should be ensured that there is no obstruction and no undue efforts
required for its operation. If the gate is not going down of its own weight
or found tight in some fiosition,
reasons should be investigated
and
remedied instead of forcing the gate down.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The testing of gate-seals in dry condition
should be done by suitable
means, such as by viewing the contact surface against a light source.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 In case of rubber seals, water should be poured over the seals so that
there will not be dry friction
of the seals. In case of metal to metal
contacts,
oil or grease is to be used. No grease or lubricant is to be used
for rubber seals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 There shall be no noise of friction
or any other noise, no signs of
excessive friction, no jerky
performance,
no dug in any position,
no
dangling of the gate, no twist in rubber
seals and rubber
seals are not
overpressed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 The gate is to be first kept resting on sill beam,
that is in closed posi-
tion. The leakage test can be done in this position by using suitable pump
with necessary arrangements of jetting
water at 1’5 times the designed
pressure on sealing positions from bottom to top. All joints, if any, shall be
tested to ensure perfect working of the gate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6 The gate should be fully opened and closed to ensure full opening and
satisfactory closing. The time required for 300 mm opening or closing of
the gate is to be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7 The arrangements provided for preventing
the travel
of the gate or
hoist beyond the designed limit are tested and checked for proper working.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8 In case of rope drum hoist, it is ensured that the gate moves down of
its own weight. The gates shall also go up and down without
uneven pull
to the gate. The winding of rope over the drum is uniform and according
to the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9 In case of hydraulic hoists, it should be ensured that oil pressures are
within the designed limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10 The full load current required for movement of the gate on load shall
be measured and checked against the designed value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.11 When the rainy Season starts, visual inspection
of gates shall be made
and
they
shall be lowered and raised several times to make
sure that
everything is in orcler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 10096 ( Part 2 ) - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.12  When the water starts overflowing, lower the gates to hold the water
to half the height of gates. In this position the seals may be tested and any
leakage shall be attended to. The gates may also be operated
up and down
with this water load and operation of hoist shall be observed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.13 The gates shall also be tested in a similar ‘way against full water load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.14 During the testing of gate in dry condition ( see 3.1 to 3.9 1 and under
water pressure, the following observations shall be made and a record
be
kept:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Movement of gate and indication of jamming, if any;
b) Effective stop is achieved by the gate stops wherever provided;
c) Speed of opening and closing, and the current
requirement at
specified voltage;
d) Operation of brakes and limit switches;
e) Manual operation of gate, if provided;
f) Efficiency of guide rollers to check the side sway of the gate;
g) Correctness of indication by local position indicators;
h) Synchronization
of remote position
indicators, if provided; and
j) Vibration of gate, hoist, and civil structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
