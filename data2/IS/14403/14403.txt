<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Soil
Quality
and Improvement
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Food and Agriculture
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In India, a large area of land is adversely affected by high alkali (sodic) conditions.
The chemical
amendments
are primarily
used for the reclamation
of alkali soils.
Gypsum
has been used for a long time as a chemical
amendment.
The use of iron pyrites as an amendment
is a recent development
in the chemical
amelioration
of alkali soils.
The use of pyrites
has been found to be quite effective
and has opened
fresh avenues
in
the reclamation
of alkali
soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A need was, therefore,
felt to formulate
Indian Standard on the subject stipulating
various quality parameters
for the benefit of processors
and users of the product.
In preparation
of this standard considerable
assistance
has been derived
from Pyrites
Phosphates
and Chemicals
Limited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final
value, observed
or calculated,

the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded

with IS 2: I960 ‘Rules for rounding

The number ofsignificant
places retained
in the rouncled

be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

CONTENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Raise the glass cover by glass hooks resting on the
rim of the beaker,
or displace
it to one side, and
evaporate
the liquid to dryness
on the steam bath.
Add 10 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric
acid, mix
well, and again evaporate
to dryness
to eliminate
most of the nitric acid. Place the beaker in an oven,
maintained
at 95 to IOO’C, for 30 to 60 minutes
in
order to dehydrate
any silica which may-be present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-O PRINCIPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The

The
reaction may be represented by the following equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 FeS, + 6HN0,

=
2 Fe(NO,),

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
If the dry residue is heated at a temperature
above
IOOT, loss of aulphuric acid may occur and the determination
will be rendered useless.
Moisten the cold, dry residue with
1  to 2 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric
acid and, after an interval
of 3 to 5 minutes, dilute with SO ml of hot water, and rinse
the sides of beaker and the cover glass with water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The resultant
sulphuric
