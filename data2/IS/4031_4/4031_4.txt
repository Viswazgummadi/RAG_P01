FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>standard in 1968, a number of standards covering
the requirements
of different
equipment used for
testing
of cement,
a brief description
of which
was also covered
in the
standard,
had been
published.
In this revision, therefore,
reference
is given to different
instrument
specifications
deleting the description of the instruments
as it
has been recognized that reproducible
and repeat-
able
test
results can be obtained
only
with
standard
testing equipment
capable
of giving
desired  level  of accuracy.
This part
covers
the
procedure
for determining
the quantity of water
required to produce
a cement paste of standard
consistency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard ( Part 4 ) ( First Revi-
sion > was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 24 February
1988,
after the draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engi-
neering Division Council.
0.2 Standard
methods
of testing
cement
are
essential
adjunct
to the cement
specifications.
This standard in different
parts
lays down
the
procedure
for
the tests to evaluate
physical
properties
of different types of hydraulic cements.
The procedure
for conducting
chemical
tests of
hydraulic cement is covered in IS  :  4032-1985*.
0.3 Originally all the tests to evaluate the physical
properties
of hydraulic
cement
were covered in
one standard but fdr facilitating
the use of this
standard and future revisions, it has been decided
to print different
tests as different
parts of the
standard
and, accordingly
this revised standard
has been brought
out in thirteen
parts.
This
will also facilitate
updating
of individual
tests.
Further,
since the publication
of the original<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding
whether a parti-
cular requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final .value, observed
or
calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained
in the
rounded
off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tency.

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Balance -  The balance shall conform to the
following requirements.
4.2.1 On balance in use, the permissible varia-
tion at a load of 1 000 g shall be plus or minus
1’0 g. The permissible variation
on new balance
shall be one-half
of this value.
The sensibility
reciprocal shall not
be greater
than
twice the
permissible variation.
NOTE 1 -The
sensibility reciprocal is generally
defined as the change in load required to change  the
position of rest of the indicating element or elements  of
a  non-automatic
indicating
scale a definite
amount
at
any load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The samples of the cement shall be taken in
accordance
with the requirements
of IS  :  3535-
1986* and the relevant
standard specification for
the type of cement being tested.
The represen-
tative sample of the cement
selected
as above
shall be thoroughly
mixed before testing.

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Prepare
a paste of weighed
quantity
of
Cement with a weighed
quantity
of potable
or
distilled
water,
taking
care that the time of
gauging is not less than
3 minutes, nor more
than 5 min, and the gauging shall be completed
before
any sign of setting occurs.
The gauging
time shall be counted from the time of adding
water to the dry cement
until commencing
to
fill the mould.
Fill the Vicat mould E with this
paste,
the mould resting
upon a non-porous
plate.
After
completely
filling
the
mould,
smoothen
the surface of the paste, making it
level with the top of the mould.
The
mould
may be slightly shaken to expel the a.ir.
5.2.1 Clean

In filling the mould,
the operator’s

the blade of the gauging trowel
shall
alone be used.
5.3 Place the test block in the mould,
together
with the non-porous
resting
plate,
under
the
rod bearing the plunger; lower the plunger gently
to
touch the surface
of the test block,
and
quickly release, allowing it to sink into the paste.
This operation shah be carried
out immediately
after filling the mould.
5.4 Prepare trial pastes with varying percentages
of water and test as described
above
until the
amount
of water necessary
for making up the
standard consistency as defined in 5.1 is found.
