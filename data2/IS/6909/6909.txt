<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee, CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1973 and since then large number of amendments have been
issued from time to time in order to modify various provisions based on the requirements of the
users and also keeping in view the raw materials and fuel available in the country for manufacture
of cement. The important amendments include incorporating a clause on false set of cement,
permitting packaging of cement in 25 kg bags, making compulsory provision for issuing a
certificate indicating the total chloride content in percent by mass of cement, modification in the
tolerance requirements for the mass of cement packed in bags, etc. In view of these large number
of amendments, the Sectional Committee decided to bring out the first revision of the standard
incorporating all these amendments so as to make it convenient for the users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Supersulphated cement has been successfully used in a variety of aggressive conditions, for
example, for marine works, mass concrete jobs to resist the attack by aggressive water, reinforced
concrete pipes in ground water, concrete construction in sulphate bearing soils, and in chemical
works under conditions involving exposure to high concentrations of sulphates of weak solutions of
mineral acids. It has been used for the underside of bridges over railways and for concrete sewers
carrying industrial effluents. Its use under tropical conditions has also been recommended,
provided the prevailing temperature is below 40°C (  see  Note ). Although its use as a general
purpose cement can be made with adequate precautions, it is not recommended for producing
steam-cured products. Production of this cement will also result in greater utilization of
blastfurnace slag, an industrial by-product of steel in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The limit of 40°C for use of this cement in tropical conditions is on the basis of available literature and this
limit will be reviewed when more experience will be gained with the use of this cement in this country.
Mass of cement packed in bags and the tolerance requirements for the mass of cement packed in
bags shall be in accordance with the relevant provisions of the  Standards of Weights and Measures
(  Packaged Commodities  )  Rules ,  1977  and  B-1.2  (  see  Annex B for information ). Any modification
in these rules in respect of tolerance on mass of cement would apply automatically to this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in
Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.4 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (June 1991), Amendment No. 2 (November 1991),
Amendment No. 3 (November 1993) and Amendment No. 4 (April 2000). Side bar indicates
modification of the text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to distinguish supersulphated cement from
other cements shall be clearly and indelibly
made on each bag. The number of bags (net

percent, shall be not less than 50 when tested
according to the method described in IS 4031
(Part 14) : 1989. In the event of cement
