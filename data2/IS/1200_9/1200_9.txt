FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This  Indian Standard
(Part IX)
(Second
Revision)
was adopted by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 16 February
1973, after
the draft
finalized by the Civil Works Measurement
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved  by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
a very important
place in the planning
and
execution of any civil engineering
work from the time of first estimates to
the final completion
and settlement
of payments for a project.
Methods
followed for measurement
are not uniform’and
considerable
differences
exist
among
practices
followed
by different
construction
agencies
and
also among various Central and State Government
departments.
While
it is recognized
that each system of measurement
has to be specifically
related to administrative
and financial
organizations
within a department
responsible for the work, a unification
of various systems at technical
level
has been accepted as very desirable
specially
as it permits
a  wider range
of operation
for civil engineering
contractors
and eliminates
ambiguities
and misunderstandings
of various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Among various civil engineering
items, measurement
of buildings was
the first to be taken up for standardization
and this
standard
having
provisions relating
to building work was first published in 1958 and was
revised in 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.h In the course of usage of this standard
by various construction
agen-
cies in the country, several clarifications
and suggestions for modifications
were received
and as a result of study, the technical
committee
responsi-
ble for this standard
decided
that its scope besides being applicable
to
buildings
should be expanded
to cover method of measurement
of  civil
engineering
works like industrial
and river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Since different trades are not related
to one another,
the Sectional
Committee decided that each trade as given in IS  :  1200-1964*
shall be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied

the final
value,

calculated,
expressing
the result of a measurement,
shall be rounded off in accord-
ance with IS: 2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
