FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Part
XL1 ) was
adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 December
1977, after the draft
finalized
by
the
Soil
Engineering.Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view
to establish
uniform
procedures
for the determination
of different
characteiistics
of soils and
also for facilitating
comparative
studies
of the results,
the Indian
Standards
Institution
has brought
out
this
Indian
Standard
methods
of test
for soils ( IS : 2720 ) which
is
published
in parts.
Fortvone
parts of this standard
have
been
published
so far.
This
part
IS  :  2720 ( Part
XLI
) deals
with
the
method
of
test for determination
of swelling
pressure
of soils. The main purpose
of
swelling
pressure
test is to determine
the intrinsic
swelling
pressure
of the
expansive
soil
tested.
The
expansive
clays
increase
in their
volume
when
they
come
in contact
with
water
owing
to surface
properties
of
these
clay
types.
Light
structures
founded
on these
type of clays -
popularly
known
in India
as black cotton
soil, experience
severe structural
damage
due to the swelling
of the subsoil.
Since
the intrinsic
swelling
pressure
is to be associated
with
the design
of structures
against
such
damages,
measurement
of swelling
pressure
assumes
importance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
swelling
pressure
is dependent
upon
several
factors
namely
(a) the type and amount
of clay in the soil and
the nature
of the clay
mineral,
(b) the initial
water
content
and dry density,
(c) the nature
of
pore fluid,
(d)
the
stress
history
of the soil including
the
confining
pressure
and (e) drying
and wetting
cycles to which
the soils have
been
subjected
to.
Besides,
the dependence
of swelling
pressure
on volume
change
makes
a precise
measurement
of swelling
pressure
difficult.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the
field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  In reporting
the result
of a test or analysis
made
in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with  IS  : 2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
covers
the
laboratory
method
of conducting
one-
dimensional
swelling
pressure
test using either
fixed or the floating
rings
on
both
undisturbed
or remoulded
soils
in
the
partially
saturated
condition
to determine
thbLswelling
pressure
of the soil.
Two
methods,
namely,
consolidometer
method
in which the volume
change
of the soil
is permitted
and the corresponding
pressure
required
to bring
back
the
soil to its original
volume
is measured
and
the constant
volume
method
in which
the volume
change
is prevented
and the con/sequent
pressure
is
measured
are covered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the pupose of this standard,
the following
definition
shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

OF TEST SPECIMEN<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Preparation
of Specimen from Undisturbed
Soil Samples
-
The  container
ring shall be cleaned
and weighed
empty.
From one end of
the undisturbed
soil sample
about
30 mm, or more if desired,
of the soil
sample,
if desired
shall be cut off and rejected.
The specimen
shall be cut
off either from the undisturbed
tube sample or from block sample the latter
generally
being
more
representative
of the field conditions.
In either
case the consolidation
ring
should
be gradually
inserted
in the sample
by pressing
with hands
and carefully
removing
the material
around
the
ring.
The soil specimen
so cut shall
project
as far as 10 mm on either
side of the ring.
The specimen
shall then
be trimmed
smooth
and
flush
with the top and bottom
of the ring.
Any
voids in the specimen
caused
due
to removal
of gravel
or limestone
pieces,
shall
be filled
back
by
pressing  lightly
the loose soil in the voids,
care being
taken
to see that
the specimen
is not affected.
The
container
ring
shall
be  wiped clear
of  any
soil sticking
to the outside
and
weighed
again
with
the
soil.
The whole process should
be quick to ensure
minimum
loss of moisture
and
if possible
shall
be carried
cut
in
the
moisture
room.
Three
representative
specimens
from
the
soil
trimming
shall
be taken
in
moisture
content
cans
and
their
moisture
content
determined
in
acc:ordance
with IS  :  2720  (  Part XI )-1973*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Preparation
of Specimen
from
Disturbed
Soil Sample?
-
In
case  where
it is necessary
td use disturbed
soil samples
the soil sample
shall b& compacted
to the desired
(field  )  density
and water
content
it1 a
standard
compaction
proctor
mould.
Samples
of suitable
sizes are cut
from it as given in 4.11.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NI)TE  1 -
Since
thr

it shall
be
ensured
that
in
the
case
of
undisturbed
soil samp!es,
the sprcmx-n
shall be coil&ted
from  the field for trst dttriog
the driest
season
of the yrar,
,namely,
April,
May
and June,
so that
the
swelling

shall iw rnaxlmtrm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ho the case of remoulded
soil samples,
the initial
water
content
shall
be at the
shrinkage
limit
or field water  content.  SO  that
the swelling

<<HEADING level=3>>5. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Assembly<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1  The porous
stones
shall
be
saturated.
All
surfaces
of
the
consolidometer
which
are to be enclosed
shall be moistened.
The
porous
stones
shall
be
saturated
by
boiling
in
distilled
water
for
at
least
15 minutes.
The
consolidometer
shall
be
assembled
with
the
soil
specimen
(in
the
ring)
and porous
stones
at top and bottom
of the
specimen,
providing
a filter
paper
rendered
wet  (  Whatman
No.
1 or
equivalent)
between
the
soil
specimen
and
the
porous
stone.
The
loading
block
shall then be positioned
centrally
on the top porous
stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
This
assembly
shall then be mounted
on the loading
frame
such
that,
the.load
when applied
is transmitted
to the soil specimen
through
the loading
cap.
The assembly
shall be so centred
that
the load
applied
is axial.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3
In the case of the lever
loading
system,
the apparatus
shall
be
properly
counterbalanced.
If a jack
with load measurements
by platform
scales
is used
as the loading
systems
the tare
weight
with
the empty
consolidation
apparatus,
excluding
those parts
which
will be on top of
the soil specimen,
which
rest on the platfortn
shall be determined
before
filling
the ring with the soil and this
tare
weight
shall
be added
to the
computed
scale loads required
to give the desired
pressures
at the time
of loading
the soil specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4
The holder
with the dial gauge to record
the progressive
vertical
heave
of the specimen
under no load, shall then be screwed
in place
and
adjusted
in
such
a way
that
the dial
gauge
is near
the
end
of
its
release
run, allowing
small margin
for the compression
of the soil, if any.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5
An initial
setting
load of 50 gf/cms
( this includes
the weight
of
the porous stone and
the loading
pad ) shall
be placed
on the loading
hanger
and the initial
reading
of the dial gauge shall be noted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.6
The
system
shall
be
connected
to a water
reservoir
with
the
level of water
in the reservoir
being at about
the same
level
as the soil
specimen
and water
allowed
to  flow  in the sample.
The
soil shall
then
be allowed
to swell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1  The
free
swell
readings
shown
by
the dial
gauge
under
the
seating
load
of 5 kN/ms ( 0.05 kgf/ cm% ) shall
be recorded
at different
time intervals.
For the purpose
of record
form

and
shelling
dial reading
as .ordinates
on natural
scale. A smooth c!lrve
shall
be drawn joining
these points. If the curve so drawn
becomes
asymptotic
with the abscissa, the swelling has reached its maximum
and
hence the swelling phase shall be stopped, and the consolidation
phase
shall be started.
The compression readings shall be tabulated
as in form ‘2
of Appendix A and a plot of change in thickness
of expanded

as ordinates
and consolidation
pressure
applied
as abscissa
in semi-
