<<PARAGRAPH>>PART I
REQUIREMENTS
FOR LABORATORIES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part I ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 25 August 1981, after the draft finalized by the Acoustics
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Electronics and Tele-
communication
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.2 The purpose of this standard is to provide a coordinated statement of
requirements for laboratories used for measurement of sound insulation
of building elements.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Laboratories
for the determination
of airborne and impact sound
reduction of structural elements should be constructed in such a way that
the measurement results can be directly or indirectly applied to the con-
ditions in actual buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the case of laboratories with suppressed radiation from flanking
elements, the behaviour of the element in the actual building can be con-
cluded only indirectly and only in some cases from the measurement results
in the laboratory. The test rooms described in this standard belong to this
group of laboratories. This group includes laboratories where the specimen
is structurally isolated ~from both test rooms, and laboratories where the test
specimen is connected to one or both of the test rooms, the radiation from
flanking elements being reduced either by use of heavy elements or by use
of appropriate linings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A direct application
of the results of laboratory
measurements is
possible if the flanking transmission is included. For this purpose, the test
rooms -and coupling of test specimen to the flanking construction must
resemble the situation in usual buildings (laboratories
with flanking
transmission or mockups ): The requirements for such laboratories are
under consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.5 Measurement of sound insulation in buildings and of building elements
are being covered by a series of standards consisting of the following in-
dividual parts  :<<HEADING_END>>

International

<<HEADING level=3>>0.7 In reporting the result of a test made in accordance with this standard,
if the final value, observed or calculated is to be rounded off, it shall be
done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
( Part
I ) specifies requirements for laboratories for
sound insulation measurements of building elements. It applies to labo-
ratories with suppressed radiation from flanking elements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0 For the purpose of this standard, the terms and definitions given in
IS  :  1885 ( Part III/Set

shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Roomy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  Volumes
and shapes of the two test rooms should not be exactly
the same. A difference in room volumes of at least 10 percent is recommend-
ed.
The
volumes
of the
test
rooms should be atleast 50ms. The ratios
of the room dimensions
should be so chosen that the natural
frequencies
in the low-frequency
region are spaced as uniformly
as possible. If neces-
sary, diffusing elements should be installed in the rooms to obtain a diffused
sound field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
The volume of the rooms and the size of the test opening as well
as the position of the test specimen within this opening are under consideration.
Theoretical
calculation as well as some experiments have indicated that it may
be advisable that the specimen should cover a total side wall or ceiling of the test
room, that is, the test opening should extend from wall to wall and/or from ceiling
to floor. If the latter is the case, a volume of 5Oms is appropriate in view of the
recommended
size of the test opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The reverberation time in the rooms should not be excessively long.
Where the reverberation
time at low frequencies exceeds two seconds, a check
should be made to determine whether the measured reduction index d
!%
ends
on the reverberation time. When such a dependence is found, even with di usors
in the rooms, the room should be modified to reduce the reverberation time to
not more than two seconds at low test frequencies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2  The background
level in the receiving
room must be sufficiently
low to permit
a measurement
of the sound transmitted
from the source
room,
considering
the power output
in the source room and the isolating
properties
of the specimens for which the laboratory
is intended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3
In laboratory
test facilities
for measuring
the
transmission
loss,
the sound transmitted
by any indirect path should be negligible compared
with the sound transmitted
through the test specimen.
One way to achieve
this in such facilities is to provide
sufficient structural
isolation
between
source and receiving
room. Another
method might be to cover all surfaces
of both rooms with linings that reduce the radiation
sufficiently:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
A suitable measure to use as a reference value is d, Max defined in
IS : 9901 ( Part III )-1951*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Test Opening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1
It is recommended
that
the size of the test opening
should
be
approximately
lOm2 for walls, and between IOms and 2Om2 for floors, with
the shorter edge length not less than 2.3m for both walls and floors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:99Ol(PartI)-1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2  A smaller size may be used if the wavelength
of free flexural waves
at the
lowest
frequency
considered
is smaller
than
half
the minimum
dimension
of the specimen.
The smaller the specimen,
however,
the more
sensitive the results will he to edge constraint
conditions
and to local varia-
tions in sound fields.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3
A smaller size may also be appropriate
for tests of windows, doors
and similar components.
Test openings
for doors shall be so arranged
that
the lower edge is situated directly above the floor of the test rooms according
to the conditions
in the field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-Test
openings  should be so arranged that the test specimen can be
installed in a manner as similar as possible to the actual construction with a careful
simulation of normal connections and sealing conditions at the perimeter and at
joints within the partition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

-The
volume
of the receiving

The
ratios
of the receiving

should be so
chosen that the natural
frequencies
in the low-frequency

If necessary,
diffusing elements should be installed
in the receiving
room to obtain a diffuse sound field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE I -
The volume of the receiving room and the size of the test opening as well
as the position of the test specimen within this opening are under consideration. Theo-
retical calculation as well as some experiments have indicated that it may be advisable
that the specimen should cover the total ceiling of the receiving room, that is, the test
openmg should extend from wall to wall. If the latter is the case, a volume of 5Oms is
appropriate in view of the recommended size of the test opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The reverberation time in the receiving room should not be excessively
long. Where the reverberation
time at low frequencies exceeds two seconds, a check
should be made to determine whether the measured impact sound insulation depends
on the reverberation time. When such a dependance is found, even with diffusers in
the room, the room should be modified to reduce the reverberation time to not more
than two seconds at low test frequencies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  The
background
level in the receiving
room must be sufficiently
low to permit a measurement
of the transmitted
impact sound, considering
the properties
of the tapping
machine
and the isolating
properties
of the
specimens
for which the laboratory
is intended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2
The airborne
sound insulation
between the receiving
room and the
source room must be sufficiently
high that the sound field measured
in the
receiving
room is only that generated
by the impact
excitation
of the test
floor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

according to IS  :  9901 ( Part VIII )-1981  ,  special precautions with respect to the test
