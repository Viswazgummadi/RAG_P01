FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part VI ) was adopted
by the Indian
St;lndards
Iustitution
on 31 January
1972, after the draft tinalizetl
by, the Soil

ueerinq

Committee
had been approved
by the Civil

Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Soil stabilization
is the alteration
of any property
of a soii to improve
its engineerirq
perki)rmance.
There
are several
methods
of stabilizatios
and these may be broadly
c’lassified on the basis of treatment
given to the
soil ( for example.
dewatering
and
compaction
), process
involved
( for
example,
thermal,
and
ckctrical
),
and
on
additives
employed
(for
exam[)le.
asphalt
and
cement
).
The
choice
of
a particular
method
depends
on
tile characteristics
of the problem
on hand.
For studying
in the laboratory
the methods
and effects of stabilization,
certain
standard
methods
of test
for the evaiuation
of properties
of stabilized
soils and
their
analysis
are required.
‘I’he required

Approximately
90 roddings
distributed
uniformly
over the cross-section

required;
take
care
so as not
to leave

Obtain.
final compaction
with a static load applied
by the compres-

or Compression
frame until the height of‘ 75 mm is: reached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4
Immediately
after compaction,
carefully
dismantle
the mould
and
remove  the specimen
onto a smooth, rigid wood or sheet metal pallet.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
-
A suggested
method for  removing
the
specimen
from the mould is to
remove
first the top and then the sides and end plates of the mould.
The specimen
is
then resting on the bottom
plate of the mould.
The flat face of a carrying
pallet is then
placed against one side of the specimen and then the bottom mould plate,
the specimen,
and the pallet-are
rorated
90” so that
the specimen
rests on its side
on the
pallet.
The bottom
mould
plate is then carefully
removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Curing the Specimens
-
Cure the specimens
on pallets
in the moist
room
and protect
from free  water'  for  the specified
moist
curing
period.
Generally
the specimen
will be tested in the moist condition
directly
after
removal ~from the moist room.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N0TE -
Other
conditioning
proctsdures,
such as soaking

air drying or
oven drying,
alternate

and drying,
or  altcrllare freezing and  thawing,
may be
specified
after an initial

FOR FLEXURAL
TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Turn
the specimen
on its side with respect
to its mnulded
position
(with
the original
top and bottom
surfaces
as moulded
perpendicular
to
the testing
machine
bed,) and
centre
it on the lower
half-round
steel
supports,
which shall have been spaced apart a distance
of three times the
depth of the beain.
Place the load appl,ying block assembly
in contact
with
the upper
surface
of the beam at the third points
between
the
supports.
Carefully
align the centre of the beam with the centre of thrust of the sphe-
rically seated head block cit. the machine.
:\s this block
is brought
to bear
on the beam-loading
assembly,
rotate its movable
portion gently by hand
so that uniform
seatlng
is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Apply
the load

and
without
shock.
A screw

machine,
with
the’ moving
head
operating
at
approximately
1.2 mm/min
when
the

is running
idle
may
be
used.
With
hydraulic
machines
adjust
the loading
to such a constant
-rate that the
extreme
fibre stress is within the limits of 7 f O-4 kq’cu>s/min.
Record
