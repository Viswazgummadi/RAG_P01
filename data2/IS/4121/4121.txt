FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Insti-
tution on 16 May 1967, after the draft finalized by the Stones Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Dense varieties
of natural
building
stones are sometimes
used for
waterproofing or damp-proofing
courses in buildings and ,their performance
would depend upon the satisfactory prevention of flow of water by capillary
‘ransmission.
The determination
of water transmission
rate by capillary
action
through
natural
building
stones, therefore,
assumes considerable
importance.
This standard provides a uniform basis for determination
of
water transmission  I  rate by capillary
action
through
natural
building
stones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given
to  international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard is one of a series of Indian Standards on method of test
for natural building stones.
Other standards published so far in the series
are given in Appendix A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in
this standard,

off; it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard lays down the procedure for determination
of rate of
water
transmission
rate by capillary
action
through
natural
building
stones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2. SAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1’  The
sample
shall
be
selected
by
the
purchaser
or his authorized
representative
from the quarried
stone or taken
from
the natural
rock
as
described
in 2.2
and
2.3
so as to represent
a true average
of the type
or grade of stone under consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2
In case of stone from ledges or quarries
the ledge or quarry
face of the
stone
shall
be inspected
to determine
any
variation
in different
strata.
Differences
in colour,
texture
and structure
shall be observed.
Separate
samples of stone weighing
at least 25 kg each of unweathered
type shall be
obtained
from
all
strata
that
appear
to vary
in colour,
texture
and
structure.
Pieces
that
have
been
damaged
by blasting
driving
wedges,
heating,
etc, shall not be included
in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 In case of field stone and boulders
a detailed
inspection
of the deposits
of field
stone
and
boulders,
over
the
area
where
the supply
is to be
obtained,
shall be made.
The different
kinds of stone and their
condition
in
the
various
deposits
shall
be
recorded.
Separate
samples
shall
be
selected
of all
classes
of stone
that
would
be
considered
for
use in
construction
as indicated
by visual inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4
When perceptible
variations
occur in the quality of rock, the purchaser
shall select grs many samples as are necessary
for determining
the range
in
properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  TEST SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Test pieces shall be square prism 5 x 5 cm in cross section and 6 cm in
length.
The
pieces shall
be square-cut
or fine tooled
on all the faces
and
the dimension
5 ~5 cm should
be cut
along
the
planes
of strati-
fication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 At least 6 test pieces shall be used for the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  General -
The apparatus
shall consist of a shallow glass vessel
10 cm
in diameter
and 2 cm deep. The glass vessel shall be provided
with a cover
plate  with a square
hole of 5.25 x 5.25 cm in the centre
(.EC Fig.
1 ).
The cover
should have ground glass flange.
The hange should rest on the
ground
glass flange of the shallow
glass vessel.
The
flanges
should
be
properly
greased
before putting
the cover
plate over the glass vessel so as
to make the ,joint leak-proof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Sealing
Material
-
Paraffin
wax mixed
with
resin
or some
other
suitable
material
may be used for sealing the joints and in the hole so as
to make the whole arrangement
leak-proof.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.  Balance -
A balance
sensitive to 0.01 g for weighing
shall be used.<<HEADING_END>>

TYPICAL ARRANGEMENT OF WATER TRANSMISSION TEST<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. TEST PR&EDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The
specimen
shall be placed
in the centre
of the glass vessel.
The
vessel shall then be filled with the -distilled
water
to nearly
three
fourths
( l-5 cm ) of its depth and the cover plate shall be placed in position
over
the vessel so that part of the test specimen projects
through
the central
hole
of the cover
plate.
The
sides of the specimen
exposed
above
the cover
plate shall be given
wax coating
so as to prevent
evaporation
from
the
sides of specimen”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 All joints shall be made water-tight
by using paraffin
wax mixed
with
resin or some other suitable
material
to ensure
that
these are leak-proof
and no evaporation
takes place through
them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3
The test shall be carried
out at a relative
humidity
of 65 f
5 percent
,and at a temperature
of 27 f 2°C and the sample
shall be maintained
to
t.his condition
for 24 hours before the test is carried
out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4
The whole of this arrangement
shall
then be carefully
weighed
over
the sensitive
balance
specified
in 4.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 Weighing
shall
be repeated
after
every
24 hours
interval
so as to
record the rate of loss of water that results due to its evaporation
from the
top surface of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in grams at the end of 48 hours shall be
reported.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The period and the values of rate of loss of water after which it be-
comes constant shall be reported.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 The water transmission rate by capillary
action shall be expressed as
