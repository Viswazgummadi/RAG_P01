<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian

finalized by the Structural

approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1974 in view the
importance
of hqt rolled steel sections in the
fzbiication
of steel doors, windows,
ventilators
and sashes.
implementation
of this standard it was revised in 1982.
Based on’the experience gained in the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision use of concast billets made according to IS 6914 ‘Cast billet ingots and continuously
cast billets for rolling into structural
steel ( standard quality ) ( firs1  revision )’  have been permitted
in the rolling of such sections in addition to stipulating mass tolerance
of the rolled sections. The
tolerance
specified on the dimensions of the sections shall nevertheless
be strictly adhered to as they
are advantageous
and necessary for carrying out accurate fabrication
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision 4 new sections
in the F series have been included for use in the outer and inner
frames of larger size windows only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the guidance of the user -of the rolled
sections
covered
in this standard,
Annex A may be
referred
for the recommended
use of the various
sections
based on the
situations/intended
applications.
These sections
may also be used for purpose other
than those mentioned
in the
Annex provided their suitability has been established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960
‘Rulesfor
rounding
off numerical
values (  revised)‘.
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If the deformation

When
straightening

avoid
any rise in temperature
due

Any slight straightening

which may be required
shall be

The Standard
Mark on
products covered by an Indian Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply with the requirements
of that standard under a well defined system of inspection,
testing and quality control which is devised and supervised by BIS and operated
by the pr-o-

Standard marked products are also continuously
checked by BIS for conformity
to
that standard as a further safeguard.
