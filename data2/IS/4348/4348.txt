FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
(First
Revision)
was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 12 October 1973, after the draft finalized by the
Stones Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Permeability of stone is of particular importance in structures which
are intended to retain water or which are subjected to the action of high
water pressure.
intimately
Besides functional considerations,
permeability is also
related to the durability of stone, specially its resistance against
progressive deterioration
under exposure to severe climate, and leaching
t  due to prolonged seepage of water.
characteristics
of stone,
The determination of the permeability
therefore,
assumes
considerable
importance.
This standard was published in 1967.
The revision has been prepared
with a view to reviewing its provision in regard to pressure to which the
permeability is to be tested, besides making it up-to-date.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the method for determining the permeability of
natural building stones.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. SELECTION
OF  SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The sample shall be selected to represent a true average of the  type or
grade of stone under consideration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*R&a  for  rounding oif nun-.erical values (  revised).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ISr4348- 1913<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  The sample shall be selected by the purchaser or his authorized
representative from the quarried stone or taken from the natural rock, as
described in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and shall be of adequate size to permit the
preparation of the requisite number of test pieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  Stones from Ledges or Quarries  -The
ledge or quarry face of the
stone shall be inspected to determine any variation in different strata.
Differences in colour, texture and structure shall be observed.
Separate
samples of stone weighing at least 25 kg each of the specimens shall be
obtained
from all strata that appear to vary in colour,
texture and
structure.
Pieces that have been damaged by blasting, driving wedges,
heating, etc, shall not be included in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2  Field Stone and Boulders-A
detailed inspection of the stone and
boulders over the area where the supply is to be obtained shall be made.
The different kinds of stone and their condition
at various quarry sites
shall be recorded.
Separate samples for e&h class of stone that would
be considered for use in construction
as indicated by visual inspection
shall be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 When perceptible variations occur in the quality of rock, the purchaser
shall select as many samples as are necessary for determining the range in
properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Permeability
Cell-The
permeability cell shall consist of a metal
cylinder with a ledge at the bottom for retaining the specimen, a flange at
the top, a removable  cover  plate and a sheet metal funnel which can be
securely bolted
to the cell.
Gunmetal
or other
suitable
corrosion
r.esistant metal shall be used for fabrication
of the cell and  cover  platy
which shall be designed to safely withstand the maximum test pressure.
A rubber or neoprene O-ring or other suitable gasket, seated in matching
grooves, shall be used between the cell and the cover plate to render the
joint water-tight.
Typical details of the permeability
cell together with
pertinent dimensions for use with test specimens of 100 mm diameter are
shown in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Water Reservoir-A
suitable reservoir may consist of a length of
metal pipe, 50 to 100 mm in diameter and about 500 mm long.
The
reservoir shall be fitted with a graduated side arm gauge-glass, and the
necessary fittings and valves for admitting water and compressed air and
for draining, bleeding and connection to the permeability
cell, as shown
in Fig. 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The choice of reservoir dimensions is necessarily
a matter
of compromise
between the accuracy
with which the water entering
the specimen can  be  meastired
and the adequacy of the capacity.
The ideal combination
would be the smallest
diameter and sufficient length to provide a capacity for at least 24 hours of continuous
operatiort.
Lengths greater than about 500 mm may be difficult to handle.

tication .
Wherever possible, polishing of drilled cores should be done by
electrical polishing machines for efficient and quick polishing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 The ends of the cylinders shall be plane surfaces at right angles to the
axis of the cylinder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  PRESSURE HEAD<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The standard test pressure head to be applied to the water in the
reservoir should be 1’1 times the hydraulic head to which the stones under
test will be actually subjected.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Calibrating

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3  Testing
the Seal -  It  is essential
that the seal is watertight,
This
may
be checked
very
conveniently
by bolting
on the top cover
plate,
inverting
the cell and
applying
an air pressure
of 1 to 2 kgfbm’

ir used
to detect
any leaks through
the seal which
would
show up  aa  bubbles
along the ledge.
In case of leaks the specimen
shalL be taken
out tid
resealed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4  Assembling
the
Apparatus-After
a  ratirfactoty teal har been
obtained,
the funnel
shall
be secured
in position
and  the  cell asrembly
connected
to the water
reservoir,
as
illustrated
in Fig. 2.
With
the
air-bleeder
valve,
the valve
between
the reservoir
and the cell, and the
drain-cock
in the cell open,
de-aired
water
shall be allowed
to enter the
reservoir.
When
water issues freely
through
the drain-cock,
it  shall be
closed
and the water
reservoir
filled.
The reservoir water inlet and air
bleeder
valves shall then be closed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5  Running
the Test-With
the system completely
filled with
water,
the desired
test pressure
(see 6) shalI be applied
to the water reservoir
and the initial
reading
of the gauge-glass
recorded.
At the same time a
clean
collection
bottle
shall be weighed
and placed
in position
to collect
the water percolating
through
the specimen.
The
quantity
of percolate
and the gauge-glass
readings
shall be recorded
at periodic
intervals.
In
the beginning,
the rate of intake
is larger
than the rate of outflow.
As
the point of steady state of flow is reached,
the two rates tend to become
equal and the outflow
reaches
a maximum
and stabilizes.
With
further
passage
of time, both the inflow and outflow
generally
register
a gradual
_
drop.
Permeability
test shall be continued
for about
100 hours after the
steady
state of flow has been reached
and the outflow shall be considered
as average
of all the outflows
measured
during
this period
of 100 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-
The steady state of flow is defined as the condition
in which
the rate8 of
inflow and outflow
of water
are equal.
The point of qteady state is defined a& the
time at which thir condition
is first reached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*For
getting
a pood perfect
seal, preheating
of the cylinder
at low temperature
of 30-3S°C for 24 to 30 hours ia recommended
before test specimen
is centred.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Test Temperature-The
test  shall preferably
be carried out at
a temperature of 27 f 3°C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7  Precautions-There
are several precautions which shall be observed,
before any dependable estimate of permeability can be obtained from the
test data, of these the most important are as follows:
4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The seal around the specimen shall be effective.
Leakage through
it can give rise to entirely misleading results.
Obtaining a good
seal is a matter of experience and only a general guidance can be
provided.
It is important that the air content of the water entering the
specimen should not exceed about 0’2 percent.
Excessive amounts
of dissolved air can result in air locks in the specimen and
apparent reduction in permeability.
Periodical samples shall be
drawn from the cell drain-cock and the dissolved air determined.
The system shall be drained and replenished with fresh de-aired
water, as  soon  as the air content- exceeds the above limit.
The flow should be permitted to attain the steady state before the
coefficient
of permeability
is calculated.
Examination
of the
inflow and outflow rate data or suitable graphs of the same may
be used to determine the establishment of the steady state.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The observation
of outflow
from the specimen is liable to be
influenced by evaporation
of
the percolate
during collection.
The collection bottle may be housed in a humid chamber, or alter
natively, blank observations on a similar bottle containing water
should be made and the necessary correction
for evaporation
loss applied.
The inflow measurement provides an additional
check.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>al
The quantity percolating
in the steady period indicates an equili-
brium state.
Computation of coefficient of permeability shall be based
on this rate.
.
