<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 8 February 1965, after the draft finalized by the Welding General
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Structural and Metals
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 There are two major fields in which sprayed metal coatings find appli-
cation, namely, for providing protection to surfaces against corrosion and
for building-up surfaces to desired dimensions. In this standard, it is inten-
ded to deal only with the latter aspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 A variety of processes and equipments for flame spraying of metal
coatings are in use today and some of the recent technical developments
such as electric arc spraying and plasma arc spraying show much promise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 This standard, however, covers only the oxy-fuel gas flame spray-
ing process using metal in the wire form, since this method is by far the
most commonly used and sufficient information and experience is available
for the formulation of a code of practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international co-ordination among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.
This has been met by basing the standard on the follow-
ing publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers recommendations for building-up by metal spray-
ing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>using,wire   and oxy-fuel equipment except and where otherwise stated,
the reference is to building-up of the outside surface of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>.cylindrical
components, such as, shafts, rolls, drums, etc, which in fact constitute the
bulk of the building up applications for which this process is<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e?ployed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. SURFACE PREPARATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 The adherence of the flame sprayed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cbating  to the base depends upon
mechanical interlocking of the first layer to the interstices of the roughened
surface or to the bond coat.- For obtaining a high degree of adhesion,
careful attention should be paid to the preparation of the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  Cleaning Prior to<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  Crease, paint and other
foreign matter shall be removed from the area to be sprayed as well as the
adjoining area, since these stand in the way of proper adhesion of the
sprayed metal to the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>,Further  Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1 A chemical solvent, such as, trichloroethylene or carbon<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>tetrachlo-
ride or heating or a combination of both methods should be employed for
cleaning the surface.
Surfaces which are likely to have absorbed oil
should be heated to 250” to 300°C to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>endure  removal of all traces of oil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>_  2.1.2 Blasting with abrasive material is an effective method of removing
ail foreign matter except oil and grease.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Inspection for Soundness -The surface should be carefully
examined for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>freedbm   from cracks and other flaws which would render the
component unsuitable for repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Undercutting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  It is almost always necessary to undercut the surface
to be built-up. This is done<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iti  order to  allow  for  an adequate and uniform
thickness of sprayed deposit on the finished job.
Undercutting will not be
necessary when a thin coating of molybdenum is to be applied for restoring
a component to a size so that a gear, flange, wheel, or such other parts
may be press-fitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1  Procedure for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  The undercutting is accomplished on a
lathe or similar device by either machining or grinding to the required
dimensions, care<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Updercutting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>beitig<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>excercised   to see<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t,hat  the undercut section is con-
centric with the original axis of the shaft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1.1 In cases where the extent of wear that has already taken place
is such as to allow for an adequate thickness of sprayed deposit in the
finished job, machining<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or’  grinding should be done solely for the purpose of
correcting the eccentricity in wear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1.2 Undercutting reduces the effective cross-section of the part to be
metal sprayed. Since sprayed metal deposits do not restore any qualities<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:3023-1965<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>such as tensile strength or resistance to fatigue stress, all parts to be built-
up  by metal spraying should be examined carefully from a design stand-
point to determine that adequate strength is maintained in the part as
prepared for metal spraying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1.3 The undercutting operation should preferably be done dry,
but where this is not feasible, this should be followed by a further<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>degreas-
ing treatment and drying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3.2  Length of Undercut  -The length of the undercut section should
generally extend beyond both-ends of the sleeve, bearing or packing gland
in which the shaft operates.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.3  Depth of Undercut-The  depth to which the shaft should be under-
cut is determined by a number of factors such as the diameter of the shaft,
the severity of service and the amount of wear to be expected in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>’
The wear allowance should always be determined for each individual job
but the information provided in Table 1 may be used for guidance in de-
termining the depth of undercut to be provided for specific service appli-
cations.
Additional allowances should be made, if necessary, for more
severe wear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.3.5  When preparing journals of crankshafts where dovetailing at the
extremities as illustrated in Fig. 1 is not permissible, about<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.25  mm should
be removed from the flanges.
The fillet radius should be reduced to be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>parallel   to the original radius.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.6 Where the surface to be built-up extends to the extremity of the
shaft, the end should be chamfered to avoid possibilities of damage to the
coating at that point.
It is also good practice to chamfer the ends of
hydraulic rams and pump-rods so that the sprayed deposit can be taken
over<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the  end surfaces. This prevents the possibility of the pressurized
fluids exerting a lifting action on<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Surface Roughening-To  ensure adherence of the sprayed metal,
a clean surface of sufficient roughness is necessary.
Before the roughening
operation is commenced, however, it should be made certain that all traces
of oil, grease and other foreign matter on and adjacent to the undercut
surface are removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A number of methods of roughening are available and the choice
among them depends mainly on the materials and tools available and
service requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.1  Mechanical Roughening<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  The roughening methods falling under
mechanical roughening are given in 2.4.1.1 to 2.4.1.3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.1.1  Rough threading method-The  object of the rough threading
method is to obtain roughened V threads with the sides torn and jagged
and with a radius of not more than<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O-4  mm at the bottom.
A 50” to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>60°
pointed tool should be used for the purpose and Fig. 3 illustrates one of
the many ways to grind the tool bit for rough threading.
Another way is
to grind the tool so that it has a zero or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>shghtly  negative back rake and
side rake.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The tool should be set slightly below the centre line of the work to
give a certain amount of chatter.
Alternatively, a shim placed at the back
of the tool assists in obtaining as rough and jagged a thread as possible.
The tool should also be fed to a greater depth than normal so as to obtain
a sharp thread.
The work should be rotated at a low speed and 6 to 12
threads/cm with a depth of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.8  mm are to be cut, larger diameter
shafts usually requiring coarser threads which would be correspondingly
deeper also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The threading operation may be done in one or more passes or cuts.
No coolant should be used and the surface should always be kept free from
grease.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Barbs that are just above the contour of the shaft may be removed by
placing a flat tool just clear of the job.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of annular grooves the machining time may be reduced
by the use of multiple cutters which permit the making of several grooves
at a time.
Annular grooves should be cut proceeding from both ends
towards the centre so that an outsize groove or land, if it occurs, is in the
centre of the area to be sprayed. The depth of the groove should be
approximately 0.6 mm and may be cut in one or several passes. The
grooves should be so spaced that the lands between them are approxi-
mately 0.4 mm wide.
The grooving should cover entire length of the
undercut section except for 0.6 to 0.9 mm at each end.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>-  1965<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the grooving is completed, the spreading and roughening
operation should be done with a special knurling tool usually consisting of
several hardened and grooved wheels. With the work turning at a surface
speed of from 60 to 90 m/min, the tool should be fed into the work at
O-1 mm<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>infeed   per pass and traversed over the lands of the grooves at a
feed of about<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  mm per revolution.
This operation should be continued
until the land is spread out and the land width and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the,  groove width are
approximately<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O-8  mm.
When this operation has been completed the U
shaped grooves will have been converted into a series of dovetails.
The
surface of the land will be spread and roughened ( Fig. 4B<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The most common method of blasting surfaces prior to building-up

Undeday —  While
this
method
may
be
adopted
for
general
use
also,
it
is
particularly
useful
in
treating
hardened
surfaces
which
cannot
be prepared
by the methods
described
under
2.4.1.1,
2.4.1.2
and 2.4.1 .3.
It consists of
applying
by ~metaI, spraying
a thin
coating
of
molybdenum
on to the surface
which
should
be clean,
free from
grease
and
slightly
roughened
or
abrasing
with medium
grade
emery
cloth,
taking
a
light
grinding
cut
or
light
grit
blasting
being
usu/dly
adequate.
Grit
blasting
‘is definitely
of benefit
in that it produces
compressive
stresses
in
the
surface
of
the
steel
and
offsets
the
tendency
to the
lowering
of the
fatigue strength.
The
molybdenum
coating
acts as the base for the coating
that follows
the metal
to be used for building-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When used as a bonding
coat,
the thickness of the molybdenum
should
only
be sufficient
to cover
the surface
completely.
This
will
be
equal
to
an average
coating
thickness
of 0“04 to 0“05 mm,
which
will then
measure
0.07
to 0“08 mm due to surface irregularities.
The
underlay
coating
should
be
sprayed
coarse
since
such
a
coating
provides
a
better
key
for
the
following
coat.
The
correct
degree
of atomisation
may
be achieved
by
reducing
the
propellent
air
pressure
to
less
than
the
usual
figure
recommended
for normal
spraying
of other metals
and
alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is
essential
that
acetylene
be
used
as the
fuel
gas for
spraying
molybdenum.
Adjustment
of
both
the acetylene
and
oxygen
pressures is
critical
Molybdenum
will
oxidise
badly
and
not
bond
if even
a slight
excess of
oxygen
is used.
Conditions
of spraying
molybdenum
involving
high
oxygen
gas
ratios
are
confined
to
the
application
of
hardened
molybdenum
coatings
and
are
not
used
for
underlays.
The
operating
conditions
recommended
by
the
manufacturers
of
the
metal
spraying
equipment
should
be carefully
followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since molybdenum
sticks even to smooth
surfaces,
it is necessary
to
mask
areas
adjacent
to the
portion
to be treated
with
tape or a masking
compound.
Oil holes in the area to be treated
should
be protected
by the
use of carbon,
wood
or
brass
plugs
and
key wa ys
by
inserting
a brass,
bronze
or carbon
dummy
key.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A
molybdenum
coat
when
applied
correctly
on
a freshly
prepared
surface
will
adhere
satisfactorily
to steel
either
in the hardened
or in the
soft state, cast iron, stainless steel, nickel
and
nickel
alloys
and
most
alu-
minium
and
magnesium
alloys.
It
does
not
bond
well with
copper
and
copper
alloys and
on nitrided

Molybdenum
has a marked
tendency
to
oxidization
at
elevated
temperatures
and
because
of
the danger
of
deterioration
of the bond
on
account
of
this,
a molybdenum
underlay
is
not
generally
recommended
for
work
which
will

<<PARAGRAPH>>I<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 General-  Parts should be sprayed as ‘soon as possible after
preparation.
Where, for special reasons, the spraying has to be delayed
for even a short period of time or the part has to be handled, the prepared
surface should be protected from oxidation and contamination. Wrapping
with clean paper and handling with clean protective gloves usually pro-
vides adequate protection. Since condensation of moisture on the prepared
surface impedes satisfactory adhesion of the sprayed metal, warming the
surface prior to spraying is recommended but if a gas flame is used care
has to be taken to ensure that surface oxidation and contamination do not
occur in the process.
Oil holes and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>keyways   on the surface to be treated
should be plugged with moulded rubber or carbon insets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When spraying steel and other metals, particularly molybdenum, the
bright spray is liable to strain the eyes of the operator and he should,
therefore, be provided with tinted glasses of the right shade and quality
(see<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:1802-1961”).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When spraying large quantities of metals of the copper group and
nickel, it will be necessary for the operator to protect the nose and mouth
by means of a respirator or by other suitable means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The shop where metal spraying is carried out should be airy and well
ventilated or provided with efficient dust removal and air circulation
facilities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  Spraying is done with a tool commonly known as the
metal spraying pistol or gun.
The motive power for the feeding of the
wire into the flame is provided usually by an air turbine in the pistol (or
an electric motor in some heavy duty pistols) geared down to drive rollers
which pull the wire into the pistol and feed it into the flame.
Suitable
means of adjustment of feed speed are also provided.
Compressed air is
also used as the propellent for the atomised molten particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An adequate supply of dry air free from traces of oil and at pressures
required for operating the tool efficiently should be arranged. In addition,
supplies of oxygen and the fuel gas that is recommended for theequipment
as well as ancillary equipment such as pressure regulators and hoses should
be available.
Fuel gases commonly used are acetylene and propane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of flowmeters for the oxygen and the fuel gas is recommended
since these assist in setting and maintaining correct spraying conditions
without difficulty.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Wires-The  wire to be used for spraying should be kept wound in
reels or spools and shall be free from kinks which hamper the smooth
feeding of the wire through the nozzle.<<HEADING_END>>

to low carbon
mild

a
higher

also
oxidises
excessively
during

<<PARAGRAPH>>Where

of
the

<<PARAGRAPH>>In treating shafts prepared by the grooving and knurling method,
after spraying the ends of the undercut sections, spraying should be
continued with the gun held at an angle of 45 degrees to the work for at
least<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fiye  passes in each direction in order to deposit metal under each
dovetail.
Subsequent procedure is the same as that for work prepared by
other methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In work prepared by method other than grooving and’knurling, after
the ends of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the  undercut sections are sprayed, the job should be completed
by spraying at right angles to the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The spraying process<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4. FINISHING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  General-  Sprayed deposits may be finished either by grinding or by
turning, the former method being preferred.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Grinding-  Finishing sprayed deposits by grinding requires no special
technique, normal grinding practice usually being followed.
Medium soft
wheels having vitrified bond with a No. 40 grit or soft ones with a N O . 60
grit, the abrasive being bauxite or silicon carbide, are generally recommen-
ded for the purpose ( see IS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>:  715<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1962*<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>).
When grinding sprayed metals,
the wheel glazes quickly and more frequent dressing may be found
necessary.
If fine grain wheels are used, clogging may/cause chatter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grinding wet is always preferred and the surface speed of the wheel
should be approximately 1800 to 1950<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>mlmin,  with the work turning at a
surface speed of25 to 30<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>infeed  should  be very  light. For
rough grinding an<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>infeed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>approximately<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.04  mm is used and as the job
approaches finished size this is reduced to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O-02  mm.
Two percent soluble<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>oil, clean and free from foreign matter is a suitable coolant.
The grinding _
wheel should never be allowed to remain immersed in the coolant, due to
the wheel absorbing moisture and thereby becoming unbalanced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In dry grinding on tool post<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>grinders,   wheel speeds are<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>usually,lower
by about 10 percent than for wet grinding. Keeping the  work smeared
with a light layer or machine oil helps in reducing the glazing of the wheel.
The tool post grinder used for finishing sprayed deposits should be of  a
robust type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Turning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  If turning has to be<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Resorted   to as the method of finishing,
tools tipped with tungsten carbide or high speed steel should be used. While
the shape of the tool is not critical, it has been found advantageous to have
the tool ground as shown in Fig. 7 and to the dimensions given in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
