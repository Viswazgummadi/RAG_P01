FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
(Part
IX)
was adopted
by the Indian
Stand-
ards Institution
on 25 September
1970,
after the draft
finalized
by
the
Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Soil stabilization
is the alteration
of any property
of a soil to improve
its engineering
performance.
There
are several methods
of stabilization
and these may be broadly
on the basis of treatment
given
to the soil (for
example,
dewatering
and compaction
)  ,  process
involved
(for
example,
thermal
and
electrical)
-and
on
additives
employed
(for
example,
asphalt and cement )  .
The
choice
of a particular
method depends on the
characteristics
of the problem
on hand.
For
studying
in the laboratory,
the methods and effects
of stabilization.
certain
standard
methods
of test
for the evaluation
of properties
of stabilized
soils and
their. analysis
are
required.
The required
standards
on methods
of test for stabilized
soils
are being
published
in parts.
This part (Part
IX ) lays down the method
for the determination
of the bituminous
stabilizer
content
of bitumen
and
tar stabilized
soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in this
field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The representative samples of the soil-bituminous stabilizer mixture,
obtained as in 5 containing
a known weight of water (a g)
[ which
shall be determined in accordance
with IS  :  4332 (Part 1X)-1967*]
shall
be weighed to the nearest 0.01 percent of the weight taken (tl’)
and
introduced into a wide-mouthed
metal bottle of appropriate
capacity.
Powdered silica gel shall be added to absorb water, the quantity being
equal to half the weight of water present.
In the case of fine-grained
soils, three steel balls shall then be placed in the bottle to assist in breaking
down the mix.
A volume of dichloromethane
measured to the nearest
0.5 percent of the volume taken ( V ml) shall be added to the soil in suffi-
cient quantity to obtain a solution containing 2 to 3 percent of stabilizer.
After insertion of the rubber stopper, the bottle shall be shaken for 30
minutes on the mechanical shaker in the  case  of fine-grained soils and for
60 minutes in the case of medium- and coarse-grained soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 A portion of the soil stabilizer solution so obtained shall be filtered
through the alumina or  porous  filter into the burette by the arrangement
shown in Fig. 2, or shall.be centrifuged.
If the solution is to he centrifuged,
the centrifuge tubes shall be tightly stoppered to avoid losses due to  evap-
ration.
Sufficient quantity of the solution ( v ml ) shall then be transferred
by means of a burette into 200 ml carbon dioxide flask, the weight of
which shall be known to the nearest 0.001 g, to give an estimated weight
of approximately 0.75-1.25
g of recovered
stabilizer.
If the first amount
obtained lies outside these limits another suitably adjusted portion of the
solution shall be taken.
The flask shall then be connected to the vacuum
line, the manometer and the reservoir, and placed in a water-bath main-
tained at 100°C (see Fig. 3).
The bulk of the solvent shall be evaporated
with the pressure reduced to 500 f 50 mm Hg, the flask being shaken
with
a rotary
motion
during
the
course
of the
evaporation.
For
complete removal of solvent one of the following procedures shall be
adopted  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

This pressure shall be maintained for
a  further 34  minutes.
The reduced pressure may conveniently be
obtained by a water filter-pump; if this is not available a suitable
mechanical
vacuum
pump
may be used, in which case the
following procedures shah be adopted  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bulk of the methylene chloride shall be distilled off before
connecting the flask to the vacuum line.
To ensure that
solvent vapour does not reach the pump, the flask shall be
connected to the pump through a reservoir consisting of a Rask
containing lubricating oil of medium viscosity, followed by a
tower containing activated carbon ( 1.4 mm to 780 microns).
The
procedure
subsequently
followed
shall be as given
in 6.2 (a) and(b).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 The flask shall be romoved from the water bath and air admitted
gently to the apparatus.
After wiping the tlaak, the last trace of dichloro-
methane shall be removed by means of a gentle air current.
The ilask
&ah then be cooled for 5 minutes in a desiccator and weighed to the
nearest 0901 g and the weight of recovered stabilizer ( Wr ) determined  by
diffbrence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4  Soluble  Portion  of htrtrrtd
Soil-A
test shall be carried out under
the same conditions on the untreated soil to determine the quantity (  W,g)
which  may be soluble in dichloromethane, and this shall be deducted from
the total soluble content of the stabilized soil.
Unless the soil has been
previously stabilized with bitumen, however, the soluble portion is  us~&ly
negligible and may be ignored.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>65  -1ubJe
Portion of Stibilizn
-  Bitumens are generally com-
pletely  soluble in dichloromethane, but some petroleum stabilizing oils may
contain .wax which is insoluble; similarly, certain naturally-occuring
bitu-
mens may contain insoluble mineral matter.
Refined tars also contam a
proportion
of material insoluble in dichloromethane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In such cases allowance shall be made for the insoluble portion in the
calculation of the total stabilizer content.
The insoluble matter shah be
determined
by dissolving a representative portion of the stabilizer in
dichloromethane and filtering through a Gooch or sintered silica crucible
or a filter paper.
The percentage of soluble stabilizer (P)
shall then he
calculated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The sample shall be warmed just sufficiently to facilitate breaking up, and
a representative portion (see Note ) obtained if possible by quartering, and
having the weight as indicated in Table 1, shall be weighed to the nearest
0.05 percent of the weight taken and transferred without loss to the filter
paper and. placed inside the gauze cylinder.
Alternatively, the cylinder
and its lining may be placed on the balance and the material weighed into
it.
The gauze cylinder shall then be placed inside the pot and 800-15OOml
ofthe solvent according to the size of the extractor, shall be poured over
the sample.
The cover shall be bolted on with the dried gasket in posi-
tion.
Water shall he added to the receiver up to or a little beyond the
lowest graduation and this quantity subsequently deducted from the total
volume of water collected.
After fixing the reflux condenser, heat shall be
applied to the pot and so adjusted as to avoid intense local heating, but at
the same time to ensure a steady reflex action of 2 to 5 drops per second
falling from the end of the condenser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE-
When quantity
for the te.st exceeds the capacity
of ,-‘re apparatus,
the
extraction
should be carried out in two operations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.2 Any water present in the sample will collect in the receiving tube,
while the solvent will fill the tube, flow back over the sample and drain
through the filter paper to the bottom of the pot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:4332(FartIX)-1970<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1’3.3  If water is removed from the receiver during the extraction,
in
order to obviate fire risk the gas flame should be extinguished before
doing this:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.3.1
Heating shall be continued until extraction is complete and water
ceases to collect in the receiver.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.4 The washed mineral aggregate,
virith its container,
shall then be
removed
and dried to constant
weight (see Note)
at a temperature of
lOO-120°C. The cylinder land contents shall be cooled in a desiccator before
weighing.
In order to correct for any fine material present in the solution
at the end of the test, the solvent shall be evaporated off, the residue
weighed, and a representative portion of it (between 2 g and 3 g) treated
witht he solvent and filtered through a sintered silica or glass  filtering
crucible
or filter paper
as in the determination
of insoluble matter
(see IS  :  1215-1958* )  .  In the case of materials containing natural asphalt or
high filler content the whole of the solution -at the end of the test should be
filtered or centrifuged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
Material
shall be deemed to be aF constant weight when the difference
between successive weighings at half-hourly intervals does not exceed @05percent.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14. CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.1  The soluble binder content S shall be calculated on the dry sample by
