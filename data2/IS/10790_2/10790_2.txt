<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part 2 ) was adopted
by the
Indian
Staudards
Institution
on 19 March
1984,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the Building
Materials
and
Components
Sampling
Sectional
Committee
had
been
~approvcd by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
has
been
prepared
with
a view
to unifying
the
quality
control-and
sampling
provisions
applicable
to all types of remforcing
steel
used
in
reinforced
concrete.
Some
broad
guidelines
regarding
the
provisions
for process control
have also been
indicated
besides
giving
an
objective
sampling
procedure
which
will
bc
helpful
in
large
scale
transactions.
0.3 Such process control
and sampling
procedures
will help in the develop-
ment of adequate
quality
assurance
system
in
the
manufacture
and
also
in assuring
adequate
protection
to the users against
poor
quality.
Further,
proper
quality
control
during
the process
of manufactur,:
would
substan-
tially
reduce
quality
fluctuations
of the various
characteristics
and
thus,
ensure supply
of uniform
quality
of reinforcing
steels. For effective
process
control,
the use of statistical
quality
control
techniques
is imperative
for
which helpful
guidance
may be obtained
from
IS  :  397 ( Part 1 J-1972*,
IS  :  397 ( Part 2 )-1975*
and
IS : 397 ( Part 3 )-1980*.
The
purchasing
organizations
need guidance
in economic
and effective sampling
inspection
of the  lots  of materials
being received
by
them
to evaluate
their
quality
before their
actual
use.
The
samplin g procedure
recommended
in this
standard
therefore
includes
provisions
both
for process
control
and
lot
inspection.
0.4 The prestressing
steel used in prestressed
concrete
is separately
covered
in Part 1 of this standard.
0.5 In reporting
the results of test or analysis,
if the final
value,
observed
or  calculated,
is  to be rounded
off, it shall be done
in accordance
witP
IS  :  2-1960t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Broad outlines
with regard to the controls
to be exercised  during the manu-
facturing
process have also been indicated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3. PROCESS
INSPECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The object of inspection by the purchaser is to ensure conformity
of
the material offered to him to  the specification
requirements,
whereas
the
inspection done by the manufacturer
during
the production
is not
only
to
ensure the conformity
to relevant
specifications,
but also
to maintain
overall uniform
quality For process control, the manufacturer
should test
representative
samples
of the material at regular
intervals
during
the
manufacture
to control the  quality
variation
at various
manufacturing
stages. The following inspection levels may serr’e as a guide for routine
control over the manufacturing
process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 10790 ( Part 2 ) - 1984<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  In case of producers
with their own melting
facilities,
the
routine
process control
on heat basis should
be
done
separately
for material
of
each

from
the heat. For this purpose
Table

<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  The manufacturer
should maintain
control
of various characteristics
of the reinforcing steel on the basis of the following considerations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1 Following an unsatisfactory
test result, the manufacturer
should
take all necessary steps to rectify the deficiencies and shortcomings
in the
process.
Products
which do not satisfy the requirements
are
to
be
segregated.
3.2.2 Results of the inspection
and testing should be recorded
and
evaluated statistically. The records may be preserved for adequate
period
of  time say 2 to 3 years so that they can be referred to in case of difficulties
and complaints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.1 The scrutiny of the test results may be carried
out with the
aid of statistical methods adopting the variables or attributes
approach
as
appropriate.
The variables approach shall normally be applied
for proof
stress;’ tensile strength. elongation, weight, dimensions, rolling and cutting
tolerances and chemical requirements.
The attributes
approach
might be
applied
in respect of bending test and visual characteristics.
For this
purpose,
reference may be made to IS  :  7200 ( Part 1 )-1974*, IS  :  7200
( Part 2 )-1975*,

of a lot to the
requirements of any specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1 When such
