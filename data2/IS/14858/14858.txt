<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
afterthe
draft finalized by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A series of Indian Standards
on methods of testing of cement
and concrete
have already been brought
out. It
has been
recognized
that reproducible
and repeatable
test results can be obtained
only with standard testing
equipment
capable of giving
the desired
level of accuracy;
therefore,
a series
of specifications
covering
the
requirements
of equipments
used for testing cement and concrete have also been brought out to encourage
their
development
and manufacture
in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been formulated
to cover requirements
of the compression
testing machine for testing concrete
and mortar. The Indian
Standard
which details the methods
of compressive
strength
test requiring
use of this
machine
is IS 516:1959
‘Method of test for strength of concrete’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of the standard,
due weightage
has been given to international
co-ordination
among
the
standards
and practices
prevailing
in different countries. Assistance
has also been derived from ASTM C 39-86
‘Standard
test methods
for compressive
strength of cylindrical
concrete
specimen’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the technical
committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard
is given
at
Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test of analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values ( revised )’. The number of significant
places retained
in
the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
