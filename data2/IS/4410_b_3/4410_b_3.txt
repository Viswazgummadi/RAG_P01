<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Part XI/Set
3 ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 28 March 1973,
after the draft fina!ized by the
Terminology
Relating
to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number of Indian Standards have already been printed covering
various aspects of river valley projects and a large number of standards are
in the process of formulation.
These standards include technical terms, the
precise definitions of which are required to avoid ambiguity in their inter-
pretation.
To achieve this end, this Institution
is bringing out IS  :  4410
‘  Glossary of terms relating to river valley projects ‘, which is being published
in parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Part XI covers the important field of hydrology which is a separate
science by itself.
In view ofthe vastness of this subject, it is proposed to cover
the subject in different sections.
Other sections in the series will be the
following:
Section 1
General terms
Section 2
Precipitation and runoff
Section 4
Hydrographs
Section 5
Floods
Section 6
Ground water
Section 7
Discharge measurements
Section 8
Quality of waters<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.
This has been lnet by deriving
assistance
from
the
following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
