<<HEADING level=3>>( First  Revision
)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  Scope -
Prescribes a method for determination
of ozone, residual in water and wastewaters.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Principle
-
Ozone
liberates
iodine
from potassium
iodide solution.
After immediate
acidifi-
cation, the liberated iodine is titrated
with standard sodium thiosulphate
with starch as indicator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.  Interference
-
Ozonated water may contain manganese dioxide,
ferric ion,
chlorine,
nitrite,
peroxide
and other
oxidation
products.
Avoid
their Interference
by passing ozone through
the
gaseous
phase
into
potassium
iodide
solution
for titration.
The stability
of ozone solution
decreases progressively
at increment
in temperature
above freezing and with each increment
in
pH above 3’0. The minimum
detectable
concentration
by this method is 30 pg/litre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Standard
Sodium Thiosulphate
-
0.1  M. Dissolve 25 g of sodium
thiosulphate
( NasS20a.
5H20 ) in 1 litre
freshly boiled distilled
water.
Standardize
against potassium
hydrogen
iodate or
potassium
dichromate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Dilute
proper
volume
( about 50 ml ) of
0-1
M solution
( 5.3 ) to 1 000 ml.
For accurate work, standardize
this also against potassium
hydrogen
iodate or potassium
dichromate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 Standard Iodine Solution
-
0.1  M. Dissolve
40 g of potassium
iodide in  25  ml of distilled
water. Add 13 g of resublimed
iodine and stir until dissolved.
Dilute
to one litre and standardize
against arsenite solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.1
Standard
iodine
solution -
0,005
M.
Dissolve
16 g of potassium
iodide
in little
distilled
water in a 1 litre volumetric
flask, add proper volume
of 0.1 M iodine
solution
and dilute
to mark. For accurate work, standardize
daily.
Store in a brown bottle or in the dark. Protect from
direct sunlight
and keep from contact with rubber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Sample Collection
-
Collect an 800 ml sample in a 1 litre gas washing
bottle,
Pass stream
of pure
air or nitrogen
through
the sample and through
an absorber containing
400 ml of potas-
sium iodide solution.
Continue for 5 to 10 minutes at a rate of 0.2 to 1-O litre/min
to insure
that
all ozone is swept from the sample and absorbed in potassium
iodide solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Titration
-  Transfer
potassium
iodide
solution
to a 1 litre
beaker,
rinse
absorber
and add
20 ml of 1 N sulphuric
acid to reduce pH below
2.0.  Titrate
with
0.005
M sodium thiosulphate
titrant
until yellow
colour of liberated
iodine is almost is discharged.
Add 4 ml of starch indicator
solution
and continue
titrating
carefully
but rapidly to the end point, at which
the blue colour just
disappears.
Long
contact
of iodine
and starch
develops
a blue
compound
that is difficult
to
decolourize.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Blank  Test -
Correct sample titration
result by determining
black contributed
by such reagent
impurities
as free iodine or iodate in potassium
iodide
or traces
of reducing
agents
that
might
reduce liberated
iodine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1
Take 400 ml of potassium
iodide solution,
20 ml of 1 N sulphuric
acid and 4 ml of starch
indicator
solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Perform whichever
of the following
blank titration
is applicable
:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If a blue
colour appears, titrate with 0.005 M sodium thiosulphate
to disappearance
of blue and record result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If no blue colour appears, titrate with

to disappearance
and record
the difference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ozone
is a potent
germicide.
It is also used as an oxidizing
agent for destruction
of organic
compounds
producing
taste and odour in water, for destruction
of organic colouring
matter and for
the oxidation
of reduced iron or manganese salts
to insoluble
oxides which can be precipitated
or
filtered
from the water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
