<<HEADING level=3>>Methads of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering ( Excluding River Valley Projects ) Sectional
Committee.
CED 94<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by the
Methods of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering ( Excluding River Valley Projects ) Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement
occupies a very important
place in the planning and execution
of any civil engineering
work from the time of f;rst estimates to the final completion and settlement
of payment in the project.
Methods followed for measurements
are not uniform and considerable
difl‘erence exists between the
practices follo\r cd by one construction
agency and the State Government
Departments.
While it is
recognised th:\t each system of measurment
has to be specifcally
related to the administratl.:e
and
financial
organiz:itions
within the Department
responsible for the work unification of the various
systems at technic:4
level has been accepted as very desirable specially as it permits
wider section
of operation
civil engineering
contractors
and elimmates ambiguties arising out of inadequate under-
standing of various system followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement of earth work basically related to the manual method of excavation,
carriage and filling
is covered
in Part 1. With the advent
of machinery
for this operation,
many lacunae
in the
methodology
for the measurement have become apparent
and thus necessity has been felt to formulate

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of measurement,
shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS 2:1960 ‘Rules fo
rounding
off numerical
values  C revised ).’
The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in cubic meters unless otherwise mentioned.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1 The lead for fiilling and removal
shall be
measured
over the specified route

the measurement of the excavation
shall be recor-
ded for the entire excavation.
Excavated material
of ordinary
rock shall
be
stacked,
separately
measured and reduced by 50 percent

voids to arrive at quantity payable under ordinary
rock. The difference between the entire excavation
and dome of the quantity payable under ordinary
rock shall be payable
as excavation
in ordinary
soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

volume of
work done shall be worked out from filling. The
actual measurement of the fill shall be calculated
after taking the levels of the original
grounds
be-
fore start of the work after site clearance
and
after compaction
of fill at the
desired density
which should be specified in advance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
