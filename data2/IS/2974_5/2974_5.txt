<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Part !? ) ( First
Revision
) was, adopted
by
the
Bureau
of
Indian Standards on 26 September
1987, after
the draft finalized by the Foundation
Engineer-
ing Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard was first published
in 1970.
This
revision
has been
prepared
based
on
general experience gained in the implementa-
tion of this standard in the past 15 years. The
principal
modifications
made
in this revision
are deletion of elevator and hoist tower struc-
tures ( which do not fit into the
scope of this
code ), and inclusion of provisions for the foun-
dations for jolters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The installation
of
machines
and equip-
ments such as forging, sheet
metal and stamp-
ing presses, pig breakers
and jolters
involves
careful design of their foundations
taking
into
consideration
the impact
and related
vibration
characteristics
of the load and the condition of
the soil on which the foundation
rests. While
many of the special features
relating to design
and construction
of such
machine
foundations
will have to be as advised by the manufacturers
of these machines,
still most of the details will
have to be according to the general
principles
of design.
This standard lays down the general
principles of planning and design of reinforced

with IS  :  2-

equal

<<PARAGRAPH>>and designed and placed in accordance
with
IS  :  456-1978*.
Concrete
should be specified
on the basis of 28 days cube strength and shall
be of grade not less than M-20.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 The concrete used should be of plastic con-
sistency
without excessive
water.
A  slump  of
5 to 8 cm is allowable.
The
same
consistency
should be
maintained
throughout
the con-
creting.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Continuous concreting
should be done as
far as possible for the entire block leaving pro-
visions for grouting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6  Pig Breakers
or Scrap Breakers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1  Hammers inducing very high impact
energy should be located, as
far as
possible,
from other structures susceptible
to vibration,
namely
laboratory
buildings,
shops, housing
precision equipment and complete process lines,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 If a construction
joint is unavoidable,
the
plane of joint shou1.d be horizontal
and measu-
res should be taken to ensure perfect
bond at
the joint.
Reinforcement
should be continuous
across the joint.
Before placing the new layer
of concrete, the previously
laid surface should
be roughened, thoroughly cleaned and washed
by a jet of water and then
covered by a layer
of rich 1:2 cement grout 2-cm thick.
Concrete
should be placed
not later than 2 hours after
the grout is laid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.2
The foundation for crushing platform
should preferably be designed as a hollow cyli-
nder or hollow
cup and made of RCC
and
filled with well compacted
sand.
and scrap
ingots to increase the crushing efficiency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.3
The crushing anvil may also be placed
on RCC block in a rectangular
or circular well.
Block foundation
under
the anvil
should be
made of richer concrete and suitably reinforced
to withstand the high impact energy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 Grouting of the machine bed plate and the
pockets of anchor
bolts should be done in a
condnuous operation.
The surfaces
should be
thoroughly
cleaned
prior
to
grouting.
All
exposed surfaces should be made
rough so as
to secure good bond with the fresh concrete.
Cement
grout
with
non-shrinkage
additive
should be used for purpose of grouting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.4
Timber battens should
be suspended
on hinges from a metallic
ring installed
above
the wall and tied to each other at places
by a
rope so that they can intercept the flying chips.
Rubber lining
may also be provided
at the
inner face for the same purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 All units of foundation should be provided
with reinforcements
both ways and amount
of
reinforcement
should be not less than 25 kg/ms
of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7  Jolters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7.1  Block
foundations
supporting
jolter
tables often used in foundry-forge
plants
are
designed
following
the
procedure
outlined
in 4.4.
The moving weight in a jolter installa-
tion
is the total
weight
of the jolter
table
together with the charge on it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7 The minimum diameter
of bar should be
12 mm and the maximum
spacing 200 mm in
order to take care
of shrinkage
in concrete.
Unless specified otherwise,
the concrete
cover
for the protection
of reinforcement
should be
a minimum of 75 mm thick at the bottom and
50 mm thick on the sides and top.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
