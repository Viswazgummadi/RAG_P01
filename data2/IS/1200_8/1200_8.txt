<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering (Excluding River Valley Projects)
Sectional Committee, CED 44<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 8) (Fourth Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by the Methods of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering (Excluding
River Valley Projects) Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement occupies a very important place in planning and execution of any civil engineering
work from the time of first estimates to final completion and settlement of payments of the project.
The methods followed for measurement are not uniform and considerable differences exist
between practices followed by one construction agency and another and also between various
Central and State Government departments. While it is recognized that each system of
measurement has to be specifically related to the administrative and financial organizations
within the department responsible for work, a unification of the various systems at technical level
has been accepted as very desirable, specially as it permits a wider circle of operation for civil
engineering contractors and eliminates ambiguities and misunderstandings arising out of
inadequate understanding of various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Among the various civil engineering items, measurement of buildings had been first to be taken up
for standardization and this standard having provisions relating to all building works, was first
published in 1958 and was subsequently revised in 1964. In its second revision, the standard was
issued in different parts corresponding to different trades in building and civil engineering works.
As a result, the second revision of this standard (Part 8) was published in 1967 which was then
revised in 1974.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This fourth revision has been brought out to incorporate the changes found necessary in the light
of usage of this standard and suggestions made by various bodies implementing it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 5.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (May 2002). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
