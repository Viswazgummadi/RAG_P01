<<PARAGRAPH>>Terminology
Relating to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee,
RVD 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by the
Terminology
Relating
to River Valley Projects
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the River
Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A large number of Indian Standards have already been printed covering various aspects of river valley
projects
and some more similar standards
are in the process of formulation.
These standards include
technical
terms, and precise definitions for these are required for avoiding ambiguity in their interpreta-
tion.
To achieve
this aim, the terminology
relating to River Valley Projects
Sectional
Committee
is
bringing out Indian Standard
Glossary
of terms relating to river valley projects
( IS 4410 ),
published in parts. This part 12 contains definitions of terms relating to temporary
diversion works.
being<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The revision of this standard was first published in 1973. The present revision of the standard has been
taken
up in the light of the experience
gained during the last 20 years in the use of this standard.
In
this revision, additional terms have been added besides modifying
some of the terms so as to bring them
in line with latest
technology.
Some of the terms not concerning
this subject
have been transferred
to the relevant parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to international
co-ordination
among
the  standards and practices
prevailing in different countries.
This has been met by deriving considerable
assistance from  ‘  Multilingual technical
dictionary
on irrigation
and drainage ‘, published
by Interna-
tional Commission on Irrigation
and Drainage ( ICID ) and other sources.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
