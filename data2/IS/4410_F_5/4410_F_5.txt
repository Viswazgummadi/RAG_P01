<<PARAGRAPH>>Glossary of Terms Relating to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee, RVD 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘This Indian Standard ( Part lS/Sec 5 ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft finalized by the Terminology
Relating to River Valley Projects Sectional Committee
had been
approved by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A number of Indian Standards have been published covering various aspects of river valley projects
and a large number of similar standards are in the process of formulation.
These standards include
technical terms, the precise definitions of which are required to avoid ambiguity in their interpreta-
tion.
To achieve this end, the Bureau is bringing out this glossary of terms relating to river valley
projects ( IS 4410 ) which is being published in parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This part ( Part 15 ) covers the important field of canal structures and in view of the vastness
of
this subject, it is covered in six different sections.
Other sections in the series are as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Section 1
General terms<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Section 2
Transitions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Section 3
Flumes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Section 4
Regulating works<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Section 6
Other structures<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard ( Part 15/Set 5 ) was first published in 1977.
Due to the information
received
from
various
states it was found necessary to revise this standard.
The terminology
as given in this
standard has been finalized by the Cross Drainage Works Sectional Committee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
