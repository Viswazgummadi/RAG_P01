<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Flooring, Wall Finishing and Roofing Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pitch-mastic has proved to be a suitable surfacing material for bridge decks, bus stops and roads. The ability of
pitch-mastic to absorb shocks and vibrations, to self-heal cracks and to prevent bleeding, makes it suitable for
selection as a surfacing material. But in places where abundant fuel oil drippings are expected, the use of pitch-
mastic as a surfacing material is not desirable.
This standard was first published in 1969. In this revision,
Table 1 has been revised in view of better suitability of harder grade bitt!men for use in pitch-mastic surfacing
specially where pavement temperature exceeds 50”C in summer months.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision besides certain editorial changes, the anti-skid properties of pitch-mastic have been strengthened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given at Amex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed
or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
1S2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (rewked)’. The number of significant places retained in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The manufacture of pitch-mastic consists of two stages.
The first stage shall be mixing of filler and fine
aggregates
and then heating
the mixture
to a
temperature of 170 to 205”C. Required quantity of
bitumen shall be heated to 170 to 180°C and added to
the aggregate. They shall be mixed and cooked in
mechanically agitated mixer called mastic cooker for
2 to 3 h until the materials are thoroughly mixed.
During mixing, care shall be taken to ensure that the
contents in the cooker are at no time heated to a

each of pitch-mastic shall be taken at intervals during
the discharge of the mixer. The specimen shall include
portions taken at beginning or at the end of discharge
except in cases where the practice of returning to the
mixer,
the first and last portions
discharged,
is
followed. The portions shall then be thoroughly mixed
at a temperature of 150to 205 “C. The mixed discharge
shall be floated out on an iron plate with the aid of a
wooden float to a thickness not less than 25 mm. While
still warm the specimen shall be loosened from the
plate and a representative portions weighing not less
than 5 kg if ungritted (without coarse aggregate) and
not less than 10 kg if gritted (with coarse aggregate)
shall be forwarded to the laboratory for examination
with full particulars as given in 7.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  The second stage shall consist of the incorporation
of the coarse aggregates. When the pitch-mastic is to
be transported directly to the site of work, a quantity
of coarse aggregate 6 to 20 mm normal size to form
not less than  30  percent and not more than 50 percent
by mass of the final mixture
shall be added and
thoroughly incorporated with the mastic in the cooker.
The actual percentage of the coarse aggregates to be
added
shall
be specified
according
to design
requirements. When the material has been cast into
blocks, these shall be reheated in the cooker to a
temperature of not less than 170”C and not more than
205°C and the coarse aggregate as mentioned before
shali be thoroughly incorporated in the mastic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  Blocks<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Material in block form shall be sampled by taking
approximately equal amounts in pieces from not less
than 6 blocks taken at random. The total specimen of
not less than 5 kg if ungritted and not less than 10 kg
if gritted shall be forwarded to the laboratory
for
examination with fill particulars as given in  6.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1 As an anti-skid measure, the pitch-mastic after
spreading and while still hot and in plastic condition
shall be covered with a layer of coarse/Carborundum
aggregate 12 to 20 mm size depending on thickness of
mastic layer at the rate of about 2 to 13 kg/m2or about
0.15 to 0.2 m2per 100m2.Anti-skid properties of newly
laid mastic shall be ensured by running
a pump
integrator. The coarse aggregate prior to application
shall be coated with 2 to 3 percent by weight of
S95 or S65 grade of paving bitumen and 2 to 3 percent
tiller. The coarse aggregate shall be rolled or otherwise
pressed into the surface of mastic layer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
