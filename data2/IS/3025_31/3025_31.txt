<<PARAGRAPH>>1.  Scope -
Prescribes
two
methods
for
determination
of phosphorus,
namely
(a) vanadomolyb-
do -
phosphoric
acid method;
and (b) stannous
chloride
method..In
case of difference
of opinion,
vanadomolybdo
-
phosphoric
acid method shall
be the referee
method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.  Preliminary Digestion Steps<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Phosphorus
analysis
involves
the conversion
of the
phosphorus
present. in water
in different
forms to dissolved
orthophosphate
which
is then estimated
calorimetrically.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1 For  acid hydrolyzable
phosphates
-
To 100 ml of sample
or a portion
diluted
to 100 ml, add
0’05 ml phenolphfhalein.
If a red colour
develops,
add strong
acid dropwise
to just
discharge
the
colour,
then add 1 ml more. Boil
gently
for 90 minutes
at least,
adding
distilled
water
to keep the
volume
between
25 and 50 ml. Alternatively,
heat for 30 minutes
in an autoclave
or pressure
cooker
at 98 to 137 kPa. Cool,
neutralize
to a faint
pink colour
with sodium
hydroxide
solution
and restore
to original
100 ml volume
with distilled
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2  For total phosphorus<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2.1 Perchloric
acid
digestion
-
Measure
sample
containing
the
desired
amount
of phos-
phorus
into a 125-ml Erlenmeyer
flask. Acidify
methyl
orange with concentrated
nitric
acid, add 5 ml
excess of nitric
acid and evaporate
on a steam bath or hot
plate to 15 to 20 ml.
Add 10 ml each of
Concentrated
nitric
acid- and perchloric
acid to the 125-ml conical
flask,
cooling
the flask
between
additions.
Add a few boiling
chips,
heat
on
a hot plate,
and evaporate
gently
until
dense
white
fumes of perchloric
acid
just
appear.
If solution
is not clear, cover neck of the flask with a watch
glass and keep solution
barely boiling
until
it clears.
If necessary,
add IO ml more
of nitric
acid
to aid oxidation.
Cool digested
solution
and
add
one
drop
of aqueous
phenolphthal&in
solution.
Add
6 N sodium
hydroxide
solution
until
the
solution
just
turns
pink. If necessary,
filter
neu-
tralized
solution
and
wash
filter
liberally
with
distilled
water.
Makeup
to 100 ml with distilled
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2.2  Sulphoric
acid-nitric
acid digestion
-
Into
a micro
kjeldahl
flask,
measure
a sample
containing
the desired
amount
of
phosphorus.
Ad.d 1 ml of concentrated
sulphuric
acid and 5 ml
of concentrated
nitric
acid. Digest to a volume
of 1 ml and then continue
until
solution
becomes
colourless
to
remove nitric
acid. Cool
and add
approximately
20 ml of distilled
water,
0’05 ml of
phenolphthalein
indicator
and
as much
1 N sodium
hydroxide
solution
as required
to
produce
a
faint
pink tinge.
Transfer
neutralized
solution,
filtering,
if necessary,
to remove turbidity
or parti-
culate
matter,
into a 100 ml volumetric
flask.
Add
filter
washings
to the flask and
adjust
sample
volume
to 100 ml with distilled
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2.3  Persulphate
digestion
method -
Use 50 ml or a suitable
portion
of thoroughly
mixed
sample.
Add C’q5 ml of phenolphthalein
indicator
solution.
If a red’colour
develops,
add
sulphuric
acid solution
dropwise
to just
discharge
the colour.
Then
add 1 ml of sulphuric
acid
solution
and
either 0’4 g solid
ammonium
persulphate
or 0.5 g of
solid
potassium
persulphate.
Boil
gently
on a
preheated
hot plate for 30 to 40 minutes
or until
a final volume
of 10 ml is reached.
Cool,
dilute
to
30 ml with distilled
water,
add
0.05 ml of
phenolphthalein
indicator
solution,
and neutralize
to a
faint pink colour
with 1 N sodium
hydroxide
solution.
Make
up to 100 ml with distilled
water.
In
some samples,
a precipitate
may form at this stage, but do not filter.
For any
subsequent
subdivi-
sion of the sample,
shake well.
The
precipitate
redissolves
under
the
acidic
conditions
of the
calorimetric
reactive
phosphorus
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3. Vanadomolybdo
-
Phosphoric
Acid Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Principle
-
In
dilute
orthophosphate
solution,
ammoni urn
molybdate
reacts
under
acid
conditions
to form a hetropoly
acid, molybdo
-
phosphoric
acid.
In presence
of vanadium,
yellow
vanadomolybdo
-
phosphoric  acid
is formed.
The
intensity
of yellow
colour
is proportional
to
phosphate
concentration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Interference
-
Positive
interference
is caused
by silica
and arsenate
only,
if the sample
is
heated,
Arsenate,
fluoride,
thorium,
bismuth,
sulphide,
thiosulphate,
thiocyanate
or excess
molyb-
date cause
negative
interference.
Ferrous
iron results
in blue
colour
and
does
not
affect
the
results,
if the concentration
is less than 100 mg/l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

anhydrous
potassium
dihydrogen
phosphate
( K&PO,
) in distilled
water
and
dilute
to  1 990 ml, 1 ml = 50 pg orthophosphate
phosphorus.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 Procedure -
If the sample
pH Is greater
than 10, add.0.05 ml of
phenolphthalein
indicator
to
50-O ml of sample and discharge
the red c&our
with f : I hydrochloric
acid before diluting
to 100 ml.
Remove
excessive
colour
in sample
by shaking
about
50 ml with
200 mg of activated
carbon
in
an Erierimeyer
flask for 5 mfnutes
and filter
to remove carbon.
Place
35 ml or less of sample,
con-
taining
0.05 to 1’0 mg of phosphorus
(P), in a 50-ml volumetric
flask. Add 10 ml vanadate-molybdate
reagent
and dilute
to the mark with
distilled
water.
Prepare
a blank
in which
35 ml of distilled
water
is substituted
for the
sample.
After
IO minutes
or more,
measure
absorbance
of sample
versus
blank
at a wavelength
of 470 nm. The colour
is- stable for
days
and is not
affected
by
variation
in room
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prepare
a calibration
curve
by using
suitable
volumes
of standard
phosphate
solution
and
proceeding
as given
above. Read the concenfration
of the sample from the calibration
curve for the
given absorbance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6  Calculation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Phosphorus
(P), mg/l = r
X 1 000<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>m =  mg of phosphorus
( in 50 ml of final volume
), and
v = volume in ml of sample.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  Stannous’Chloride
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Principle
-
The molybdo-phosphoric
acid formed is reduced to an intensely
coloured
complex
molybdenum
blue by stannous
chloride.
This method
is significantly
sensitive
and the reliability
of
the method increases
at concentrations
below 0’1 mg/l of phosphorus
with minimum
interference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Interference
-
Silica
and
arsenic
interfere
positively,
if
the
sample
is heated.
Arsenate,
fluoride,
sulphide,
thiosulphate,
thiocyanate
or
excess
molybdate
cause
negative
inter-
ference.
Ferrous
iron
which
causes
blue
colour
does not affect the
result
if the cencenfration
is below 100 mg/l. If nitric
acid is used in the test, chloride
interferes
at 75 mg/l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1 The minimum
detectable
concentration
by this method
is about 3 pg/I of phosphorus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Phosphorus
occurs in natural
waters
and wastewaters
almost
solely as phosphates.
These are
classified
as orthophosphates,
condensed
phosphates
( pyro, meta and other polyphosphates
) and
organically
bound
phosphates.
Phosphorus
analyses
embody
two
general
procedural
steps,
namely, conversion
of the phosphorus
form of interest
to dissolved
orthophosphate
and the colori-
metric determination
of dissolved
phosphorus.
Separation
of phosphorus
into its various
forms
is
defined
analytically.
Filtration
through
a 0.45 pm pore diameter
filter
separates
dissolved
phospho-
rus from suspended
forms of
phosphorus.
Phosphates
that
respond
to calorimetric
tests without
preliminary
hydrolysis
or oxidative
digestion
of the samples
are known as reactive
phosphorus.
Reactive
phosphorus
is largely
a measure of orthophosphate,
a small fraction
of any condensed
phos-
phate present
may also be hydrolyzed
unavoidably.
Reactive
phosphorus
occurs
in both dissolved
and suspended
forins.
Acid hydrolysis
at boiling
water
temperature
converts
dissolved
and parti-
culate
condensed
phosphates
to dissolved
orthophosphate.
The
phosphate
fractions
that
are
converted
to orthophosphate
only by oxidation
destruction
of organic
matter present are considered
as
organic
or organically
bound phosphorus.
Like reactive
and acid hydrolyzable
phosphorus,
organic
phosphorus
occurs
in both dissolved
and
suspended
fractions.
Total
phosphorus
as well
as the
dissolved
and
suspended
phosphorus
fractions
each
may
be divided
analytically
into
three
chemical
types,
namely,
reactive,
acid hydrolyzable
and organic
phosphorus.
In the preparation
of
this standard,
considerable
assistance
has
been
derived
from Standard
