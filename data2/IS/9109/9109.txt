<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision)
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Fire Safety Sccttional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Paint and varnish factories present considerable
fire risk in most of the processes and storage areas. Presence of
dense acid smoke, toxic fumes, explosion hazards, slippery floors, chances ofboil over, burning liquids travelling
long distances and involving
other areas are some of the peculiar features of fires in such industries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hazards of fire and explosion in factories manufacturing
and storing paints and varnishes may be considerably
lowered by adoption
of certain pre-determined
safety measures with regard to proper planning
of building,
choice of proper materials and components,
electrical equipment and making suitable provision
for fire fighting
arrangements,
etc. This standard has therefore been formulated
to give necessary
guidance
in this respect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published
in 1979. This revision incorporates
some new clauses pertaining
to process
safety provisions,
fire protection arrangements
and outdoor storage of paint/varnish
with flammable
liquid base
in containers
and portable tanks, in addition to modifications
in various clauses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard ~due weightage
has been given to international
co-ordination
among the
standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the technical committee responsible
for the formulation
of this standard is given at Annex 9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
oi this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules
for rounding off numerical values  (revised)‘.  The number of significant
places retained in the rounded off value
should be the same as that of the specified values in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
