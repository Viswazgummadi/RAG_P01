<<HEADING level=1>>CODE OF PRACTICE FOR
FIRE SAFETY OF INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS:
ALUMINIUM(MAGNESIUM
POWDER FACTORIES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>(  First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>details of construction,
fire safety and equipment
have been formulated.
This revision has, there-
fore, been prepared so as to keep details of cons-
truction and use of fire fighting equipment accord-
ing to the latest codes. Since magnesium powder
factories
are also having similar type of hazard,
the scope of this standard has now been enlarged
to cover such types of factories as well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard ( First Revision ) was
adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards on
7 June 1988, after the draft
finalized by the Fire
Safety Sectional Committee has been approved by
the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The main causes of explosions
and fires in
production
and/or
storage
of aluminium
and
magnesium powders are bad house keeping,
con-
gestion, improper electrical equipment, spark from
foreign material in the stock, friction
and static
electricity.
In order to prevent and reduce losses
due to fires and explosions, it is necessary to plan
carefully the layout of the buildings
and provide
adequate and suitable fire fighting equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose
of deciding whether a parti-
cular requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed or calculated, ex-
pressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be
rounded off in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*. The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard
was first published
in
1967
covering aluminium power factories.
Since then,

It should be so located as to be
easily accessible for fire fighting.
The premises
should be enclosed
by a secure
fencing or com-
pound wall and guarded,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard lays down the essential require-
ments for fire safety of factories in which powders
of aluminium,
magnesium
and their
alloys are
manufactured
and/or stored.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The factory buildings should at least be 100 m
distant
from a public building,
dwelling,
ware-
house or manufacturing
establishment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Ignition of aluminium, magnesium and allied
powders
in buildings
free from the presence of
any ostensible
means of ignition
may occur due
to electrification
of the particles, facilitated by the
relatively
low energy
required.
The
metallic
nature of aluminium and
magnesium powders is
not effective in extinguishing the potentials set up
within a dust cloud since these powders behave as
insulators.
The risk of explosion
shall, therefore,
always be faced and precautions
shall be taken in
the design of the plant to confine its hazards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 The factory buildings should at least be 150 m
away from a railway
siding, yard or
lines, pre-
ferably on the windward
side of the tracks.
If
these tracks are serviced
by diesel or electric
locomotives,
the distance
may be reduced
to
30 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 The factory
building should at least be 20 m
away from high tension lines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  COMPOUNDS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The compounds
should be of sufficient area
to house all the buildings
specified in 5.1 and to
allow for future expansion
and should be kept
clear of all combustible
material, such as grass,
weeds and other vegetation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  LOCATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  To prevent and reduce possible damage from
explosion
or fire or from both to nearby and the
community,
the factory should have enough open<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_3>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16  :  4226 - 1988<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  The area should be such as to
accommodate
necemary
pave or percca roads in between
the
different
buildings
to allow free movement for
fire fighting and rescue operations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fire resisting materials
throughout
and the build-
ings should be so designed that every internal
surface is readily accessible to facilitate cleaning.
In all buildings, walls of rooms
where metal dust
may be produced and which are not of monolithic
construction,
all masonry joints
should of tho-
roughly
flushed
with
mortar
and
trowelled
smooth so as to leave no interior or exterior voids
for the infiltration and accumulation
of the pow-
ders. Entry of water into the building and com-
ing into contact
with the powders
should
be
prevented,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. BUILDING
CONSTRUCTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.  STORAGE
AND PRECAUTIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.11.4 Where explosion risk is involved,
win-
dows should be fitted with  3  mm thick glass. They
should be top hinged or pivoted so as to open
outwards and should be provided with devices to
prevent
opening
due to wind a.ction but should
be capable
of opening
if an explosion occurs.
Wired glass should not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Storage
of powder
should
be in a separate
building other than the powder making building..<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The powder
should
be packed
as soon as
possible
in non-sparking
drums which
should
then be tightly sealed and stored in a dry place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 In no case should the powder
be stored,in
open bins or gunny bags,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.11.5 Where
fixed sash windows
are used in
powder
plant
building,
light anchorage
only
should be used so that the whole windows blow
out during an explosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 No other material should be stored along with
powder as fire fighting methods for such materials
are different
from those involving metallic pow-
ders or dust.
Moreover,
such materials
could
serve as a source of ignition
for the metallic
powders.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.11.6 The bottom
of windows
should be at
least 2.2 m above the floor level to deflect the full
force of an explosion above worker‚Äôs heads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.11.7 Each room
should have at least two
separated exits to corridors or to the outside.
All
openings should open to the outside to enable the
workmen to escape in the event of fire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 There should be no leakage from roof, pipe
lines, etc, into the storage area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6 All machines should be suitably gauged that
no temperature
in the area rises beyond 35¬∞C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12  Roofs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.1  Roofs
should
be
directly
supported
from wall without
any intermediate
columns or
posts. The roof covering
should
he as light as
possible but should be fire resistant. If roofs are
covered
with corrugated iron sheets, they should
be either
galvanized
or painted with aluminium
paint,
and cast iron or mild steel open grills
should be inserted
along the lower edges of the
roof near the walls at intervals of 6 m to facilitate
entry through
the roof for fire fighting purposes.
If underside of roof is to be painted,
only non-
flammable paint should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  MACHINERY
AND EQUIPMENT<<HEADING_END>>

delay action so adjusted that the mill should cease
rotating before the door can be opened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.2 Roofs should be leak-proof and no pip-
ing and other
equipment
should be supported
from roofing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.3 Wherever
roof is planned
as a part of
explosion
venting
methods,
it should be of
fragile material
and should
be fixed in such a
way that the same can be blown away by an
explosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 Where aluminium/magnesium
powder is pro-
duced by ‚Äòblowing‚Äô,
unit should be enclosed in a
strong chamber
prefertbly
situated
in the open.
The discharge
valve should be interlocked with
the blowing
mechanism
to ensure that it cannot
be opened when blowing is in progress
Where a
cyclone is installed
to receive the discharge, it
should be connected to a hopper through a valve
which should be interlocked with the discharge
valve from the hopper
to ensure
that the valves
are not open simultaneously.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.4 At least 10 percent of the roof should be
covered with fragile
materials
capable
of giving
way in case of explosions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7 Sparks
caused by ferrous
matter
passing
through
cleaning,
processing
and
grinding
machines should be prevented by installing mag-
nets  or  magnetic separators in the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.15 Conveyor ducts should be designed and ins-
talled to avoid condensation
of moisture
within
the ducts
and means should
be provided

thoroughly
dry out the ducts before putting into
service after a period of idleness. Drying of ducts
should
be done thoroughly
with warm dry air
several hours before resuming operations.
Wher-
ever possible, ducts should be inclined to horizon-
tal to facilitate cleaning, drying and draining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8 Dust collecting
system consisting
of suitable
hoods,
enclosures,
ducts, dust collectors,
etc,
should be installed.
These should
be of metal
construction.
Hoods should be so designed that
the powder
particles
either
fall or to projected
into them in the direction
of the air flow. The
interior of the hoods and ducts should be smooth
with internal lap joints pointing into the direction
of the air-flow
and having no
dead end spaces
which may allow accumulation
of dust.
Hand
holes with metallic
covers should
be provided
throughout
the ducting at regular interval to faci-
litate cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.16 Wherever
possible,
relief vents of sufficient
area extending
to the outside
of the building
should be provided in the ducts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.17 Wherever
damage may result from the rup-
ture of a duct,
in case the relief vent does offer
sufficient relief, the duct should be designed for a
working pressure of at least 0‚Äô7 MN/m2 (~7 kgf/
cm‚Äô).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.9 All such ducting
should
be continuous and
properly earthed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.10. The
motors
driving
the
dust producing
machines
should be electrically
interlocked with
the fan motors of the dust conveying system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18 Blades and housing
of fans used either for
dust collection
system or conveyance
of magne-
sium/aluminium
powder should
be of non-spark-
ing material.
The intercepting
screen cloth filter
should be properly grounded and the duct design-
ed so as to prevent
passage of dust into the fan.
Whenever
possible,
fans into which dust may
enter should
be placed outside the dust making
building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.11 Dust collectors
should
be arranged to pre-
vent contact
of dust with high speed moving
parts while still in the dry state. Grinding opera-
tion should not be served by same collectors as
buffing and polishing
operations.
Dust from dry
collectors
and sludge from
the wet collectors
should be removed
daily or more often as the
conditions may require.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.19 All dust making machines
and conveyors
should be so constructed as to minimize escape of
dust into the rooms
and all such
equipment
should be properly
earthed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.12 Sludge so removed should be transported in
covered
non-combustible
containers
of not over
25 kg each and should be disposed off by any of
t.he following means:
a)
Mixing with much larger volume of sand
and discarding
in a dump,
bj
Dumping in an open pit which should be
fenced or guarded
from public
access,
and
c)
Spreading over the ground in an isolated
area fenced or guarded from public access
where the sludge can oxidize.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. ELECTRICAL
INSTALLATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 The electrical installation should be in accord-
ance with IS  :  1646-1982* and special attention

of the electrical
circuits so that
the current for lighting and power in any
dust making building may be switched off
by switches outside the building at a dis-
tance
of 1‚Äô25 m from outside the nearest
doorway.
Provision
should also he made
for switching
off the whole factory by
switches located
at one or more central
points, such as the office and the watch-
men‚Äôs booth; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.14 When
aluminium/magnesium
powder
is
conveyed
pneumatically,
the
conveyor
ducts
should
be of non-ferrous
material.

ARRANGEMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  Provision
of first aid appliances and their
maintenance
should
be
in
accordance
with
IS  :  2190-1979*.
All
the
workers
should
be
trained and periodically
practiced
in the use of
first aid fire fighting appliances placed near their
place of work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.8 The whole of the electric power in
the
effected building should be immediately cut off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.9 If the metallic powder is burning quietly in
a place where it can be safely isolated, the same
should be carefully ringed around but nor drop-
ped on the burning powder, great care being taken
to avoid fanning the dust into the air.
The pow-
der when burning
quietly
forms
a crux which
excludes and gradually
extinguishes
itself.
As
soon as the fire is isolated,
the room should be
closed, windows
shut, the bottom
of the doors
sealed with sand and the fire allowed to burn
itself out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 The factory
should
be equipped
with a
warning
system for fire so that the warning is
clearly
audible
throughout
the factory
and the
compound.
The appliance or appliances for giving
such warning
or means of operating the same
should be located in conspicuous
positions and
should be painted fire red. All workers should be
familiar
with
their
location
and
method
of
operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.10 Close  liaison should be maintained with the
neighbouring fire brigades
to ensure quick atten-
dance in time of emergencies.
The hazards invol-
ved in the use of water jets, carbon
dioxide,
foam or other liquids not allowed to deal with the
fire involving
metallic
powders and
also
the
special hazards relating
to metallic
dust should
be explained to them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3 All factories
which do not have their own
fire brigade
or do not expect major fire fighting
assistance
from
regular
fire brigades
within a
short time, should
make suitable fire fighting
arrangements
with the help of workers.
