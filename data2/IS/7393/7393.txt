paper
bags,
cartons,
preparation
of bituminized
paper and for bonding
hessian
with kraft
paper or polyethylene.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated
express-
ing  the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS : Z-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
covers the requirements
and methods of sampling and

metallic
roller or a 10 kg mass on the cemented
surface
five times.
Allow the specimen
toage

temperature
without
any applied
pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of the
same
batch
of manufacture,
shall
constitute a lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-2.1.1
Samples shall be tested for each lot for ascertaining
conformity
of the material
to the requirements
of the specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-2.2 The number of containers
(n) ~to be selected from a lot shall depend
on the size of the lot (JV) and shall be in accordance
with co1 1 and 2 of
Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-2.2.1
The
containers
shall
be selected
at random
and in order to
ensure the randomness of selection, a random number table shall be used.
In case such a table
is not available,
the following procedure
may be
adopted:
Starting
from any container,
count them in one order as 1,2,
3  ) . . .  up to r and
so
on,
where
Y  is the integral
part of .W/n

or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-3.2
After
the contents
are thoroughly
mixed,
a small representative

implement
from each of the containers
selected
according
to F-2.2 (the
approximate
quantity
of material
to be drawn from a container
shall
be thrice the quantity
required for the tests indicated
in 3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-3.3
In case a thorough mixing by shaking or stirring cannot be attained,
small
representative
portions
of the
material
shall
be drawn
from
different
parts of the container
with the help of a suitable
sampling
instrument so as to give representative
sample for the container.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
