<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 7) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Water-Proofing and Damp-Proofing Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen felts may be of different types depending upon the raw material used and their
construction. IS 1322 : 1993 ‘Specification for bitumen felts for water-proofing and damp-proofing
(  fourth revision  )’ and IS 7193 : I993 ‘Specification for glass fibre base coal tar pitch and bitumen
felts (  first revision  )’, cover bitumen felts of hessian based and glass fibre base respectively. The
above standards require, amongst other requirements, detailed testing of each of these products.
Various methods of test relating to each product for determination of physical properties have
been included in the separate standards. All types of felts have to satisfy some common essential
physical requirements for which methods of tests are same. A series of standards covering
methods of test have therefore been formulated to cover the determination of various physical
requirements of bitumen felt. This standard covers determination of binder content. Other parts of
this standard are as follows:
Part 1 Breaking strength test
Part 2 Pliability test
Part 3 Storage sticking test
Part 4 Pressure head test
Part 5 Heat resistance test
Part 6 Water absorption test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (August 1999). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1  The thimble shall be dried at 100°C to
110°C, then cooled in a desiccator and weighed.
The bitumen felt sample shall be weighed
nearest to 0.1 g and is folded and put in the
thimble. The sample of the felt shall be cut into
pieces, if necessary, to be accommodated in the
thimble.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>M 1  = weight of the sample in g, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>M 2  = weight of the recovered hessian bass
with filler in g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2  About 400 ml of the solvent shall be taken
into the properly cleaned and dried flask and
the soxhlet shall be fitted over the flask. Care
should be taken that the ground glass fittings
are perfect and there is no leakage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to correct for any fine material present
in the solution at the end of the test, the solvent
shall be distilled off, the residue cooled down
and weighed and a representative portion of it
(between 2 and 3 g) treated with the solvent
and filtered through a sintered silica filtering
crucible or filter paper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.3  After fixing the reflex condensor, heat
shall be applied at the bottom of the flask
slowly. The heating should be adjusted to
ensure a steady reflux of 60-70 drops per
minute falling from the end of the condensor on
the middle of the extraction thimble. It is to be
observed that at least three cycles of siphoning
of solvent is taken place in 10 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.2  In the case of materials containing high
filler content the whole of the solution at the
end of the test should be filtered or centrifu-
galled. The binder content  B  shall be calculated
on the dry sample by the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Amendments are issued to standards as the need arises on the basis of comments. Standards are also
reviewed periodically; a standard along with amendments is reaffirmed when such review indicates that no
changes are needed; if the review indicates that changes are needed, it is taken up for revision. Users of
Indian Standards should ascertain that they are in possession of the latest amendments or edition by
