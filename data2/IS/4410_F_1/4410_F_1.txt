(Part

by the Indian
Standar-ds
Institution
on 13 April
1973. after the draft finalized
by the

had

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
A number
of Indian
Standards
has already
been printed
covering
various aspects of river valley projects
and a large
number
of standards
is in the process
of formulation.
These
standards
include
technical
terms, the precise definitions
of which are required
to avoid ambiguity
in
their interpretation.
To achieve this end, the Institutitm
is bringing

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Part XV covers the important
field of canal structures
and in view of
the vastness of this subject,
it is proposed to cover it in different

of this standard
due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the
field in this country.
This has been met by deriving
assistance
from the

discontinuity
at a wave angle p that depends
in magnitude
on

resembles
a

Standing
Wave
a><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A wave formed on the surface of a body of water when a stream
enters such a body at a high velocity.
The energy of the entering
stream
is dissipated by turbulence
and by maintaining
the water
comprising
the wave at the higher elevation
above the normal
surface of the body of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A sudden rise in the water surface,
generally
fixed in position,
such as a hydraulic jump;
a standing
wave may exist, however,
where the hydraulic jump is not involved.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A type of wave in which the surface of the water oscillates verti-
cally between
fixed nodes without
progressing.
The points of
maximum
vertical
rise and fall are antinodes or loops.
It may
be the result of two equal progressive
waves travelling
through
each other, but in opposite directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.78  Steady Jump -A
type of hydraulic jump in which the downstream
extremity of the surface roller and the point at which the high velocity
jet tends to leave the flow, occurs at practically
the same vertical section.
The action and position of this jump, are least sensitive to variation
in tailwater depth.
The jump is well balanced and the performance is at
its best.
The Froude number of the incoming flow in this case is between
4.5 and 9.0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.79  Strong Jump -
A type of hydraulic
jump tin which
the high
velocity jet grabs intermittent
slugs of
water rolling down the front face
of the jump generating
waves downstream,
and
a rough surface can
prevail.
The Froude number of the incoming flow in this case is more
than 9.00.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

water
surface
remains
smooth.
The velocity

is fairly uniform,
and
the energy loss is low.
