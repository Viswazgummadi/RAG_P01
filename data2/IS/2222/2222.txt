<<PARAGRAPH>>FoREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
(Third
Revision )wasadopted
bythe
Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the Clay Products
for Buildings
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Perforated
bricks
are
light
in
weight
and
provide
better
thermal
insulation
as compared
to
common
bricks.
Further,
with
the
setting
up of a number
of mechanized
and semi-mechanized
plants for the manufacture
of clay building products
in different parts
of
the
country,
and
since
all
the
plants
are
using
extrusion
process,
these
bricks
and
other
special varieties
of clay
building
materials
will be produced
in larger
quantities
and
will
find
greater
application
in
general
building
construction.
This
standard
has been formulated,
therefore,
to provide
a guide
for the manufacture
and uce of perforated
bricks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
was
first
published
in
1962 and
subsequently
revised in 1969 and 1979.
In this
revision,
non-modular
size of brick in addition
to modular
size has been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for
the
preparation
of this standard
has taken into con-
sideration
the
views
of
producers,
consumers
and
technologists
and
has related the standard
to
the
manufacturing
and
trade
practices
followed
in the country
in this field.
Due weightage
has also been given
to the
need
for
international
co-ordination
among
standards
prevailing
in
different
countries
of the world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this
standard
is complied
with
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test or analysis, shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised
)’.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded
off value should be the same as that
of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
