<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
the draft finalized by
( Fourth Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the Water Supply and Sanitation
in Building Sectional Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was first published in 1957 and subsequently
revised in 1963, 1971 and 1983.
In this revision, requirements
of water supply for residences has been listed
based on population
of the community.
However, for Lower Income Group ( LIG ) and Economical
Weaker Section
of Society ( EWS ), the value of minimum requirement
of water supply has been
retained
as 135
litres per head per day.
Fire demand in buildings has been catered to, by giving reference
to
a
suita-ble standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
code
represents
a standard
of
good
practice
and,
therefore,
takes
the
form
of
recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
