<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This  Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 17 November
1980,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Farm

Committee
had been
approved
by the Agricultural

Food Products
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Different
types of
asbestos
cement
pipes have been
in
use in this
country
for about
four decades
and considerable
experience
is available
in regard
to their use as water supply. pressure
mains
and building
pipes,
gutters
and
fittings
for
conveyin, m rain
water
and

from
the

to the drainage

( IS : 690%1975t
) and

A need
has
also
been
felt
for
an
Indian
Standard
on asbestos

pipes for farm drainage
purposes
and
this

has been prepared
to cover
such pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In preparation
of this standard
assistance
has been
derived
from

<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  For the  purpose
of this standard,
the pipes based on their crushing
strength
( se  7.1 ) shall be of the following
three classes:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Light
duty,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Medium

conforming
to IS :  1489-1976$,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1
The
mixture
shall
be
free
from
any
organic
fibre
or
any
material,
liable to cause deterioration
in the quality
of pipes.
In case of
auto-claved
pipes  siliceous
filler may also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
When
the pipes are intended for conveyance
of particularly
aggressive
residual
water
or to  be laid in particularly
aggressive grounds, the nature  of these
watcr
and grounds
shall be specified to the manufacturer
by the purchaser,
who may
suggest  appropriate
