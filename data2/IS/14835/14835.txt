<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Cost
Analysis and Cost Estimates Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Water Resources
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Estimation
of unit rate for different type of works in construction
of rubble masanry
far river valley projects is
being done by various methods.
It becomes
very essential
to follow certain guidelines
during the process of
estimation
of unit rate, so that uniform methods are followed by concerned
personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (revised)‘.
The number
of significant
places retained
in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

2 For well steining in this class of masonry add 1.4 masons-11
class for one cu m of finished work.
3 Thirty eight (38) percent of mortar shall be adopted in the data
for Random Rubble Masonry Work for construction of Dam and
appurtenant works.
4 In individual cases and~if warranted, the above percentage limit
can be raised up to 40 (forty) percent by the Superintending
Engineer-in-Charge of the work for recorded reasons.
5 The provisions for bond stones shall be deleted in the data for
Random Rubble Masonry for dams and its appurtenant works.
For the purpose of notes (2) and (5) above  :
a)
‘Dam’ means hydraulic structure built across a stream to
hold water.
b) Appurtenant works of a masonry dam are the abutments,
aprons, water cushions and retaining walls forming part
of masonry dam.
c) Diversion works like anicuts, head regulators can not be
classified as Dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
