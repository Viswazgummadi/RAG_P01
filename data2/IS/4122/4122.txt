<<HEADING level=3>>2. SAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The sample shall be selected to represent a true. average of the type or
grade of stone under consideration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The sample shall be selected by the purchaser ‘or his authorized
representative from the quarried stone or taken from the natural rock, as
described in 2.2.1
and ‘P.2.2
and shall be of adequate size to permit
the preparation of the requisite number of test pieces,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1 In case of stone from ledges or quarries the ,ledge or quarry face
of the stone shall be inspected to determine any variation in the different
strata.
Differences in colour, texture and structure shall be observed.
Separate samples of stone weighing at least 25 kg each ofunweathered
specimen shall be obtained from all strata that appear to vary iu colour,
texture
and structure.
Pieces that have been damaged
by blasting;
driving wedges, heating, etc, shall not be included in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2 In case of field stone and boulder, a detailed inspection of the
deposits of field stone and boulders over the area where the supply is to be
obtained, shall be made;
The different kinds of stone and their condition
in the various deposits shall be recorded.
Separate
samples shall be
selected for all classes of stone that would be considered for use in
construction as indicated by visual inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3 When perceptible variations  occur  in the quality of rock, the purchaser
shall select as many samples as are necessary for determining the range in
properties.’<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  TEST SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Test pieces shall be either 10  x  10 x  20  cm prisms or lO-cm cubes. The,
faces shall be ground smooth and finished with abrasive of IS Grit No. 80

), and brushed free of all loose flakes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  HAND SCRAPING TOOL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The scraping tool shall be made by grinding down the blade of a putty
knife to a length of 7.5 cm and width of 2 cm. The end of the blade
shall be ground to a plane surface perpendicular to the length of the tool
to form a sharp edge with either side of the blade. These sharp edges
shall be referred to as cutting edges, and the scraping shall be done with
these cutting edges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

5. TEiT PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Sample Preparation -_The  specimens
tested shall not be less than 3
in number.
One of the faces of each
sample
shall be scraped. in the
original condition at the centre.
The scraping
shall be done in the manner
as explained in 5.1.1.
The centre of the face may be located
by drawing
the diagonals of the rectangle.
The depth of scraping
dI shall be found by
makitlg thickness
measurements
to the nearest
0.02 mm before and after
sciapmg and computing
their
difference.
The sample
shall be scraped at
room temperature
( 20”  t0,30”C
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5-1.1
Procedure
for
Scraping-Apply
approximately
1 *Ii kg
pressure
( ~6  Note below ) on the cutting edge holding
the blade
on the surface of
:he specimen at an angle of 30”.
Make
each stroke by moving the cutting
edge forward about 4 cm, and repeat the stroke with the same  cutting edge
8 times,  taking
care
that
each
stroke’
follows
the
same
path.
.Make
another 8 strokes with the other cutting
edge in the same manner.
Before
each specimen is scraped, sharpen the cutting
edge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Now . -The
criteria for judging the pressure to be applied
in the test, are the feel of
P’e%~rr.
and rhe amount of bending of the blade.
By grasping
the handle of the tool
in the same way as in scraping
the specimen
and by pressing
a cutting edge on the
weighing
table of a small
platform
scale having
its weighing
beam set for a load of
1.5 kg, the feel of piessure and the bending of blade could be ascerlained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2
After
scraping the specimen
as in 5.1, put that
in a glass vessel and
completely
cover with
1 percent  (w/v)
sulphuric
acid solution
( see Note
below).
Space
the specimens
in the container
so that the acid has free
access to the faces that are to be scraped
subsequently
as in 5.3.
Pour off
the acid solution each day and replace with fresh solution.
At the end of
7 days remove the specimens,
wash thoroughly
with water
and dry in an
oven for 24 hours at 105” f 2°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
A convenient
means of determining
the amount of aulphuric acid required
to make l-percent
solution is obtained
from the following
formula:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>096 .y
One percent  (a01
w/v)
sulphuric acid solution = -
-
x+ 1006b<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>where<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>x = the weight of  96-percent sulphuric acid  (  sp gr 1.84) to
be dissolved in 10 000 ml of water<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Therefore,
the value of x = 105.25 kg<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>105.25
The volume of 105.25 g pf such sulphuric
acid is r
= 57 ml.
,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The error due to assuming
the density of water as 1 is not appreciable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  When i.he specimens
have cooled
to room temperature
(20”  to  30°C)
after drying,
scrape
in each specimen
the face opposite to the one scraped<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>previously as  in  5.1.
explained in 5.1.1.
The scraping shall be done in the same manner as

thicknesses before and after scraping and computing the difference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  EVALUATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The
depth of softening
shall be computed
for each specimen as
(  da-d,

The average
depth of softening for all the
specimens tested shall be computed
