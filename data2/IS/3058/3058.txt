<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 20 February 1990, after the
draft finalized by the Fire Safety Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the entire process of rayon yarn or staple fibre manufacturing
the greatest hazard
lies in the
handling of carbon disulphide which is one of the most dangerous of the common flammable liquids
because of its low auto-ignition
temperature
and flash point,
wide explosive range and high
volatility.
The chances of outbreak of fire in a staple fibre plant are also very high in the processes
connected with treatment of the staple fibre, that is, processes subsequent
to the extrusion
of the
fibre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The other locations where fires are likely to occur are the polymerization
sections, drier rooms, yarn
packaging rooms, godowns and open storage areas.
Chances of fires in these locations
can be
considerably reduced or even eliminated if precautions and safety measures mentioned in this Indian
Standard are followed.
This Indian Standard was first published in 1965. The revision
has been
prepared to align to the extent possible with the TAC rules and also update its requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provisions of this code are supplimentary to the relevant
statutory
requirements
as laid down in
Indian Factory Act, Petroleum Rules, Gas Cylinder Rules, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
