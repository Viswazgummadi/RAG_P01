FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part VII ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 22 March 1973, after the draft finalized by the Cement and
Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2. Autoclaved
cellular concrete
is a class of material,
which has been
developed commercially
abroad and is in the process of development in this
country also.
A series of Indian Standards on cellular concrete
is being
formulated so as to provide guidance
in obtaining
reliable products in
autoclaved cellular concrete.
The Sectional
Committee has considered it
desirable to issue a standard for the methods of tests for autoclaved cellular
concrete products for the guidance of manufacturers
and users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different coantries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For convenience
of reference,  ’  Indian
Standard
methods of tests for
autoclaved cellular concrete products  ’  has been grouped into  the following
nine parts:
Part
I Determination
of unit weight or bulk density and moisture
content<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part
II Determination
of drying shrinkage
part III
Determination
of thermal conductivity
Part  IV Corrosion protection

part V Determination

wit
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded o
it shall be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard ( Part VII ) covers the method of test for the strengt
deformation and cracking ( under sustained load ) of flexural memben, sul
as, floor or roof slabs of cellular concrete subject to bending.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TEST SPECIMEN<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Size of the Specimen -
The test specimen shall be the full size meml
as ‘to be actually used in construction
satisfj&g the requirements of t
Televant Indian Standard ( or the requirements specified by the man&
turer ) in respect of shape and dimensions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Condition
of the Test Specimen<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  Moisture Content -
The moisture content of the concrete  during
1
test  should be indicated and should be not less than 10 percent  by weig
when
determined in accordance with IS  :  6441 ( Part I )-1972t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2  Tm.erature of Specimen -The
temperature of the concrete sh
not be materially different from the ambient temperature in which it is bej
tested and in any case not less than 0°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  TEST  ARRANGEMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The members to be tested shall be simply supported
at the en
The supports shall consist of 25-mm thick horizontal mild steel plates bedi
on rigid supports of steel or concrete.
The ends of the members shall
fully in contact with the &eel plate over the whole width of the membt
The bearing width and the span used for the test shall be the same as th,
indicated
by the manufacturer
and to be actually used in constructj
practice ( see Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

METHOD FOR BENDING TEST OF REINFORCED  CELLULAR
CONCRETE  UNITS ( UNDER SUSTAINED  LOAD )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. LOADING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The test  specimen
member
shall be subjected
to loads placed
at l/4 span
points  through
steel platens
not less than  25  mm thick, the load extending over
the entire width of the members.
The steel platens shall be bedded on soft
fibre board packing, not less than .12 mm thick and of the same plan dimen-
sions as the steel platens.
The packing shall be placed between each steel
loading platen and the top of the member.
The span shall be taken as the
distance between the centres of the bearings ( set Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The loads at the two l/4 span points shall be equal and evenly distribut-
ed over the steel loading platens.
The width of the steel platen shall not
be less than 100 mm and shall be increased, where necessary, in multiples
of50 mm, so that the contact pressure under the applied load is not more than
20  percent  of the compressive strength of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 The weight of the loading equipment shall be taken into account in
calculating the applied load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Loads -
The loads shall be measured to an accuracy of not less than
f l*5 percent of the  applied
load.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Deflection
-
The deflection
of the member shall be
measured
at
&d-span
and the  least count of the dial gauge shall be at least O-01 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:6441  (PartVII)-1973<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Strain -
Strain measurements may be made, where required, prefer-
ably at mid-span on the main tension reinforcement
and on the extreme
compression fibre of the concrete.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Cracking
Widths -
Crack widths shall be measured with an accuracy
of f0’05
mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. TEST PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Zero for the deflection measurements shall be taken immediately after
the member had been placed in position.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The loading apparatus shall then be fixed and the load shall be applied
in stages.
At the end of this stage the load, including the self weight of the
member and the weight of the loading apparatus, shall be equal to the design
dead load for the member.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>63.1
After an interval of about 5 min, loading shall be increased gradu-
ally until the load is equal to the combined dead and design live loads.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2
After a further interval of about 5 min, the load shall be further
increased gradually until it is equal to the combined dead and twice the
design live loads.
At that load the deflection shall be noted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3
The load should be left on the member for 24 h.
The residual
mid-span deflection after removal of the test load at the end of that period
should be measured.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4
The unit shall then be tested to destruction
with the load  being
imposed  steadily at a rate of l/4 of the design live load per minute until
failure occurs or the mid-span deflection is l/60 of the span, whichever is
earlier.
If the member is not tested to failure, then a hypothetical failure
load shall be assumed to be that load for which the mid-span deflection is
l/60 of the span.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>63.5
Deflection and strain measurements ( see 5.3 ) should be recorded at
the beginning and where applicable at the end of each of the loading stages;
intermediate measurements may also be made, if required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. REPORT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 The test report shall state:
a) moisture content of the specimen;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) temperature of the specimen; and
c) measured loads, deflections,  strains
and crack widths for au load
conditions.<<HEADING_END>>
