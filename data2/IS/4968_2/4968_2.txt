FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
( Part II ) ( First Revision ) was adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 22 December
1976, after the draft
finalized ~by the Soil Engineering
Section&l Committee
had been approved.
by. the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Dynamic
cone penetration
test is a simple device for probing
the soil
strata and it has an advantage
over the standard
penetration
test that
making of a bore hole is avoided.
Moreover,
the data obtained
by come
test provides
a continuous
record
of
soil resistance.
The
resistance
jv,,
( ne Note ) to penetration
in terms of blows per 30 cm of penetration
of the cone specified
in this standard
and developed
by the Central
Building Research Institute, Roorkee, has been co-related
quantitative1
to
the
standard
penetration
value
N obtained
in accordance
wit yh
IS:2131-1963*.
Studies with a view to establish
a definite co-relation
-between
flrbr
and N values
for different
regions of the country
are.in
progress.
The Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of
this standard
decided to publish this standard
in the meantime
so that
it could serve as a basis of test to various investigators
and others engaged
in subsurfacd
exploration
for foundations
and thus make the results of
investigations
comparable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The resistance to penetration
in the standard penetration
test ( IS  :  2131-
19635 ) shall be designated
as N, that to a 50 mm con:

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard was first published
in 1968.
In this revision
several.
changes have been made taking into consideration
thC experience gained
in conducting
the test and in the manufacture
of the equipment.
The
major
changes
made relate to the material of the cone and the hammer,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>and the criteria for stopping of the driving of the cone.
The diameter of
the cone has been changed to 62’5 mm and the provision
permitting
the
use of cones of other
diameters
has
been
withdrawn.
Additional
information
has been given on the bentonite
slurry
used
in the test.
Correlations
between JVebr and N values have also been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Correlation
between. cone penetration
values obtained using 62’5 mm
cone ( JVcar ), and penetration
values obtained
by-other
methods
may be
*developed
for a given
site by conducting
the
latter
tests
adjacent
( about 3 to 5 m ) to the location of the cone test.
However, for medium
to fine sands the following relationships
between the standard penetration
,value (N)
obtained
in accordance
with IS  :  2131-1963*
and the cone
penetration
value
( Ncer ) in accordance
with method
specified in this
standard
[ IS : 4968 ( Part II ) ] have
been
developed
by the Central
Building
Research
Institute,
Roorkee.
These relationships
when utilized
shall be used with caution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
( Part II ) covers the procedure
of dynamic..driving
of
a 62.5 mm cone and thereby obtaining
a record of resistance of the soil.
‘The cone is directly
driven
into the ground
and
for eliminating
the
friction on the driving rods bentonite slurry is used.
The use of bentonite
slurry may not be necessary when the investigation
required
is up to a
depth of 6 m only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

s_uitable lengths with threads
for joining
A  rod coupling
at either end.
The rods shouid be marked at every 100 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
The  ’ OUIW and  internal

and 28.57
mm
respectivrly.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  Fonr mild’steifv&es
as show&in
Fig.

welded to the driving rod immediately
above the cone.
.4s an alternative,
a gravel trap about 150 mm high of wire gauze of 5 mm mesh may be
provided on the rod immediately
above the cone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Driving

driving
head
shall be of mild
steel
with
threads at either end for  A  rods coupling ( set Note under 2.2 ).
It shall
have a diameter of 100 mm and a length of 100 to 150 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  Hoisting
Equipment
-
Any &table
hoisting equipment,
like a
tripod may be used.
The equipment
shall be designed to be stable under
conditions of impact of the hammer over the driving head when the cone
is driven during the test.
Provision shall be made to enable the operator
to climb up the equipment for fixing the pulley, ropes, etc.
A typical set
up using a tripod is shown in Fig. 2.
Suitable
guides shall be provided
for keeping the driving rods vertical and in position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5  Hammer
-The
hammer used for driving the cone shall be of mild
steel or cast iron with a base of mild steel.
It shall be 250 mm high and
of suitable diameter.
The weight of the hammer together wirh the chain
shall be 65 kg.
It shall have a hole at the centre running throughout
its
length and of suitable diameter for the  A  rod ( see Note under 2.2 ) and/or
guide to pass freely through it.
The clearance
between the rod and/or
guide and the hole in the hammer,shall
be about 5 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
An automatic arrangement
for controlling
the drop of the hammer may be
preferred if available.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6  Pumping
Unit for Bentonite
Slurry -
It consists of slurry pump
of capacity
35 to 45 l/min at a pressure of 700 to 850 kN/m* ( 7 to
85 kgf/cm2 ) with a suction hose assembly
and a swivel assembly.
For
better circulation
of slurry at greater depths a vank borer consisting of
four vanes and a number of drill holes for the escape of slurry may be
provided in between
the driving
rod and the cone
(see Fig.
1 and
Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i
3.  PROCEDURE
i ,
’
3.1  The
vane shall be connected
to the driving
rods,
with the vane
borer/gravel trap in position.
The driving head with the guide rod shall
be fixed on the driving rods. This assembly shall be kept in position with
the cone resting vertically
on the-ground
at the point to be tested.
For
the circulation
of slurry. the guide rod shall be connected
te a water<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>i<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 4968 ( Part II ) - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>swivel preferably through a flexible tube connection
and then through
another
flexible tube to the pumping unit for bentonite slurry.
The
swivel assembly shall be held in position by a rope passing over the pulley
p,rovided for that purpose.
The slurry tank shall be filled with bentonite
slurry of suitable consistency
( see Note ).
The slurry should generally
be prepared separately and stored in drums.
The tank end of the inlet
tube to the pump shall be provided with suitable protection
against
entry of debris and it shall be kept immersed in the slurry tank.
The
hammer,
to which a rope has been attached for operation, shall be slid
over the guide rod, to rest on the driving head.
A typical assembly of
the equipment for test using a tripod is shown in Fig. 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
In the case of medium to fine sand, 5 percent bentonite slurry has been
found useful,
In the case of coarse sand,
slurry
of thicker
consistency
subject to
circulation
requirements
may
be needed.
In the case of hard water,
addition
of
1 percent
soap solution
has been found useful to get a better ~suspension of the
bentonite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The
cone shall be driven by allowing the 65 kg hammer to drop
freely through a height of 750 mm on the driving head.
A drum type
winch fixed to central
leg of the tripod may be used for lifting the drop
weight provided the free fall of the hammer is not affected.
The driving
of
the
cone
and
the
pumping
in
of the
slurry
shall be started
simultaneously.
Driving shall not be done for more than 30 cm at a
time after which it shall be stopped for a minute or two.
Pumping shall,
however, be continued.
This helps in keeping the hole lined and also
avoids the choking of the holes provided in the cone.
The driving rods
shall be given a few turns ( about 4 or 5 turns ) every now and then so
that the hole above the cone is maintained.
Efficient
circulation
of
slurry is necessary for eliminating friction on the rods.
The number of
blows for every 100 mm penetration of the cone shall be recorded.
The
process shall be repeated
till the cone is driven to the required
depth
(.sec Note ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
In order to avoid damage to the equipment, driving may be stopped when
the number of blows exceeds 35 for 100 mm penetration when the cone is driven dry
and 20 for 100 mm penetration when the cone is penetrated by circulating slurry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  REPORT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The
number of blows ( .MOb, ) should be reported
as a continuous
record for every 300 mm penetration
either  in a tabular
form or as a
graph between
Near and depth.
Records
of the test shall also include
the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
