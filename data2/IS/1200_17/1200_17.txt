FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Part 17 ) ( Third Revision ) was adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 4 October
1985, after the draft
finalized by the Method of Measurement
of Works of Civil
Engineering
( Excluding
River
Valley
Projects ) Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
3 very
important
place in planning
and
execution
of any civil engineering
work from the time of first estimates
I  to final completion
and settlement of payments
for the project.
Methods
followed
for measurement
are not uniform and considerable
differences
exist between practices followed by one construction agency and another
and also between various Central and
State Government
Departments.
While it is recognized
that each system of measurement
has to be speci-
fically
related
to the administrative
and financial organizations
within
the department
responsible for work, a unification of the various
systems
at technical
level have
been
accepted as very desirable, specially as it
permits a wider circle of operation for civil engineering
contractors
and
eliminates
ambiguities
and misunderstandings
arising out of inadequate
understanding
of various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Among the various civil engineering
items, measurement
of building
was first to be taken
up for standardization
and this standard
having
provisions relation to ‘all building works, was first published
in 1958 and
was revised in 1964 and 1970.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the course
of usage
of this standard
by various
construction
agencies in the country, several clarifications and suggestions
for modi-
fications were received
and as a result of study, the Sectional Committee
decided
that its scope,
besides being applicable
to buildings
should be
expanded
so as to cover civil engineering
works like industrial
and
river
valley project works.

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  Since various
trades are not
related
to one ,another,
the
Sectional
Committee
decided
that method
of measurement
for each trade as given
in IS : IZOO-1964.
be issued separately
as a different
part, which will
be
helpful
to specific
users in various
trades.
This part covering
method
of measurement
of road
work including
airfield
pavements
to building
as well as civil
engineering
works
was,
therefore,
issued
as a second
revision
in 1969.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 In
the course
bf  use of this standard
in the past 16 years and based
on
suggestions
received,
so as to bring
in line with IRC codes this third
revision
has been prepared.
The major
modifications
are in
respect
of
earthwork,
and cement
concrete
pavements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with the final value, observed
or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a measurement,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS : 2-1960t.
The
number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
( Part

standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Booking of Dimensions
-
In booking
dimensions,
the order
shall

and generally
in the sequence
of length,
width
and

to the following
limits,
unless otherwise
stated:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Length
and width shall be measured
to the
