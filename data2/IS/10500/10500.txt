<<PARAGRAPH>>Water Sectional Committee, CHD 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Water Sectional Committee had been approved by the Chemical Division
Council.
This standard was originally published in 1983. The current revision has been undertaken to take
into account the uptodate information available about the nature and effect of various
contaminants as also the new techniques for identifying and determining their concentration. In
this revision based on experience gained additional requirements for alkalinity, aluminium and
boron have been incorporated and the permissible limits for dissolved solids, nitrate and pesticides
residues have been modified.
A report prepared by the World Health Organization in cooperation with the World Bank showed
that in 1975, some 1 230 million people were without safe water supplies. These appalling facts
were central to the United Nations decision to declare an International Drinking Water Supply
and Sanitation decade, beginning in 1981. Further, the VI Five-Year Plan of India had made a
special provision for availability of safe drinking water for the masses. Therefore, this standard
was prepared with the following objectives:
a) To assess the quality of water resources, and
b) To check the effectiveness of water treatment and supply by the concerned authorities.
During VII Five-Year Plan, 55 mini mission districts were identified with a view to meet supply of
water to all the problem villages. The VIII Five-Year Plan intends to provide safe drinking water
to the rural mass. It also propose to ensure supply of desired quality land required quantity of
drinking water.
While preparing this standard, the Committee had taken note of the limited testing facilities
available in the country. This standard, therefore, categories various characteristics as essential or
desirable. The standard also mentions the desirable limit and indicates its background so that the
implementing authorities may exercise their discretion, keeping in view the health of the people,
adequacy of treatment, etc. All essential characteristics should be examined in routine. Besides,
all desirable characteristics should be examined either when a doubt arises or the potability of
water from a new source is to be established.
It has been recognised that often it is necessary to relax the specifications, especially when no
alternate resources are available and therefore, to enable the experts to exercise their discretion a
maximum permissible limit has also been given.
In the case of virological examination, if not even one plaque-forming unit (PFU) of virus can be
found in 1 litre of water, it can reasonably be assumed that the water is safe to drink. It would,
however, be necessary to examine a sample of the order of 10 litres to obtain a proper estimation of
the PFUs at this level. Such examinations cannot be made in ordinary control laboratories but
there should be at least one laboratory in the country or region capable of carrying out virus
examinations and also of pursuing further research on this subject.
The methods of test for various characteristics mentioned in this standard are currently under
revision and their latest revision shall be used in testing.
In the formulation of this standard, assistance has been derived from the following publications:
a) International Standards for Drinking Water issued by World Health Organization, 1984
Geneva;
b) Manual of Standards of Quality for Drinking Water Supplies. Indian Council of Medical
Research, 1971, New Delhi; and
c) Manual on Water Supply and Treatment (  third revision  ), Ministry of Urban Development,
1989, New Delhi.
This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (January 1993). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.
For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

DRINKING WATER — SPECIFICATION
( First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>sanitary inspection and not exclusively on the
results
of
bacteriological
examination.
Everything possible should be done to prevent
pollution of the water. Obvious sources of
contamination should be removed from the
immediate catchment area, special attention
being given to the safe disposal of excrement.
Wells and storage tanks should be protected by
lining and covering, surface drainage should be
diverted,
erosion
prevented
and
the
surrounding area paved. Access of man and
animals should be restricted by fencing, and
should be so designed that fouling is prevented
when drawing water. Although not supplied
through pipes, water from such sources is likely
to undergo further deterioration in quality
during transport or storage before drinking.
Containers used for water should be kept clean,
covered and clear of the floor. The most
important factor in achieving these objectives is
to
ensure
the
cooperation
of
the
local
community, and the importance of education in
simple sanitary hygiene should be strongly
stressed. In hospitals or medical clinics with
such supplies, the value of some form of
treatment is stressed.
3.2.2.1  Bacteriologically, the objective should
be to reduce the coliform count to less than 10
per 100 ml, but more importantly, to ensure the
absence of faecal coliform organisms. If these
organisms are repeatedly found, or if sanitary
inspection reveals obvious sources of pollution
which cannot be avoided, then an alternative
source of drinking water would be sought,
whenever possible. Greater use should be made
of
protected
ground-water
sources
and
rain-water catchment which are more likely to
meet requirements for potable water quality.
3.2.2.2  Although private sources of drinking
water may be outside the jurisdiction of public
health and water supply authorities, such
supplies should still be of potable quality. The
results of bacteriological tests and those of
sanitary surveys should therefore be used to
encourage improvement. Partial treatment may
be necessary to remove turbidity even when coli-
form counts are low; and other quality criteria
may dictate the need for treatment processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE
The standard prescribes the requirements for
the essential and desirable characteristics
required to be tested for ascertaining the
suitability of water for drinking purpose.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 REFERENCES
The Indian Standard listed in Annex A are
necessary adjuncts to this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 CHARACTERISTICS
3.1  The test characteristics are given in
Table 1.
3.2 Bacteriological Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1   Water in Distribution System
Ideally, all samples taken from the distribution
system including consumers’ premises, should
be free from coliform organisms. In practice,
this is not always attainable, and the following
standard for water collected in the distribution
system is therefore recommended when tested
in accordance with IS 1622 : 1981.
a) Throughout any year, 95 percent of
samples should not contain any coliform
organisms in 100 ml;
b) No sample should contain E. Coli in
100 ml;
c) No sample should contain more than 10
coliform organisms per 100 ml; and
d) Coliform
organisms
should
not
be
detectable
in
100
ml
of
any
two
consecutive samples.
3.2.1.1  If any coliform organisms are found the
minimum
action
required
is
immediate
resampling. The repeated finding of 1 to 10
coliform organisms is 100 ml or the appearance
of higher numbers in individual samples
suggests that undesirable material is gaining
access to the water and measures should at
once be taken to discover and remove the
source of the pollution.
3.2.2   Unpiped Water Supplies
Where it is impracticable to supply water to
consumers
through
a
piped
distribution
network and where untreated sources, such as
wells, boreholes and springs which may not be
naturally
pure,
have
to
be
used,
the
requirements for piped supplies may not be
attainable. In such circumstances, disinfection
although desirable is not always practicable,
and considerable reliance has to be placed on<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Virological Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.1  It is theoretically possible that virus
disease can be transmitted by water free from
coliform organisms, but conclusive evidence,
that this has occurred, is lacking.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2  None of the generally accepted sewage
treatment methods yield virus-free effluent.
Although a number of investigators have found
activated sludge treatment to be superior to
trickling filters from this point of view, it seems
possible that chemical precipitation methods
will prove to be the most effective.
3.3.3  Virus can be isolated from raw water and
from
springs.
Enterovirus,
reovirus,
and
adenovirus have been found in water, the first
named being the most resistant to chlorination.
If enterovirus are absent from chlorinated
water, it can be assumed that the water is safe
to drink. Some uncertainty still remains about
the virus of infectious hepatitis, since it has not
so far been isolated but in view of the
morphology and resistance of enterovirus it is
likely that, if they have been inactivated
hepatitis virus will have been inactivated also.
3.3.4  An
exponential
relationship
exists
between the rate of virus inactivation and the
redox potential. A redox potential of 650 mV
(measured between platinum and calomel
electrodes) will cause almost instantaneous
inactivation of even high concentrations of
virus. Such a potential can be obtained with
even a low cencentration of free chlorine, but
only with an extremely high concentration of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>combined chlorine. This oxidative inactivation
may be achieved with a number of other
oxidants also, for example, iodine, ozone, and
potassium permanganate, but the effect of the
oxidants
will
always
be
counteracted
if
reducing
components,
which
are
mainly
organic, are present. As a consequence, the
sensitivity of virus towards desinfectants will
depend on the  milieu  just as much as on the
particular disinfectant used.
3.3.5  Thus, in a water in which free chlorine is
present, active virus will generally be absent if
coliform organisms are absent. In contrast,
because the difference between the resistance
of
coliform
organisms
and
of
virus
to
disinfection
by
oxidants
increases
with
increasing
concentration
of
reducing
components, for example, organic matter, it
cannot be assumed that the absence of viable
coliform organisms implies freedom from active
virus under circumstances where a free
chlorine
residual
cannot
be
maintained.
Sedimentation and slow sand filtration in
themselves may contribute to the removal of
virus from water.
3.3.6  In practice, 0.5 mg/l of free chlorine for
one hour is sufficient to inactivate virus, even
in water that was originally polluted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 10500 : 1991<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>enteric bacteria; microscopic examination after
concentration is, therefore, the only safe
methods of identification.
3.4.5  Strict
precautions
against
back-
syphonage and cross-connections are required
if amoebic cysts are found in a distribution
system containing tested water.
3.4.6  The  cercariae of schistosomiasis  can be
detected by similar microscopic examination,
but there is, in any case, no evidence to suggest
that this disease is normally spread through
piped water supplies.
3.4.7  The cyclops vector of the embroys of
Dracunculus
medinensis
which
causes
dracontiasis or Guinea-worm disease can be
found in open wells in a number of tropical
areas. They are identifiable by microscopic
examination. Such well supplies are frequently
used untreated, but the parasite can be
relatively easily excluded by simple physical
improvements in the form of curbs, drainage,
and apron surrounds and other measures
which prevent physical contact with the water
source.
3.4.8  The drinking water shall be free from
microscopic
organisms
such
as
algae,
zooplanktons,
flagillates,
parasites
and
toxin-producing organisms. An illustrative (and
not exhaustive) list is given in Annex B for
guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4 Biological Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1  Biological examination is of value in
determining the causes of objectionable tastes
and odours in water and controlling remedial
treatments, in helping to interpret the results
of various chemical analysis, and in explaining
the causes of clogging in distribution pipes and
filters. In some instances, it may be of use in
demonstrating that water from one source has
been mixed with that from another.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2  The biological qualities of a water are of
greater importance when the supply has not
undergone the conventional flocculation and
filtration processes, since increased growth of
methane-utilizing bacteria on biological slimes
in pipes may then be expected, and the
development of bryozoal growths such as
Plumatella  may cause operational difficulties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3  Some of the animalcules found in water
mains may be free-living in the water, but
others such as  Dreissena  and  Asellus  are more
or less firmly attached to the inside of the
mains. Although these animalcules are not
themselves pathogenic, they may harbour
pathogenic
organisms
or
virus
in
their
intestines, thus protecting these pathogens
from destruction by chlorine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.4  Chlorination, at the dosages normally
employed in waterworks, is ineffective against
certain parasites, including amoebic cysts; they
can be excluded only by effective filtration or by
higher chlorine doses than can be tolerated
without subsequent dechlorination.  Amoebiasis
can be conveyed by water completely free from<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
