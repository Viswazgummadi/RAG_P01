<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee, CED 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 24 November 1989, after
the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.
High alumina cement (HAC) is a special cement containing essentially hydraulic calcium
aluminates as the major ingredient. The presence of the mono calcium aluminate (CaO Al 2 O 3 )
constituent in HAC imparts certain unique properties, such as high early strength and
refractoriness.
High alumina cement is mainly a refractory cement but in some cold regions this cement may find
use as a structural material taking advantage of high heat of hydration and high early strength
development. The hydration of mono calcium aluminates imparts high early strength and hence
this cement will have special utility in work involving emergency repair or construction. However,
conversion of the hydration product of the calcium aluminates from dicalcium aluminate hydrate
to aluminate hydroxide and tricalcium aluminate hydrate and water will result in increased
porosity and gradual reduction in strength. This conversion is more rapid in presence of moisture
and at atmosphere temperatures over 18 to 20 C. In tropical climates the loss in strength can be as
much as 50 to 80 percent.
There has been considerable controversy on the long term effect of storage of high alumina cement
concrete in water at temperatures around 18°C, also the data on retrogression is conflicting. In
view of this, the use of this cement should be restricted to areas of continuously low temperature
where highest summer temperatures do not exceed 18°C.
In view of the above and other properties of high alumina cement, there are certain restrictions
given below about the use of this cement in concrete which should be strictly followed:
a) In view of the restrogression in strength and reduced durability, high alumina cement shall
not be used in locations where the ambient temperatures are likely to exceed 18°C even for
short periods. It shall not be used in mass concrete in view of the high heat of hydration
inducing conversion of the hydrated compounds;
b) Accelerators like calcium chloride shall not be used with this cement;
c) Steam curing or elevated temperature of curing shall be avoided; and
d) High alumina cement shall not be mixed with any other type of cement.
This standard was first published in 1972. Since publication of this standard large number of
amendments have been issued from time to time in order to modify various requirements and also
other standards referred to in the specification have been revised. The important amendments
include incorporating a clause allowing different types of bags for packing 50 kg cement,
permitting packaging of cement in 25 kg bags and incorporating a note regarding supply of cement
in bulk and intermediate containers. As a result of these modifications, the Sectional Committee
decided to bring out the first revision of this standard incorporating all the amendments for the
convenience of the users.
Mass of cement packed in bags and the tolerance requirements for the mass of cement packed in
bags shall be in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Standards of Weights and Measures
(Packaged Commodities) Rules, 1977 and  B-1.2  (  see  Annex B for information ). Any modification
in these rules in respect of tolerance on mass of cement would apply automatically to this
standard.
The composition of the committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in
Annex C.
This edition 2.3 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (November 1991), Amendment No. 2
(November 1993) and Amendment No. 3 (May 2000). Side bar indicates modification of the text as
the result of incorporation of the amendments.
For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
