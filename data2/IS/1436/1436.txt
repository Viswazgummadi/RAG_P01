<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard f First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Commercial Weights and Measures Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Light Mechanical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is one of a series of Indian Standards
relating to commercial
weighing instruments.
This standard was originally published in 1960. This revision
is based on further experience gained
in manufacture of commercial weighing instruments and other developments in this field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standard on General Requirements for Weighing Instruments IS 1432 is necessary adjunct
to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is intended chiefly to cover the technical
provisions
relating
to weigh-bridges,
and it
does not include all the necessary provisions of a contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard assistance has been derived from the Weights and Measures Rules
and Acts on weights and measures prevailing in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
