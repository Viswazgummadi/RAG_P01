<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work
of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for
which a technical committee has been established has the right to be
represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO
collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are
circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International
Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting
a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standard ISO 10005 was prepared by Technical Committee
ISO/TC 176, Quality management and quality assurance, Subcommittee
SC 2, Quality systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard was prepared to address the need for a
mechanism to relate generic requirements on quality system elements to
the specific requirements of a particular product, project or contract.
Its provisions should be considered advisory and not requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A quality plan may be used within an organization to ensure that specific
requirements for quality are being appropriately planned and addressed for
identified products during production. A quality plan may be used to indi-
cate the specific application of a quality system to a given development
project, whether for a marketable product or for an in-house facility.
A quality plan may also be used by the supplier in a contractual situation
to demonstrate to the customer how the specific requirements for quality
of a particular contract will be met. In many cases, it may be beneficial to
obtain customer input to the development of the quality plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality plan should be compatible with other plans that may be pre-
pared.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Quality management — Guidelines for quality plans<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>for compliance with requirements. A quality plan may
also be used where a documented quality system
does not exist, in which case procedures may need
to be developed to support the quality plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1
This International Standard provides guidelines
to assist suppliers in the preparation, review, accept-
ance and revision of quality plans.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
Annex B contains a bibliography of International
Standards which provide information that may prove helpful
to those involved in the preparation and review of quality
plans.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is intended for use in two situations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
as guidance to a supplier organization in meeting
the requirements of ISO 9001, ISO 9002 or
ISO 9003 relative to the preparation of a quality
plan; or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 Normative reference<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
as guidance to a supplier organization in preparing
a quality plan when the supplier does not have
such a quality system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following standard contains provisions which,
through reference in this text, constitute provisions
of this International Standard. At the time of publi-
cation, the edition indicated was valid. All standards
are subject to revision, and parties to agreements
based on this International Standard are encouraged
to investigate the possibility of applying the most re-
cent edition of the standard indicated below. Mem-
bers of IEC and ISO maintain registers of currently
valid International Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In both situations, the quality plan is supplemental to
the supplier's generic quality system documentation
and should not duplicate the generic documentation.
For convenience in situations of type b), this Inter-
national Standard includes features that are covered
in the generic requirements of ISO 9001, ISO 9002
and ISO 9003.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 8402:1994, Quality management and quality as-
surance — Vocabulary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quality plans provide a mechanism to tie specific re-
quirements of the product, project or contract to ex-
isting generic quality system procedures. They do not
require the development of a comprehensive set of
procedures or instructions over and above those al-
ready existing, although some additional documented
procedures may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 Definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this International Standard, the
definitions given in ISO 8402, together with the fol-
lowing definitions, apply. Terms which are repeated
here for clarity but have been defined in other Inter-
national Standards are identified by the placement of
the number of the standard after the term being de-
fined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2
This International Standard is applicable where
a quality plan is to be used for a particular product,
project or contract. A quality plan may be applicable
to any product of the generic product categories
(hardware, software, processed materials and ser-
vices) or industry/economic sectors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1
contract:  Agreed requirements between a sup-
plier and customer transmitted by any means.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A quality plan may be used to monitor and assess
adherence to the requirements for quality, but these
guidelines are not intended to be used as a checklist<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

project:  Unique process consisting of a set of
coordinated and controlled activities with start and
finish dates, undertaken to achieve an objective con-
forming to specific requirements, including the con-
straints of time, cost and resources.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.7
quality plan:  Document setting out the specific
quality practices, resources and sequence of activities
relevant to a particular product, project or contract.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11
A quality plan usually makes reference to the parts of
the quality manual applicable to the specific case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2
An individual project may form part of a larger project
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12
Depending on the scope of the plan, a qualifier may be
used, for example, “quality assurance plan”, “quality man-
agement plan”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3
In some types of projects, the objectives are refined and
the project characteristics defined progressively as the pro-
ject proceeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>[ ISO 8402 ]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.8
quality system:  Organizational structure, pro-
cedures, processes and resources needed to imple-
ment quality management.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4
The outcome of a project may be one or several units
of a product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3
type test:  Test or series of tests directed
towards approval of a design conducted to determine
that it is capable of meeting the requirements of the
product specification.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13
The quality system should be as comprehensive as
needed to meet the quality objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4
witness testing:  Testing of a product in the
presence of the customer's representative or a third
party.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14
The quality system of an organization is designed pri-
marily to satisfy the internal managerial needs of the or-
ganization. It is broader than the requirements of a particular
customer who evaluates only the relevant part of the quality
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5
procedure:  Specified way to perform an activity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>15
For contractual or mandatory quality assessment pur-
poses, demonstration of the implementation of identified
quality system elements may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5
In many cases, procedures are documented (e.g. quality
system procedures).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>[ ISO 8402 ]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6
When a procedure is to be documented, the term
“written procedure” or “documented procedure” is fre-
quently used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4
Preparation, review, acceptance
and revision of the quality plan<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7
A written or documented procedure usually contains the
purpose and scope of an activity; what shall be done and
by whom; when, where and how it shall be done; what
materials, equipment and documents shall be used; and
how it shall be controlled and recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When preparing a quality plan, quality activities appli-
cable to the situation should be defined and docu-
mented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>[ ISO 8402 ]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Much of the generic documentation needed may be
contained in the supplier's quality manual and docu-
mented procedures. This documentation may need to
be selected, adapted and/or supplemented. The qual-
ity plan shows how the supplier's generic docu-
mented procedures are related to and applied to any
necessary additional procedures peculiar to the prod-
uct, project or contract in order to attain specified
quality objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6
product:  Result of activities or processes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8
A product may include service, hardware, processed
materials, software, or a combination thereof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9
A product can be tangible (e.g. assemblies or processed
materials) or intangible (e.g. knowledge or concepts), or a
combination thereof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality plan should indicate, either directly or by
reference to appropriate documented procedures or
other documents, how the required activities are to
be carried out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10
A product can be either intended (e.g. offering to cus-
tomers) or unintended (e.g. polluant or unwanted effects).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The format and level of detail in the plan should be
consistent with any agreed customer requirement,
the supplier's method of operation and the complexity
of the activities to be performed. The plan should be
as brief as possible, consistent with meeting the pro-
visions of this International Standard. (Simplified
examples of alternative presentations of quality plans
are contained in annex A.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>stages, the supplier should submit the quality plan for
each stage to the customer prior to the start of that
stage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Procedures referenced in the plan should be made
available to the customer, where agreed in the con-
tract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Revision<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A quality plan may be a stand-alone document when
a supplier does not have a documented quality sys-
tem. A quality plan may also be included as part of
another document or documents (e.g. product or pro-
ject plan), depending on such things as customer re-
quirements or the business practices of a specific
supplier. It may be necessary to develop a quality plan
that consists of a number of parts, each of which re-
presents a plan for a distinct stage, such as for de-
sign, purchasing, production, or inspection and test,
or for particular activities such as the dependability
plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The supplier should revise the plan, when appropriate,
to reflect changes that have been made to the prod-
uct, project or contract, changes to the manner in
which the product is produced or the service is pro-
vided, or changes in quality assurance practices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Changes to the quality plan should be reviewed for
impact and adequacy by the same authorized group
which conducted the review of the original quality
plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Subject to the specific requirements of a contract,
proposed changes to the plan should be submitted to
the customer for review and acceptance before they
are implemented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 16
When drafting a textural quality plan, the fol-
lowing conventions may be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— “shall” to express a provision that is binding between
two or more parties;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Contents of the quality plan<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— “will” to express a declaration of purpose or intent by
one party;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)  Structure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— “should” to express a recommendation among other
possibilities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The contents of the quality plan should be based on
this International Standard and the supplier's docu-
mented quality system. It is not essential that the
quality plan follow the structure and numbering of any
ISO 9000 standards and the alignment of the para-
graphs in this International Standard is only intended
to ease use and understanding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— “may” to indicate a course of action permissible within
the limits of the quality plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2
Review and acceptance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality plan should be reviewed for adequacy and
formally approved by an authorized group that in-
cludes representatives from all affected functions
within the supplier's organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The elements described in the following subclauses
should be addressed, where relevant to the require-
ments of the product, project or contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)
Scope of the quality plan<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In contractual situations, a quality plan may be sub-
mitted to the customer by the supplier for review and
acceptance, either as part of the precontract award-
bidding process or after the contract has been
awarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The scope of the quality plan should be defined and
should include, but not be limited to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the product or project to which it is to be ap-
plied;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the plan is submitted as part of the bidding process
and a contract is subsequently awarded, the plan
should be reviewed and, where appropriate, revised
to reflect any changes in requirements that may have
occurred as a result of precontract negotiations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the scope of the contract to which it is to be
applied;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the product, project and or contract quality
objectives (these quality objectives should be
expressed in measurable terms wherever
possible);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a quality plan is required by a contract, it should
normally be submitted prior to the start of the re-
quired activities. Where the contract is conducted in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Simplified examples of formats for the presentation of quality plans<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex provides examples of some of the ways
in which quality plans may be presented. (See figures
A.1 to A.4 and table A.1.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Presentation of quality plans can be in any form
deemed suitable for meeting the agreed require-
ments. Even though the examples shown are in the
form of flow diagrams, other forms better suited to a
specific situation may be used. A textual presentation
rather than a diagrammatic one may be more appro-
priate in certain circumstances. Similarly, a diagram-
matic form may be supplemented with text.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The examples shown should not be taken as being
complete as regards the quality plan content defined
in clause 5 of this International Standard. Actual
quality plans may be more complex. It would normally
be expected that all of the elements would be cov-
ered, unless under some exceptional circumstance
they do not apply to the case under review.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
