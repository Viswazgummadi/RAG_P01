0.1  This Indian Standard (Part X) (Second Revision) was adopted by
the Indian Standards Institution on 16 February 1973, after the draft
finalized by the Civil Works Measurement Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2  Measurement occupies a very important place in the planning and
execution of any civil engineering work from the time of first estimates
to the final completion and settlement of payments for a project.
Methods followed for measurement are not uniform and considerable
differences exist among practices followed by different construction
agencies and also among various Central and State Government
departments. While it is recognized that each system of measurement
has to be specifically related to administrative and financial
organizations within a department responsible for the work, a
unification of various systems at technical level has been accepted as
very desirable, specially as it permits a wider range of operation for
civil engineering contractors and eliminates ambiguities and
misunderstandings of various systems followed.
0.3  Among various civil engineering items, measurement of buildings
was the first to be taken up for standardization and this standard
having provisions relating to building work was first published in 1958
and was revised in 1964.
0.4  In the course of usage of this standard by various construction
agencies in the country, several clarifications and suggestions for
modifications were received and as a result of study, the technical
committee responsible for this standard decided that its scope besides
being applicable to buildings should be expanded to cover method of
measurement for civil engineering works, like industrial and river
valley projects works.
0.5  Since different trades are not related to one another, the Sectional
Committee decided that each trade as given in IS : 1200-1964* shall be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Method of measurement of building works (  revised  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1200 (Part X) - 1973<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>issued separately as a different part. This will also be helpful to users
in using the specific standard.
0.5.1  This part covers method of measurement of ceiling and linings
applicable to buildings as well as to civil engineering works.
0.6  This edition 3.2 incorporates Amendment No. 2 (February 1989).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment. Amendment No. 1 had been
incorporated earlier.
0.7  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a measurement, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard (Part X) covers the method of measurement of
ceilings and linings for buildings and civil engineering works.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Clubbing of Items  — Items may be clubbed together provided
that the break-up of the clubbed items is agreed to be on the basis of
the detailed description of the items stated in this standard.
2.2 Booking of Dimensions  — In booking dimensions, the order
shall be consistent and generally in the sequence of length, breadth or
width and height or depth or thickness.
2.3 Description of Items  — The description of each item shall,
unless otherwise stated, be held to include where necessary,
conveyance and delivery, handling, unloading, storing, fabrication,
hoisting, all labour for finishing to required shape and size.
2.4 Measurements  — Unless otherwise stated here-in-after all works
shall be measured net in decimal system, as fixed in its place, as given
in  2.4.1  and  2.4.2 .
2.4.1  Dimension shall be measured to the nearest 0.01 m.
2.4.2  Areas shall be worked out to the nearest 0.01 m 2 .
2.5 Bills of Quantities  — The bills of quantities shall fully describe
the materials and workmanship, and accurately represent the work to
be executed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
