<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by the
Fire Safety Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fires may occur in buildings involving tea manufacturing
operations
particularly
in withering houses,
where preliminary
drying of houses either by natural or artificial means is carried out. The fire in such
houses becomes difficult to control because of combustible
hessian
spread
on tiers of wooden racks
and which results in complete
gutting of the sheds.
Chances of outbreaks
of fire in tea factories
will
be greatly reduced if predetermined
safety
measures
are adopted
in the construction
of building,
installation
of machinery,
in storage godowns and by providing adequate tire fighting arrangements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Furthermore,
tea factories
are located
in such areas which
may not receive
ready support for fire
extinguishing
purposes from public fire service.
Provision
of adequate water supply and adequate
pri-
vate protection
are important
aspects
that need
consideration
from
fire safety
point of view. This
safety code has, therefore,
been formulated
with a view to give necessary
guidance with regard
to fire
safety aspects
of tea-factories
which, if followed, would safeguard
the factory
from
fire hazard to a
large extent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published in 1968. This revision has been published to conform to the extent
possible with the latest requirements
of TAC besides general updating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Provisions
of this code are supplimentary
to the relevant
statutory
requirements
as laid down in
Indian Factories Act,  1948,  Petroleum Rules,  1976,  Gas Cylinder Rules,  1940, etc.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.10  The drier should
preferably
be separated
from the heater by enclosing
walls of non-com-

material
to ensure
that the polluted
dust from the drier exhaust
should not again be
drawn
into
air
passages
thereby
causing
an
accumulation
of calained

at the fan
blades and at the base of the drier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.8 The piping
should be thoroughly
cleaned

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.9  Pipes taken
off the main gasline to feed
the burners should be fitted with properly desig-

of supply
thereto,

minimum
prescribed
in 9.2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.3 The piping installation
should be of robust
nature and be thoroughly
gas tight. It should be
rigidly
supported
and
mounted
to minimize
changes of accidental
mechanical
damage. PIO-
vision should
also be made for draining
out
condensed water, if necessary.
The
installation
should be carried
out
to the requirements
of
the gas supply authority.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.12.1  The ignition

provided whereby
supply of gas to burners is
automatically
cut off in the
event
of flame
failure at a gas pilot or voltage
drop
below a
prescribed
minimum in case of electrical
ingnit-
ing devices. Provision

voltage
for operation
of the electrical
igniting device is
available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.4 The piping

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.2 Daily service tank(s)
should be installed
which shall not be of greater
capacity
than is
required
to hold
sufficient
fuel to cover a full
day’s working of the drying machines
installed
and should also comply with the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fill pipe should
be
fitted
with
a
screwed cap and should
extend into the
tank and be arranged
so as to discharge
the fuel horizontally
along the side of the
tank. It should be carried down not less
than two-thirds
of the depth of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tank(s)
should be outside the build-
ing. If the daily
service
tank is required
to be inside the buildings, it/these
should
be at the periphery
of the building in a
separate
enclosure
with the access door
from outside, and having no opening on
the
wall
separating
the
tank
storage
room.
The
separating
wall
should
be
of at least 27 mm thickness.
The
door
of
the
room
should
be raised,
and
the floor counter
sunk so as to prevent
oil flowing out in case of a rupture of the
service tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The centre line of the outlet
should not
be within
75 mm of the tank bottom.
A
sludge cock or other means of removing
sludge should
be provided
at the lowest
point of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Only solid
bottom
gland
packed
plug
cocks or gate or sluice type valves may

<<PARAGRAPH>>Each tank should
be fitted
with a vent
pipe. The vent pipe should extend to at
least 1 m above the tank roof for above
ground tanks and 3 m from ground level
for square tanks.
The upper end should
form an invested ‘U’ bend and its opening
should
be fitted
with a wire gauze of
20 mesh per square cm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For external tanks, each tank should have
a bund wall around it. The area enclosed
in the bund wall and its height should be
adequate to ensure
that
the whole con-
tents of the tank
shall be contained
by
the wall in case of a rupture of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The outlet,
suction
or gravity pipe for
filling the service
tank(s) should be fitted
with a stop
valve,
except in a case of a
service tank
being filled only by a hand
pump and such pump not being gravity
fed. The stop valve should be placed as
close as possible to the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tank(s)
should
only be filled by a
fixed pipe(s)
from
storage
tank and if
filled by gravity
without a hand pump a
stop
valve
should
be fitted as close as
possible to the tank(s) within easy reach
of ground level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each tank should have a vent
pipe com-
plying with the requirements
of 10.2.1(d)
and its upper end should
not be within
one metre of any window or doorway, nor
within
three
metres
of
any
chimney
opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An anti-syphon
valve should be fitted near
the tank on any supply pipe in which fuel
cold continue to flow by syphonic
action
if the valve were absent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydrostatic
gauges
should
normally
be
used as fuel level
indicators.
Dip rods
may be used only in case of tanks in the
open.
If a float
gauge is used, the cord
should
pass through a small hole fitted
with a close fitting
gland.
Gauge glasses
should not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An overflow pipe of cross sectional
area
not less than 50 percent greater than that
of the inflow pipe should be fitted and be
capable of returning
all surplus fuel to a
sump or other suitable container.
No stop
valve should
be fitted on overflow pipe
( see Note ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tank and all its fitting
should be
designed to ensure
electrical

accessible
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
