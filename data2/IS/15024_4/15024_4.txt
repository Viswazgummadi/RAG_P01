<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 4) which is identical with ISO 11442-4 : 1993 ‘Technical product

— Part 4: Document

was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on the recommendation of Drawings Sectional
Committee and approval of the Basic and Production Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 4) gives the basic prerequisites for the efficient handling of documents and
activities in the different phases of design work. Other parts of this series are given as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The text of ISO Standard has been approved as suitable for publication as Indian Standard without
deviations. In this adopted standard, certain terminology and conventions are not identical to those
used in Indian Standards. Attention is particularly drawn to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Wherever the words ‘International Standard’ appear, referring to this standard, they should be
read as ‘Indian Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Comma (,) has befm used as a decimal marker while in Indian Standards the current practice
is to use a full point (.) as the decimal marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this adopted standard, reference appears
to certain International Standards for which Indian
Standards also exist. The corresponding Indian Standards which are to be substituted in their place
are listed below along with their degree of equivalence for the editions. indicated:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Type of document
is a general
classification
of docu-

with
regard
to application.
It may be
used
for
retrieval
purposes.
Examples
of
types
of
document
are:
assembly

Here,
the
advantages
of
reference

<<PARAGRAPH>>In connection
with

is often
included,
In
order
not
to
complicate
such
a computerization,
a
consecutive

method
should
be used. The
number
may be alphanumeric.
If the number
has any

meaning,
this

<<PARAGRAPH>>The identification

a supplement
to the

The retrieval

<<PARAGRAPH>>A retrieval

can be bought,
but
may
need
to
be adapted
to the organization
or even developed
and
tailored
by the organization
itself.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For copy distribution,
information
is needed
regarding
the name and address
of each subscriber,
the extent
and period of information
subscribed,
the
medium
and
the number
of copies,
These data may be stated
in a
Document

This

also contain
the

<<PARAGRAPH>>Retrieval
of earlier

<<PARAGRAPH>>Turnkey
systems,
which
are data-processing
systems
that
are ready to use when
installed,
have been
de-
veloped
by
computer
software
suppliers
for
both
classification
and
retrieval
of
data.
In general
such
systems
must be adapted
to the specific
needs of the
company.
Most turnkey
systems
are intended
for only
one
type
of classification
code.
This
may
be hierar-
chically
arranged
(see
figure 1),
such
as
decimal
classification,
or property
oriented
(see figure 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
technical
part
of
the
document,
optionally
to-
gether
with
a geometrical
representation,
describes
and
defines
the
product
concerned
in
its
finished
state, This document
part can be used as a basis for
the
document
classification,
enabling
efficient
re-
trieval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For retrieval
of
design
objects
with
one
or several
characteristics
in common,
a classification
of the ob-
jects
is
needed.
In
practice,
this
is
achieved
by
classification
of the
technical
contents
of the
docu-
ment. This classification
may be general
or specific.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A hierarchically-constructed
code
is advantageous
in
that it is often
known
at an early stage and is applied
e.g. for the company
parts
standard.
A disadvantage
is that the entire
code must be always
stated.
A code
based on characteristics
allows
a selective
search
for
the
desired
properties.
However,
such
a code
may
require
a great
number
of characters.
Often
the
two
types of classification
codes are combined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1
General
classification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>General classification
shall group
design
objects
with
regard to their
function,
shape,
material,
dimensions,
etc.
By
consistent
application
of
a general
classi-
fication,
the design
work
and the preparatory
work
in
production
are facilitated.
Functional
grouping,
for ex-
ample
for
a car,
may
be as follows:
engine,
trans-
mission,
body,
chassis,
etc.
Classification
by shape
may include:
round,
hexagonal,
flat,
etc. A complete
classification
will
include
both
principal
criteria
(such
as product
group) and criteria
for relevant
details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of the company,
a system

the organization
itself
may prove better.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
