FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Part III)
(Third
Revision ) was adopted by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 19 July
1976,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the Civil Works Measurement
Sectional
Committeehad
been approved by theCivil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
a very
important
place in planning
and
execution of any civil engineering work from the time of first-estimates
to
final
completion
and
settlement
of
payments
for
the project.
Methods followed for measurement
are not uniform and considerable
differences exist between practices
followed by one construction
agency
and another
and also between various Central
and State
Government
departments;
While it is recognized
that each system of measurement
h,as to be specifically
related to the administrative
and financial organi-
zations within the department
responsible
for work, a unification of the
various systems at technical
level has been accepted
as very desirable,
specially as it permits a wider circle of operation for civil engineering
contractors and eliminates ambiguities and misunderstandings
arising  out
of  inadequate understanding
of various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Among the various civil engineering items, measurement of buildings
was the first to be taken up for
standardization
and
this standard
having provisions relating
to all building works, was first published in
1958 and then revised in 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the
course of usage of this standard
by various
construction
agencies
in
the
country,
several
clarifications
and suggestions for
modifications
were received
and as a result of study, the Sectional
Committee decided that its scope, besides being applicable
to buildings,
should be expanded so as to cover civil engineering
works like industrial
and river valley project works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>is : 1296 ( Part III ) - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  Since various
trades
are not related
to one
another,
the Committee
decided
that method
of measurement
for each trade
as given in IS  :  1200-
1964* be issued
separately
as a different
part,
which
will be helpful
to
specific users in various
trades.
This part
covering
method
of measure-
ment of brickwork
applicable
to building
as well
as civil engineering
works was, therefore,
issued as a second revision
in 1970.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 In the course
of use of this standard
in the past five years based
on
suggestions
received,
certain
amendments
were issued to this standard.
This third revision
has been prepared
to incorporate
these amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a measurement,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS :2-1960t.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in
the
rounded
off value
should
be the
same as that of the
specified
value
in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
