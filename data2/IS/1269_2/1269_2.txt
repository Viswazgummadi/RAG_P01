<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 2) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after the draft finalized by the
Commercial Weights and Measures Sectional Committee had been approved by the Light Mechanical Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published as IS 1270: 1959 ‘Specification for metric, steel tape measures (winding) type‘
and was subsequently revised in 1965.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1964 and covered metric woven, metallic and glass fibre tape measures:
whereas steel tape measures were covered in IS 1270  : 1959  ‘Specification for metric, steel tape measures
(winding) type’ (subsequently revised in 1965). This revision has been brought out to merge the two standards
and to publish IS 1269 in two parts as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1 Woven metallic and glass fibre tape measures. and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 2 Steel tape measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the publication of this standard, IS 1270: 1965 ‘Specification for metric, steel tape measures (winding)
type’ will be withdrawn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This revision is based on the suggestions received from the Directorate of weights and Measures as a result
of practical application of the standard, more so as the  Standards of Weights and Measures .4ct  was revised
in 1976. The contents of this standard have also been harmonized with OIML Recommendation OIML
R-35  :  1977 ‘Material measures of length for general use’ issued by International Organization of Legal Metrology.
France. As a result of this harmonization, the following modifications have been introduced:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The definitions/terminology
used in Legal Metrology have been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tape lengths covered in this standard are extended upto 200 meters nominal length. Tapes for
0.5 m, 1.5 m, 3 m, 4 m and 5 m denomination are included, considering the maximum use of these tapes
by the common consumer required for measurements in day-to-day applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The material and construction of the tapes are defined in detail alongwith methods of testing and
checking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iii)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The graduation scale marking pattern on the tapes has been revised, to give more clarity and to avoid
any confusion while taking actual measurements.
Marking clause has also been revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iv)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The values of maximum permissible errors for graduation marking on tapes are redefined and based
on the permissible errors; classification has been made into three accuracy classes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>v)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value.
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2  :  1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised)‘.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in ltiis standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This Indian Standard ( Part 2 ) covers the
requirements for steel tape measures which are used
for measurements where the use of rigid length
measures is not convenient or practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3 NOMINAL LENGTH<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of this standard, following definitions/
terminologies shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The steel tape measures shall be made in nominal
lengths of 0.5 m, lm, 2m. 3m, 4m or 5 m or an integral

<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  Material measures of length<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The length measures covered by this standard are
material measures with scale marks, the distances
between which are indicated in legal units of length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
