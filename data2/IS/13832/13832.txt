<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted
the Pesticides

Agriculture
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Food
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dithiocarbamate
formulations
are extensively
used in agriculture
for the control of several fuagal
and bacterial diseases of plants.
This standard
will enable the food, health authorities
and others
engaged
in the fields
to follow a uniform
test procedure
for the estimation
of residues
of
dithiocarbamates
in various food commodities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard,
due consideration
has been given to the maximum limits of
dithocarbamate
residues laid under
the provisions
of  Prevention of Food Adulteration
Act,
2955
and the Rules framed
thereunder.
The test method
is restricted
to the prescribed
level of
residues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the result of a test or analysis
made in accordance
with
this standard,
