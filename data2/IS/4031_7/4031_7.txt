FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>original standard in 1968, a number of standards
covering the requirements
of different equipment
used for testing of cement,
a brief description
of which was also covered in the standard, had
been
published.
In
this
revision,
therefore,
reference
is given to different instrument
specifi-
cations
deleting
the description
of the instru-
ments, as it has been recognized that reproducible
and repeatable test results can be obtained
only
with
standard
testing
equipment
capable. of
giving desired level of accuracy.
This part covers
the
method
for determining
the compressive
strength of masonry
cement.
The criteria
for
accepting
compressive
strength
values has also
been incorporated
in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part 7 ) ( First Revi-
sion ) was adopted
by
the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 10 March
1988, after the draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been .approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Standard
methods
of testing
cement
are
essential
adjunct
to the cement
specifications.
This standard in different
parts
lays down the
procedure
for the tests to evaluate the physical
properties
of different types of hydraulic cements.
The procedure
for conducting
chemical
tests of
hydraulic cement .is,covered in IS  :  4032-1985*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Originally all the tests to evaluate the physi-
cal properties
of hydraulic cements were covered
in one standard
but for facilitating the use of
this standard and future
revisions,
it has been
decided
to print
the different
tests as different
parts
of the standard
and
accordingly,
this
revised
standard
has
been
brought
out in
thirteen parts. This will also facilitate updating of
individual tests. Further, since publication
of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a parti-
cular
requirement
of this standard is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance with IS  : 2-  1960*.
The number of significant places retained
in the
rounded
off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Place
a layer
of mortar
about 25 mrh in thickness
in
all
the
cube
compartments,
Tamp the mortar in each cube
compartment
32 times in about lOs, in four
rounds,
each .round to be at right angles to ,ihe
other and consisting. of eight adjoining  1  strokes
over the surface of the specimen as illustra?ed in
Fig.
1. The -tanbping pressure
shall
be
just
sutficient to ensure uniform filling of the moulds.
The four rounds of tamping:( 32 strokes ) of: .the
mortar
shall be completed
in an& cube ,bef’ore
going to the next.
When the tamping. of ,the
first layer in all of the cube compartments
is
completed,
fill
the
compartments
with
the
remaining mortar and then tamp as speci5ed for
the first layer.
During -tamping
bf the second
layer, bring’ in the mortar forced ,dttt on to the
tops of tbe moulds after each round of tampihg
by means of the gloved fingers and the tatiper
upon
completion
of
each round
and before
starting
the next round of tamping.
On com-
pletion of the tamping,
the tops of all cubes
should extend slightly
above
the tops sf the
moulds.  Bring  in  the mortar that has been forced
out on ta the tops of the moulds with a trowel
and. smooth
off the cubes by drawing the flat
side of the trowel, ( with the leading edge slightly
raised ) once across the top of each cube at right
angles  to  the length of the mould.
Then for the
purpose
of.. levelling the mortar and making the
m&tar
that protrudes
above the top
of
the
mould of more uniform thickness, draw  the flat
side of the trowel
with the leading edge slightly
raised)
lightly once along the length of the
mould.
Cut off the mortar
to a plane surface
5ush with the top of the mould by drawing the
straight edge of the trowel (held nearly prependi-
cular to the mould) with a sawing motion
over
the length of the mould.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Upon  the  completion
of mixing, the miiing
paddle  shall,be shaken to ‘remove excess? mortar
into the mixing bowl.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2 Carefully wipe the flow-table
top clean,
and dry and place ,the mould. at the
centre.
Place about 25 mm thick layer of mortar
mixed
in accordance with 7.3.1 in the mould and lamp
20,times with the tamping
rod.
The tamping
pressure shall be just sufficient to ensure uniform
filling of the mould.
Then fill the-mould with
mortar and tamp-as specified for the first, -layer.
Cut off the excess mortar to a plane iurf?ce,flush
with the top of the mould by drawing the,straight
edge of a trowel
( held .nearly
perpendicular
to the mould ) with a sawing motion .across
the
top of the mould.
Wipe the table toi clean and
dry, particularly
taking care td reillove anjr,waJer

the edge of the flow mould.
Lift
the mould
away from the mortar
one minute
after completion of the mixing operatiqn.
Imme-
diately drop.the table through a height, of 12’5
mm, 25 times in 15 s.
The flow is the resulting
increase in average base diameter of ,the mortar
mass, measured
on ,at least four diaheters
at
approximately
equi-spaced intervals expressed as
a  percentage of the briginal base diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 The material
for moulding

to the mlxmg bowl.
Quickly scrape down into
the batch the mortar that may have collected on
the side of the bowl and give the entire batch a
15 s mixing at medium

Start moulding
the specimens within a
total elapsed time of not more than 2 min and
15 s after completion
of the original mixing of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>in such  a  manner that
the upper
surfaces
shall
be exposed to the moist air. The cubes shall then
be removed from the moulds and placed
in the
moist
cabinet
for five days in such a manner as
to allow free circulation
of an around at least five
faces of the specimens
PIfter five days curing
in moist
cabinet,
the
cubes for

pressive
strength
shall be removed
for testing
whereas
the
cubes

shall be immersed
in clean water
for another
twenty-one days in storage tanks of
non-corrosive
materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.1 The cubes shall be tested on their sides
without any packing between
the cube and the
steel plattens
of the electrically
operated testing
machine.
One of the plattens
shall be carried
on a base and shall be self-adjusting.
An initial
loading up to one-half of the expected maximum
load for specimens
having expected
maximum
loads of more than 13 500 N may be applied at
any convenient
rate.
Apply no initial
loading
to specimens having expected maximum loads of
less than 13 500 N.
Adjust the rate of load
without interruption
so that the breaking strength
of the cube is reached in not less than 20 s and
not more than 80 s.
Make no adjustment
in the
control of the testing machine while
a specimen
is yielding rapidly immediately
before failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10. TESTING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  Test not less than three cubes for com-
pressive
strength
for each of the curing periods
of 7 and -28 days as indicated in 9.1, the periods
being reckoned from the completion
of moulding
and compaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11. CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1 The  measured
compressive
strength of the
cubes shall be calculated by dividing the maximum
load applied to the cubes during the test by the
cross-sectional
area, calculated
from
the mean
dimensions of the section and shall be expressed
to the nearest
0’5 Nlmm2.
In determining
the
compressive strength, do not consider
specimens
that are manifestly faulty, or that give strengths
differing
by more than
10 percent
from
the
average
value of all test specimens.
After dis-
carding specimens or strength values, if less than
two strength
values are left for determining the
compressive
strength
at any given
period,
a
retest shall be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Testing
of the cube specimens
shall
be
carried out immediately
aft& their removal from
the moist cabinet for 7-day specimens, and from
storage
water for all other specimens
If more
than one specimen at a time is removed from the
moist cabinet for 7-day tests, these cubes shall be
covered
with a damp cloth
until
the time of
testing.
If more than one specimen at a time is
removed
from
storage
water for testing, these
cubes shall be placed
in a pan of water
at a
temperature
of 2Y f 2°C and of sufficient depth
to completely
immerse each cube until the time
of testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
