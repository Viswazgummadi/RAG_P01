F O R E W O R D
0.1  This Indian Standard (Part VI) (Second Revision) was adopted by
the Indian Standards Institution on 8 February 1974, after the draft
finalized by the Civil Works Measurement Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2  Measurement occupies a very important place in the planning and
execution of any civil engineering work from the time of first estimates
to the final completion and settlement of payments for a project.
Methods followed for measurement are not uniform and considerable
differences exist among practices followed by different construction
agencies and also among various Central and State Government
departments. While it is recognized that each system of measurement
has to be specifically related to administrative and financial
organizations within a department responsible for the work, a
unification of various systems at technical level has been accepted as
very desirable specially as it permits a wider range of operation for
civil engineering contractors and eliminates ambiguities and
misunderstanding of various systems followed.
0.3  Among various civil engineering items, measurement of buildings
was the first to be taken up for standardization and this standard
having provisions relating to building work was first published in 1958
and was revised in 1964. In the course of usage of this standard by
various construction agencies in the country, several clarifications and
suggestions for modifications were received and as a result of study,
the technical committee responsible for this standard decided that its
scope besides being applicable to buildings should be expanded to
cover method of measurement of civil engineering works like
industrial and river valley projects.
0.4  Since different trades are not related to one another, the Sectional
Committee decided that each trade as given in IS : 1200-1964* shall be
issued separately as a different part. This will also be helpful to users
in using the specific standard. This part covers method of
measurement of refractory work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  This edition 3.2 incorporates Amendment No. 2 (May 1986). Side
bar indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of
the amendment. Amendment No. 1 had been incorporated earlier.
0.6  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a measurement, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard (Part VI) covers the method of measurement of
refractory work.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. GENERAL RULES
2.1 Clubbing of Items  — Items may be clubbed together provided
that the break up of the clubbed items is agreed to be on the basis of
the detailed description of the items stated in this standard.
2.2 Booking of Dimensions  — In booking dimensions, the order
shall be consistent and generally in the sequence of length, breadth or
width and height or depth or thickness.
2.3 Measurement  — Unless otherwise stated hereinafter all work
shall be measured net in the decimal system, as fixed in place, as given
in  2.3.1  to  2.3.4 .
2.3.1  Dimensions shall be measured to the nearest 0.01 m.
2.3.2  Areas shall be worked out to the nearest 0.01 m 2 .
2.3.3  Cubic contents shall be worked out to the nearest 0.01 m 3 .
2.3.4  Weight shall be worked out to the nearest 0.001 tonne.
2.4 Description of Items  — The description of each item shall,
unless otherwise stated be deemed to include, where necessary,
conveyance, delivery, handling, unloading, storing waste, return of
packing, necessary scaffoldings, platforms, walkways, tools and
tackles, stacking item wise, opening of packages and disposal of wood,
straw etc. This shall also include use of necessary equipments, safety
appliances, lighting at place of work, ventilation facilities, where
necessary.
2.5 Waste  — All measurement of cutting shall, unless otherwise
stated, be deemed to include consequent wastage.
2.6 Deduction  — Where a minimum area is defined for the deduction
of opening voids or both, such area shall refer only to openings or voids
within the space measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7 Work to be Measured Separately  — The refractory work to be
carried out in hot conditions shall be so specified indicating range of
temperature and work shall be measured separately.
2.8 Bills of Quantities  — The bills of quantities shall fully describe
the materials and workmanship and accurately represent the work to
be executed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. METHOD OF MEASUREMENT
3.1  The items of work wherever necessary and unless otherwise stated
shall be deemed to include the following:
a) Dressing of the bricks/blocks including cutting, grinding and
chipping to achieve proper thickness of joint and alignment as
required in the drawings for all classes of work.
b) Dressing of bricks/blocks including cutting, grinding and
chipping wherever necessary for expansion joints, sliding joints,
binding joints, etc, to ensure proper curvature and keying in
arches, curved surface, etc.
c) Forming of expansion joints, sliding joints, etc, excluding filling
(for filling  see   3.8 ).
d) Finishing, pointing, clearing and cleaning of masonry joints,
gaps, hollows, cavities, opening passages, ducts etc. for up to
0.1 m 2  each (  see  3.3  ).
3.2  The refractory and insulation bricks and blocks, types of mortars
and powders to be used shall be fully described. Other auxiliary and
filling materials, such as paper, cardboard, asbestos materials,
mineral wool, water glass, coke pitch, carbon mass, special sands,
crumbs, powders, admixtures and plasticizers required to be
incorporated in the works shall also be described.
3.3  All refractory work unless otherwise specified shall be measured in
cubic metres. The measurement shall be inclusive of mortar joints,
expansion joints and sliding joints. Deductions for voids, openings, etc,
shall be made only when the area of each such opening and voids
exceeds 0.01 square metre.
3.4  The method of measurement on volumetric basis as specified in  3.3
shall also apply for castable refractory work or refractory concreting,
rammed mass filling; filling of loose insulation materials, such as mica
crumbs, slag wools, asbestos powders, fireclay mass and carbon mass.
3.5  Where the brick/blocks lining is separated from the shell or wall
surface by the use of asbestos, cardboard, etc, such insulating material
shall be fully described and measured separately in square metres.
3.6  Where insulation plaster is applied over the refractory surface, the
same shall be fully described and measured separately in square metres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
