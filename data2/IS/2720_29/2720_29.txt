FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part XXIX ) ( First Revision ) was adopted by
the Indian Standards
Institution
on 22 September
1975, after the draft
finalized by the SoiI Engineering Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establishing uniform procedure for the determination
of
different characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating comparative studies
of the results,
the Indian
Standards
Institution
has brought
out this
Indian Standard methods of test for soils (IS: 2720) which is published in
parts.
This part [ IS:2720 (Part XXIX )-1975 ] deals with the determina-
tion of dry density of soil in-place by using a core-cutter.
The in-place
density of soil is needed for stability analysis, for the determination
of the
degree of compaction
of compacted
soil, etc.
The core-cutter
method
covered by this part is suitable for fine-grained soils free from aggregations.
It is less accurate
than
the
sand-replacement
method
and
is not
recommended,
unless speed is essential or unless the soil is well compacted.
Other parts relating to in-place determination
of density of soils are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Part XXXEV
Determination

method<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 This standard was first published in 1966. In this revision, the test
has been made applicable to soil 90 percent of which passes the 4.75mm
IS Sieve.
The dimensions and requirements
of the core-cutter
have been
modified.
Detailed requirements for the steel rammer required for the test
have been spelt out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2720 ( Part XXIX) - 1975<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  In  the fomulation
of this standard  due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.
This has been
met by basing the standard
on the
following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>BS 1377: 1974 Methods of testing soils for civil engineering purposes.

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2- 1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard  (  Part XXIX ) covers the method for the determination
of the in-place density of fine-grained natural or compacted soils free from
aggregates using a core-cutter.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1.1  For the purpose
of the tests described
in this standard,
a soil
shall be termed as fine-grained soil if not less than 90 percent of it passes a
4.75~mm IS Sieve.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3. PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The internal volume ( VC ) of the
.
core-cutter in cubic centimetres shall
be calculated from its dimensions which shall be measured to the nearest
0.25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The cutter shall be weighed to the nearest gram ( WC ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 A small area, approximately
30 cm square of the soil layer to be tested
shall be exposed and levelled.
The steel dolly &all be placed on top of the
cutter and the latter shall be rammed down vertically into the soil layer
until only about 15 ‘mm of the dolly protrudes above the surface, care being
taken not to rock the cutter ( see Note ).
The cutter shall then be dug
out  of the surrounding
soil, care being taken to allow some soil to project
from the lower end of the cutter.
The ends of the soil core shall then be
trimmed flat to the ends of the cutter by means of the straight edge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The cutting edge should be kept sharp.
The cutter
should not be used
in stony soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4 The cutter containing
the soil core shall be weighed to the nearest
gram  ( WS ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 The soil core shall be removed from the cutter and a representative
sample shall be placed in an air-tight container and its water content ( w )
determined as in IS:2720  (  Part II j-1973*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  It is necessary to make anumber
of repeat determinations
(at least three)
and to average results, since the dry density of the soil varies appreciably from point
to point.
The number
of determinations
should
be such that an additional
one
would not alter the average significantly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. CALCULATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The bulk density yb; that is, the weight of the wet soil per cubic
centimetre shall be calculated from the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ws -  WE
Ylc =
VC
,  g/cm3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Ws =  weight of soil and core-cutter in g,<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>WC =  weight of core-cutter in g, and<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vc = volume of core-cutter in cm3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The dry density Yd, that is, the weight of the dry
metre shall be calculated from the following formula:
soil per cubic centi-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Yd= 1oo+w
loo  yb ,  g/cm3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>YI, = bulk density ( see 4.1 ), and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>w = water content of the soil ( percent ) to two significant
figures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. REPORTING
OF RESULTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 The results of the test shall be recorded in a suitable form.
A recom-
mended  proforma

of the results of this test is given in

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The following values shall also be reported:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
