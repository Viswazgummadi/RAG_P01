FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Part
II ) was
adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 March
1967, after the draft finalized by the
Building Construction
Practices
Sectional
Committee
had been approv-
ed by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Concrete
slabs
with
different
colours,
textures
and
finishes
provide
possibilities
for
a wide range
of
architectural
treatment
for
external
facing
and
are
particularly
suited
for
wide
scale
adoption
in multi-storey
constructions.
While
finishes with natural
materials
like stone slabs are restricted
by the availability
of suitable
stones and the dressing possible
for facing,
the concrete
finishes can bc
made,
in order to obtain
a wide range of textures
and colours.
The
manufacture
and marketing
of white
cement
in this country
IIOW
has considerably
expanded
the
applicability
of concrete
to facing
work,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 However,
it may not be enough to make the concrete
blocks
and slabs in the same manner
as for interior
work since when exposed
to action
of weather,
the dimensional
changes
are much more and
concrete
has got to be carefully
designed to accommodate
this.
Speci-
ally made facing blocks or slabs are
necessary
for this purpose.
The
techniques
of fixing
concrete
facing
slabs
also
have
made several
advancements
with regard
to fixing devices
and their arrangements,
jointing
mortar,
etc, and their selection
with regard to exposure condi-
tions
and also
with regard
to types of units
with
which
they are
used.
Part II of this code is intended
to provide guidance with regard
to selection
of materials
and fixing techniques
for facing with.concrete
slabs;
Part
I covers
stone
facing
and
only
such
techniques
which
are considered
to be feasible
for adoption in this country
under the
present conditions
have been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevail-
ing in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 4101( Part II ) - 1967<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculat-
ed, expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in
accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of
significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value
should be the same
as that
of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard ( Part II ) covers fixing of cement concrete facing which
may be in the form of’precast
concrete
facing blocks or slab units.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2  This standard does not cover the fixing of prefabricated
panels of
plaster rendering
mosaic or terrazzo.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard, the following definitions shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Combing -
The
process
of graining
done with a flexible
toothed
metal plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Facing -
Where different parts of the, wall thickness are composed
of different materials
or grades
of materials,
facing refers to the outer
part of the wall,
composed
of one material
or grade
of material
and held to the other part ( backing ) by bonding or mechanical
anchors
or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Hardening Shrinkage -The
shrinkage that occurs in a freshly made
precast concrete
unit during the period of drying to maturity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4 Joint Sealing Compound -
A material
used by itself or in conjunc-
tion with mortar or other material
for making the joints watertight.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5 Mastic -A
general
term
for
any
substance
which
remains
pliable, used for adhesive compounds and joint sealing compounds.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6 Starey Level Support -  The support given to facings at storey levels,
SO  that there is not a tendency to continuous
load transfer
from the top
facings of the building down to those at ground level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Structural Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1  The structural
design
of facings
and their
attachments
must be
able to withstqnd,
without
damaging
the pushing
and pulling
effect
of
positive
and negative
air pressures
got by winds.
For design
data
with
regard
to wind loads reference
may be made
to IS  :  875-1964**.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2 In the case of cramp-supported
facings,
the stresses
induced
by
weight
of the
ficings
shall
also
be codsidered
in the
design
of the
cramps
or other
attachments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Types of Facing and Methods of Attachment -
Facings
and
veneer-
ings may be of two types:
4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attached
facings
for use with backing
only as a safe means
of
attachment
without
essentially
contributing
to the stability
or
load bearing
properties
of the wall,
and
Integrally
reacting
facings
which
are bonded
with the backing
and
contribute
to
the
structural
stability
and
strength
of
the wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods
of attachment
of facings
may
be any
one
of the
5.2.1
following:
a) Using

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Using
cramps
to hold
the units
in position
and
in, addition
’
to support
the units
thus
transferring
the weight
of the unit to
the backing;
or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The
facing
unit
may
contain
projections
which
mechanically
bond
into the backing
and support
the unit;
or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) By means
of masonry
bond
or keying
to the backing;
or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) By combinationspf
the above
methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 Where
cramps
are
used to hold the unit
in position
only,
the
facings
shall
be provided
with a continuous
support
on which
they rest
at
the
ground
level
and
other
storey
levels,
the :support
being
in
the
form
of projection
from
or recess in
the concrete
floor slab,
or
a beam
between
the columns
or a metal
angle
attached
to the floor slab
or beams.
These
supports
shail preferably
occur
at vertical
intervals
not
more
than
3.5 m apart
and
also
over
the
heads
of all
open-
ings.
Such supports
shall also
be provided
where
there
is a transition
from thin
facings
below
the thicker
facings
fixed above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -Generally
the
week
point
about
faoing
of high
walls
with
low
transmitting
facing slabs will be the dependence of the whole upon the performance
of each unit.
The failure
to hold a slab properly
in position
by accidental
omission of a faulty cramp or a  faihre
in an imperfect
facing, ebo, may
result
in
collapse of many facinga above
and  around the point of failure.
To obviate
this
risk intermediate
supports for facings will be essential.
However,
the streeees set
up in the lower most facings as a result
of accumulation
of the load will normally
be of such an order that can be borne by the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3  Staggering
-
Staggering
of vertical
joints
may also preferably
be adopted
to reduce
the danger
of wholesale
collapse.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  Supporting by Projecting  -Supporting
by
means
of projections
which
may mechanically
bond
into
the facing
is a common
method
of
attaching
concrete
facing
units.
Projecting
portions
must be reinforced
to prevent
failures.
In areas
of severe
exposure
the reinforcement
of the
concrete
shaI1 have enough
cover to minimize
the risk
of corrosion

shall
be attached
to the both
sides
of facing (see A in Fig. 1 ). Alternatively,
two cramps shall be attached
to one side of facing
and one
cramp
to the other
side (see
B  in
Fig. 1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.3  Top and Bottom
Attachment -
Two cramps at top and one at

of facing
shall be attached
in case the bottom
cramps
are
unsuitable
for bearing load ( see C in Fig. 1); where bottom cramps are
in position to bear load, two cramps
at bottom and one at top shall be
attached
(see  D  in Fig. 1 ).
For making
arrangement,
more simpler,
two double
cramps shall be attached
at bottom and top of the facing
block ( see  E  in Fig. 1).
In case vertical joints are grouted and cramps
carry no weight,
two double cramps shall be attached
one at bottom
and the other at the top (see F in Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tuck, ruled,
square,
weathered-struck
or rebated,
as in Fig. 2.
Where
expansion joints
are formed
in the general structure
or backing
walls,
these joints shall also be carried through the facing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.1 TO make the joints

are used in other countries but these
compounds
are not generatly
available
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.2 For prevention
of travel of moisture from the backing
to the
facing
where such trouble
is envisaged,
sometimes
it may be useful
to attach the facing unit with only dabs of mortar instead with applica-
tion of mortar to the whole of the ,backing.
However,
this procedure
will have disadvantages
compared
to solid filling,
such as less piotec-
tion against
impact,
tendency
to warping and less security
of cramp
fixing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6. FIXING PRECAST CONCRETE SLAB FACINGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The facings
can be fixed with butt joints,
single
and double
joggled
joints
or grouted
joints
as illustrated
in Fig. 2, 3 and 4.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 When
the backing
wall is of  in situ  concrete
it will be of advantage
to use dovetailed
non-corrosive
metal
channels
cast vertically
in the
backing
wall
in which
one end of the cramps
fit, the other
end being
cranked
or drilled
for dowells,
the cramps
being
set into the channel
as
the fixing proceeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3  Use of Butt Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1  Butt joint
is the simplest
form of joints
and may be used when the
facing
unit
has
a projection
into
a backing
to provide
mechanical
bond.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2 It may
also
be used
when
it has
no such
projection
with
the following
arrangements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The weight
of the facing
unit
is transmitted
to the facing
unit
under
it and
the facing
unit is attached
to the backing
with
mortar
only ( see Al in Fig. 4 ).
b) The
weight
of the
facing
units
is transmitted
to the filcing
unit
below
but
the
facing
unit
is attached
to the
backirlg
by means
of flat
cramps
and
by mortar.
The
split
end
01
the cramp
shall
be fixed to the facing
u&t by making
a groove
in it ( see A2 in Fig. 4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Part of the weight
of the facing
unit
is transmitted
directly
to
the backing
by means
of a rag bolt ( see A3 in Fig. 4  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4  Single Joggled Joint -
In
the
case
of single
joggled
joints
when
side cramps
are used they need only be single
cramp
as, one side of the
cramp
is already
held
in position.
The. positionill
g of single
cramp
will be easier
than
that
of double
cramps
in practice
(see 82  and B3
in Fig. 4).
Where
lec$ed
type of facing
is used in coljjunction
with an
inverted
single-joggle
Joint,
probably
cramps
may not be necessary
and
the joint
shall
be as shown
in Fig. 5.

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Double Joggled
Joint -
Double
joggled
joint
( see Cl
in Fig. 4 )
will not be suitable
for vertical
joints
as the sliding
action
necessary
to engage
the unit
vertically
will interfere
with the proper
bedding
of
the
horizontal
joint
and
the
bond
to the
backing
wall
mortar.
This
type
of joint
shall,
however,
be suitable
for
horizontal
joints;
it locks the units
to one another
by positive
action,
but cramps
may be
needed
to hold
the
units
to the wall
as illustrated
in C2 in Fig. 4.
Cramps
when
fitted to the wall with the help of rag bolt as shown in C3
in Fig.
4 shall
be in
position
to support
the weight
of construction
at intermediate
levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6 The grouted
joint
as shown
in Dl in Fig. 4 shall stabilize
the facing
system if applied
to all horizontal
and vertical
joints.
When
this type of
joint
is qe@ horizontally
care shall be taken
to ensure
that
as much as
possible
the upper
groove
is filled with
mortar.
When
using
this type
of joint
as a vertical
joint
it may be advantageous
to plank
off or caulk
the
external
portion
of the joint
up to the outer
edge
of the
core
with rolled
paper.
The joint
shall be filled with cement
sand grout
and
the rolled
paper
shall be extracted
out when the grout has partially
set<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_18>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 4101 (Part
II) - 1967<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and the joint shall be pointed
immediately.
Cramps may be used for
supporting the unit with the wall and aIso for bearing load partially
as
in 02 and 03 in Fig. 4, respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.7  The thickness of joints may vary from 6 to 10 mm. Where necessary
from architectural
considerations,
thickness of weathered joints may be
more but shall never exceed 15 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.  CONTROL
OF ALIGNMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  The a\ppearance of the finished
wall face exhibiting
a plain surface
will be easily
marked
by inaccuracies
of alignment.
Accuracy
of
alignment
will depend
upon the control
of uniform size for the cover-
ings, freedom from warping
as well as in the accuracy
with which the
cramps
are fixed.
Where
practicable
the backing
wall shall
be built
simultaneously
with the fixing of facings as this will assist in maintaining
the correct
alignment
of the facings.
Inaccuracies
in alignment
of
slabs to some extent will be masked by the treatment
of the joints, for
example,
by the use of chamfered,
slightly rounded or rebated
edge in
place
of simple
squared
edge.
Such
an edge
will in addition
be
free from chipping due to handling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
