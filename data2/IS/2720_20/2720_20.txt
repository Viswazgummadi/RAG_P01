<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized
by
the Soils and Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engiueering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With
a view to establish
uniform
procedures
for the determination
of different
characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating
comparative
studies
of the
results,
an Indian Standard
Methods
of Test for Soils IS 2720 has been
published
in 41 parts.
This part
deals with the
determination
of the
linear
shrinkage
of soils.

of soils having low clay contents.
The
test is of value in indicating

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1966.
In
this
revision
apart
from
general
updation,
the two amendments
issued
have
been incorporated
and the quantities
and dimensions
have
been given in SI units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied

the result

analysis,

rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical

The number of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the
same as that
of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The
mould
shall
be thoroughly
cleaned
and a thin film of grease shall then be applied
to its inner
walls in order to prevent
the soil
from adhering
to the mould.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Title<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 About 150 g of the soil sample passing
425
micron
IS Sieve ( see 4.1 ) shall be placed
on
the flat glass plate and thoroughly
mixed with
distilled
water,
using the palette knives, until
the
mass
becomes
a smooth
homogeneous
paste,
with
a moisture
content
approximately
2 percent
above
the
liquid
limit of the soil
( see Note 1 and Note 2). In the case of clayey
soils,
the
soil paste
shall be left to stand for
a sufficient
time ( 24 h ) to allow the moisture
to permeate
throughout
the
soil mass.
The
thoroughly
mixed
soil-water
paste
shall
be
placed
in the mould such that
it is slightly
proud
of the
sides of the mould.
The mould
shall then
be gently jarred to remove any air-
pockets
in the paste.
The
soil shall then be
levelled
off along
the
top of the mould with
the palette
knife.
The mould shall be placed
so that the soil-water
mixture ( paste ) can air.
dry slowly, until the soil has shrunk away from
the walls of the mould
( see Note 3 ). Drying
should then be completed
first at a temperature
of 60 to 65°C until shrinkage has largely ceased
and then
at
105 to
110°C to complete
the
drying.
The
mould
and soil shall
then
be
cooled and the mean
length
of.soil bar meas-
ured if the specimen has become curved during
drying.
The
measurement
should
be made
along the mean arc ( see Note 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
