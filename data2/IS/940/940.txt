<<PARAGRAPH>>Fire Fighting Sectional Committee, CED 22<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Fourth Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Fire Fighting Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Portable fire extinguisher, water type (gas cartridge) is one of the types of the tire extinguishers used as first-aid
fire fighting appliance. This type of extinguisher is suitable for fighting fires in Class A fires, that is, in wood,
textiles, paper, etc. The details in regard to maintenance of this appliance in efticient condition are given in
IS 2190 ‘Code of practice for selection, installation and maintenance of portable first-aid fire extinguishers (third
revision)’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1961 and subsequently revised in 1972, 1976 and 1989. In this revision, the
principal modifications made are in respect of providing cap having squeeze grip type COZgas cartridge puncture
mechanism and also on-off control discharge. Squeeze grip type cap has following advantages over the conventional
cap:
a) It is safe in operation as the operation need not hit the knob with force by hand.
b) The discharge can be halted and restarted at the will of the operator.
c) It has built in operation lever and carrying handle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other modifications made are as follows:
a) Stainless steel body is included to provide resistance from corrosion and good aesthetic appearance.
b) Internal plastic lining of the extinguisher to avoid corrosion in usage.
c) Type test for leaded tin alloy coating and stainless steel bodies have been incorporated.
d) Epoxy powde- coating for external surface is included to improve the scratch hardness, life and aesthetics.
e) Provision of thickness of body in accordance with bursting formulae.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to above various provisions have been updated which are based on experience gained in the use of this
appliance in the past.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A scheme for Iabelling environment friendly products known as ECO-Mark has been introduced at the instance
of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF), Government of India. The ECO-Mark would be administered
by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) under the BLSACI,1986 as per the Resolution No. 71 dated21 February
1991 and No. 425 dated 28 October 1992 published in the Gazette of the Government of India. For a product to be
eligible for marking with ECO logo, it shall also carry the 1S1Mark of BIS besides meetinq additional optional
environment friendly requirements. For this purpose, the Standard Mark of BIS would be a single mark being a
combination of the 1S1Mark and the ECO logo. Requirements to be satisfied for a product to quali~ for the BIS
Standard Mark for ECO friendliness are optional; manufacturing units are free to opt for the IS Mark alone also .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This clause is based on the Gazette Notification No. 160 dated 1April 1999 for fire extinguishers as environment
friendly products published in the Gazette of the Government of India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised’.
The  number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

volume to ensure that when the discharge nozzle is
temporarily
closed and the extinguisher
put into
operation at a temperature of

Epoxy polyester powder coating of 50 micron
thickness may also be applied on internal and external
surfaces of the mild steel body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A snifter valve shall be fitted to extinguisher.
The
design of the snifter valve shall be such that in the
variation of atmospheric temperature within + 10 ‘C,
there shall not be any spouting of liquid through the
nozzle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9  PAINTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  Each extinguisher body except stainless steel body
shall be painted ‘Fire Red.’ or Post OffIce red as per
shade 536 or 537 of IS 5, either by epoxy powder
coating or synthetic enamel paint. Stainless steel body
shall be buffed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9  Gas Cartridge
and Cartridge
Holder<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A cartridge holder shall be provided and fitted inside
the cap in such a way that the cartridge seal piercing
mechanism passes through its centre and shall puncture
the cartridge clean when the cartridge is fitted to this
holder.
The threads shall be provided in the holder ,
and these shall correspond to the threads of gas cartridge
(see IS 4947). Pot holes shall also be provided in the
cartridge holder. The maximum size of gas cartridge
shall be 60 g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
