<<HEADING level=3>>0. F-OREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 28 January
1982, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Indian Standards
Institution
has already published a series of
standards
on
methods
of testing
cement and concrete.
It has been
recognized that reproducible
and repeatable
test results can be obtained
only with standard  testing  equipment capable of  giving
the  desired level of
accuracy.
The Sectional Committee has, therefore, decided to bring out a
series of specifications covering the requirements
of equipment
used for
testing cement and concrete,
to encourage
their development
and manu-
facture in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Accordingly, this standard has been prepared to cover requirements
of
the cylindrical metal measures used in testing aggregates and concrete. The
relevant methods of tests wherein use of these measures is called for are
covered in IS  :  1199- 1959” and IS  :  2386 ( Part III )-1963t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard, due weightage has been given to
international co-ordination among the standards and practices prevailing
in
different
countries
in addition
to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS  :
2-196Of.
The number
of significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of  sampling  and analysis of concrete.

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.  SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard covers the requirements
of cylindrical
metal measures
used in tests for determining the following:
a) Bulk density and voids of aggregates for concrete, and
b) Weight
per cubic metre, yield, cement
factor
and
air
content
( gravimetric ) of freshly mixed concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.  CYLINDRICAL
METAL MEASURES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Cylindrical metal measures shall be of capacities 3, 10, 15, 20 and 30
litres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. MATERIAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The material of construction
of cylindrical
metal measures shall be
mild steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
Use of mild steel conforming
to IS  : 226-1975*  is recommended.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. DIMENSIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Dimensions
with tolerances for cylindrical
metal measures specified
in 2.1 shall be as given in Table
1. Where tolerances are not specifically
mentioned, dimensions shall be considered nominal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
Allowable deviations for nominal dimensions
shall be as laid down
for
coarse class of deviation in IS  :  2102-1969t.<<HEADING_END>>
