Test Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.1
The equipment
required
for Salt Spray Test consists
of a fog chamber,
a salt solution
reser-
voir,
a supply
of suitably
conditioned
compressed
air, one or more atomizing
nozzles,
specimen
supports,
provision
for heating
the chamber,
and necessary
means of control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
size and detailed
construction
of the equipment
are optional,
provided
the conditions
obtained
meet the requirements
of this test.
The chamber
shall
be insulated
to avoid
temperature
gradients,
particularly
with
a chamber
temperature
of 35°C &.2X.
With
small
cabinets,
this
is
conveniently
effected
by me~ans of a double
skin construction,
incorporating
a water
jacket
for
temperature
control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.2
Drops
of solution
which
accumulate
on
the ceiling
or cover of the chamber
shall
not be
permitted
to fall on the specimens
being tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-l.3
Drops of solution
which fall from the
specimen
shall
not be returned
to the solution
reservoir
for  re-spraying.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.4
The spray from the atomizing
nozzle
or nozzles
shall
be prevented
from
impinging
directly
on the test specimen
by means of suitable
baffles.
The solution
condensing
on the baffles may be
returned
to the salt solution
reservoir;
this can effect
a substantial
economy
in
rate
consumption
of the solution.
Adjustable
baffles are of assistance
in obtaining
a uniform
collection
rate through-
out the test zone of the chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-1.5
Materials
of
construction
shall
be such
that
they will
not affect the corrosiveness
of fog
( glass, rubber or certain
plastic
materials
are suitable
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.6
The equipment
shall
be sited so as to be in diffused
light and away from
radiators
or other
sources
of heat and draughts
in order to facilitate
temperature
control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-2.  Test Samples<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.1  The number
of test specimens
to be used,
as well as the criteria
for
the
evaluation
of the
test results,
shall be defined
in the specifications
of the product
being tested
or shall
be mutually
agreed upon by the purchaser
and the supplier.

<<HEADING level=3>>B-3.  Position
of Specimens
during Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.1  The specimens
shall
be suspended
by cotton,
nylon or any suitable
thread
vertically.
Unless
otherwise
specified,
the specimens
shall
be supported
between
15” to 30” from
the vertical
and
preferably
parallel
to the principal
direction
of horizontal
flow of fog
through
the
chamber.
The
test specimens
shall
be at least
30 mm from any other specimen
and 35 mm from any wall of the
chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.2
The specimens
shall
not contact
each other or any metallic
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.3
Each specimen
shall
be so placed as to permit free settling
of fog on allspecimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.4 The salt solution
from one specimen
shall
not be allowed
to drip on to any other specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-4.1  Preparation
of Solution
-
Dissolve
50 f5
g  sodium
chloride
in each litre
of distilled
or de-
ionized
water or water containing
less than
100 ppm of total dissolved
solids
and substantially
free
from dissolved
heavy metals particularly
nickel, copper and iron.
The pH of the solution
shall
Abe
such that, when atomized
under the test condition,
the collected
solution
will be in the pH range
of
6’5 to 7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-5. Air Supply<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8-5.1
The compressed
air supply
to the nozzle or nozzles
for atomizing
the salt solution
shall
be
free
from
oil,
oil
vapour
and
dirt,
and
shall
be maintained
between
0.67 bar and
1’72 bar
( 1 bar z 1 kg/cm2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-5.2 The air shall
be saturated
with
moisture
by means of water wash or humidifying
tower,
after
suitable
filtration.
It is preferable
to operate
the tower
at temperature
well
above
the chamber
temperature
to ensure wet fog to offset
heat losses and to maintain
the required
temperature
in the
chamber.
The tower temperature
should
be adjusted,
so that both the collection
rate and
compo-
sition
of collected
fog are kept within
the specified
limits.
For guidance,
the following
table
shows
lower temperature
at different
air pressures
required
to offset the cooling
effect of expansion
at the
nozzle or nozzles
to atmospheric
pressure
with a chamber
temperature
of 35°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>-The nozzle
or nozzles
may be operated
intermittently
by means of a suitable
timer and relay
actuating
a solenoid
valve in the air supply,
providing
that the fog is maintained
continuously.
This
provides
means of adjusting
the collection
rate and it also ensures
a more consistant
fog distri-
bution
with minimal
directional
effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-6. Test
Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-6.1  Temperature
-
The exposure
zone of the test chamber
shall
be maintained
at 35f2”C.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-6.2  Atomization
and Quality
of Fog -  At least two clean
fog collectors
shall
be placed
in the
exposure
zone in the proximity
of the test specimens,
one near to a nozzle
and another
as far as
possible
from nozzle.
They shall
be positioned
so that
no test
solution
falling
from
the test
specimen
is collected.
The fog shall
be such that for each 8 000 mm2 of horizontal
collecting
area
there
will
be collected
in each collector
from
1 to 2 ml of solution
per hour determined
over an
operating
period
of at least 16 hours.
( Standard
laboratory
glass funnels
or dishes
with
100 mm
dia have horizontal
area of 8000 mm 2 ).
The collected
spray solution
shall contain
50 5 IO g/l of
sodium-chloride
( specific
gravity
1.0255 to 1’040 0 at 25°C ) and pH shall
be 6’5 to 7’2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-7.  Continuity
of Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bi7.1
Unless otherwise
specifLed in the specifications
of the product
being tested,
the test shall
be ‘;:
continuous
fort
he duration
of the
entire
test
period.
Continuous
operation
implies
that
the
.,‘p
chamber
be closed
and
the
spray operating
continuously
except for the short daily
interruptions
necessary
to inspect,
rearrange,
or remove test specimens,
to check and replenish
the solution
in
the reservoir,
and to make necessary
recordings.
Operations
shall
be so scheduled
that these
interruptions
are kept at a minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-6. Period of Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-8.1  The period
of test shall be 48 hours.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B-9.1  The following
procedure
shall
be carried
out :<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Expose the specimen
in the cabinet
for the specified
perio,d.
2) Remove the specimen,
wash in cold running
water and dry off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consequent
,to the
decision
to revise
IS : 1367-1967, splitting
it into
separate
parts,
this
:tga$rdard on requirements
for
phosphating
of
fasteners
has been formulated.
Although
IS : 3618-
‘ Phosphate
treatment
of iron and steel for protection
against
corrosion
’ covers the general
requirements
for phosphating,
a need was felt for special
requirements
of fasteners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard,
assistance
has been taken from
BS : 3189-1973 ‘Phosphate
treatment
of iron and steel, ’ issued
by the British
Standards
Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
