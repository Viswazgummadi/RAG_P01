reat devastation
along a narrow path.
Its chief characteristics
are the
ollowing:
a><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under
a heavy
cumulonimbus
cloud
there
hangs
a funnel-
shaped cloud which marks the vortex and, as the storm moves
along, may or may not touch the earth;
Heavy precipitation
and ( usually ) hail occur, with thunder.
In
addition to the thunder, there is the roar attending
the tornado
cloud when it touches the surface:
The winds blow spirally upward around the axis of the tornado
cloud; and
The speed of the storm itself in travelling
over the earth
is
comparatively
slow 40 to 65 km an hour;
its path is short
averaging about 480 km.
