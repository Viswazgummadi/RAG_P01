<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 2) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft linalized by
the Rock Mechanics Sectional Committee had been approved bythe Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Buildings in hilly regions are constructed
on varying types of foundation
soil and rock formations
occurring on hill slopes, undulating ground, hill tops and level terraces. The behaviour and geological
characteristics of such sites are in general significantly different from those encountered
in plains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cost of site development in hilly areas is much more than that in plains. The stability of the sites especially
after cutting hill slopes to obtain level ground to locate the building greatly affects the cost of site
developement.
Such costs are about 20 to 40 percent of the total cost of building complex or even more
on unsuitable sites.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Improper selection and development of building sites often causes landslides. This causes damages to
buildings and loss of life and injury to the occupants, and the affected area remain in danger from probable
landslides, uprooting of trees and related surfacial movements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Damage to buildings located on cut slopes, often occur due to failure of the cutting, which may have been
excavated without any considerations of its stability. Methodology for stability analysis and excavation of
cut slopes and construction of protection works vary from hill to hill and from area to area depending on
the character
of geological
formations,
vegetation,
weathering
and various other climatological,
geohydrological
and metreological conditions in region.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off values should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>13063  :  1991 Code of practice for structural safety
of buildings on shallow foundations

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard (Part 2) gives guidelines for the
selection of building sites in mountainous terrains
on various types of soils and rock with least slope
stabilization and/or protection works. An in-
dividual building site, depending upon the specific
requirement, importance and special foundation
soil and terrain characteristics
may require
separate detailed study and investigations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 STABILITY OF SLOPES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Hill slopes and cuttings which are stable under
normal climate and weather conditions undergo
movements and failures due to weathering along
joints and other discontinuities in rocks, changes in
drainage conditions, erosion and surface excava-
tions, earthquakes and other causes. Surfacial soil
and rocks over lying  in-situ  rock often undergo
creep
movements,
and
under
extreme
hydrometerological conditions result in debris
slides and avalanches. Field survey and stability
analysis of hill slopes and cuttings should be carried
out and buildings located on stable hill slopes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 In high altitude cold regions  freezing  and  thaw-
-
ing of the ground pose special problems which
require separate careful study for selection of build-
ing sites and evaluate the depth ofbuilding founda-
tions. Also snowfall and avalanches along steep
slopes which result in damage to building require
detailed investigations for each site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Cuttings and excavations on stable hill slopes
are made to locate buildings, Such cuttings often
require protection works which adds to the site
development costs. It is essential to ensure stability
of such cuttings to have adequate safety of the
buildings. Cut slopes as shown in Table 1 with
height less than 5 m or two to three storey heights
of residential buildings are in general stable. For
higher cut slopes special investigations should be
carried out and details of protection works should
be worked out and implemented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

flood plain deposits, rock scree and other overbur-
den material over ~-situ rock, adequate clearance
in between the outer face of the wall of building
facing the hill side and the toe of the buttress or
retaining Walls constructed for protection of cut
slope is required to be provided. The width of the
clearance depends upon the stability of the cutting
with its protection works and the probable extent
of movement of soil debris of cut slope forming
slope angle of about 40” or equal to the angle of
repose of talus or the soil rock aggregate,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 SELECTION OF BUILDING SITES IN HILLY
AREAS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Building sites in hilly areas are generally lo-
cated on slopes and hill tops with roads girdling in
between levels to provide access to the residences.
Large flat grounds and valley bases are left as open
spaces for recreational and agricultural use. For
selection of an individual building site, nature and
behaviour of soil or rock (and dip and strike of
discontinuity surfaces) should be assessed at the
cuttings or test pits (450 mm x 450 mm) at bottom
and 1 to 2.m in depth or by augur boring (in soils).
Many rocks behave like clay or silt on wetting or on
submergence, rock pieces should therefore be kept
in water for 24 hours for assessing the  effect of
wetting.
4.2 Hill sides with less than 30” slope in general are
noted to be stable as the gradient correspond to safe
angle of repose of slope forming material. Stable
slopes steeper than 30” with  in-situ  rock exposure
are encountered in hilly terrain, if the discontinuity
surfaces dip into the hill to prevent outward and
downward movement of rock wedges. Building sites
should in general be located on hill side with not
more than 30“ slope. None residential temporary
buildings may be constructed on steeper slopes up
to 45”. The heights of cutting in hill slopes should
not exceed as detailed in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 The foundation
of an individual building
should be located away from the edge of the ter-
races formed as natural flood plain deposits or
constructed by cutting and filling along the hill side
or at the river bank. Such foundations should lie
away from the line extending from the toe of the
terrace or the river bank at an angle of 30”. The
location of buildings with respect to other drainage
courses or streams should also be at safe distances
depending on the angle of repose of material exist-
ing in the area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6 Individual buildings should be so oriented that
it is properly sunlit and it shall not be located on.
the bottom of the valleys or permanent shadow
zones of ridges and peaks, and high wind zones. The
buildings shall be so oriented that no part of the
building can be blown off during high winds or hit
by falling boulders and avalanches from steep
slopes and cliffs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7 In hilly areas the building interact with wind,
modifying flow pattern in its own neighbourhood
and generating a new flow regime mainly depend-
ing upon locations of building sites on the hill
slopes with respect to whole valley. A new flow
regime shall produce small scale turbulance in the
flow, the magnitude and direction of the turbulant
flow depending upon the orientations of the in-
dividual buildings. Such turbulant flow over the
surface of the building determines the wind loads
on the building, specially on the roofs. In areas
where important building complex are proposed in
hilly terrains it is advisable that model studies are
undertaken and wind pressures determined. It is
desirable that the direction of prominent winds are
observed and orientation of buildings is choosen
accordingly. Sheet roofings in buildings in hilly
terrains should be provided with ties, properly
hooked in the roof and embedded in the ground.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Building foundations resting on  in-situ  rock
with discontinuity surfaces, if any, dipping inside
the hill are in general stable and buildings may be
constructed without any clearance in between the
building and the rock face. Stepped storeyed build-
ings may be planned on such hard stable rock zones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8 Hill sides susceptible to landslides and erosion
at toe due to probable meandering of the rivers and
gullies should be avoided to locate the buildings.
Hill sides with  moderate  soil  cover supporting thick
vegetation with tall trees often are uprooted and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>d)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The building site should be at a reasonably higher
level above river and gullies such that the site is
unaffected
by landslide
dam reservoirs.
In
Himalayan region, landslide dams are often formed
in narrow gorges ofweak rocks in cloud burst prone
areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The site should also be much away from quarries as
repeated blasting may cause landslide or cracks in
the building due to slope movement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.9 If the hill side consist of  in-situ  rock strata
exposed on the surface with dips greater than 20”
outwards from the hill side safety against creep or
sliding of the rock strata should be checked and
factor of safety against sliding of the hill side should
not be less than 1.2 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.13.1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Detailed geotechnical investigations should
be done by competent geotechnical engineers and
engineering geologists who will certify that the site
after development is stable along with slopes in the
above situations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 GEOTECIINICAL
INVESTIGATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.10 Hill sides having extensively folded, faulted,
fractured and fissured rock strata should be avoided
for location of buildings. In case of non-availability
of other sites detailed geotechnical investigations
should be undertaken
to check the stability of hill
side before a decision is taken to locate a building.
The location of building complex in such cases shall
preferably be finalised by a technical committee
consisting of a geotechnical
engineer, a civil en-
gineer, a geologist, a town planner and an architect
or a technical commitee of a Municipal Corpora-
tion in case of private construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Site development
in hilly regions consumes
about 30 to 40 percent of total cost of building
complex, therefore
the following investigations
shall be done to obtain the following geotechnical
parameters:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Type of Soil Rock  :  Weathered or intact, dip
of bedding
planes, drainage
conditions,
shear planes, material between the joints,
tension cracks, type of plantation, verticality
of trunks of the trees, etc.
Thickness of overburden,
nature of soil-
strata, details of soil matrix, etc.
Estimation of shear-parameters
of the  in-
situ  soil mass which will govern the failure.
Drainage
pattern
of the area and per-
meability
tests in the area to see the
drainage conditions.
Specific slip zones in the area, if any.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.11 In hill sides with varying near surface soil and
rock strata which could undergo unequal settle-
ments, buildings should be so planned, oriented
and designed that higher loads comes on the more
compact foundation strata. Such situations are very
frequently observed on hill sides. Width and depth
of foundations have to be suitably designed depend-
ing upon the distribution of the soil and hard rock
strata in different parts of the foundations, and the
dimensions worked out conservatively
for softer
rock or soilbase part of the foundation
in com-
parison to hardrock part of the foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>e)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 After above parameters have been obtained it
shall be decided as to what type of buildings are to
be constructed
that is whether of rigid type or
flexible type. Both have their own merits and
demerits. The type of buildings shall depend upon
the specific requirement
of buildings and whether
they are temporary or permanent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.12 For heterogeneous
rock and soil mass existing
on hill sides RCC strip foundations
should be
provided. There should be enough reinforcement
along the wall to take care of loose and soft pockets
below strip footing. In case of framed structures
with isolated footing structural
beams intercon-
necting isolated footing shall be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The safe bearing capacity of building foun-
dations shall be calculated. Where seismic
forces arc also considered; the safe bearing
capacity shall be increased as specified in
IS 1893 :’ 1984.
Building
foundations
shall
be fully
safeguarded against thecauses ofsettlcment
(see IS 13063  :  1991 and IS 12070  :  1987).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.13 Detailed gcotechnical

<<PARAGRAPH>>these structures and so for the safety of foundation,
the ingress of surface or sub-surface water behind a
structure may be prevented by constructing proper
surface drains and keeping soak pit far away.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 TERRACE DEVELOPMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Following points shall be kept in mind during
development of terrace for a building site:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Height of Cutting -  shall be as minimum as
possible. It shall not be more than given in
3.2. Slope of cutting shall be kept as given in
Table 1 or as slope of stable-cuts observed
at the nearby buildings and roads.
Clearance Around Buildings -
Failed cut
slopes will tend to make a slide debris with
a slope angle of about 40” or equal to angle
of repose. For a typical site for construction
of a building on hill-slope suitable clearance
shall be left between edge of cut-face and
outer face of the wall of building even if
breast wall is constructed
for protection
of
cut slope. A minimum clearance of 1.5 m
between toe of wall and building wall should
be provided. A suitable breast wall may be
made, when soil or soil mixed boulder
deposit rests over rock which are mostly met
in practice. On valley side, the clearance
should be such that base of foundation rests
on firm soil or rock and not on filled up
ground. It should be more than 1.5 m. Top
of soil crust should be made impervious by
any suitable method such as stone pitching,
vegetation, etc. In case of hill sides with hard
stable rock mass stepped storeyed buildings
without any clearance in between hill face
may be constructed.
Blasting -
The effect of blasting on slope
conditions is a most significant factor and as
far as possible it should not be resorted to
for rock-cutting. If necessary, it may be res-
tored to when rock is very hard and of stable
nature and when there’are no structures in
thevicinity. It shall only becarried out under
thorough
and competent
supervision
and
with the written permission of appropriate
authorities,
taking all precautions
con-
nected with blasting operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 The slope of ground all around building should
be not less than 1 : 50 built in such a way that rain
water does not find way to ingress in ground exces-
sively and moves away quickly to surface drains or
away on adjoining
hill surface towards natural
streams.  A  minimum of 0.75 m wide apron should
be provided all around the building to prevent entry
of water into foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Proper Orientation of Building<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Buildings in hilly areas should be so planned,
oriented and designed but higher load comes on
harder part of foundation soil. Since inner side of
cut slope may have higher bearing capacity, build-
ing should be so oriented and planned that higher
load may come on inner side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Width of developed land in hilly areas is often
quite small and restricted
because of cuttings.
Therefore,
longer buildings should be planned in
view of above facts depending
on the slope of
ground and width of land available after cutting. If
it is an office complex or school which cannot be
planned in. one long building or the length of the
complex is more than 50 m, then it should be built
in a number of smaller and stepped storeyed build-
ings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6 Protective works  like  drains, breast wall, stone-
pitching, cut slope trimming, plantation
or other
protective and drainage works shall be completed
as early as possible. Delay in execution of protec-
tion and drainage works result in manifold increase
of problems during rains. These works shall not be
delayed. Preferably these be done simultaneously as
cutting progresses. No site development
work like
cutting in loose soil, rock strata or protection work
should preferably be done before rains and during
monsoon season.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Proper Drainage -
On the uphill side of a
building on a sloping site, drainage requires
special consideration.
The natural flow of
water shall be diverted away from the foun-
dations. Suitable lined or unlined drains
shall be provided all around the building in
order to get proper drainage. The rain water
should flow as scattered as possible towards
water course or stream or main drains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.7 The material excavated for site development
shall be disposed of properly in such a manner that
it causes no problem of maintenance
and is not a
source of trouble to neighbouring lower sites. It has
been seen at many.places that land-slides of loose
material dumped along the slope occured at lower
sites and resulted in heavy damages to buildings,
transmission lines, trees, etc. Depositing excavated
soil by the side of site, therefore shall not be per-
mitted. All excavated material shall be dumped at
far away places where there is no likelihood of any
future problem and where no future development
works are planned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  The problem of failure of retaining walls and
foundations
of buildings is generally due to per-
colation of sewerage or soak pit water and house
waste water from kitchen, bathrooms, etc, behind<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 14243 ( Part 2 )  : 1995<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Building should
have both external and
internal stairs.
Building complex should have approaches
from sides via terrace sides connected from
rooms and verandahs.
In order to provide for safety against fire
protection, escape routes shall be provided.
For this each storey of the building complex
shall be connected by adjoining hill slope.
A 300 mm thick impervious layer of com-
pacted silty soil should be laid on all terrace
behind retaining walls up to aprons. This
will prevent flow of rain water inside backfill
of retaining walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.8 Normally, height of breast wall for protection
of cut-slope and hill side retaining wall shall not be
more than 4 m. It shall be further raised by 1 m
incase of danger of jumping boulder. Vertical front
face and sloping back face retaining walls shall be
economical since its height shall be much lesser
than front-sloped
retaining wall. Suitable weep
holes shall be provided in breast wall and retaining
wall for proper drainage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.9 Retaining walls and ‘breast walls should be
made of dry stone masonry or dry stone masonry
with masonry bands in 1: 6 cement sand mortar of
400 mm to 600 mm thick at top and bottom with
3 m to 5 m vertical spacing in bands. In case of fine
soils like silt, clay or shales which behave like soils
in presence of water, retaining walls and breast
walls shall be designed after detailed study of soils,
rocks, etc, in laboratory and at site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 STABILITY OF SLOPES AND STEPPED
TERRACES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 The purpose of slope stability analysis in this
context is to contribute to the safe and economic
design of excavations required for the development
of terraces. The factor of safety shall be calculated
for individual
slopes as well as for the whole
stepped terrace.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9 STILT FOUNDATIONS FOR ECOFRIENDLY
CONSTRUCTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In hilly regions, cutting of slopes for building
horizontal terraces creates complicated problems,
like unstable slopes, new drainage problems and
other related problems. In order to economise in
time and money STILT foundations
have been
developed.
The superstructure
may consist of
wooden or steel framed structures with fibre-glass
or aluminium or corrugated
GI sheet roofings.
Walls may be claded with PVC sheets. However,
for large tall buildings. RCC stilt frames with RCC
columns foundations
at different
levels may be
made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

1.5 m should be given between retaining wall
face and building wall for proper ventila-
tion, lighting and minimum dampness.
Height of hill cutting for stepped storey
buildings in stable rock hill sides for any step
shall not be more than 4 m.
Kitchen, lavatory, water-closets, etc, shall be
located and oriented away, as far as possible,
from hill cut face and at outer spaces of
building so as to avoid dampness due to
seepage of water and to avoid foul smell, if
any.
Upper storeys should be as light as possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.0 Selection and development of site should be
such that high steep cuts are avoided. Steep cuts
invoive very costly and difficult protection works. It
has been observed
that most of the slips and
landslides occur during monsoon when water per-
colates in the
joints, fissures, seems providing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

ticipated failure plane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>lubrication to weak-planes. The main aim of sur-
face protection
works is therefore
to provide
proper drainage measures in the area. The follow-
ing measures may be adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.7 In hilly regions storm water drainage is the
main problem.
The object of the storm water
drainage is to collect and carry, for suitable dis-
posal, the rain-water collected within the premises
of the building complex. Drainage shall avoid all
possibilities of slope failure due to ingress of water.
The best way to get best drainage pattern is to have
a group-discussion at site between habitants of the
area and the field engineers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1  Minor trimming or cutting may be done to
make the slope stable with minor protection works
both for soil and rock<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Suitable or unlined drain as per  necessity  shall
be provided. These shall be so located and dis-
charged that rain water flow is spread over in a large
area because concentrated
high discharge may
cause erosion on lower side surface of hill which
may lead to serious problems. Proper drainage
holes for subsurface
discharge and rain water
should be provided. Filters may also be provided
where necessary. The ultimate aim of providing
drainage works is that water coming from the up-
hi!ls is diverted to natural streams without causing
any harm to the structures.
Water shall not be
allowed to flow along the bottom of cut. It shall
reduce and check undermining, erosion and failure
of slope.
Suitable
breast
walls may be made.
Proper slopes shall be maintained all around for
quick drainage of the whole area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.8 Fundamental
requirement
of efficient
drainage is that rain water should move away from
the site as early as possible without stagnation.
Further, water should flow as scattered as possible
on surface so as to avoid any surface erosion. Sur-
faces which are soft and susceptible
to erosion
should be made impervious by any of the suitable
means like grass, vegetation, stone-pitching,
sur-
face grouting, guniting, etc. It is also necessary that
the natural drainage pattern is restored at the ear-
liest after site development.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.9 The following works normally done on just
thumb rules lead to serious accidents, slope failures
and other catastrophies.
These points need sig-
nificant attention
on the part of field-engineer
responsible for execution:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3 All the barren surface above the cut should be
planted with light but deep rooted bushes, shrubs,
etc. This will  check  soil erosion and also improve
stability of slope and also improve the microsystem
for abosrbing the toxic gases from the environment
and enrich the lining environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Non-restoration of  Existing  Drainage  Pattern
-
Normally
drainage
pattern
existing
before site development
is not restored
properly. Water should be disposed off to
natural streams or water-courses
by means
of lined or unlined drain as per necessity of
site.
Improper Ground Slope Around Building -
Many times proper slope is not given in
developed ground after hill cutting or fill-
ing. It causes ingress of large quantity of
water which causes water pressure
and
provides lubrication
to soil grains, rock-
joints ultimately
causing slope failures.
Field engineer, should check that proper
slope has been provided during hill-cutting
and after construction of building.
Improper Location of Soak Pits -
Many
times soak pits are constructed
in front or
the rear of buildings which causes dampness
in adjoining soil-rock masses, leading to
slope failures. If hill slopes are greater than
30”, then soak-pits should neither be made
at front or at the back of building but they
should be made by the side of buildings. This
will avoid any slope failure and building
shall not be damaged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.4 Grouting or guniting may be resorted to with
caution in all those cases where plantation cannot
be developed. It will check entry of water into the
rock joints and avoid slope failures in most of the
cases. In order to improve
the top surface of
ground, guniting may be done around the building,
top surface of cut slope, filled or built-up ground
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.5 On all sloping surfaces, stone pitching may be
done in 150 mm to 200 mm thickness, filling all
joints with 1  :  6 cement-sand mortar. If economy
does not allow stone pitching, all joints may be
filled in by fine soils, and grass or small plants may
be planted on it. Roots of grass shall spread in the
voids and grip the soil pebbles, rock pieces, etc,
thereby preventing
the entry of water into the
ground.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.6 Reinforcing bars and rock bolting may prove
very useful in cases where the rock is highly frac-
tured, fissured or weathered. The basic underlying
idea of using rock-anchors for slope stabilization is
that rock-anchors create compressive forces which
are uniformly distributed over the potential failure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>due to toe pressure of upper retaining walls.
Heavy higher retaining walls of height more
than 5 m are more susceptable for collapse
due to heavy back-pressure or failure of
foundation rock soil below toe of retaining
walls. These walls fail most often. They
remain intact only when they are subjected
to remarkable pressures that is when there
are stable. rock behind retaining walls or
when rock below toe of every retaining wall
is stable and strong.
Vertical Tension Cracks -
Presence of a
vertical crack around a building complex on
hilly terrain should be taken as an indication
of potential  instability and  that, in case of an
important slope, this should signal the need
for detailed investigations into the stability
of that particular slope. Not only the build-
ing but also the vertical crack, if any, seen in
the area should be investigated thoroughly
because it is a sure indication that shear
failure has initiated within the slope.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There shall be a minimum clearance of 2 m
between the foundation on rock mass and
the soak pit so that pressure bulb is unaf-
fected by the seepage through joints from
the soak pit.
d)  High Cutting and High Retaining Walls -
Many times high cutting is done vertically
and high retaining walls are constructed.
The stability of such construction always
remains in question and many times they fail
causing fatal accidents including damage to
buildings. Retaining walls become unable to
bear heavy back pressures causes by slopy
hill face in the back of retaining wall along
with induced water pressures due to ingress
of water behind retaining wall. It is there-
fore, recommended that criteria as given in
Tables 1 and 2 should be adhered to, where
high cuts are involved. Height of retaining
walls shall normally be not more than 4 m.
The foundation of the retaining wall shall be
given a slope of 3:l towards hill side.
e)  Improper Selection of Site -
Many times
improper and steep hills of more than 35”
are selected which requires high cutting
posing significant economic problems and
accidents too. As such, steep grounds shall
always be avoided.
f) Successive  Retaining Walls -
Successive
retaining walls should not be made since
these walls have more chances of collapse
under heavy surcharge pressures, caused<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

In hilly regions, failure of a building on
uphill side may result in damage to many other
buildings on downhill side resulting in loss of
human lives apart from involvement in legal court
cases. Strict inspection
and quality control
measures shall be taken during construction ofsuch
areas. From safety point of view during construc-
tion of such complexes, regular inspections should
be done bythe municipal engineer of the locality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
