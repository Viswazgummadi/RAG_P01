<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( P::rt
IlI/Sec
2 )  (  First
Revision
)
was
adopted
by the Ixdian
Standards
Institutinn
on 10 November
1980, after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Soil
Engineering
artd
Rock
Mc,chanics
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With
a
view
to
establishing
uniform
procedures
for
the
determination
of different
characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating
a comparative
study
of the results,
the Indian
Standards
Institution
is
bringing
out
a series
of
standards
on
methods
of
test
for
soils
( IS  :  2720 ).
This
part
deals
with
the method
of test
for
determi-
nation
of specific
gravity
of the soils
which
is
used
in
finding
out
the
degree
of
saturation
and
unit
weight
of moist
soils.
The
unit
weights
are needed
in pressure,
settlement
and
stability
problems
in soil
engineering.
This
standard
was published
in the gear
1964.
In view
of the further
work done in this field
in this country
and
overseas,
the
revision
has been
prepared
so as to give the latest method
of test.
The
revision
is being
prepared
in two sections:
Section
I, dealing
with fine
grained
soil
which
is basically
a
laboratory
method;
and
Section
2
dealing
with
the
method
for
fine,
medium
and
coarse-grained
soils
which
is basically
a field method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 A  sample
weighing
200 g in the case of fine-grained
soil and
400’ g
in
the case of medium
and
coarse-grained
soils,
shall

The
rubber

shall
then
be removed
carefully
and
any
soil
adhrring
to the stopper or the top of the gas jar shall be washed care-
fully into the jar;
any froth that has formed shall be dispersed with a
fine spray
of
water.
Water
shall
then be added
to the gas jar to
within 2 mm of the top.
The soil shall be allowed
to settle for a few
minutes
and the gas jar
then filled to the brim with more water
The
ground-glass
plate plastic slip cover shall then be placed on the top of
the jar
taking care not to trap any air undert the plate.
The gas jai
and plate shall then be carefully
dried on the outside and the
whole
weighed to the nearest 0.2 g  (ma).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 The
gas jar
shall be emptied,
washed out thoroughly,
and fillea
completely
to the brim with water.
The
glass plate shall be placed in
position
taking
care not to trap any air under the plate.
The gas jar
and plate shall then be dried carefully
on the outside and the whole
weighed to the nearest 0.2 g  (mc).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6 The procedure
outlined in 4.1 to 4.4 shall be repeated
c.n a second
sample
of
the same
soil so that
two values for specific gravity
are
obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. CALCULATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 The specific gravity, G, of the soil particles shall be calculated
from
the equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-
ml
C=(m,-m~;-(m3-mi&j-<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ml  = the mass bf gas jar and ground glass plate;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>m2 =  the mass of gas jar, plate and sail;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ms =  the mass of gas jar, plate, soil and water;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>mr  =  the mass of gas jar, plate and water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The
specific
gravity
shall
be calculated
at 27°C.
If
the room
temperature
is different
then 27”C, the following
corrections
shall
be
done:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G’ = KG<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G’ = corrected
specific gravity at 27’C, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6. REPORTING
OF RESULTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The specific gravity
of the soil particles shall be reported
to the
nearest 0.0 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Three determinations
of the specific gravity of the same soil sample
shall be made.
The average of the values obtained shall be taken as the
specific gravity
of the soil particles and shall be reported to the nearest
0.01.
If the results differ by more than 0.03 from the average
value,
the tests shall be repeated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -
A gas jar ha: been found to make a very effective pycnometcr
but any
container
of similar
capacity
can
be usrd provided
that it can be shaken in a
mechanical
shaking apparatus,
vd
provided that the mouth can be scaled in such  a
way that its volume is constant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 2 -
An end-over-end
shaker has been specified but shaking machines
giving
a vibrating
motion would also be suitable.
The choice of shaking machine
depends
on the type of pycnometcr
uacd.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3 -
Oven drying of the sotI has been spcdified for convenience.
If there is
any reason to believe that this will change the specific gravity due to loss of water of
hydration,
the soil should be dried at not more than 80%.
This fact should
be
reported.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 4 -
If there is a large difference the air temperature
sufficient water should
be drawn for the required
number of tests and allowed
to stand in the room
in
which the tests are being done until the temperature
is within the given range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
