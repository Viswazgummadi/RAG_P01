<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard ( Part III ) specifies a laboratory
method of measuring
the airborne sound insulation of building elements such as walls, floors,
doors, windows, facade elements and facades.<<HEADING_END>>

the
common logarithm of the ratio of the space and time average of the sound
pressure squared to the square of the reference sound pressure, the space
average being taken over the entire room with the exception of those parts
where the direct radiation of a sound source or the near field of the bounda-
ries ( wall, etc ) is of significant influence. This quantity is denoted by  L:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In general,
the sound power transmitted
into the receiving
room consists
of the sum of the following
components:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>WDd =<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>which
has entered
the partition
directly
and is radiated
from it directly;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-WDf

<<PARAGRAPH>>which
has entered
the partition
directly,
but is radiated

<<PARAGRAPH>>which
has entered

<<HEADING level=3>>WFd

<<PARAGRAPH>>which
has entered -flanking

and is radiated

and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>WFf

<<PARAGRAPH>>which has been transmitted
( as airborne
sound ) through
leaks,

=<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Also in this case, under the assumption
of diffuse sound fields in the two
rooms,
the apparent
reduction
index may be evaluated
from:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R’=L,-L,flOlog,,-A-
’ dB . . . . . . . . . (5)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thus,
in the apparent
sound reduction
index the sound power transmitted
into
the receiving
room
is related
to the sound
power incident
on the
common
partition
as in equation
(3) irrespective
of actual
conditions

<<HEADING level=3>>3. EQUIPMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The
equipment
shall be suitable
for meeting
the requirements
of 6.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  TEST ARRANGEMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Reams -
Laboratory
test facilities
shall
meet
the requirements
of
IS  :  9901
(Part
I )-1981*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Test Specimen<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1  Partitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.1
The size of the test partition
is determined
by the size of the
test opening of the laboratory
test facility,
as defined in IS  :  9901 ( Part I )-
1981*.
These
sizes are approximately
10m2 for walls, and between
lOm2
and 2Om2 for floors, with the shorter
edge length for both walls and floors
not less than 2.3 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.2
A smaller
size may be used if the wavelength
of free flexural
-waves at the lowest frequency
considered
is smaller than half the minimum
dimension
of the specimen.
The smaller
the specimen,
however,
the more
sensitive the results will be to edge constraint
condition
and to local variation
in sound field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-The
test partition
should preferably
be installed
in a manner
as similar
as possible
to the
actual
construction
with
a careful
simulation
of normal
con-
nections and sealing
conditions
at the perimeter
and at joints
within
the partition.
The mounting
conditions
shall be stated in the test report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.3  If the test specimen
is installed
in an aperture
between
the
source
room
and the receiving
room,
aperture
depths
on each side shall
be approximately
equal,
unless this is inconsistent
with the practical
use
of the test specimen
( for example
windows in facades ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.4
In laboratories
with
suppressed
radiation
from
flanking
ele-
ments,
the sound transmitted
by any indirect
path should
be negligible
compared
with the sound transmitted
through
the test specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1 -For
special
laboratory
facility,
the value of R’,,,
shall be measured.
This may be done by measuring
R’
with a highly insulating
construction
inserted
in
the test opening.
If further
improvements
of the insulating
properties
of this
construction
give no increase in  R’,  this value of  R’  is considered as  R’,,.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>If the measured
value of  R’  for a test specimen
is less than
( R’,,-5
dB ),
the indirect
transmitted
sound may be considered
negligible.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If R’ is larger
than
( R’,,-
5 dB ) the
contribution
of
the
flanking
transmission
for this special
case shall be investigated
with one of
the
methods
mentioned
in Appendix
A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 -If
the
test specimen
is smaller
than
the test
opening,
a preliminary
test shall be carried
out to ensure that energy transmitted
through
the surrounding
partition
is small compared
with the energy transmitted
through
the test specimen.
This may be checked by the method described in  A-l  of Appendix A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2
Doors,
Windows, Facade
Elements and Facades<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.1
The test specimen
shall be tested in the same manner
as parti-
tions. If the test specimen
is smaller than the test opening,
a special partition
of sufficiently
high sound insulation
shall be built in the test opening
and
the specimen
shall
be placed
in that
partition.
The
sound
transmitted
through
this partition
and
any
other
indirect
path
shall
be negligible
compared
to the
sound
transmitted
through
the
test
specimen
( see
Appendix
A  ) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.2
For
windows,
doors,
etc, the area S is the area of
the free
opening
in which
the element
( including
a possible
frame
and sealing )
is mounted.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  -As
the sound insulation
of windows,
doors and small
facade
elements
depends
on their
dimensions,
accurate
values can be obtained
only by measuring
every actual size.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.3
Doors
shall
be so inserted
that
the
lower
edge
is situated
directly
above
the floor of the test rooms
according
to the conditions
in
the field.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.4
If the test specimen
is intended
to be openable,
it shall be
installed
for test so that it can be opened and closed in the normal
manner.
It shall be opened
and closed at least 10 times immediately
before testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3  If the sound source contains more than one loudspeaker operating
simultaneously,
the loudspeakers shall be contained in one enclosure,
the maximum dimension of which shall not exceed 0.7 m.
The loud-
speakers shall be driven in phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4 The loudspeaker enclosure shall be so placed as to give a sound
field as diffuse as possible and at such a distance from the test specimen
that the direct radiation upon it is not dominant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Measurement
of the Average
Sound
Pressure
Level<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1 The average sound pressure level may be obtained by using a

phone with an integration of P2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>~5.3 Frequency
Range
of Measurements<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1 The sound pressure level shall be measured using third-octave
band filters. The discrimination characteristics of the filters should be in
accordance
with
IS : 6964-1973*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2 Third-octave
band filters having at least the following
centre
frequencies ( in Hz ) shall be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>100, 125, 160, 200, 250, 315, 400, 500, 630, 800, 1000, 1250, 1600,
2 000, 2 500 and 3 150.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 1 -Use
of lower frequency
is dependent
on the distribution
of
natural

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -The
minimum
reverberation
times for the empty
room
are
adjusted
to a volume of 180 m3. For other volumes, these times shall be multiplied by the
factor
( V/l80 )‘I3

has to be investigated,
this may be done
in either
of the
following
ways:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.1
By covering
the specimen
on both sides by additional
flexible
layers,
for example
13 mm gypsum board on a separate frame at a distance
which
gives a resonance
frequency
of the system of layer and airspace
well below
the frequency
range
of interest.
The
airspace
shall contain
the absorbing
material.
With
this measurement
Wm,
WFd
and
WD~  are suppressed,
and the measured
apparent
reduction
index
is determined
by  Ww.  Addi-
tional flexible
layers,
over particular
flanking
surfaces,
may permit identi-
fication
of the major
flanking
paths.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.2  One loudspeaker
is placed separately
in 2 different
corners
opposite
the test specimen
( but not directed

positions
randomly
distributed

each room 3 can have readings
taken for each loudspeaker
position,
using an averaging
time of 5 s in each
frequency
band at each position.
The loudspeaker
is fed with white noise
in one third-octave
bands.
In the microphone
channel
one third-octave
band filter is used as well.
No microphone
position
shall be nearer
than
O-7 m to the room boundaries

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.3  As an alternative,
the sound field sampling

lout using a rotating
microphone
device having a sweep radius between

and
1.5 m. In this case, the plane
of the traverse
is inclined
in relation
to the room boundaries
and the device shall have an averaging
time equal
to the traverse
time, which shall be a minimum
of 30 s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

THE LOSS FACTOR
Ttotd OF T-HE PARTITION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G-1.
For the frequency
region
above
the critical
frequency,
the total loss
factor
of the partition
is important
for its sound
reduction
index.
The
total
loss factor
is influenced
by the boundary
conditions
and may
be
checked
by measuring
the reverberation
time of the partition
as a function
of frequency.
Th e partition
shall then be excited
by a shaker
driven by
white noise in third-octave
bands.
From
the measurements,
the loss factor
is calculated
from the following
equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
f
is the third-octave
band centre frequency;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I
is the reverberation
time of the partition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
