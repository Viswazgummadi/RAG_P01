FOREWORD
_ This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after ;
. the draft finalized by the Steel Tubes, Pipes and Fittings Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Metallurgical Engineering Division Council.
This standard was first published in 1966 and has been revised in 1981. While reviewing this Indian
Standard in the light of the experience gained during these years, the committee has felt to revise the
same, taking note of the practices being followed in the country and also overseas standards
existing on the subject. In the revision of this Indian Standard the following main modifications
. have been made:
a) Requirements for seamless tubes have been included;
b) Nominal size has been deleted and only outside diameter has been retained;
‘ c) One more grade has been added and grade designation have been modified along with |
requirements for chemical composition and mechanical properties;
| d) Product analysis requirements have been added; and
¢) Requirements for condition of supply and flattening test have been modified.
In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to international coordination
among the standard prevailing in different countries in addition to the practices in the country.
This has been met by deriving assistance from the following publications:
ISO 559 : 1977 Welded or seamless steel tubes for water, sewage and gas. International
Organization for Standardization.
BS 534 : 1981 Steel pipes, and specials for water, and sewage. British Standards —
. Institution.
BS 3601 : 1974 Steel pipes and tubes for pressure Purposes : carbon steel: with specified
room temperature properties. British Standards Institution.
API Specification Specification for line pipe. American Petroleum Institute,
3 L — 1988
This standard contains clauses 3.3, 4.1, 6.1, 8.3, 9.1.1, 12.3 and 16.2 which call for agreement i
between the purchaser and the manufacturer.
For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the
final value observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values ( revised )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
| value in this standard. |
