          "content": "Steel Tubes, Pipes and Fittings Sectional Committee, MTD 19\nFOREWORD\n_ This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after ;\n. the draft finalized by the Steel Tubes, Pipes and Fittings Sectional Committee had been approved\nby the Metallurgical Engineering Division Council.\nThis standard was first published in 1966 and has been revised in 1981. While reviewing this Indian\nStandard in the light of the experience gained during these years, the committee has felt to revise the\nsame, taking note of the practices being followed in the country and also overseas standards\nexisting on the subject. In the revision of this Indian Standard the following main modifications\n. have been made:\na) Requirements for seamless tubes have been included;\nb) Nominal size has been deleted and only outside diameter has been retained;\n\u2018 c) One more grade has been added and grade designation have been modified along with |\nrequirements for chemical composition and mechanical properties;\n| d) Product analysis requirements have been added; and\n\u00a2) Requirements for condition of supply and flattening test have been modified.\nIn the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to international coordination\namong the standard prevailing in different countries in addition to the practices in the country.\nThis has been met by deriving assistance from the following publications:\nISO 559 : 1977 Welded or seamless steel tubes for water, sewage and gas. International\nOrganization for Standardization.\nBS 534 : 1981 Steel pipes, and specials for water, and sewage. British Standards \u2014\n. Institution.\nBS 3601 : 1974 Steel pipes and tubes for pressure Purposes : carbon steel: with specified\nroom temperature properties. British Standards Institution.\nAPI Specification Specification for line pipe. American Petroleum Institute,\n3 L \u2014 1988\nThis standard contains clauses 3.3, 4.1, 6.1, 8.3, 9.1.1, 12.3 and 16.2 which call for agreement i\nbetween the purchaser and the manufacturer.\nFor the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the\nfinal value observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded\noff in accordance with IS 2: 1960 \u2018Rules for rounding off numerical values ( revised )\u2019. The number\nof significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified\n| value in this standard. |\n; Bigg Be |\n| ee\ni.\n: ~\u201c \u2018me :",
