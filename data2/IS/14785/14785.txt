<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards. after the draft finalized by-lhc Automotive
Vehicle Testing and Performance Evaluation Sectional Committee had been approved by the Transport Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The road-load constants of an automotive vehicle are needed for evaluation of the performance of an automotive
vehicle such as fuel consumption, emission, etc, on a chassis dynamometer. Thcsc constants are used lo determine the
(  load on the chassis dynamometer to simulate the power needed to propel the vchiclc at diffcrcnt speeds as per lhe
appropriate driving cycle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has beenprepared with a view to have a uniform procedure to be followed by the automobile manufacturers
as well as the testing laboratories who. at present in the absence of this standard. have evolved their own practices for
evaluating these constants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee rcsponsiblc for formulating this standard is given in Annex A<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE
4  VEHICLE PREPARATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The vehicle shall be clean and complete in all
respects, representative of production series.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
specifies
the procedure
for
determining the equation of road-load resistance of
vehicle,
including
the aerodynamic
and rolling
resistance by coast down technique.
This data is
primarily intended for the road-load simulation on
variable load curve chassis dynamometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Vehicle shall be run-in as per manufacturer’s
recommendation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The wheels of vehicle shall be free and without
any parasitic drag. For vehicles with rear chain drive,
it shall be-ensured that there is no chain rubbing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This equation is expressed as  F = u+6v2,  where factors
a and b are the constants.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 The weight of testing personnel riding the vehicle
and instrumentation
carried on the vehicle shall be
part of vehicle weight ( see 8.2.1). Additional loads
may be addedto bring the actual weight during testing
to be within f 2 percent of specified weight. The
distribution of weight among axles shall be as close
as possible to the values recommended
by the
mamiW~~
However, ifsumofmaximumrnded
axle weights exceeds the gross vehicle weight, the
actual weight on the axle shall be in the same proportion
of the ratios of the gross vehicle weight to the sum of
maximum recommended axle weights. The actual load
condition and wheel reactions shall be recorded in
the report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 However, it may be borne in mind that use of
each of these constants independently
may not be
accurate. For example, the coefilcient  of  rolling  resistance
‘a’ will not be accurate enough to use as a comparison
of rolling resistance of tyre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 Tyres which have covered only 10 ~percent or
less of their expected life shall befitted on the vehicle.
The tread depth measurement method or tread wear
indicators on the tyre may be used to assess tyre life.

be inflated to pressure specified for respective load
condition of the vehicle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

5  FEATURES OF TEST TRACK<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  DEFINITIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 LadenVehicle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test shall be conducted on a dry, level test track
with a coefficient
of adhesion not less than 0.8,
particularly in region where the test is to be conducted.
If test surface is of tar, it shall not be traffic smooth
and surface shall not have become soft due to heat.
Longitudinal
slope of the track shall-not
exceed
0.5 percent and shall be constant within f 0.1 percent
over the measuring strip. The track shall have sufbcient
length and width for achieving the test speed and
carrying out the test safely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The load condition
of the vehicle for which
the road-load equation is to be determined,
depends on
the end use of this equation. For example, for emission
measurement
for statutory purposes, the load condition
is the ‘Reference Mass’, whereas for design verification
tests, it may be the ‘Gross Vehicle Weight’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

8 COAST DOWN TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Fitment of instruments shall be as recommended
by instrument manufacturer. All instruments and the
additional weights, if any, shall be mounted in such a
way that they do not affect the performance or stability
of the vehicle and do not hamper rider/driver from
normal driving of vehicle and carrying out tests. The
instrument shall be positioned on the vehicle such
that it does not significantly affect the aerodynamics
of the vehicle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.1  Coast down test for a specific test speed (v) is
basically to establish the road-load
‘F’ from the
deceleration by measuring time elapsed from speed
‘v + 6v’ to speed ‘v - Sv’, when the transmission is in
neutral. From the values of  ‘F  at different speeds,
values of constants  ‘a’  and ‘b  ’  in equation F =  a + bv*
are determined by best curve fit method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2 In the case of two wheelers, the recommended
height of rider shall be 1.7 f 0.05 m and the rider shall
wear helmet and proper riding gear. He shall be seated
upright on the seat provided for the rider, his feet
upon the pedals or foot rests. This position shall,
nevertheless, allow the rider at all times to have proper
control of the vehicle during the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Calibration of instrument shall be checked and
adjusted asper instrument manufacturer’s instructions
before commencement of test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Automatic

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.3 While carrying out the test, the portion of the
test track where the vehicle is decelerated
from
‘v + 6v’ to ‘v - 6~’ shall be kept approximately same in
both directions

of track
variation. This shall be followed for each test speed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

during the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.11  Repeat the test for all the desired test speeds
(see 8.2.2). Depending on consistent length of test

condition of 8.2.3 would not be satisfied, it shall be
ensured that the variation of the track does not affect
the test results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.8 Attain a speed of about 5 to 10 km/h above

Measure time (t,) up to 2 decimal places required for

direction. In case the vehicle has transmission without
manual control, the test shall be done by towing/
pushing the vehicle to achieve required speed and
releasing the towing/pushing
arrangement. In case
of electric vehicles, if the regenerative braking system
can be electrically switched off, disconnecting the
drive from the wheels may be done by switching off
the same and the power supply to the motor. If it is
not possible to do so, the motor should be decoupled
before the test and the test shall be done by towing/
pushing the vehicle to achieve required speed and
releasing the towing/pushing arrangement. The towing/
pushing shall be done in such a way that it does not
affect the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
