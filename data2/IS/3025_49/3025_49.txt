<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Environmental Protection Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Zinc is an essential and beneficial element in body growth. Concentration above 5 mg/l may cause
a bitter astringent taste and opalescence in alkaline water. Zinc most commonly enters the
domestic water supply from deterioration of galvanized iron and dezincification of brass. Zinc in
water may also come from industrial water pollution. In the preparation of this standard
considerable assistance has been derived from American Standard Test Methods (ASTM Annual
Book Section 11, 1983) and Analytica Chimica Acta, 164 (1984) pp 1-21. The assistance so derived
is thankfully acknowledged. This standard supersedes  17  of IS 2488 (Part 2) : 1968 and  39  of
IS 3025 : 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (October 2000). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final
value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2 : 1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation of this Indian Standard
is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>thoroughly with dilute nitric acid (6 N) prior to
the final rinsing with water. The water samples
should be collected and stored preferably in
polypropylene or chemically resistant glass
containers. For preservation, the samples
should be acidified with concentrated nitric
acid (2 ml of AR grade of nitric acid in 1 litre
just to bring down the  p H below 2). Unacidified
samples should be analysed the same day while
the acidified samples can be stored for a few
days (5 days) in a refrigerator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
prescribes
following
four
methods for determination of zinc:
a) Zincon Method,
b) Atomic Absorption Method (Direct),
c) Atomic Absorption Method (Chelation and
Extraction), and
d) Differential
Pulse
Anodic
Stripping
Voltammetry (DPASV).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depending upon the concentration range and
interference levels, choice of the method is
made. When the concentration levels are below
200  µ g/l, preconcentration is carried out either
by chelation and extraction prior to atomic
absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) or by
deposition on a mercury drop electrode as in
DPASV method. For dissolved zinc content,
filtration through 0.45  µ m membrane filter is
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 PURITY OF THE REAGENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Unless otherwise indicated, only AR/GR
grade chemicals should be used for all the tests.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Double distilled water, with a specific
conductivity of less than 1.0  µ mho/cm should be
used for preparing the standards and reagent
solutions.<<HEADING_END>>
