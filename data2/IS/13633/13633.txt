<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the
Shipbuilding Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Transport
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The term
‘  local vibration
‘, as used in the shipbuilding industry,
applies to the dynamic response of a
structural
element,
an assembly of structural
elements,
machinery
or equipment
which vibrates at an
amplitude
significantly
greater than that of the basic hull girder at the location.
occur
at a frequency
of the hull girder or of a machinery
component.
This vibration
may
Typical examples include the
vibration
of parts of the superstructure,
smokestack,
mast, binnacle,
turbine,
pipe or deck plate. These
local vibrations generally result from:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) local flexibility of supporting
structural
elements; or
b) the vibratory
characteristics
of the machinery
concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this standard,
the term
‘  vibration severity  ’  is used to describe the vibration
conditions
in the ship
and, based on long established
practice
in the industry,
the peak value of vibration
velocity
has been
chosen as the primary quantity
of measurement;
since,
however,
much data have been accumulated
in
terms of vibration
acceleration
and vibration displacement,
a plotting sheet has been adopted on which
data may easily be plotted
using any of these quantities
of measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
establishes uniform procedures
for gathering and presenting
data on vibration
of local
structural
elements
or equipment in sea-going merchant
ships.
The procedures,
where applicable,
can
also be used for inland ships and tug boats. Such data are necessary to establish uniformly the vibration
characteristics
present in various compartments
on board ship and to provide a basis or design predic-
tions, improvements
and comparison
against environmental
vibration reference levels or criteria relative
to reliability
( of machines ), safety
( of structures
) and habitability.
The data are not intended to
apply to the evaluation
of the vibration of machines with respect to noise control
or to the design of
the machine
or eqmpment
under
consideration.
These
latter
cases will generally
require
specific
diagnostic treatment
and include a broader frequency
range and more specialized
instrumentation
than
is necessary for these general considerations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concern over local vibration may be caused by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the stresses
due to the vibration,
for
example,
in the structure,
in the equipment
or
attachments;
b) the necessity of maintaining
trouble-free
operation
of a machine
or other
equipment
which
might be jeopardized
by the malfunction
or degradation
of components;
c) the physical strain on man ( habitability
and performance
);
d) the effects
of the vibration
on its environment,
such as adjacent
instruments,
machines,
equipment,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard gives general principles of vibration measurement
on board ships to improve
vibration
engineering. Therefore,
in individual case, items to be measured may be selected or added to meet the
aims of the vibration
measurement
of each ship.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard,
considerable
assistance
has been derived from
IS0 4868  : 1984
‘  Code for the measurement
and reporting
of local vibration
data of ship structures
and equipment ‘,
issued by the International
Organization
for Standardization
( IS0 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accor-
dance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘ Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.  The number of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
deals
with
local
vibration
measured on structural
elements,
superstructures,
decks, bulkheads,
masts, machines,
foundations,
equipment, etc, and only relates to the measure-
ment and reporting
of the local vibration
of the
structure or equipment mounted thereon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The peak value of vibration ( velocity
accelera-
tion or displacement ) during periods of steady-
state
vibration,
representative
of
maximum
repetitive behaviour, under the conditions defined
in 4.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using autographic
records, suitable lengths
of record may easily be recognized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency range considered includes propul-
sion
shaft
rotational
frequencies,
rotational
frequency of machines and other significant source
frequencies,
such as diesel firing, blade or vane
passage etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using electronic
methods of recording
and
analysis,
care
shall be taken to use lengths
of
record, time constants and averaging times so that
good approximation
to the steady-state
amplitude
is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is a necessary adjunct to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Instrumentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>41.1  Measurements
shall
preferably
be
made
with an electronic
system which produces a per-
manent
record.
The
transducers
may generate
signals
proportional
to acceleration,
velocity or
displacement.
Recording
can be made either on
magnetic tape, paper oscillographs,
or a combina-
tion of both. Use of paper oscillographs during the
tests
means that
the
vibration
traces
can be
inspected directly and is very helpful in evaluating
existing
vibration
problems.
When displacement
rather
than
either
velocity
or
acceleration
is
recorded, the desired
low-frequency signals asso-
ciated with significant
vibratory
motion are the
major components of a recorded trace. Thus, they
are
readily
evaluated
since
they
overshadow
possible
higher
frequency
signals
with
low
displacement
amplitudes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>

of which can be described by
a free-free non-uniform beam approximation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
