were
modified
resulting in increased permissible stresses
in load

major changes were made in its  second
revision:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of
this

has taken into
consideration
views of all who are interested
in
this field and has related

prevailing practices in the country.
Due weight-

for inter-
national
coordination
among the standards
and
practices prevailing in different
countries
of the
world. In the preparation
of this code, assistance
has been derived from the following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in this code that design of

codes )
under
the
directions
of an

four times the thickness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.2  Pier -
A thickened.
section
forming
integral part of a wall placed at intervals
along
the wall, to increase the stiffness of the wall or to
carry a vertical concentrated
load.
Thickness of
a pier is the overall
thickness
including
the
thickness of the wall or when bonded into a leaf
of a Cavity wall,
the
thickness
obtained
by
treating that leaf as an independent
wall ( see

CONSIDERATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 General
-
Masonry
structures
gain
stability
from
the
support
offered
by cross walls, floors,
roof
and
other
elements
such
as
piers
and
buttresses
Load
bearing
walls
are
structurally
more
efficient
when the load
is uniformly
distri-
butcd
and
the
structure
is
so
planned
that
eccentricity
of loading
on
the
members
is
as
small as possible.
Avoidance
of eccentric
loading
by providing
adcquatc
bearing
of floor/roof
on
the walls pt oviding
adequate
stiffness
in slabs and
avoiding
lixity at the supports,
etc,
is especially
important
in load
bearing
walls
in multistorey
structures.
These
matters
should
receive
careful
consideration
during
the
planning
stage
of
masonry
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
Sand for making
mortar should be
well
graded.
In case sand is not well graded, its proportion
shall be reduced in order to achieve the minimum
specified strength.
NOTE 2 -
For mixes in SI No.
I and 2, use of lime is not essential
from
consideration
of strength as it
does not result in increase in strength.
However,
its use is highly recommended
since it improves workability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For  mixes  in SI No. 3(a), 4(a). 5(a) and 6(a),
either
lime
C or B to the extent
of l/4 part of
cement (by volume) or some plasticizer
should be added for improving
workability.
NOTE 4-
For
mixes  in Sl No. 4(b) and 5(b), lime and sand should first be ground  in mortar mill and then
cement added to coarse stuff.
NoTE 5 -
It is essential
that mixes in Sl No. 4(c), 4(d), 4(e), 5(d), 5(e), 6(b), 6(c),  7(a) and 7(b) are prepared
by grinding in a mortar mill.
NOTE 6 -
Mix in Sl No. 2(b) has been classified
to be of same grade as that of Sl No. 2(a), mixes in SI No.
3(b) and 3(c) same as that in Sl No. 3(a) and mixes in SI No. 4(b) to 4(f) same as that in SI No. 4(a), even though

No exact calculations
are possible to

Extent

Lintels, that

from any
other part of the structure.
Length
of bearing
of lintel at each end shall not be less than 9 cm
or one-tenth of the span, whichever is more,
and
area of the bearing shall be sufficient to ensure
that stresses in the
masonry
( combination
of

bearing stresses from the lintel ) do not exceed the
stresses permitted in 5.4 ( see Appendix

( a load being taken to be concentrated
when

certain< increase
in
permissible

because of dispersal of the load. Since, according

views in regard to manner  and  extent of dispersal,
design of walls subjected

to
deflection.
For timber
floors with
larger
spans,
that
is, more
than 30 times the thickness
of the
wall, eccentricity
of one-third
the thickness
of the
wall may be assumed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2. In case
of a reinforced
concrete
slab
of
normal
span
(that
is, less
than
30 times
the
thickness
of the
wall),
which
does not bear on
the
full
width
of the
wall
and
‘cover
tiles or
bricks’ are provided
on the
external
face,
there
is some eccentricity
of load.
The
eccentricity
may be assumed
to be
one-twelfth
of the thick-
ness of the wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-6. In multi-storeyed
buildings,
fixity and eccen-
tricity
have normally
purely
local effect
and
are
not
cumulative.
They
just
form
a constant
ripple on the downward
increasing
axial
stress.
If the
ripple
is large,
it is likely
to be more
serious
at upper
levels where it can
cause
crack-
ing
of walls
than
lower
down where it may or
may not cause local over-stressing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3. Eccentricity
of
load
from
the
roof/floor
increases
with the increase
in flexibility
and thus
deflection
of the
slabs.
Also,
eccentricity
of
loading
increases
with
the
increase
in fixity
of
slabs/beams
at supports.
Precast
RCC slabs
are
better
than
in-situ  slabs in this regard
because
of
very little lixity.
If supports
are released
before
further
construction
on top, fixity is reduced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-The resultant eccentricity of the total loads
on a wall at any level may be calculated
on the
assumption
that immediatelv

a
horizontal
