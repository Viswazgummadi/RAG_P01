1.1  The scope of this standard
is limited
to earth
and
rockfill
dams
where
the control
of seepage
is
achieved
primarily
by a positive
cutoff extending
to
bed rock so that the core is seated
on rock all along
the foundation
as well as the flanks and
abutments.
The shell or casing zones may however
rest on over-
burden.
1.2 Treatment
of rock foundation
for strengthening
and
stahilization
of slopes
is excluded
from this
standard.
The scope is limited
to treatment

is to be
avoided.
Diver-
gence
of abutment

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Despite
these adjustments,
because
of irregula-
rity of rock surface,
there may still be areas of core
contact
where
the rock contours
have an undesirable
orientation.
Trimming
of rock shall then
be done
to attain
a maximum
90” angle
with the axis on a
horizontal

Such

should
be avoided
to
minimize
the
hazard
of transverse

because
of differential

of the dam.
If a site
with
a bench
on

is
to
be
developed,
trimming
or
rounding
of the
bench
should
be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Alternatively,
excavated

through
weathered
rocks
may
be treated

shotcrete.
Where
loosening
of the
rock
by

should
be done of the rock contact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2
Necessary
trimming
or excavation
of the
abutments
should
be done very carefully.
The line
of excavation
should be presplit
or cushion

used
to minimize
damage
to the rock beyond
the
excavation
line.
Surfaces
against
which
material
is
to be placed
commonly
are excavated
to a slope not
steeper
than
4 horizontal
to 1 vertical
( see Fig. 2 ).
Flatter
s1ope.s or rounding
may
be necessary,
parti-
cularly
in upper
portions
of the abutment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The minimum
width of the core trench
should
be larger
than
4 m or
10 percent
of head.
If it
is not possible
to accommodate
a cut-off
trench
of
top
width
detailed
as above
within
the core width,
consideration
should
be
given
to use
the
plastic
concrete
diaphragm
in part of the cut-off depth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3
Changes
in slope should
be limited
to
20”
and the number
of changes
in slope should be mini-
mum.
This can be achieved
by excavation
of rock
or placing
concrete
against
the rock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

zonc3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The amount
of care
required
in treating
the
rock suface is’controlled
by the character
of the core
material.
If the core material
is resistant
to piping,
especially
if it contains
considerable
coarse material
with adequate
proportion
of sand,
surface treatment
is less demanding
than
if the core material
is susce-
ptible
to piping;
for example,
a fine silty
sand
and
very
lean
clays.
In the latter
case, extreme
care
should
be taken
and
the
core material
should
be
placed
only
after
very
careful
inspection
of
the treated
surface.
For
dispersive
clays,
special
precauutions,
such as protection
by
filter
fabric
or
plastic
concrete
may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8 Surface
treatment
as described
may
be difficult
to accomplish
on steeply
sloping
abutments.
In this
case,
gunite
may
be
used
for
filling
depressions
after the cracks and joints
have
been
cleaned
and
sealed.
If there
is extensive
jointing,
especially
if
the
joints
slope
upward
away
from
the
face,
adequate
sealing
of the joints
may require
construc-
ting a concrete
slab, which
is dowelled
to the
rock,
and then grouting
through
the slab.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9 The depth of excavation
necessary
in weathered
rock is difficult
to establish
during
initial
design.
The
depth
of weathering
is usually
very irregular,
being
controlled
by minor
variations
in joint
spac-
ing and
rock
type.
Abrupt
changes
in elevation
of the surface
of ‘groutable
rock’ probably
will be
found.
Overhangs,
some of large size,
should
be
anticipated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Blasting
should
be
kept
to
the
minimum
practical
in order not to open
up joints
or other-
wise
disturb
the
rock
surface,
and
no
blasting
should
be done on surfaces
that have
been
grouted
or slush-grouted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 All knobs
and overhangs
should
be removed
by
barring
and wedging
or by light
blasting.
Cracks
and
joints
that
are
exposed
in
these
operations
should
be’ cleaned
( usually
to a depth
of not
less
than
three
times
their width at the surface
) using
air and water,
picks, or other tools, as necessary,
to
remove
completely
soil or
weathered
rock which
would
be subject
to erosion.
Such joints
and cracks
should
then
be filled
with
grout
under
a small
gravity
head, say, of 3 m. Wherever
possible,
a pipe
should
be set to the bottom
of the joint
or crack and
grout
pumped
in until
the joint or crack is comple-
tely filled.
Grout
should
then
be broomed
and
brushed
across the top of the joint
to ensure
that the
contact
with the core
material
will
be tight
and
non-erodible.
In
the
absence
of gravity
grouting,
slush grouting
alone may not be effective
because
complete
filling
may
not be assured.
Grout
used
for this purpose
should
be
highly
plastic
buttery.
The maximum
size of sand for the slush grout
used
for filling
cracks
should
not exceed one-third
the
width of the crack to be filled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10 Usual practice
is to select
material,
preferably
a plastic
soil,
for the
first
lift
over
the
rock
surface.
If plastic
soils
are
limited,
the
most
plastic
soil
available
should
be used.
Gravel
or
stone
exceeding
about
50 mm
in size should
be
removed
or
excluded
from the material
placed
in
this first layer over the rock to improve
compaction
at the
contact.
The
surface
on
which
the
core
material
is placed
should
be
moist
but
free
of
standing
water,
and
the
material
when
placed
should
be
wet
of optimum.
In
dry
climates
or
during
dry weather,
difficulty
may be experienced
with
this first lift becoming
excessively
dry where it
feathers
out
on
a gentle
to moderate
slope.
In
such a case the edge of
the
fill should
be sloped
slightly
downward
toward
the
contact
with
the
rock.
Against
steep
rock
faces
or
adjacent
to
concrete
structures,
sloping
the fill slightly
upward
near the contact
is desirable
to provide
better
clear-
ance and better
compaction
at the contact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 Concrete
with admixtures
of approved
quality
and
sufficient
water to achieve
a slump
of loo-150
mm
may
be
easily
compacted
by
hand
and
used for backfilling
of irregularities
such as depres-
sed areas, holes and
potholes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  FOUNDATION
CLEAN-UP<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  All
foundation
areas
should
be dewatered
for
final inspection
after clean-up
prior to the placement
of core
material.
The
prepared
rock surface
in
the central
contact
area should
be free of water
at
the time
when embankment
material
is placed
and
for foundation
treatment
measures,
such
as slush
grouting
and crack-grouting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 Small ribs and similar
irregularities
should
be
filled with
plastic
concrete
to produce
slopes
not
steeper
than
about
1:l
where
the
difference
in
elevation
ici a few centimetres
to
a metre or so.
Surface
treatment
in
this
fashion
should
extend
upstream
to approximately
the
mid-point
of the
upstream
filter and downstream
at least 0.6 to 0.9 m
beyond
the downstream
edge of the fine filter.
In
particularly
adverse
situations,
such  as where
there
are joints
wider
than
the coarser
particles
of the
filter,
surface
treatment
as
described
may
be
necessary
under
the entire transition
zone.

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Where
existence
of
deep
depressions
and
occurrence
of
springs
complicate
the
clean
up,
special
provisions
should
be
made
to dry up the
foundation
in preparation
for pl.acing

Gravel

The
latter is generally

configurations.
This
is usually

<<PARAGRAPH>>effective.
A cover of polythene
should
be placed
over
the
gravel
to prevent
contamination
of
the
gravel

the fill material.
Stand
pipes should
be
provided
for discharge
of water
from
the
sumps.
The
top
of stand

should
correspond
to the
static head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

coating
of asphalt

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2  To prevent
possible
piping
of
the
fine
core
material
through
the foundation,
blanket
grouting
is accomplished
as determined
by the
rock
condi-
tions.
If the
core
foundation
of the dam consists
of closely
fractured
and
jointed
rock,
a blanket
grout
pattern
is used with holes spaced
at 3 m to
5 m with depths
of 6 m to 10 m.
If the foundation
rock is massive,
no blanket
grouting
is done.

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 To prevent

all necessary
excavation

ing blasting
should
be

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3 If the rock does not respond
to cement
grouting
and post grouting
‘Lugeon’
values remain
above
10
(Ten) locally,
the nature
and size of cracks
should
be carefully
examined.
When
the
high
‘Lugeon’
values are attributable
to fine cracks, closely spaced,
cement
grouting
may not be effective
in
reducing
the
permeability.
In
hard
inerodible
rocks,
such
fine cracks may be permitted.
In other
cases such
as gauge
zones
supplementary
measures
should
be
resorted
to for prevention
of internal
erosion
( set
IS  :  6066-1984*).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 In evaluating
and planning
for excavation
and
seepage
control
measures,
special
attention
shall be
given to d&continuities
such
as faults
and
relief
(sheet) joints,
which may extend
for long distance
as
nearly
plane
surfaces.
Relief
joints
may
exist
naturally
or may open during
excavation.
They
are
most
likely
to
occur in deep, steep-walled
valleys,
specially
in brittle
rocks,
or where
high
modulus
rock is underlain
by low modulus
rock.
Since they
are
roughly
parallel
to the
valley
wall, they may
cause
slides
during
construction.
Openings
of
several
centimetres
have been
observed.
Control
of
seepage
through
such joints
becomes
a major
problem.
Installation
of
concrete
cutoffs
across
particularly
bad
joints
may
be
warranted
or
extensive
grouting
may
be necessary.
Drainage
from such joints
shall be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. DRAINAGE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  Galleries
or tunnels
are
sometimes
excavated
into
abutments
and
foundations
to provide
access
for drilling
drain
holes
and
grout
holes
into
the
foundation
or
into
the
embankment
foundation
contact.
Drilling
from these tunnels
after filling
of
the reservoir
is subjected
to the hazard
of uncontro-
lled ‘blow
in’
under
high
heads.
If tunnels
are
provided,
the elevations
should be judiciously
chosen
so that the hazard
of ‘blow in’ can be prevented
by
lowering
the reservoir
before undertaking
the drilling
operations
for corrective
grouting
or drainage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 When
seams are filled with silt, clay, etc, or in
faults with gauge,
it is essential
to excavate
and
backfill
the
seam
and
gauge
zones
in the entire
core contact
zone.
It is advisable
to excavate
and
backfill
a further
length
on
the
upstream
for a
distance
equal
to the reservoir
head and backfill
it
with concrete.
On the downstream
side the
seams
should
be excavated
and
backfilled
with
a well
designed
and adequate
filter
again
for a distance
equal to the reservoir
head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Relief
wells
and
drainage
trenches
are often
used at downstream
toes of dams on pervious
over-
burden
to provide
relief of seepage
pressure
and
to
control
seepage
discharges
without
permitting
piping.
Installation
of relief wells and their monitor-
ing shall be
done
as per
IS  :  5050-1968t.
When
drain
holes are installed
in rock containing
fines the
drain
should
be protected
by
a filter
system
as
shown
in Fig. 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
