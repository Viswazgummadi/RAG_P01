<<PARAGRAPH>>I. scope
-This
standard
( Part 14 ) covers
a method
for
determination
of
carbon
in all
types (
steels and alloy steels in the range of 0’005 to 2’000 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. Determination
of Carbon by Thermal Conductivity
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Oofh’ne offhe
Method-
The sample
is burnt
in a stream of oxygen
in
presence
of
a met;
accelerator.
The carbon dioxide
formed is selectively
adsorbed
on the
molecular
sieve at a tempera
ture apd released
by heating
at 300°C.
The detector
is a thermistor
cell which
senses the differenc#
between
thermal
conductivity
of the carrier gas
( with
helium
specially
for
extra-ldw
carbon,
ant
oxygen
in other cases ) and that of the carrier
gas containing
carbpn
dioxide.
This difference
i
proportional
to carbon
content
of the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

covered
the chemical
analysis
