FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
(Part I) was adopted by the  Indian Standards
Institution on 4 November 1974, after the draft finalized by the  Modular
Co-ordination
Sectional
domrhittee
had been ‘approved
by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 iince the basic decision’to adopt a 10 cm module has  been taken, the
work connected with the application of this module for  -different building
components, such as bricks, walling materials, roofing materials etc, has been
done by different committees and dimensions have been recommended by
these committees for such components.
0.2.1
However, it has been felt that some th6ught had to be given to the
need for dimensionally
co-ordinating
a particular
product, specially with
respect to the three dimensions -
length, width, heightltbckness.
It was
felt that in some cases such co-ordination of dimensions may or may not be
necessary, while in other cases it is absolutely imperative.
To identify such
parameters for individual components, it was felt that building as a whole
should be examined from the point of view of various components that go
into it and then decide on the need for dimensional co-ordination
on an
individual basis.
0.2.2
After such a decision has been arrived at, it will then be possible
for the relevant committees to adopt this principle in finally arriving at the
nominal and work sizes for the individual components.
With this end in
view the building has been divided broadly into the following five functional
groups  :
a)  ’  Functional group 1 -
Structure
b) Functional group 2 -
External envelope
c) Functional group 3 -
Internal subdivision
d) Functional group 4 -
Services and drainage
e) Functional group 5 -
Fixtures, furniture and equipment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 It was indeed very useful for the Modular Co-ordination Sectional Com-
mittee to have the views of various architects, engineers and users in arriving<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 7564 (Part I) -  1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>at a basic decision regarding the need for dimensionally co-ordinating some
of these products so that the relevant committees could exercise their mind
on such items only.
Based on these decisions, it may be possible to review
the existing Indian Standards on different subjects where dimensions have
been already given and arrive at new dimensions where necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1
It may be noted that the words ‘co-ordination’of dimensions’ instead
of ‘modular co-ordination’ have been used in the title of the standard with a
view to encouraging the concept of establishing the correlation
of two or
more products when juxtaposed together to perform  a  function.
If such a
function is not necessary or there is no function to be done, then it appears
there may not be a need for co-ordinating dimension in the products placed
together.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country.
This has been met by deriving assistance from the following:
BSPD 6432  :  Part l-1%9
Recommendations
for the co-ordination
of
dimensions in building -
arrangement
of building components and
assemblies within functional groups; Part 1 Functional groups 1, 2,
3 and 4.
British Standards Institution.
BSPD 6432  :  Part 2-1969 Recommendations
for the co-ordination
of
dimensions in building -
arrangement
of building components and
assemblies within functional
groups, Part 2 Funcfional
group 5.
British Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 This standard is one of a series of Indian
Standards
on modlllar
co-ordination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard (Part I) lays down recommendations
for co-ordinating
dimensions of building components and assemblies for functional group 1
structure which comprises of the following elements of construction  :
Foundation,
floors, roofs, floor and roof beams, roof trusses and
arches, columns, load bearing walls, staircases, ramps and raker beams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard the following definitions shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Element
of Construction
-
A functional part of a building construc-
ted from building materials and/or building components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Services
-The
group of installations each of which supplies one or
more services to a building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  ~7564 (Part l) - 1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>!&3  Assembly -  An  aggregate of building components used together.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  _Ba.ilding Component -
A building product formed as a distinct unit
having specified sizes in three dimensions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5  Bull-g
Section -
Building material formed to a definite cross-section
but
of unspecified
length.
Sections
are
usually
manufactured
by a
continuous
process,
such as rolling,
drawing,
extruding -or machimng.
Examples are angles, bars, tubes, battens, sheet, plate, wire and cable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Co-ordinating
Plane -
A plane by reference
to IA-’ kh
a building
component or assembly is coordinated
with another.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7 Co-ordinating
Space-A
space bounded by co-oramaurrg
planes
allocated
to a component,
including
allowances for tolerances and joint
clearances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>.2.8 Co-ordinating
Dimensions -A
dimension of co-ordinating
space,
which defines the relative positions of two or more components in an assem-
bly, according to the characteristics
of the components which are relevant to
assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.9  Basic Size -
The size by reference to which the limits of size are fixed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  GRADING OF COMPONENTS“AND
ASSEMBLIES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Depending upon the relative importance, the components or assemblies
shall be given a grading, A, B, or C as follow:
Grading A -
Components
or assemblies
for which dimensional
CO-
ordination is essential.
Grading B -
Components or assemblies which in some situations need
to be dimensionally co-ordinated.
Grading C -
Components or assemblies which do not require to be
dimensionally co-ordinated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
