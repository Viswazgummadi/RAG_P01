FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This IndianStandard
(Part V) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 13 September
1963, after the draft finalized by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Building
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 One of the major contributing
factors to the quality of concrete is the
quality of aggregates used therein.
The test methods given in this standard
are intended to assist in assessing the quality of aggregates.
In a given
situation, for a particular aggregate, it may not be necessary to assess all
the qualities,
and therefore
it is necessary to determine
beforehand the
purpose for which a concrete is being used and the qualities of the aggregate
which require to be assessed.
Accordingly, the relevant test methods may
be chosen from amongst the various tests covered in this standard.
For the
convenience of the users, the test methods are grouped into the following
eight parts of Indian Standard Methods of Test for Aggregates for Concrete
( IS  :  2386 - 1963):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Particle Size and Shape

<<PARAGRAPH>>,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for
the
preparation
of this
standard has taken into consideration
the views of concrete
specialists,
testing
authorities,
consumers
and
technologists
and has related
the
standard to the practices followed in this country.
Further, the need for
international co-ordination among standards prevailing in different countries<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS :23S6 (-Part  V ) - 1963<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of the world has also been recognized.
These
considerations
led the
Sectional Committee to derive assistance from C88 - 61T Tentative
Method
of Test for Soundness of Aggregates by Use of Sodium Sulphate or Magne-
sium Sulphate issued by American Society for ,Testing and Materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Wherever a reference to any Indian Standard
appears in this method,
it shall be taken as a reference to its latest version.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirkment of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS  :  2 - 1960 Rules for Rounding Off Numerical
Values  (Revised).
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the
same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 This standard
is intended
chiefly
to cover the technical
provisions
relating to testing  of  aggregates  for concrete, and it does not include all the
necessary provisions of a contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard (Part
V > covers the method of test to determine
the
resistance to disintegration
of aggregates by saturated solutions of sodium
sulphate or magnesium sulphate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-
This test
furnishes
information
helpful
in judging
the
soundness
of
aggregates
subject to weathering
action, particularly
when adequate
information
is
not available
from service records
of the material
exposed
to actual
weathering
conditions.
Attention
is called to the fact that test results
by the use of the two
salts differ considerably,
and care shall be exercised in fixing proper limits in any
specification
which may include requirements
for these tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Sieves -  Sieves of the following sizes, having square openings, comp-

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Containers -  Containers
for immersing
the samplei of aggregate in
the solution, in accordance
with the procedure described in this method,
shall be perforated in such a manner as to permit free access of the solution
to the sample and drainage of the solution from the sample without loss of
aggregate.
Arrangements
shall also be available to ensure that the volume
of the solution in which samples are immersed shall be at least five times
the volume of the sample immersed at any one time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Baskets made of suitable wire mesh or sieves with suitable
openings are
~  satisfactory
containers for the samples.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Temperature
Regulation -
Suitable
means
for
regulating
the
temperature
of the samples during immersion
in the sodium sulphate or
magnesium sulphate solution shall be provided.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  Balances -
For weighing fine aggregate, a balance having a capacity
of not less than 500 g, sensitive to at least 0.1 g, shall be used; for weighing
coarse aggregate,
a balance having a capacity
of not less than 5 000 g,
sensitive to at least one gram, shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5  Drying Oven -
The drying oven shall be capable of being maintained
between
105” and 110°C and the rate of evaporation,
at this range of
temperature,
shall average at least 25 g/h for four hcurs during which
period the doors of the oven shall be kept closed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE --  This rate shall be determined
by the loss of water from 1-litre low-form
beakers
each initially
containing
500 g of water at a temperature
of 27” f 2°C
placed
at each corner
and centre
of each shelf of the oven.
The evaporation
requirement
is to apply when the oven is empty except for the beakers of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  REAGENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Sodium Sulphate Solution -
Saturated solution of sodium sulphate
shall be prepared by dissolving sodium sulphate, technical grade, confor-
ming to IS  :  255 - 1950 Specification
for Sodium
Sulphate,
Anhydrous,
Technical,
or an equivalent
grade of the salt of either the anhydrous
(Na,SO,)
or the
crystalline
( Na,S04.10H,0)*
form in
water
at
a
temperature
of 25” to 30°C.
Sufficient salt ( see Note ) shall be added to
ensure not only saturation but aIso the presence of excess crystals when the
solution is ready for use in the tests.
The mixture shall be thoroughly
stirred during the addition of the salt and the solution shall be stirred at
frequent intervals until used.
The solution shall be cooled to a temperature
of 27” & 2°C and maintained
at that temperature
for at least 48 hours
before use.
The solution shall be thoroughly stirred immediately
before<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Experience
with the test method
indicates
that a grade of sodium
sulphate
designated
by the trade
as  dried powder,
which may be considered
as approxima-
tely anhydrous,
is the most
practical
for use.
That
grade is more economically
available
than the anhydrous
form.
The
decahydrate
sodium
sulphate
presents
difRculties in compounding
the required solution on account of its cooling effect on the
solution,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ISIt 2386 ( Part V ) - 1963<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>use and salt cakes, if any, shall be broken and the specific gravity shall be
determined.
When used, the solution shall have a specific gravity of not
less than l-151 and not greater than 1,174.
Discoloured solution shall be
discarded, or filtered and checked for specific gravity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -For
making up the solution,
350 g of anhydrous
salt or 1 150 g of the
decahydrate
salt per litre of water  are  sufficient for saturation
at 28’C.
However
since these salts are not completely
stable and since it is desirable that an excess of
crystals be present, the use of not less than 420 g of the anhydrous
salt or 1 300 g of
the decahydrate
salt per litre of water is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Magnesium Sulphate Solution -
The saturated solution of magne-
sium sulphate shall be made by dissolving magnesium sulphate, technical
grade, conforming to IS  :  257 - 1950 Specification
for Magnesium
Sulphate
(Epsom
Salt ), Technical,
or an equivalent
grade of the salt of either the
anhydrous ( MgSO, ) or the crystalline ( MgS0,.7H,O
) ( epsom salt ) form<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>in  water at a temperature
of 25” to 30°C.
Sufficient quantity of salt
( see Note ) shall be added to ensure ‘saturation and the presence of excess
crystals when the solution is ready for use in the tests.
The mixture shall
be thoroughly stirred during the addition of the salt aud the solution shall
be stirred at frequent intervals until used.
The solution shall be cooled to
a temperature of 27” & 1°C and maintained at that temperature for at least
48 hours before use.
The solution shall be thoroughly stirred immediately
before use and salt cakes, if any, shall be broken up and the specific gravity
shall be determined.
When used, the solution shall have a specific gravity
of not less than 1.295 and not more than 1.308.
Discoloured solution shall
be discarded, or filtered and checked for specific gravity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  For making
up the solution,
400 g of anhydrous
salt or 1 400 g of the
heptahydrate
per litre of water
are sufficient
for saturation
at 28°C.
However,
since these salts are not completely
stable,
with
the hydrous
salt being the more
stable of the two, and since it is desirable that an excess of crystals be present, it is
recommended
that the heptahydrate
salt be used and in an amount of not less than
1 600 g per litre of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. SAMPLES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Fine Aggregate -
Fine aggregate for the test shall be passed through
a lo-mm IS Sieve.
The sample sh@l be of such a size that it will yield not
less than 100 g of each of the following sizes, which shall be available
in
amounts of 5 percent or more, expressed in terms of the following sieves:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 All-h-Aggregate
-  All-in-aggregate
shall be separated in two major
fractions, finer than 4.75 mm and coarser than 4.75 mm.
The former shall
be dealt with as fine aggregate and the latter as coarse aggregate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
-It
shall be noted  that  testing closely sized aggregates, such as these
constitutes a more severe test than testing a graded aggregate, and this fact should
be taken into account while specifying limits in specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4  Should
the samples contain
less than 5 percent of any of the sizes
specified in 4.1 or 4.2, that size shall not be tested, but, for the purpose of
calculating
the test result, it shall be considered
to have the same loss in
sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate treatment
as the average of the
next smaller and the next larger size, or if one of these sizes is absent, it
shall be considered to have the same loss as the next larger or next smaller
size, whichever is present.
When the 20 mm to 10 mm, 40 mm to 20 mm
or 63 mm to 40 mm test samples specified in 4.2 cannot be prepared due to
the absence
of one or two sizes of aggregate shown for each, the size
available shall be used to prepare the sample tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. PREPARATION
OF TEST
SAMPLE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  Fine Aggregate -
The sample of fine aggregate shall be thoroughly
washed on a 300-micron IS Sieve, dried to constant weight at 105” to  1 10°C<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16:2386(PartV)-1963
.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and separated into different sizes by sieving as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Make a rough separation of the graded sample by means of a nest of
the,sieves specified in 4.1.
From the fractions obtained in this manner,
select samples of sufficient size to yield 100 g after sieving to refusal.
(In
general,
a 110
g sample will be sufficient.)
Fine aggregate
sticking in the meshes of the sieves shall not be used in preparing
the samples.
Samples
of 100 g shall be weighed out of each
of
the separated
fractions
after final sieving and placed
in
separate
containers for the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Coarse
Aggregate -  The
sample
of coarse
aggregate
shall
be
thoroughly washed and dried to constant weight at 105°C to 110°C and
shall be separated into different sizes shown in 4.2 by sieving to refusal.
The proper weight of sample for each fraction shall be weighed out and
placed in separate containers for the test.
In the case of fractions coarser
than the 20-mm IS Sieve, the number of particles shall also be counted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Storage of Samples in Solution -  The samples shall be immersed
in the prepared
solution of sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate for
not less than 16 hours nor more than 18 hours in such a manner that the
solution covers them to a depth of at least 15 mm (see Note ).
The con-
tainers shall be covered to reduce evaporation and prevent the accidental
addition of extraneous substances.
The samples immersed in the solution
shall be maintained
at a temperature
of 27” & 1°C for the immersion
period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE
-  Suitably weighted wire grids placed over the sample in the containers
will permit this coverage to be achieved with very light aggregates.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Drying Samples After Immersion -After
the immersion period,
the aggregate sample shall be removed from the solution, permitted to drain
for 15 f  5  minutes, and placed in the drying oven. The temperature of the
oven shall have been brought previously to 105” to 110°C.
The samples
shall be dried to constant
weight at this specified temperature.
During
the drying period, the samples shall be removed from the oven, cooled
to room temperature and weighed at intervals of not less than 4 hours nor
more than 18 hours.
Constant weight may be considered to have been
achieved when two successive weights for any one sample differ by less than
0.1 g in the case of fine aggregate samples, or by less than 1.0 g in the case
of coarse aggregate samples.
After constant weight has been achieved the
samples shall be allowed to cool to room temperature, then they shall again
be immersed in the prepared solution as described in 6.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Number
of Cycles -
The process of alternate
immersion and drying
shall be repeated until the specified number of cycles as agreed to between
the purchaser and the vendor is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  QUANTITATIVE BCAMINATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  The quantitative
examination (see Note) shall be made as follows:
a) After the completion of the final cycle and after the sample has
cooled, the sample shall be washed free from the sodium sulphate
or magnesium sulphate as determined by the reaction of the wash-
water with barium chloride ( BaCl, ).
b) After the sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate solution has been
removed, each fraction of the sample shall be dried
to constant
weight at 105” to  1  10X,  and weighed,
Fine aggregates shall be
J
sieved over the same sieve on which it was retained before the test,
and coarse aggregate over the sieve shown below for the appropriate
size of particle:

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-In
addition to the procedure described in (a) and (b), it is suggested
that
additional information
of value will be obtained by examining each fraction visually
in order to determine
whether
there is any evidence
of excessive
splitting
of the
grains.
It is also suggested that additional
information
of value will be obtained
if, after treating
each separate
fraction
of the sample as described in (b), all sizes,
including
detritus,
are combined
and a sieve analysis
made using sieves of the
following sizes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>150,300
and 800 micron,
1*18,2*36,
4.75, 10,20,40,
and 80 mm.
The results
of the sieve analysis
shall be recorded
as cumulative
percentages
retained on each sieve.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  QUALITATIVE EXAMINATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  Fractions
of samples coarser than 20 mm shall be examined qualjta-
tively after each immersion and quantitatively
at the completion of the test.
8.2 The qualitative examination and record shall consist of two parts, (a)
observing
the effect of the action
(see
Note ) by the sodium sulphate
or magnesium sulphate
solution and the nature
of the action, and (b)
counting the number of particles affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE--Many
types
of actions
may
b,e expected.
In general,
they
may
be
classified as disintegration,
splitting,
crumbling,
cracking,
flaking, etc.
While
only particles
larger
than 20 mm in size are required
to be examined
qualitatively,
it is recommended
that examination
of the smaller sizes be also made
in order to determine whether there is any evidence of excessive splitting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.  REPORTING OF RESULTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1  The report shall include the following data:
a) Weight of each fraction  of  each  sample before test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_11>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:2386(PartV)-1963<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Material from each fraction of the sample finer than the sieve on
which the fraction was retained before test, expressed as a percen-
tage by weight of the fraction.
c) Weighted average calculated
from the percentage
of loss for each
fraction, based on the grading of the sample as received for exami-
nation or, preferably, on the average grading of the material
from
that portion of the supply of which the sample
is representative.
In these calculations sizes finer than the 300-micron
IS Sieve shall
be assumed to have zero percent loss.
In the case of particles coarser than 20 mm before test, (1) the
number of particles in each fraction before test, and (2) the number
of particles affected, classified as to number disintegrating,
splitting,
crumbling,
cracking, flaking, etc.
4  Character of solution ( sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate ).
9.2 A recommended
form for recording of test data is given in Table I.
Test
values given are for illustration
and these may be appropriate
for
either salt depending on the quality of the aggregate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
