<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part IV ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 February
1972,
after
the draft finalized
by the Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Cement
concrete
is one of the most versatile
and extensively
used buil-
ding materials
in all civil engineering
constructions.
There
are a number
of technical
terms connected
with the basic materials
for concrete,
as well
as the production
and use of concrete
which quite often require clarification
to give precise
meaning
to the stipulations
in the standard
specifications,
codes of practices
and other
technical
documents.
It has, therefore,
be-
come necessary
to standardize
the various
terms and definitions
used in
cement and concrete
technology
and thus avoid ambiguity
in their
inter-
pretations.
The Sectional
Committee
has, therefore
decided
to bring
out
a series of glossaries
of terms relating
to concrete
and concrete
materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For convenience
of reference,
this glossary
of terms has been
