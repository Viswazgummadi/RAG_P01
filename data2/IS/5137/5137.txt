<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian
Standard
( Second
Revision)
was. adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 4 April 1990, after the draft finalized
by the Rubber
Products Sectional
Committee
had been
approved by the Petroleum,
Coal and Related
Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
hoses covered
under
this standard
are
used for cement

for working
pressure up to 1 MPa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

was first published in 1969 and revised
in 1982.

have been included.
Further,
requirements
for increase in diameter
and length at proof pressure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
committee
considered
it
desirable
to
include

test.
However,
no
requirement
is being included
in the present
revision
of the standard
due to inadequate
data.
Investigations
in this regard
are in progress and requirement
for this test may be included in the
standard
at a later date.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
contains clause 4.2.3 which calls for an agreement
between
the purchaser
and the
supplier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules
for rounding
off numerical
values ( revised)‘.
The
number of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
