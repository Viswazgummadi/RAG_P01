<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This  Indian
Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by,
the Water-proofing
and Damp-proofing
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen
felts
may
be of
different
types
depending
upon
the
raw material used and their
construction.
IS 1322  :  1993 ‘Specification
for bitumen
felts for water proofing
and
damp-
proofing
(&~th
revision )’  and IS 7193 : 1994 ‘Specification
for
glass
fibre
base
bitumen
felts
(first
revision )‘,  covers
bitumen
felts of hessian
base and glass fibre base respectively.
The above
standards
require
amongst
other
requirements,
detailed
testing
of each of these
products.
Various
methods
of test relating
to each product
for
determination
of physical
properties
have been included
in the separate standards.
All types of felts have to satisfy some
common essential physical requirements
for which methods of tests are same. A series of standards
covering
methods
of test have therefore
been formulated
to cover the determination
of various
physical requirements
of bitumen felt.
the standard are as follows:
This standard
covers heat resistance
test.

given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the
purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
thefinal value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules
for rounding
off
numerical
values (  revised )‘.
Tne number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same as
that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
