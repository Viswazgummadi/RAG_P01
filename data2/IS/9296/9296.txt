<<PARAGRAPH>>Dams and Reservoirs Sectional Committee, WRD 9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standards (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Dams and Reservoirs Sectional Committee had been approved bythe Water Resources Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dams have contributed to the development of the nation. However, dams may also pose a potential hazard
because of catastrophic damage which can take place due to any failure of dam or accident. A probable failure
of the dam means not only the loss of structure and the impounding capacity but sudden release of large quantity
of water stored may also cause heavy damage to life and property in the areas in the immediate downstream
vicinity of the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The necessity for proper inspection and maintenance of dams and appurtenant structures is evident. The risk of
dam failure may increase as much by neglect of proper and timely inspection ad mainten~ce
as b
inadequacies
in design and construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The major areas needing attention to inspection and maintenance of dams and appurtenant structures have been
discussed and listed in these guidelines. These are based on knowledge gained from past experience on dams
and are not necessarily exhaustive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published
in 1979. In this revision certain provisions
relating to inspection
and
maintenance of dams have been elaborated fhrther.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard considerable assistance has been taken from the following documents prepared
by the Central Water Commission, New Delhi:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Guidelines for safety inspection of dams, and
b)
Proforma for periodical inspection of darns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no 1S0 standard on the subject. This standard has been prepared based on indigenous data/practices
prevalent in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the committee responsible for the preparation of this standard is given at Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revisecj)’. The  number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
