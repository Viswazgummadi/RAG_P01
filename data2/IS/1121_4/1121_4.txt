FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(Part
IV)
(First
Revision)
was adopted
by
the Indian Standards Institution on 1 October 1974, after the draft finalized
by the Stones
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Building stones are available
in large quantity
in various parts of the
country and to choose and utilize them for their satisfactory performance
it is necessary to know the various strength properties determined according
to standard procedure.
This standard has, therefore, been formulated
to
cover the standard
method
for determining
the strength
properties
of
various stones.
This standard covering compressive, transverse and shear
strength properties was published in 1957 and is being revised based on the
actual use of it in the past 17 years and the experience gained in testing fat
these properties in the various research laboratories
of this country.
In
this revision, property of tensile strength has also been added which is also
important
for assessing the suitability
of stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
This standard is now being issued in four parts, each part covering
a specific property.
Part IV covers the determination
of shear strength
of natural
building stones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS : 2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
(Part IV)
lays down the procedure for determination
of shear strength of natural building stones used for constructional purposes.<<HEADING_END>>

OF SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The

shall be selected
to represent
a true average
of the type
or grade
of stone
under
consideration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2
The
sample
shall be selected
from
the quarried
stone or taken
from
the natural
rock, as described
in 2.2.1
and 2.2.2
and shall be of adequate
size to permit
the preparation
of the requisite
number
of test pieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  Stones from
Ledges or Quarries-The
ledge
or quarry
Sate of the
stone
shall
be inspected
to determine
any
variation
in different
strata.
Differences
in colour,
texture
and structure
shall he observed.
Separate
samples of stone weighing
at least 25 kg each of the unweathered
specimens
shall be obtained
from all strata
that appear
to vary in colour,
texture
and
structure.
Pieces
that
have
been
damaged
by blasting,
driving
rvedges,
heating,
etc,
shall
not
be included
in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Field Stone and Boulders -
A detailed
inspection
of the stone and
boulders
over the area shall be made
where the supply
is to hc obtained.
The
different
kinds of stones and their
conditions
at various
quarry
sites
shall be recorded.
Separate
samples
for each
class of stone
that
would
be considered
for use in construction
as indicated
by visual inspection
shall
be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
When
perceptible
variations
occur
in the quality
of rock,
as many
samples
as are necessary
for determining
the range in properties,shalI
be
selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. TEST
PIECES
AND CONDITIONING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Saws
shall
be used for making
test pieces
from
samples
selected
in
accordance
with
2.
Use
of hand
tools,
such
as chisel
for cutting
shall
not
be
permitted.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2
The load-bearing
surfaces shall be finished to as nearly true and parallel
planes
as possible
by using rock cuttings
saws, grinding,
polishing
wheels,
abrasive
powder.
The test pieces shall be measured
to the nearest
0.2 mm
at the centre
section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
The
load-bearing
surfaces

on each
test piece
after finishing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Using Johnson
Shear Tool-The
test piece
shall be carefully
centred in the shear tool as shown in Fig. 1 and the bolts drawn up tightly.
The tool shall then be centred in the testing machine with the centre of the

of the shear tool.
Accurate
adjustments
shall be made by hand under
a small initial load.
The speed of the moving head of the testing machine
during the application
of the load shall be not more than one millimetre
per minute,
During the test, the beam of the testing machine
shall be
kept constantly in a floating position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Using Dutton Punching Shear Device -
Centre lines shall be laid
off on one surface of the slab and the thickness of the slab shall be measured
to the nearest 0.2 mm at not Iess than three points approximately
equi-
distant around the circumference
of a 50 mm circle centred on the inter-
section of the two centre lines.
The test piece shall be carefully centred
between the upper and lower plates of the punching device so that the
measured section of the test piece is under the plunger.
The upper plate
shall be carefully lowered to contact the test piece.
The punching device
shall then be centred in the testing machine with the centre of the spherical
bearing block in contact with the centre of the top portion of the plunger
of the shear device.
Accurate
adjustment
shall be made by hand under
a small initial load.
The speed of the moving head of the testing machine
during the application
of the load shall be not more than 1 millimetre per
minute. During the test, the beam of the testing machine shall be kept
constantly in a floating position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
