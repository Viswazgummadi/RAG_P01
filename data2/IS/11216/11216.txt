<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 14 February
1985,
after the draft finalized by the Dams
(Overflow
and Non-overflow)
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Masonry
is being adopted as a standard material of construction for
low as well as high gravity dams.
One of the important
characteristics
of a construction material for water retaining structures is impermeability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 It is the common
practice
to specify the strength
requirements
of
mortar in masonry dams.
In addition,
an upper limit of permeability
for mortar and masonry in masonry dams is required to be specified with
a view to achieving
a standard of workmanship.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Varying
standards
have been used for testing masonry
in various
masonry
dams with regard
to their permeability.
Hence a need
was
felt for rationalizing
a standard criterion for the same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of  this
standard
is complied
with, the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded  off  in accordance
with
IS : 2-1960+.
The number of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value
should
be the same as that of the specified
value
in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This code gives guidelines
for permeability
tests for masonry during
and after construction
and the standards to be achieved.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>‘ISr 11216 - 19%5<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. DEFINITIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Coefficient
of Permeability
-
The
rate
of flow of water
under
laminar
flow
conditions
through
a unit
cross-sectional
area
of porous
medium
under
a unit hydraulic
gradient
and at a standard
temperature
of 27°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Lugeons
-
It is the water loss in litres per minute
per metre
depth
of
the drill hole under
a pressure
of
10 atmospheres
maintained
for
10 minutes
in a drill hole of 46 to 76 mm diameter.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. PERMEABILITY
TESTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Frequency
of  Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1
Masonry -Permeability
test for the masonry
shall be conducted
regularly
and at frequent
intervals
to judge
quality
and maintain
uni-
formity.
Every
block,
where
fresh
masonry
is laid,
shall
be
tested
at least once every year.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. I.2
Mortar -
Permeability
tests on mortar
shall
normally
be carried
out once in a week.
Specimens
100 mm dia and 50 mm high or similar
size prepared
from
mortar
as used on work shall be used for testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Testing
Procedure
for Masonry
-Test
holes 76 mm in diameter
and of appropriate
depth
(say 4 to 6 m) shall be drilled
on the built up
masonry
after
28 days hardening.
Drilling
by rotary
(diamond)
drill
shall
be preferred
in order
to have the least disturbance
of the masonry
already
constructed.
The
holes
shall be kept 300 to 600 mm above the
bottom
level
of the masonry
to be tested.
These
holes shall be drilled
vertically
in two rows.
One row shall be at 1.5 m from
the axis of the
dam.
The
second
row shall
be at about
one-third
of the width of the
dam from the rear face excluding
the front impervious
face.
The
holes
shall
be provided
staggered
and it should be seen that at least one hole
each
in upstream
and downstream
portion
in each
block
is
provided.
The
holes
may
be closer
if found
necessary
on the basis of the perme-
ability
test results.
In locating
the holes, position of any embedded
parts,
instruments,
galleries
and other opening
shall be kept in view.
The holes
thus
drilled
shall
be
cleaned,
filled
with
water
and
saturated
for
48 hours.
Then
these holes shall
be
subjected
to a water
loss test to
determine
‘Lugeon’
value.
Notwithstanding
the test pressures specified for
lugeon
values,
the actual
test pressures
should
not be so high as to cause
disturbance
to masonry.
Then
assuming
linear
variation
of water
loss
with respect
to the
pressure
applied,
the water
loss in
lugeons
may
be
interpreted.
For details of procedure
and test equipment
reference
may
be made to IS : 5529 ( Part 2 )-1973*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1 When a  concrete
membrane
is used on the upstream face of  a
masonry dam, the  upstream
hole for water 10s~ test shall
be drilled
one meter
downstream
of  the junction
of
concrete
membrane
with
masonry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2 After the water loss tests the holes shall be grouted to refusal
with
neat  cement and the results of grout intake recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Testing
Procedure
for
Mortar
-  Permeability
tests on mortar
specimen shall be conducted in accordance
with the procedure
specified
in IS  :  1727-1967*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. STANDARDS
OF IMPERMEABILITY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Masonry
- Standard of impermeability
aimed at shall be a water
loss of not more than 2’5 and 5 lugeons in the upstream and downstream
portions of the dam respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1 Permissible
water  loss  in holes drilled in accordance
with 3.2.1
shall be not more than 2.5 or  5  lugeons depending on the mortar mix
used for masonry at that location ( rich or lean respectively ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2
The values of water loss obtained
from the test is the overall
value of masonry including
loss into cracks joints,
etc.
It provides an
approximate estimate of the possible leakage that may take place through
specific zones of masonry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Mortar-Mortar
as used on work shall not give a coefficient
of
permeability
greater
than
2.5 x lo-*
mm/s
for
rich
mortar
and 4.8 x 10-s mm/s for lean mortar.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. FACTORS
AFFECTING
PERMEABILITY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Two factors affecting permeability
of the masonry are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) permeability
of mortar itself; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) workmanship,
namely,
whether voids between
the stones are
filled with mortar or left free.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Pointing in the upstream face reduces seepage through the dam,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. REMEDIAL
MEASURES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 If the test results indicate
water loss greater
than specified
values
grouting
should
be done as a remedial
measure.
Grouting
pressure
should be kept such that it does not damage the constructed
masonry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
