<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee, CED 53<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cast iron manhole covers and frames are prone to pilferage and misuse due to its high resale value. Precast
concrete
manhole covers and frames which are found to satisfy the general requirements
specified
in
IS 1726:1974’ Specification for cast iron manhole covers and frames: Part 1General requirements @-st revision)’
have proved to be good substitute to cast iron manhole covers and frames. As such, use of such covers and
frames is increasing day-by-day.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been prepared with a view to guiding the manufacture and use of precast reinforced cement
concrete manhole covers and frames. This standard covers the requirements of precast concrete manhole
covers and frames manufactured using reinforced cement concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manufacturing process of precast concrete manhole covers and frames is simple and requires only ordinary
locally available machinery, such as concrete mixers, vibrators, appropriate moulds, hydraulic jacks, etc. These
products can be produced in existing factories producing precast concrete products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in two parts, namely, Part 1Covers and Part 2 Frames, brought out in 1988 and
1991respectively. This revision has been taken up in view of the change in grade and test load of manhole covers
and frames in IS 1726: 1991 ‘Specification for cast iron manhole covers and frames (third revision)’, and to
incorporate the modifications found necessary in light of the experience gained while using the earlier version of
the standard. It was also felt that instead of having two separate standard for manhole covers and frames,
requirements of both should be covered in one standard. Accordingly in this revision the requirements of both
covers and frames are covered by merging the Part 1 and Part 2 of the erstwhile standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in Annex D.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposeof deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
1S2:1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)’. The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

All covers shall be submitted to the following
tests:
a) Measurement of the permanent set of the cover
after the application of 2/3 of the test load.
b) Application of test load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The permanent set shall then be determined on the
difference of the measured readings before the first
and the fifth loading. The permanent set shall not
exceed 1/100 times the diameter of the largest circle
