<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Bitumen, Tar and Their Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Petroleum, Coal and Related Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1953 and revised in 1961 in order to incorporate references to various
methods of tests (IS 1201 to 1220) suitably subsequent to their publication in 1958. In the present version
the requirements
have been updated in accordance with the current manufacturing and trade practices
and also in accordance with the revised methods of tests prescribed in IS 1202  :  1978 to IS 1220  :  1978
‘Methods for testing tar and bituminous materials (fust  revision)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is one of the series of Indian Standards on bitumen. Other specification so far published
in the series are  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 73  :  1992
Paving bitumen ( second  revision )  (Amendment No. 1)
IS 217  :  1988

.IS 702  :  1988
Industrial bitumen (  second revision )  (Amendment No. 1) (Re-affirmed 1993)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated expressing the result of a test or analysis shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised)‘. The  number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
