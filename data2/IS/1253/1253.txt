<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Third Revision
) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft finalized by the Light Metals and Their Alloys Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1958 and subsequently
revised in 1965 and 1980. In this
revision following modifications
have been made:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Scope has been enlarged to cover any other
shape suitable for use in the manufac-
ture of iron and steel,
b) A separate clause giving all the latest
references
has been added,
c) The clauses on chemical composition
and chemical analysis have been modified,
d) Grades 1930 and 1970 have been redesignated
as Grades 1 and 2 to avoid ambiguity
with respect to IS 6051  : 1970,  and
e) The requirement
of test certificate
for each consignment
has been added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied with,
the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be
rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(  revised )‘.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
