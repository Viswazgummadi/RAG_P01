<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Sanitary Appliances and Water Fittings Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first issued in 1973 and subsequently revised in 1984. In view of the sixth-revision of
IS 779 ‘Specification for water meters (domestic type)’ in 1994, the revision of this standard also became
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the revision of this standard, considerable assistance has been derived from IS0 4064 (Part 3)  :  1983
‘Measurement
of water flow in closed conduits -
Meters for cold water -
Part 3 Test method and
equipment’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of committee responsible for the preparation of thisstandard
is givenin Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>METHODS FOR PERFORMANCE TESTING
OF WATER METERS (DOMESTIC TYPE)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>(  Second Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pump connections
to the testing set-up are to be
made with a gate valve  E  and mercury manometer
or pressure
gauge and/or differential
pressure
gauge as shown in Fig. 1. It is recommended
to run
the pump at its maximum efficiency and control the
discharge to the testing set-up by means of a bye-
pass arrangement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard lays down the methods of tests for the
performance requirements of water meters covered
in IS 779  :  1994.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standard IS 779  :  1994 ‘Specification for
water meters (domestic type) (siwth revision)’ is a
necessary adjunct to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.1 A bye-pass arrangement
with connecting
line to the meter gives a steady flow~dampening
small fluctuations.
Any other method of dampen-
ing fluctuations may also be used. This is absolutely
necessary in the case of the minimum starting flow
test and metering accuracy test. This arrangement
may not be required where separate test bench is
used for conducting the minimum startingflow test
and the metering accuracy test. Any other method
of controlling flow may then be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 TEST EQUIPMENT AND TEST SET-UP FOR
PRESSURE TIGHTNESS, METERING
ACCURACY AND LOSS-OF PRESSURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Test Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main equipment (see Fig. 1) required for test-
ing is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pump set (centrifugal)
and/or overhead
tank,
Mercury manometer
or pressure
gauges
and/or differential pressure gauge,
Measuring tanks with level indicator,
Sluice valves or gate valves,
Stop watch or electronic timer, and
Rotameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.2 The  capacity of the pump should be deter-
mined based on the number of meter(s) proposed
to be tested in series. The pump should be capable
of delivering water more than Qrn~, through 1 or
N number of meters (where N is the numerical
number of meters being tested in series), at a
delivery head more than the sum of pressure loss as

<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1  Test Bench<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A centrifugal pump or any other suitable arrange-
ment to ensure the required differential head and
discharge, may Abe used. The pump, where used,
should have a stable head discharge characteristics
and should be free from cavitation effects. Con-
stant suction condition arrangements are necessary
to avoid dischargevariation
during the testing. The
pump which can give more than the specified
delivery head [required to test meter(s) in series],
and discharge value can also be used.
Proper
~precautions and arrangements should be made to
dampen the vibrations by taking care about the
alignment of pump and meter coupling by making
suitable flexible joints between the pump delivery
line and meter connections.
Supports
shall be
provided at suitable intervals on pipe lengths. The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.3 Other suitable arrangements for testing by
direct connection to pressure main or using over-

for some time in the open to acclimatize it at the
ambient temperature.
It shall then be tested again
for flow tests (see 6) and pressure tightness test (see

satisfies the above requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 The meter(s) shall be subjected to hydrostatic

it should bc subjected for the test for (b) above.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  After mounting the meter(s) on the test bench
as specified in 3.2.1 the pump or the pumping
medium should be switched on to let the water flow
through the meter(s) and the air is purged out of
the system. The downstream valve should then be
closed. The pressure shall then start building up
and should be maintained at the above value for
the given time. The meter should withstand con-
stantly the above pressure without defects in its
function, leakage, seepage or permanent deforma-
tion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
