FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 25 November
1985 after the draft finalized by the Measurement
of
Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 In measurement
of quantities in construction
of river valley projects a
large diversity of methods exist at present according
to local practices.
This lack of uniformity
creates complication
regarding measurements
and
payments.
This standard
is intended
to provide
guidance
regarding a
uniform
basis for measurement
of instrumentation
items in river valley
projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3 In reporting the results of measurement
made in accordance with this
standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it
shall be done in accordance with IS:  2-1960”.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the method of measurement
of work related to
instrumentation
items in river valley projects.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GENERAL RULES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Clubbing of Item -  Items may be clubbed together and that the break
up of the clubbed items are agreed to be on the basis of the detailed
description of the items stated in this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Booking of Dimensions-
In booking
dimensions,
the order shall be
consistent and generally in the sequence of length, width and height or
depth or thickness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules for rounding
off numerical values (  revised ).<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9401( Part 8 ) - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Description of Items -
The description of each item shall unless and
otherwise
stated, be held to include where necessary,
conveyance
and
delivery handling,
unloading,
storing, fabrication,
hoisting all labour for
finishing to required
shape and size setting, fitting and fixing in position,
straight cutting and waste return or packings, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Measurement -
All works shall be measured net in decimal system as
fixed in its place subject to the limitation:
Linear
dimensions
shall be
measured to the nearest of 0.01 metre.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. PLEZOMETERS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Porus tube piezometers (aluminum
pipe ), thin tube hydraulic founda-
tions type piezometers
and embankment
piezometers shall be measured in
units of numbers
and shall be designated in terms of R.D. (reduced
distance ), station number and elevation; and shall include the following:
a) All connected works pertaining to making of main trenches/offset
trenches
in the compacted
material of embankment
( in case of
embankment tips ) and backfilling and compacting the material in
specified layers after laying the tubing for tips, riser vertical steel
pipes for avoiding reverse slopes, steel housing for temporary
housing of the reels of the said tips.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The quantity of bentonite, mud/cement gravel, etc, if required;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The bore holes required to be made for foundation tips;
d) The installation
and removal of casing pipe to maintain the holes
during installation of tip assembly;
e) Qrosole solution or wetting agent for circulation of water in tips,
boiiing of tips and boiling of water for filling pipes for taking pore
pressure measurement;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Epoxy rubber sheath wooden block and other petty items like black
conduit, tapes and plump bob item; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Any wooden racks for facilitating the proper laying of twin tubes
in trench.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The PVC twin tube from the pipe to instrumentation
house/well shall
be measured in running metres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 The pipes in case of porous tube piezometres
shall be measured in
running metres stating diameter and the type of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Typical Terminal well constructed
in RCC or in some special cases
fabricated
out of GI pipe shall be enumerated
and shall include the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Suitable measure like water proofing and painting of terminal well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
