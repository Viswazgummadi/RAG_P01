<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted  by  the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 22 March 1990, after the
draft
finalized
by the
Solar
Energy
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Heavy
Mechanical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A solar water heating system consists mainly of three components,
namely
solar collector,
storage
tank
and connecting
pipes.
Other. components
which
may be require3
are
heat exchangers,
circulating
pumps and measuring instruments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard gives general characteristics
of all
types of solar water

systems
with flat
plate or tubular collectors and their performance
evaluation
methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This system works without the aid of pump and
instrumentation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1,  Thcrmosyphon System<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This system is shown in Fig, IA and 1B. It works
on the principle
of natural
convection.
The
water from
the bottom
of the tank enters the
solar collector
and gets heated.
This heated
water becomes
less dense and rise again to the
tank.
This
continues
till
the
temperature
differential at the bottom and top remain. In this
system since the density difference is the driving
force:
a) Pipe friction losses should be low,
b) Pipe should
have -minimum
length with
larger
diameter
( above
25 mm )
with
minimum fittings,
c) To prevent the reverse
thermosyphoniog
during night,
the
top of the collector
header should be more
than 50 cm below
the bottom of the storage tank,
d) For very cold climates a heat exchanger
with water,
mixed with anti-freeze
liquid
is recommended,
and
e) The heat exchanger is also recommended
when water is very hard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Active !3ystems
In this  system, the working
fluid is transported
by forced
circulation
which
involves
use of
pumps and controls.
The major components
of
these types of systems are collector, storage tank,
circulation
pumps and
differential
thermostat.
In addition
a complete
system
requires  .  items
such as auxiliary
heating unit, heat exchangers
and expansion
tanks, valves and gauges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>systems
use a heat transfer
fluid
and
heat
exchanger
to heat service water.
In very cold
climate, this system is recommended
to protect
the freezing.
It is also used where water
is too
hard or acidic
which msy cause scale deposits
that clog or corrode
the
fluid
passage.
The
closed loop
systems require
an expansion
tank
to accommodate
pressure changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Solar Collector<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Solar collector should always be kept facing due
south
at an inclination
so
that
it receives
maximum radiation.
This inclination
depends on
the utility
pattern
of hot water.
The optimum
value for inclination
of the collector
with the
horizontal is latitude for year round performance
and latitude + 10” to + 15” for water months
and latitude - 10” to - 15” for summer months.
When a row of collectors
are mounted, to avoid
shading,
the minimum
distance
between
the
two collectors

<<PARAGRAPH>>The part of the system which collects the energy.
They may be of many types such as evacuated

high

to provide

over a wide range
of
temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Storage Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  thermal energy storage
in solar water heat-
ing system is in one or two tanks.
It should be
such sized as to store 1’5 to 2 times the average
daily hot water usage.
The tank capacities
are
generally chosen between
40 to 100 litres rn-’ of
collector
area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6  Pumps
The selection of p,ump must consider
the head
and discharge
requirements
and the operating
temperature
and pressure losses.. In solar water
heating
system usually
a centrifugal
pump
is
recommended.
When oil or hydrocarbon
( high
microns
liquids ) is used in the loop,
positive
displacement
pump should be used with a relief
valve on the pump outlet.
4.7  System Piping.and Fittings<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1 The material used for tank may be copper,
steel, aluminium or concrete.
But the inner side
of the tank
must be of a material which
does
not contaminate
water
( if direct system ), is
non-corrossive,
and stable at maximum operating
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2 The tank outlet to the collector should be
about 10 cm above
the tank bottom to prevent
scale
deposits
from being
drawn
into
the
collector..
The hot water outlet pipe should be
at the top end to
increase
stratification
in
thermosyphon
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The material of the pipe must
be compatible
with the working fluid, its velocity of flow and
with the material of riser tubes in the collector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3 The exterior
of the tank must be properly
insulated so that the hot water temperature
does
not decrease by more than 8°C in about 16 hours
time. Generally thickness of 7-10 cm of fibreglass
or cork insulation is provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7.1 The collector array
and piping
should be
properly
insulated
to avoid
heat
loss.
After
insulation
they are convered by aluminium
foil
to avoid damage to insulation.
4.8 Valves and Gauges<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Expansion Tank<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The valves and its seals should be such that it is
able to bear maximum temperature
and compa-
tible with fluid used.
These
valves
must
be
placed properly such that its function cannot be
deactivated
by anything.
4.9  Control Systems
In an active solar water heating
system, control
systems are used to switch on a circulation
pump
whenever energy gain is possible
through solar
collectors.
Otherwise, it automatically
switches
off the
pump.
A differential
thermosta’t
is
recommended
as it optimizes the energy gain for
the system. A fixed point controller
is used when
the system is employed for process applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The volume
change
of
fluid in
closed loop
system
must be accommodated
by an external
expansion
tank.
The sizing of this tank
must
account
for the
variation
of
density
with
temperature
for the fluid uSed in loop. Generally
expansion tank
is 3 to 4 of the total
volume of
storage tank.
The maximum operating tempera-
ture of these tanks should
be taken
as equal to
collector
stagnation
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Heat Exchangers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heat exchangers are used for protection
against
freezing, scaling and corrosion.
Heat exchanger
selection
considers
its effectiveness,
pressure
drop,
flow rate and
total
protection
of the
potable water from contamination
if the working
fluid is toxic.
It must be properly
insulated and
thermally
compatible
with system design para-
meters.
Its overall heat transfer co-efficient and
heat transfer area should be large. The exchanger
effectiveness
is given as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5  AUXILIARY HEATING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In hot weather

heating
unit run by electricity,
fuel or gas is
needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

material is
added tothe loop and heat exchanger is employed
to heat potable
water.
The concentration
of
antifreeze material depend
on severity of freeze
conditions
expected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 Types of Corrosion and Prevention<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1.2  Drain Down Sysrem
One method of freeze protection
is to drain the
collector
when a freezing
condition
is sensed,
that is, when temperature
in thecollector
falls
below 4°C.
An automatic
air vent is located at
highest post of the system.
When the collector
array is filling, air vents out and vents close.
When the pump stops either freeze conditions or
due to power
failure,
the vents get open under
atmospheric
pressure and collector array drains
water into storage tank ( Fig. 7 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion
in metals in the system may occur
both internally within
the fluid passages
of the
collector
and system pipe work
and externally
on the surfaces of the collector box and absorber
plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.1.  Oxidation Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Oxygen dissolved in heat transfer .fluid oxidize
the metal and cause corrosion.
This
is easilv
prevented in closed loop
system where the fluid
i,s not in direct contact
with air.

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Over Heating<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>system, air enters the system through
vents and
may cause corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During periods of high radiation
and low hot
water demand,
over heating
may occur in the
collector or storage
tanks.
Protection
against
overheating
must be considered
for all portions
of
the
solar
water
heating
system.
Liquid
expansion or excessive pressure may burst piping
or storage tanks.
Steam or other gases within a
system
may restrict
liquid
flow,
making
the
system
inoperable.
In indirect
systems where
antifreeze
fluids such as glycol are used, over-
temperature
protection
is needed
to limit the
fluid degradation
at higher
temperature
closing
collector stagnation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.2
Bimetallic or Galvanic Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This corrosion
occurs
between
two dissimilar
metals when in contact with an electrolyte.
:  In
such cases dimetallic
insulating
couplings
like
PTFE
tape in threaded
joints
should
be used
specially
when water is the fluid and two dis-
similar metals are joined.
This corrosion
may
also be prevented,by
putting a sacrificial
anode
of higher electromotive
potential than any other
metal in the system like in copper collector with<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Solar
collectors
are
usually
mounted
on
the
ground
on flat or pitched
roofs.
A roof localion
necessitates
the
penetration
of the
building
envelope
for mounting
hardware,
piping
control
and wiring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.3
ion  Exchange
Pitting Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It occurs
when
the fluid carry heavy
metals
ions,
deposit
them 6n another
metal
in
the presence
of an
electrolyte.
It is a localized
attack
that
may
result
in
penetration
and
subsequent
leakage.
Heavy
metal
ions
may be
present
in
the fluid naturally
or may appear
due to corro-
sion in other
part
of the system.
To
siippress
the  ion
exchange
between
the
metal
and
ion,
corrosion
inhibitors
be added
in transport
fluid:
These
ions
present
in
the
fluid
alter
the pH.
Therefore
pH should
be constantly
monitored
to
retain
its n‘eutrality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
mounted
on
racks
the
collector
array
becomes
more
vulnerable
to wind
gusts
as the
angle
of the moment
increases.
Collectors
rnfy
be uplifted
by wind striking
the undersides.
This
wind
load,
in
addition
to the
equivalent
roof
area should
be determined
according
to aecepted
engineering
procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2  Storage
Tank<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Storage
tank should
be placed
as near
to
the
collector
as possible
to reduce
piping
length
and
heat
losses.
The
tank
should
be properly
insulated.
After insulation
it may be covered
by
reflective
aluminium
foil.
In an
active
system
the tank
may be placed
inside
the building.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.4
Crevising Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It  is similar
to pitting
corrosion
and results
in a
rapid
metal
loss
inside
a crevice.
The crevice
formation
may
be
the
result
of bad
fittings,
leaky
gaskets,
scale
deposits,
blockages
or un-
usual
flow patterns.
The fluid
passage
should
not be blocked
and in
system
some
inhibitors
should
be added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3  Piping and Fitting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The piping
length
should
be as small as possible
with minimum
joints
and elbows.
They must
be
leak proof.
Pipe bends
should
be
preferred
to
elbows
since they have less pressure
drop.
The
pipe
must
be properly
insulated
and
made
weather
proof
by covering
with aluminium
foils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.5
Scaling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water
coritains
variety
of metallic
and
non-
metallic
impurities
such as calcium
and
magne-
sium compounds.
These
impurities
precipitate
as
scales
under
certain
influences.
To
avoid
scaling,
deionized/neutral
pH water
should
be
used or some inhibitors
should
be added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.1
The slope of the pipe should
be such that  ;
proper
draining
of the collector
array
is ensured.
There
should
be no inverted
U shape
loop to
avoid
air traps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.2
In the system
all valves
must be accessible
for rapid
turn-off
if emergency
shut
down
.is
required.
The wiring
used to :onnect
sensors
to
the control
unit must
be impervious
to moisture
and should
be placed
away
from power
lines to
avoid
electromagnetic
interference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
