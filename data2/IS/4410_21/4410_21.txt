ing the overland
flow phase starting
with the
entry of surface run-off into stream channels.
2.10 Community
Preparedness
-
These are the
actions directed to provide for defensive response
by the
people
to
flood
warnings
with
the
objective
to save lives and lessen the social and
economic impact from flood hazards.
2.11 Design Flood -

flood corresponding
to some stipulated
desired
frequency
of occurrence
or hysterical
or any
other
flood

upon
the standard
of
security
to
be provided
consistent
with its
purpose.
2.12 Detention Reservoir -
These are the reser-
voirs provided along or beside a river
course
to
retard
or delay
flood run-off thereby reducing
the flood volumes and hence also heights
in the
downstream.
These
may eventually release the
stored water back into the stream.
2.13 Disaster Preparedness
-
These are actions
designed
in advance
for
any
disaster
( like
floods) to minimize loss of life and property
and
to organize
and facilitate timely

evacuation,
rescue,
relief
and
rehabilitation
at
the time in the close vicinity of a disaster.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is capable
of carrying
within the banks.
2.3 Bankful
Stage-It
is the stage
or gauge
height attained by a river or stream when flowing
at capacity
above
which the banks are over-
flowed.
2.4 Base Flow-It
is that
portion
of flow in the
channel or stream which is not contributed
by
the current
flood.
The magnitude
of base flow
may vary before, during and after the flood.
2.5 Bore-A
monoclinical
wavefront
advancing
relatively to a channel flow in either direction
or
on a dry bed,
It is also called a moving hydrau-
lic jump or surge front.
A bore caused by a
tidal inflow into an estuarial
stream is termed as
‘eager’.
2.6 Broad-Crested
Flood-A

high stage is maintained
over a long period.
2.7 Catastrophic
Flood -
A flood due to
an
exceptional
combination

and
hydrological
conditions
with
intense
rainfall
occurring
for a period considerably
longer than
the time of concentration

Surges
or boreflow due to dam bursts are also called by
the same name due to the suddeness of the water
heights and the large surge front celeritics.

2.39 Maximum
Flood -
The highest

the
recorded floods at a section of a stream during

specified
period;
the period
may be a week, a
month,
a year or even the entire
period
of
record.
2.40 Percentage
Frequency
of a Given Flood -
The percentage
of observed
hoods

Concentration
-
The
time taken by the run-off from the farthest point
of the catchment
to reach the outlet

2.42 Probable
Maximum Flood ( PMF ) -
It is
the flood that may be expected
from the
most
severe combination
of critical meteorological
and
hydrological
conditions
that
are
reasonably
possible in the region and is computed
by using
the probable
maximum
storm which is an esti-
mate of the physical
upper
limit to maximum
precipitation
for the basin. This is obtained from
transportation
studies
of the storms that have
occurred
over the region and maximizing them
for the most critical atmospheric
conditions.
2.43 Regulating Reservoir -
A reservoir
formed
in a river
valley or other basin by a barrier or
dam having controlled
outlets.
2.44 Retarding
Basin -
A basin for reducing
peak flood flows of stream through temporary
storage.
2.45 Return
Period
Flood -
A flood
with
a
return
period of  'T'  year and (  'T'
year hood )
is defined
as a hood
that is expected, on the
average,
to be equalled or exceeded once,
in  T
Thus the probability
of occurrence of a
~~r~‘equalling
or exceeding the  'T'  year flood
is l/T.
NOTE -  The ‘T’ year flood should specify the flood
element
(  for
example,
peak
discharge volume,
volume above threshold,
etc ) which is considered
in
the probability
analysis.
While using this concept
in
application,
the
flood
element
to be used
in
the
analysis
is to be decided
with
reference
to
the
engineering
design requirements.

aim at lowering
the water levels in the river by diverting all or a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

It is the flood
that may be expected
from
the

factors that are considered
reasonably
