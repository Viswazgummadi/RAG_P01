FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institu-
tion on 25 April 1979, after the draft finalized
by the Corrosion
Protection
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Structural
and -Metals
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The effect of design as a factor in the prevention
of corrosion
is  very
important,
as good
design
of structures
help to keep
the maintenance
costs low in relation
to competitive
materials.
For
the best results,
the
prevention
of corrosion
should begin at the drawing-board
stage
and it is
important
that designers,
engineers,
architects
and others should constantly
have in mind
the avoidance
of details
that
may aggravate
corrosion
or
interfere
with the effective
application
of protective
systems
and their
subsequent
maintenance.
Design
used in this context
means not only the
physical
shape or form of the component
or structure
but also includes
the
materials
of construction,
the service
environment,
and
the
protective
system
to be used as well.
This
standard
shall
help
the designers
to
identify
and design out potential
corrosion
hazards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In the preparation
of this standard,
assistance
has been
derived
from
the following
publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SHREIR (  LL ),  Ed.
Corrosion,

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
lays down
the principles
governing
design
that
shall
prevent
or reduce
the risks of corrosion.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS t 9172  l  1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. SERVICE ENVIRONMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The choice
of  corrosion
prevention
method depends largely
on the
intended service environment
and it should be thoroughly
assessed before
making a choice of the protective systems, since the corrosive factors to be
cbnsidered
shall
vary
according
to the
type of environment
and the
materials used. Broadly, exposure to the conditions given in 2.1.1 to 2.1.4
may arise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1
Exposure to External Atmospheres -
The rate of corrosion
depends
primarily on the type of metal or alloy, rainfall,
humidity, temperature,
degree of atmospheric
pollution and the angle and extent of exposure to
the prevailing wind and rain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2  Exposure to Internal Atmospheres -
Internal atmospheres in buildings
may vary; exposure in the
occasionally
hot, steamy
atmosphere
of a
kitchen or bathroom  is  more severe than in other rooms.
Condensation
may occur in roof spaces or cavity walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.3
Exposure to Water -
Many details
in building
construction
may
permit rain water to enter and this may be retained
in crevices in metal
surfaces, or between a metallic and some other surface.
on to metal surfaces.
Water may drip
These
conditions
which involve a greater risk of
corrosion than exists where a metal is exposed to the normal action of the
weather, are more severe when the water contains corrosive agents derived
from the atmosphere or from materials
with which the water comes into
contact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.3.1
For structures, submerged in water, the factors affecting the
corrosion rate are dissolved gases, salts, pH, temperature,
rate of flow and
the film-forming
characteristics
of the water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.4
Embedment
in  Soil -
For
structures,
embedded
in
soil,
the
important
factors
affecting
the
rate
of
corrosion
are
compactness,
electrical
conductivity,
moisture retention,
oxygen content,
heterogeneity
of the soil, and presence of stray currents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Use of Unstressed
Metal -
Metals,
exposed to corrosive
environ-
ments, should preferably
be used in an unstressed condition,
as stressed
steel adjacent
to unstressed
steel
may result
in the
formation
of a
galvanic
cell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1
Residual stresses, if present,
should be in a direction
to oppose
those occurring in service, especially if the conditions
are likely to induce
stress-corrosion
susceptibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ks t 9172 - i979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2  The possibilities
of stress-corrosion
cracking
may
be reduced
by
use of protective
coatings
on the steel or by inducing
compressive
surface
stresses by means
of shot peening,
rolling
or swaging.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Contact with other Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1
Other Metals
-
Electrochemical
corrosion
may
occur
at contact
surfaces
between
different
metals.
Some
metals,
like nickel
and
copper
aggravate
the corrosion
of steel, whereas
more electronegative
metals,
like
aluminium
and zinc, reduce
it. The danger
of bimetallic
corrosion
is most
serious
for immersed
structures
but
should
also
be
considered
when
designing
atmospheric
or buried
structures.
The
possibility
of bimetallic
corrosion
may be prevented
by one or more of the following
methods:
4
b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Insulating
the contact
surfaces;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Making
the joints
water-tight
and using an impermeable
coating
to keep out the electrolyte;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Applying
a metallic
coating
to the
steel
so as to reduce
the
potential
difference
between
the non-ferrous
metal
and it, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Applying
overall
cathodic
protection
for buried
or immersed
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2
Di$krent
Types of Steel -
Contacts
between
mild steels and/or
low
alloy
steels may
not affect
corrosion
appreciably,
if they
are
free from
millscale.
Trouble
might
arise, however,
at contacts
between
these
steeIs
and stainless
steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3
Concrete -
Portland
cement
concrete
is highly
alkaline
and tends
to inhibit
rusting,
moreover,
the reaction
of the carbon
dioxide
in air with
the cement
leads
to effective
sealing
of the
surface
layer
of dense
well-
made
concrete.
However,
corrosion
of steel embedded
in Portland
cement
concrete
may
take place
under
certain
conditions.
Reference
may
be
made to IS  :  9077-1979*
for suitable
preventive
measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.4
Timber -
Where
steel is in contact
with
timber
under
corrosive
conditions,
the faces of both materials
should
be coated
with
hot tar or
with
bitumen
bedding
compound
containing
asbestos
or
other
fillers,
immediately
before
they
are brought
together.
An insulating
sheet
of
plastic,
for example,
polythene,
may also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.4.1
Large
washers
of neoprene
or similar
material
should
be
fitted under nuts and bolt-heads
to prevent
water
entering
the wood.
The
nuts and bolt-beads
should
be coated
in the same way as the bolts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should
be provided
where
steel touches
other corrosive
materials
like gypsum
plaster
and penetration
of water should
be prevented.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. DESIGN
DETAILS
FOR CORROSION
PREVENTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.0  Corrosion
may be reduced
by correct
planning
of the structural
layout
and the arrangement
of details,
particularly
of those
parts most liable
to
corrosive
attack.
Some typical
examples
of details
that have been
found
to initiate
local corrosion
and
of alternative
arrangements
to avoid this,
are given in 4.1 to 43.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Entrapment of Moisture and Dirt<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  Corrosion Points -
Corrosion
is most likely where rain,
condensed
moisture
and dust collect.
To avoid such corrosion
points
( JCI Fig. 1 ) the
whole surface should
be kept as smooth
as possible,
without
sharp
edges,
sharp
corners,
cavities
or unnecessary
protruberances.
Welded
tubular
construction
is at an advantage
in this respect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2  Joints -Joints
should
be arranged
to give clean,
uninterrupted
lines.
Generally,
welds are preferable
to bolts or rivets,
butt welds
to lap
welds, and continuous
welds to spot welds.
If lap joints
have
to be used,
appropriate
welding
or filling
with mastic
may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3  Fasteners -
Care
is needed
in the design
of fasteners
and
the
choice
of material
for them.
The faying surfaces of friction
grip bolts need
special
treatment,
Spraying
them with aluminium
results
in the highest
slip factor
( coefficient
of friction
) and helps to protect
the shanks
of the
bolts as well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Cavities and  Crevices<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1
Filling -
Cavities
and crevices
should
be avoided
or, if unavoid-
able, filled in by welding
or mastic
( see Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.1
Any large cavity
that may be inaccessible
when the structure
is -completed
should
be sealed
with
weld metal;
where
required,
the
sealing
should
be tested by internal
air pressure.
Another
method
is to fill
the cavities
with
concrete,
vibrated
into
position.
Small
spaces may be
filled with mastic
or rust inhibitive
paste or steel packings
coated
with an
inhibitive
paint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
Hollow Structures -
If box sections,
tubular
steel parts and similar
hollow structures
may be properly
sealed,
so as to pass an air pressure
test,
their internal
surfaces
should
not need protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

CREVICES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.1
Where hermetic sealing is impracticable,
these surfaces are
subjected to alternating
condensation
and evaporation of moisture caused
by the  (  breathing  ’  of the enclosed space and the fluctuating difference
between
the internal
and external
temperatures.
In the circumstances
provision
of drainage
holes and painting
of internal
surfaces may be
necessary,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.2
Protection
may be prolonged by using desiccants
to reduce
the internal humidity.
Silica-gel,
used at the rate of 250 g/ma of void, is
effective for 2 to 3 years inside a reasonably
well-sealed
structure,
if the
manholes are kept closed.
The desiccant should be renewed at intervals
and it should
not be relied
on solely if its presence
is likely to be
forgotten.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3
Enclosed Steelwork -
When
steelwork
is enclosed
in brickwork,
boarding, plaster or other materials,
the first essential is that the surround-
ing space should be kept dry, that is below
the critical
humidity
for
rusting.
If this is not possible, an effective
protective
coating may be
needed,
particularly
for steel
surfaces in outer walls and behind
dry
casings or false ceilings.
In some buildings,
these may be exposed to
process fumes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Careful design is needed to avoid corrosion of steel panelling
on the cold side of air spaces, whether filled with insulation or not. An air
space should be left between the steel and the insulation
and arrange-
ments made for warm inside air to flow up through this.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

PREVENTION
METHODS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.0 In general, corrosion prevention methods may be generally
classified
into four main groups:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Treatment
of the environment
to render it non-corrosive,
b) Protective
coatings,
c) Cathodic protection,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Use of corrosion resistant structural steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Choice of Protective
Schemes
-
The choice of the corrosion pro-
tection method should be made at a very early stage, and the following
inter-related
points should be considered in arriving at a decision:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Applications<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  Ease and EBciency
of Coating -
The
designer should ensure that<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>protective
coatings may be applied with ease and efficiency
SO  as.  to
achieve a continuous, uniform coating everywhere.
Consequently,
details,
such as back
to back angles, recesses,
deep  corners
and behind
holes
should be avoided
( see Fig. 8 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2  Avoidance
of
Sharp Edges and Corners -
Rounded
contours and
corners are preferable
to sharp edges and corners, which are difhcult to
coat evenly ( see Fig. 9 ).
Moreover,
coatings are particularly
liable
to
damage at edges. Tubular sections are better than I or H sections in these
respects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3
Galvanizing and Difi-fainting
-
Vent-holes
and drain-holes should
be provided in assemblies that are to be hot-dip galvanized or dip-painted
to avoid internal pressures and air-locks during immersions, and to ensure
that molten zinc or paint is not retained in pockets on withdrawal,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4
Faying
Surfaces -
Coatings
on faying
or flexing
surfaces
are
particularly
vulnerable
to damage.
For example,
the failure of outdoor
pipelines is most frequently due to the abrasion of the coating through the
expansion and contraction
of bearing surfaces.
provide graphite pipe slides.
One possible remedy is to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  Cathodic Protection -
Where cathodic protection
is to be applied,
the design should ensure good electrical
conductivity
throughout
and,  if
necessary
insulation
from
neighbouring
structures
( see  also  IS  :  3068-
1976* ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4  Treatment of the Environment -  The environment may be treated
either, to remove the corrosive
constituents
from the environment
or to
add inhibitor to the environment
to render it non-corrosive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  GENERAL DESIGN FEATURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 General Structure Design -
The general design of a structure may
effect the performance
of a protective scheme.
It is much easier to protect
tubular construction than lattice work,
Tubes may be better than wires
for guys and similar supports.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  Access -
The
design should admit easy access to all parts of the
structure and thereby make it possible to inspect and renew the protective<<HEADING_END>>

Thus,
any falsework,
screens or loadings that
would impair access
to the erected
structure
should
be made readily

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Load-Bearing
Members
-
If
the
design
permits,
load-bearing
members
should
be located
where
the corrosive
conditions
are least
intense.
For example,
the members
supporting
the roof of a tank for
corrosive chemicals should be fitted to the outside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4  Services
-
The locations of service pipes, cables and ducts attached
to the structure, passing through box girders should be agreed between all
interested
parties before preparation
of detail design drawing.
Lack of
attention
to such matters
may lead to the creation
of corrosion points.
These
arise,
for example,
where
pockets
are formed
by not keeping
conduits clear of the steelwork or where steam and other exhausts from
pipes are allowed to impinge on it.
The time required
for maintenance
is uneconomically
prolonged if the service equipment
has to be moved
before starting maintenance
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
