<<PARAGRAPH>>The text of IS0 standard
has been approved for publication
as Indian Standard

Certain

are,
however,

Attention
is particularly
drawn to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Wherever
the words
‘International

appear, referring
to this
standard,
they
should
be read as ‘Indian
Standard’.
b) Comma ( , ) has been used as a decimal
marker
while
in Indian
Standards,
the curr.ent
practice
is to use a point
( , ) as a decimal
marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this adopted

reference
appears to certain
International

for which
Indian

Definitions and abbreviations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes
of this International
Standard,
the
following
definitions
and abbreviations
apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
falling-object
protective
structure
(FOPS):
A
system of structural
members
arranged
in such a
way as to provide
operators
with .reasonable
pro-
tection
from
falling
objects
(for
example,
trees,
rocks, small concrete
blocks, hand tools, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 2
Drop height of a standard object is defined as
a function of its mass. See figure3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2
roll-over
protective
structure
(ROPS):
System
of structural
members
arranged
on a machine
in
such a way as to accomplish
its primary
purpose
of
reducing
the possibility
of an operator,
when wear-
ing a seat belt, being
crushed
should
his machine
roll over. Structural
members
include
any subframe,
bracket,
mounting,
socket, ~bolt, pins, suspension
or
flexible
shock absorber
used to secure the system
to the machine
frame
but exctudes
mounting
pro-
visions
which
are integral
with the machine
fratie.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5
The material
temperature
requirement
of 6.3 is
intended
to be a base-line
of measurement.for
test-
ing, to ensure
that the FOPS will
have meaningful
reiistance
to brittle
fracture;
it does not necessarily
relate to operating
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6
Because,
in an actual situation
involving
a fall-
ing object,
loading
will
be dynamic
(possibly
im-
pact), the use of conventional
“safety factors”
based
on static force loading
should
be treated
with cau-
tion. The “safety
factor”
of a FOPS is related
more
to energy
absorption
capability
and details
of weld
design
and welding
procedure
than
it is to static
force resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
deflection-limltlng
volume  (DLV): That volume,
related
to the operator,
which
selves
to set limits
and deflections
permissible
when
performing
lab-
oratory
evaluations
of FOPS and ROPS. The volume,
an approximation,
is based on the seated
dimen-
sions of a large operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The small  end of the object shall
be entirely
within
the vertical
projection
of the DLV, in that vol-
ume’s
upright
position,
on the FOPS top. It is in-
tended
that
the
drop
location
include
at least
a
portion
of the vertical
projection
of the top plane
area of the DLV.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Case  1:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where
major,
upper,
horizontal
members
of FOPS
do not enter the vertical

<<HEADING level=3>>The drop test object
shall
be placed
such that it is
as close
as  possible
~to the centre
of gravity
of the
upper FOPS structure
(see figure 2).<<HEADING_END>>

Drop test impact points<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the covering
material
of all the surface
areas
above the DLV is of uniform
thickness,
the centre of
the drop test object
shall be in the surface
of great-
est area. This area is the vertical
projected
area of
the DLV without
major,
upper,
horizontal
members.
The centre
of the drop test object
shall
be at that
point, within
the surface
of greatest
area, which
has
the least possible
distance
from the centroid
of the
FOPS top (see figure 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.3
Raise
the
drop
test
object
vertically
to a
height above the position
indicated
in 5.4.1 and 5.4 2
to develop
energy
as specified
in  4.4  depending
on
the type of FOPS.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>54.4
Release
the drop test object
so that it falls
without
restraint
onto the FOPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where
other
materials
or a different
thickness
are
used  in different
areas abovethe
DLV, each area in
turn shall
be subjected
to a drop test. If design
fea-
tures
such as cutouts
for windows
or equipment,
or
variations
in cover
material
or thickness
indicate
a
more
vulnerable
location
could
obviously
be se-
lected
within
the vertical
projection
of the DLV, the
drop location
should
be adjusted
to that location.
In
addition,
if cutouts
i-n the FOPS cover
are intended
to be tilled
with
devices
or equipment
to provide
adequate
protection,
those
devices
or equipment
shall be in place during
the drop test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.5
As  it is unlikely
that the free fall will result
in
the drop test object
hitting
at the location
and/or
in
the attitude
of 5.4.1 and 5.4.2, the following
limits are
placed on deviations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.5.1
For a level II FOPS, the initial
impact
of the
small
end of the drop test obiect
shall

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 4
The requirements
of 6.3.2.2  are given until such
time as IS0 develops an International
Standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where
the structure
provides
for both
ROPS and
FOPS, the FOPS shall
also
meet the performance
requirements
for the appropriate
ROPS as given in

ROPS is not involved,
a different

Labelling<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1

shall
be as
described
in IS0 3471.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The FOPS shall
completely
cover

of the DLV.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Should
the same structure
