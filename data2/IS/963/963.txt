<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 8 November 1958, after the draft finalized by the Steel
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Structural and Metals
Division Council.
0.2  The chrome-molybdenum steel specified in this standard finds
extensive use in the manufacture of various aircraft parts and
components. It may be welded but is not recommended for heavy
sections or parts having a wide variation in thickness.
0.3  Taking into consideration the views of producers and consumers,
the Sectional Committee responsible for the preparation of this standard
felt that it should be related to the manufacturing practices followed
in the country in this field. This consideration led the Sectional
Committee to derive assistance from the US Military Specification,
MIL-S-6758 Steel : Chrome-Molybdenum (4130) Bars, Rods, and
Forging Stock (for Aircraft Applications).
0.4  This standard requires reference to IS : 1608-1960 Method for
Tensile Testing of Steel Products Other Than Sheet, Strip, Wire and
Tube.
0.5  This edition 1.2 incorporates Amendment No. 2 (March 1983). Side
bar indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of
the amendment.
0.6  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with *IS : 2-1949 Rules for Rounding Off Numerical Values.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value
should be the same as that of the specified value in the standard.
0.7  In view of the Government of India’s decision to introduce in the
country a uniform system of weights and measures based on the metric
system, all values appearing in this standard are given in metric units
except those which are inter-related with standard test methods
employing fps units only (  see   7.1.4 ,  7.6.2 ,  A-3.3  and  B-1.3  ). However,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 963 - 1958<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>in order to help the industry to familiarize itself with the metric
system,
equivalents
in
inch
system
are
also
given.
The
inter-conversion of values has been done generally in accordance with
IS : 787-1956 Guide for Inter-Conversion of Values from One System
of Units to Another.
0.7  This standard is intended chiefly to cover the technical provisions
relating to the material, and it does not include all the necessary
provisions of a contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A-2. APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1  The apparatus shall consist of the following:
a)  Water-Quenching Device  — A water-quenching device of suitable
capacity to provide a vertical stream of water that can be
controlled at height of 65 mm (or 2½ in) when passing through<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_14>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 963 - 1958<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>an orifice 13 mm (or ½ in) in diameter. The water supply line
shall also be provided with a quick opening valve.
b)  Support for Test Specimen  — A fixture for supporting the test
specimen vertically so that the lower end of the specimen
is 13 mm (½ in) above the orifice of the water-quenching device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-3. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1 Heating  — The test specimen shall be heated to the austenizing
temperature within 30 to 40 minutes and held at that temperature for
20 minutes. It is important to heat the specimen in such an atmosphere
that practically no scaling and a minimum of decarburization take
place. This may be accomplished by heating the specimen in a vertical
position in a container with an easily removable cover containing a
layer of cost iron chips with the bottom face of the specimen resting on
the chips. When a container is used, it is necessary to determine, by
means of a thermo-couple, the time required for the test specimen to
reach the required temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.2 Quenching  — The water-quenching device shall be adjusted so
that the stream of water rises to a free height of 65 mm (or 2½ in)
above the 13 mm (or ½ in) orifice, without the specimen in position.
The support for specimen shall be dry at the beginning of each test.
The heated specimen shall then be placed in the support so that its
bottom face is 13 mm (or ½ in) above the orifice, and the water turned
on by means of the quick opening valve. The time between removal of
the specimen from the furnace and the beginning of the quench should
be not more than 5 seconds. The stream of water at a temperature of
4.5° to 29.5°C shall be directed against the bottom face of the
specimen for not less than 10 minutes. So far as possible, a condition
of still air shall be maintained around the specimen during cooling. If
the specimen is not cold when removed from the fixture, it shall be
immediately quenched in water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.3 Hardness Measurement  — Hardness testing shall be made
on the test specimen in steps of
in. The series of hardness readings
shall be numbered from quenched end of the specimen. The surfaces
on which hardness readings are made shall be mutually parallel flat
surfaces, 180 degrees apart, ground lengthwise of the specimen. The
flat surfaces shall be ground 0.38 mm (or 0.015 in) in depth. When a
flat surface is used as a base, previous indentations shall be removed
by grinding.
The exact position of each hardness reading with respect to the
quenched end of the specimen shall be known. Care shall be taken to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 963 - 1958<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ensure no vertical movement in the assembly of test specimen, anvil,
and elevating screw when the major load is applied.
The grinding operation for preparing the flat surfaces shall be
carried out with great care. Surfaces shall be flat. To ensure against
reporting hardnesses taken on surfaces that are tempered by
grinding, the following etching procedure is recommended:
Etchant
Solution No. 1 — 5 parts of nitric acid (sp gr 1.42) and 95 parts of
water by volume
Solution No. 2 — equal parts of hydrochloric acid (sp gr 1.18) and
water by volume
Etching Procedure  — Wash the specimen in hot water. Etch in
solution No. 1 until black. Wash in hot water. Immerse in solution
No. 2 for 3 seconds and wash in hot water. Dry in air blast.
The presence of darkened areas in the martensitic zone indicates
that tempering has occured. All evidence of tempering shall be
removed before hardness tests are made. This may be accomplished
by resurfacing and again etching or by preparing new flat surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4. TEST SPECIMEN FOR SPECIAL APPLICATION
A-4.1  When the test specimen available is smaller in size than that
given under  A-1.1 , then an insert test specimen as illustrated in Fig. 2
shall be used and tested as described in  A-4.2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.2  About 0.2 g of Woods metal (50 percent bismuth, 25 percent lead
and 25 percent tin, m.p 93°C) shall be placed in the bottom of the test
sheath (Fig. 2), the small test specimen inserted in the sheath, and
the sheath warmed to a temperature above the melting point of Woods
metal. The sheath shall preferably be made from a plain low carbon
steel. After the Woods metal is molten, the stud shall be screwed in
place so that the specimen is forced firmly against the bottom of the
hole. The assembly shall then be heated and quenched in accordance
with  A-3.1  and  A-3.2 . After the quench, the assembly shall be warmed
in boiling water to melt the Woods metal and the specimen removed.
Hardness measurement shall then be made on the specimen as
specified in  A-3.3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
