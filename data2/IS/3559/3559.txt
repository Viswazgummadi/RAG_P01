FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ql.1 This Indian
Standard
was adopted by the
Indian
Standards
Insti-
tution on 26 April 1966, after the draft finalized by the Construction Plant
and Machinery
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Hand-held
pneumatic
concrete
breakers have a wide variety of uses
in general construction, demolition work and in industrial plants.
Breakesr
of heavy class are used for breaking
concrete
pavements,
demolition
of
concrete foundations and walls, cutting pavenients and sub-bases, trenching
in hard ground ‘and for breaking boulders which
cannot
be otherwise
blasted‘
Breakers of medium class are suitable for breaking light concrete
pavements and floors, macadam,
frozen ground and gravel.
Breakers of
light class are useful in light demolition work on floors, pavements and
masonry walls.
Light breakers are particularly
suitable for jobs requiring
the operator to handle the tools continuously and for work which is required
to be carried
out close to existing
structures.
This
standard has been
prepared
with a view to providing guidance to manufacturers
and users
in ohtaining
concrete
pneumatic
breakers capable of giving satisfactory
performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Heavy class breakers can be converted into sheeting drivers,
heavy
and medium breakers can also be converted into railway spike drivers bi
substituting a spike-driver head in place of the regular front head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Moil points can be substituted by various
other breaking tools, such
as narrow and wide chisels, digging blades, frost wedges, asphalt cutters,
clay spades and scoops, tamping pads, and pipe or sheeting driver heads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
The dimensions of tool shanks for pneumatic
concrete breakers have
been specified on the basis Of current manufacturing practices in the country.
Standards on shanks for all pneumatic tools are, however, under preparation
and it is proposed to review the dimensions specified in this standard when
a separate standard on the subjec.t becomes available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 This standard contains clause 5.4 which permits the purchaser to use
his option for selection to suit his requirement,
and clauses 9.1.1, 10.1.2
and 10.1.3
which
call
for agreement
between
the purchaser
and the
supplier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in this field
is this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.8 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
