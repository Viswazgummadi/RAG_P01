of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee,

<<PARAGRAPH>>POREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Part 15/Section
1 ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft finalized by the Measurement
of Works of River Valley
Projects
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the measurement
of works of river valley projects
a large diversity
of methods exist at present
according
to local practices.
This lack of uniformity
creates complications
regarding
measure-
ments and payments.
Keeping in view the large amount of financial
outlay
involved
in river
valley projects and also the fact that the authorities
responsible
for completing
these
projects,
are of the state level or national
level,
it is felt that
a suitable
methodology
is needed
for
adopting uniform practices towards the measurement
of works so that the scope of complications
and misinterpretation
of items of work is reduced, as far as possible.
This
standard
is being
formulated
in various parts so as to cover each type of work
separately.
This
part is being
formulated
in two sections.
Section 1 covering bore
hole
drilling
and, Section 2 Exploratory
drifting.
This standard
is intended
to provide a uniform basis for measuring
the work done
in
respect of bore hole drilling for River Valley Projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test
or analysis,
shall be
rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values ( revised)‘.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
