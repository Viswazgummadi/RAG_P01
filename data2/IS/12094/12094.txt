<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standards
(First Revision)
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finaiized
by the River Training
and Control
Works Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Water Resources
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An embankment
(levee) is an artificial
bank built along banks of a river for the purpose
of protecting
adja~ent
land from inundation
by flood.
Such type of structure
is also called
‘embankment’,
‘stop-bank’,
‘bund’
or
‘dyke’.
Construction
of embankment
to control flood is an age-old practice
and is still being followed
due to
its proven
suitability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1987. In this revision technological
changes
and improvements,
as a result
of experience
gained over the last decade, have been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no 1S0 standard
on the subject. This siandard
has been prepared
based on indigenous
data/practices
prevalent
in the field in hdia.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values  (revised)’.
The number of significant
places retained
in the
rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The spacing

the embankments

Lacey’s wetted perimeter for the design flood discharge.
In no case
should
an embankment
be placed
at a
distance
less than Lacey’s wetted perimeter
from the
river bank or one and a half times the Lacey’s wetted
perimeter from the midstream
of the river. This should
also be ensured
in case of embankment
on only one
bank of the river. Alignment
of embankments
should
also be planned so that land acquisition for embankment
construction
is feasible and is not prolonged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

adopted
earlier
for
the
protection
against floods and their effect on the river courses,
river sections, bed levels, etc, as well as the present
condition
of the existing flood
control
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1.3
In the tidal reach
of a river, embankments
should be constructed
with due regard to their effect
on the navigation
requirements
in the channel
as
embankments
in such cases may substantially
reduce
the tidal influx causing
a reduction
in the available
navigation
depth.
As such no recommendation
on
spacing
and alignment
of levee can be generalized
in view of the fact that each river is unique in its beha-
viour. Thorough
knowledge
of the river behaviour
and
studies
of the effects
of the embankments
along
different
alignments
are prerequisites
for
taking
decision
on spacing
and alignment.
Vulnerability
to
river attack,
rise of high flood
level on account
of
reduction
in flow area, increase
in discharge
due to
cut off in valley storage,
as well as optimization
of
benefit, etc, should reflect in the decision
making.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3
After
determining
the type of the area to be
protected
and degree
of protection
to be given,
the
extent of area to be protected
economically
should be
decided
upon. For economic
viability, the benefit-cost
ratio (B.C. ratio) should be more than unity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Degree
of Protection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The height of the embankment
and the corresponding
cost and B.C. ratio should be worked
out for various
flood frequencies
taking into account the damage likely
to occur.
The degree
of protection
which
gives the
maximum
benefit cost ratio should be adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
Length of the Embankment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However,
till such time as the details
of all relevant
parameters
are available, embankment
schemes should
be prepared
for a flood of 25 years frequency
in the
case of predominantly
agricultural
ar~as and for flood
of
100 years
frequency
for
works
pertaining
to
protection
of town, important
industrial and other vital
installations.
In certain
special cases, where damage
potential justifies,
the maximum
observed
flood may
also be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Length
of embankment
directly
depends
upon
the
alignment.
However,
it is to be ensured
that both ends
of the bund are tied up to some high-ground
or existing
highway
or railway or any other embankment
nearby
conforming
to the design height of the embankment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4  DESIGN
OF EMBANKMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1
Types<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Embankments
can be classified into two types as given
below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Alignment
and Spacing
of Embankments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Homogeneous
Embankment—
It consists
of
practically
uniform material throughout.
There
is no designed plan of material distribution
other
than the coarsest or most pervious material being
placed at the outer slopes (see Fig. 1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.1
As far as possible,
embankments
should
be
aligned
on the ridge of the natural banks of the river,
where land is high and soil suitable for the construction
of embankments.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The alignment
should
be determined
in such a way
that
the high
velocity
flow
which
can erode
the
embankment
material is sufficiently
distant from them.
Hydraulic
models are useful guides in this regard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Zoned Embankment—
It essentially
consists
of
an inner or impervious
section
supported
by
two or more outer sections of relatively pervious
materials (see Fig.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1.1
Embankments
should
be aligned
so that
important
towns
and properties
along the river bank
are left outside
the embankment.
Where
it is not
possible
to set back embankments
to avoid the high
velocity
flow, some form of protection
is necessary.
Protrusions
and sudden changes in the alignments
and
forming
kinks should be avoided
as far as possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The essential
requirements
for design
of the
embankment
are the determination
of the design high
flood level (HFL), hydraulic
gradient,
freeboard,
side
slopes,
top width, etc. The stability
of the structure
should
be checked
under
all stages
of construction,
condidon of saturation and drawdown. The embankment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

A general
problem
encountered
in detertnining

on data, the approach
to

The design

should

and velocities
of the river in the recent years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Top Width<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
facilitating
transport
of
material
during
construction
and maintenance
work, it is desirable
to
make the top sufficiently
wide to accommodate two-lane
vehicular
traffic
and to be used as inspection
road.
The criteria given below may be considered
as general
guideline for top width (see IS 11532).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Where
No
Discharge
and
Gauge
Data
are
Available—
Synthetic unit hydrography approach
should be used for estimating
the desired return
period flood. For this purpose
flood estimation
reports
prepared
by Planning
and Coordination
Committee
and published
by the Directorate
of
Hydrology
(Small
Catchments),
Central
Water
Commission,
New Delhi for the country ‘asa whole
under the short-term
plan and for each sub-zone
under long term plan may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1
The top width
of the embankment
should be of
5.0 m.
The turning
platforms,
15 to 30m
long and
3.Om wide with side slope
I:3 along the countryside
of the embankment
should
be provided
at every
kilometre
(see Fig. 3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2
The top width should be adequate
for the type
of vehicular-traffic
designed
to use the embankment.
Clear berms of 1m width on either side sloping towards
the outer edges of the embankment
may be provided
for drainage.
No water should be allowed
to crllect
over the embankment
at any stage.
Suitably designed
gutter-drains
may be provided on both side klopes at
intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1
In the case of embankment
on both sides of river,
rise in the water level due to jacketing
of the river
should be kept in view in determining
the design HFL.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3
Free Board<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Hydraulic
Gradient<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The top of the embankment
should
be so fixed that
there is no danger
of over-topping
even with intense
wave wash or any unexpected
rise in the river levels
due to sudden change in the river course or shortening
of river
course
due
to unforeseeable
causes
or
aggravation
of river bed or embankment
settlement.
The height ot’the wave depends upon the wind velocity
and the fetch. There are many formulae for determining
the height of the wave; however, the formula proposed
by Stevenson,
modified
by Molitor
to include
wind
vel~ity,
should
be used as given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is always desirable
to know, approximately
at least,
the line of seepage
in the cross-section
of a proposed
embankment.
This line should
never be allowed
to
intersect the outside countryside
slope of bank above
GL and care should be taken so that a cover of 0.6 m is
available on HG line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1
Hydraulic gradient line should be determined
on
the basis of the analysis of soils which are to be used
in the construction
of embankment.
However,
the
following
guidelines
are recommended:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>hw =  0.032  (VF)ln +  0.76 – 0.27 (F)i’4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Sandy soil
lin6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F
=  fetch or straight length of water subject to wind
action in kilometres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6  Side Slope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The side slopes are dependent
upon the nature of the
material of which the embankment
is made, the method
of construction,
the height of the embankment
and the
length
of time that the embankment
is likely
to be
subjected
to the action
of flood waters.
They
shall
also be stable
against
slipping
under
conditions
of
saturation
and sudden drawdown
(see IS 7894).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1 The height of the wave is measured
from trough
to crest of the wave but as the waves will travel up the
slope of the embankment,
hw  may be taken as height
above the flood level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2 As a guideline, minimum
free board of 1.5 m over
design
HFL including
the back water effect,
if any,
should
be provided
for the river
carrying
design
discharge
up to 3000
m~/s. For higher discharges
or
for aggrading/flashy
rivers,
the minimum
free board
should
be of 1.8 m. This should be checked
also for
ensuring
a minimum
of about 1.0 m of free board over
HFL
corresponding
to 100 years
frequency
flood
(see  also  3.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1
River Side Slope<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  river side slope should
be flatter than the under
water angle of repose of the material used in the till. Up
to an embankment
height of 4.5 m, the slope should
not be steeper
than
1 in 2 and in case
of higher
embankments
slope should not be steeper than 1 in 3,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Measures
in Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Structure
should
be
stable
under
all
stages
of
construction
and conditions
of saturation
and draw-
down.
It is therefore
necessary
that stability
checks
for various conditions
should be done to ensure safety
of the
structure.
Seismic
forces
should
also
be
considered
for high embankments.
The factor of safety
should be 1.3 or greater. (see IS 7894).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is usually preferable
to have more or less free
draining
material on (he river side to take care of
sudden drawdown.
In case of high and important
embankment
stone rip-rap either dry dumped or
hand
placed
and concrete
pavements/concrete
blocks
with open joints
are adopted
to protect
the
embankment
against
drawdown
andlor
erosive
action of the river (see IS 8408); in less
important
embankments
where rip-rap is costly,
willow mattress can be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For
embankment
up to 4.5

the
countryside
slope should be 1 in 2 from the top
up to the point where the cover over HG line is
0.6 m after which a berm of suitable width, with
the countryside
slope of I:2 from the end of the
berm up to ground
level, should be provided;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>matter such as remains
of pka$ts and roots should be
rejected. Well graded homogeneous
materials are most
suitable for construction.
In case of difficulty
in getting
full quantities of the same material, zonal sections with
impervious core and a pervious casing may”be adopted.
In high embankments
it is desirable
to mechanically
compact
the earth fill in suitable layers with a view to
achieve
optimum
density
with appropriate
moisture
content.
