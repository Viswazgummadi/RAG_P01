IN SOFT STRATA AND SOILS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0 .  F O R E W O R D<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part V) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 25 February 1972, after the draft finalized by the Water
Conductor Systems Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Water conductor system occasionally takes the form of tunnels through
high ground or mountains, in rugged terrain where the cost of surface pipe
line or canal is excessive and elsewhere as convenience and economy
dictates.
This standard, which is being published in parts, is intended to
help the engineers in design of tunnels conveying water. This part lays
down the criteria for structural design of concrete lining for tunnels in soft
strata and soils, covering recommended methods of design. However, in
view of the complex nature of the subject, it is not possible to cover each
and every possible situation in the standard and many times a departure
from the practice recommended in this standard may be necessary to meet
the requirements of a project’ and/or site for which discretion of the
designer would be required. Some such situations in which special
investigations will be required are given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Where swelling and squeezing types of rocks subject to internal
tectonic stresses are met;
b) Where high temperature carbonate formations are met, which
may produce carbon dioxide;
c) Where large variations in formation temperatures exist in
different sections of a tunnel; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Where anhydrite formations are met which may show expansion
sometimes about 30 percent of their volume on becoming wet,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off values should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard ( Part V) covers the criteria for structural design
of plain and reinforced concrete lining for tunnels and shafts in soft strata
and soils mainly for river valley projects.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  -The  provisions may, nevertheless, be used for design of tunnels for roadways,
railways, sewage and water supply schemes! provided that all factors peculiar to such
projects as may affect the design are taken mto consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2  This standard, however, does not cover the design of steel and
prestressed concrete lining, the design for concrete lining in swelling and
squeezing rocks subject to internal tectonic stresses and design for seismic<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Crces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard the following definitions shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  Soft Strata<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  Strata of rocks which are soft either by their nature,
usually sedimentary and metamorphic or which have become soft due
to alternation and/or shearing, crushing and intensive jointing and which
require supports to be installed within a very short period of excavation,
but which cannot be easily excavated by hand tools.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Soils<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  Decomposed and disintegrated rocks which require support
immediately after and/or during excavation and can be excavated by hand,
tools.

mean line to which payment of excavation and concrete lining is made
whether the actual excavation falls inside or outside it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-  The distance between A and B-lines shall be decided by contracting
authority.
2.5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Primary  Lining<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  A concrete lining laid j&mediately after excava-
tion and installation of steel supports. This may cover the full section
excavated or part section depending on conditions of strata. This may be

finished line of the tunnel.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Final Lining<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  Cover on a tunnel in any direction is the distance from the
tunnel profile to the ground surface in that direction. However, where the
thickness of the overburden is sizable it’s equivalent weight may also be
reckoned provided that the rock cover is more than three times the
diameter of the tunnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4. GENERAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The design of tunnel linings requires a thorough study of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>geology<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of
the strata to be pierced by the tunnel, the effective cover and a knowledge
of the stress strain characteristics, state of stress,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>to be met with.
Where heavy seepage of water is anticipated, the designer
shall make provisions for grouting with cement and/or chemicals or extra
drainage holes and also consider the feasibility of providing steel lining, if
necessary.
It is recommended that such designs of alternative use of steel
lining be made with the design of plain-reinforced lining, so that the design
is readily available should the construction personnel require it, when they
meet unanticipated conditions.
4.3 Pressure tunnels with high hydrostatic loads shall have concrete lining
reinforced sufficiently to withstand bursting, where inadequate rock cover
and unstable ground conditions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pxzvail.  Generally, a pressure tunnel
should have a reinforced lining if the cover is less than the internal pressure
head. In such cases even the provision of a steel plate liner should be
considered. If reinforced concrete ljning  is  adopted, the stresses in
reinforcement shall be checked to avoid excessive crack width in the
concrete as these may lead to seepage from the tunnel into the strata
endangering its stability.
The final choice would, however, be guided by
the geological set up, practicability and economics.
The provision of steel
liner shall also be considered where high velocity cavitation or erosion of
the lining is expected due to high velocity of water.
4.4 Detailed structural analysis and model studies shall be made for design
of junctions and transitions for tunnels.
Such transitions are difficult to
construct in the restricted working space in tunnels and this aspect shall be
kept in view so that the proposed structures are easy for construction.
4.5 An adequate amount of both longitudinal and circumferential
reinforcement may be provided near the portals of tunnels to resist loads
resulting from loosened rock headings or from sloughing of portal cuts.
The
length to which such reinforcement should be provided depends on the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>na_ture  of the rock ( extent of disintegration, stratification, etc) and the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>nature  and probable behaviour of the overburden near the portal face.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. LOADING CONDITIONS
5.1 General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  The design shall be based on the most adverse combination
of probable load conditions, but shall include only those loads which have
reasonable probability of simultaneous occurrence.
5.2 Load Conditions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>’ The design loading applicable to tunnel linings
shall be classified as normal and extreme design loading conditions.
Design shall be made for normal loading conditions ( see Appendix A<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>).
The design loading shall be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  External Strata Loads ( see 7.7 )
b)  Self Load of Lining
c) External Water Pressure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>loading

Extreme design loading conditions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  Loading equal to the differ-
ence between the highest level of hydraulic gradient i n
the tunnel under emergency transient operation and the
tunnel centre line.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Seismic Forces<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  See  Note.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  -According to the prevailing practice the tunnel lining is not designed
for seismic forces  unless the tunnel crosses an  active fault in which case some
flexibility is provided at that section to allow for some movement in case of an
earthquake. However, at locations where studies indicate that seismic forces
will be significant they shall be catered for in the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Loailing  for Shafts<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  The design loading for the shaft walls<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘shall  in general be the external earth and ground water pressures. The
earth pressure will vary according to the material through which the shaft
is excavated and may be computed from the Rankine, Coulomb or slip
circle theories in the same way as for retaining walls. This  may be
considered as uniformly distributed along the perimeter of the shaft except
where the material changes in its properties such as in case of steep sloping
rock overlain by overburden in which case the differential pressures should
be suitably reckoned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1 If compressed air sinking is applied, force due to this aspect shall
also be taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2  If a mantle of thixotropicfluid is<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tension and bending likely to be encountered during the course of uneven

<<PARAGRAPH>>sudden  sinking.
5.3.4 For preliminary estimating the wall thickness may be assumed to
be equal to about 8 percent of the shaft diameter.

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5  In the case of granular soils and clays, the external load will be taken
by the steel supports and primary concrete fully. This lining shall be
designed using methods similar to design of culverts on soils. The height
of overburden may be the height as calculated by the formula given in
Appendix B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>lini;g  is fully
backfilled and grouted at a pressure. not exceeding 2 kg/cm* immediately after the
supports and lining are placed,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6 The thickness of the lining shall be designed such that the stresses in
it are within permissible limits when the most adverse load conditions
occur. The minimum thickness of the lining will, however, be governed
by requirements of construction. It is recommended that the minimum
thickness of plain concrete lining should be 15 cm for manual placement.
Where mechanical placement is contemplated the thickness. of the lining
at the crown shall be such that the slick line may be easily introduced on
the top of the shutter without being obstructed by steel supports. For a
15 cm slick line a clear space of 18 cm is recommended. For reinforced
concrete lining, a minimum thickness of 30 cm at the crown is recom-
mended, the reinforcement, however, being arranged in the crown to allow
for proper placement of slick line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.1 For preliminary designs, the thickness of lining may<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to be 6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>cm/m  of finished diameter in the case of soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.2 Where structural steel supports are used, they shall be considered
as reinforcement only, if they can be made effective as reinforcement by use
of high tensile bolts/at the joints and/or by proper welding of the joints.
A minimum cover of 15 cm shall be provided over the inner flange of steel
supports and a minimum cover of 8 cm over the reinforcement bars,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  The determination of the magnitude
of the rock load on the supporting structures of the tunnel is a complex
problem. This complexity is due to the inherent difficulty of predicting
the primary stress conditions in the strata ( prior to excavation ), and also
due to the fact that the magnitude of the secondary pressures developing
after the excavation of the cavity, depend on a large number of variables,
such as size of cavity, method of excavation, period of time elapsing before
the strata is supported, the rigidity of supports, deformation modulus of
the surrounding strata, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7 External Loads from Strata<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.1 Secondary external pressure, in general, is understood as the
weight of the mass of strata some height above the tunnel which when left
unsupported would gradually drop out of the roof. This pressure may
develop not only immediately after excavation, but also over period of time
after excavation due to adjustment of displacements, in the strata. The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>loads are carried both by the tunnel lining and the surrounding strata and
this fact shall be considered in design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.1.1 In the case of granular soils, the loads and side pressures are
influenced by the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>physicai  properties of the soils. In clays, the water content
and plasticity of the clays also affects the pressures on the tunnel linings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.1.2 In the absence of any data and investigations, it is<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>recommed-
ed that the rock loads may be assumed to be acting as uniformly distributed
loads and the magnitude assumed as indicated in Appendix B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.2  External Pressure of Water-The  lining shall be designed for
external water pressure, if any ( see 5.2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.3 Self  Weight of Lining -The  lining will be in close contact with the
strata and its weight is distributed over the periphery by frictional forces.
However, the weight shall be considered as a uniformly distributed load
on the invert ( lower half) of the section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.4  Weight of Water Contained in the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tuntlel-  This shall be considered
only for tunnels in soft strata and soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.5  Superimposed Live Loads -These  do not materially affect the
tunnels in soft strata-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>\N.+‘re  the diameter of the tunnel is small and the
depth of overburden<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ib  large.
In case of tunnels where the overburden
is less, full superimposed load on the basis of normal distribution of loads
in foundation strata should be considered in addition to the overburden
loads on the tunnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  It may be said that negligible load is transmitted at a depth of more than
3 times the width of the structure causing the superimposed load.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N OTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.6  Side Thrusts or Pressures, Active or Passive<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  In the case of tunnels
in soft strata, side pressures may exist.
The magnitude of these pressures
may be estimated on lines similar to the procedure for soils. In case of
soils the side pressures may be taken as proportional to the vertical press-
ures and may be determined by classical theories of soil mechanics. The
passive pressures will develop only when there is a deformation. In soft
strata and soils, for tunnels constructed with due precautions of grouting
around the periphery ensuring a close contact, the passive pressures may
be relied upon to bring about a re-distribution of loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8 Since continuous contact is assumed to be established due to grouting,
the strata around and lining both will act and share the loads and deforma-
tions
Passive pressures may be assumed to be called into play and
considered in design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.1 In the case of tunnels in soft strata and soil, the moments and
thrusts may be calculated as indicated in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tests to determine the stress  distributions.  However, the design may be
done assuming uniformly distributed loads as in the case of circular tunnels,
and using the same distribution for passive pressures. The design of such
indeterminate sections may be done by accepted methods and is not covered
by this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.9  Design  for Internal Waterpressure-The  design for internal
water pressure shall be done by considering the lining and surrounding
strata, if the strata after grouting is capable of sustaining a part of the
internal pressure as a composite thick cylinder. In such a design, the
primary concrete may be treated as a part of the thick cylinder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N  OTE -This  method suffers from uncertainties of external loads, material properties
and indeterminate tectonic forces.
In this method the strata surrounding the tunnels
is assumed to have reasonably uniform characteristics and strength and that effective
pressure grouting has been done to validate the assumption that concrete lining and
surrounding strata behave as a composite cylinder. lhe grout fills the cracks and
voids in the strata and thus reduces its ability to deform inelastically and increases the
modulus of deformation. If the grout pressures are high enough to cause sufficient<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

ment, it will help to distribute the cracks on the whole periphery in the form of hair

8.1  Drainage holes may be often provided in other than water conveying
tunnels to relieve external pressure, if any, caused by seepage along the
outside of the tunnel lining.
It is recommended that drainage holes may
be spaced at 6-m centres, at intermediate locations between the grout
rings.
At successive sections, one vertical hole may be drilled near the
crown alternating with two drilled horizontal holes, one in each side wall.
Drainage holes shall extend to a minimum of 15 cm beyond the back
of the lining or grouted zone.
Where suitable, drains encased in suitable
graded material, running along the tunnel may be provided by the sides
of invert lining with provision of weep holes opening into the tunnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of the concrete lining. Stresses likely to develop in concrete at the specified
grout pressure may be calculated and seen whether they are within
permissible limits depending on the strength attained by concrete by then.

<<PARAGRAPH>>60’  angle for circular roof,
For flatter arches,
the extent may be more.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>N  OTE  1 -Pressure grouting consolidates the surrounding strata and fills any gaps
caused by shrinkages of concrete. This grouting is normally specified,  to  improve yield
characteristics and thereby the resistance of strata to carry internal water Pressure. As
a rule of thumb a grout  pressure  of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.5  times the internal water pressure in the tunnel
may be used subject to the condition that safety against uplift of overburden is ensured.
Grout pressures of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

OF WATER HAMMER IN THE DESIGN<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-l. GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-l.1  The basic conditions for including effect of water hammer in the
design of tunnels or turbine<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  installations are divided into normal
and emergency conditions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>with  suitable factors of safety assigned to each
type of operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2. NORMAL CONDITIONS OF OPERATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1 The basic conditions to be considered<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>are,as  follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Turbine<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iixtallati&   may be operated at any head
between the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ma?imum   and minimum values of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>forebay  water
surface elevation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Turbine gates may be moved at any rate of speed by action of the
governor head up to a predetermined rate, or at a slower rate by
manual control through the auxiliary relay valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The turbine may be operating at any gate position and be
required to add or drop any or all of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ita  load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) If the turbine<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  installation is equipped with any of the
following pressure controlled devices it will be assumed that<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>these
devices are properly adjusted and function in all manner for
which the equipment is designed:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I) Surge tanks,
2) Relief valves,,
3) Governor control apparatus,
4) Cushioning<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>stroke  device, and
5) Any other pressure control device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Unless the actual turbine characteristics are known, the effective
area through the turbine gates during the maximum rate of gate
movement will be taken as a linear relation with reference to  time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>f)  The water hammer effects shall be computed on the basis of
governor head action for<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the  governor<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>rati:  which is actually set
on the turbine for speed regulation.
If the relay valve stops are<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_17>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:4SSO(PartV)-1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>adjusted to give a slower governor setting, than that for which the
governor is designed this shall be determined prior to proceeding
with the design of turbine<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  installation and later adhered
to at the power plant so that an economical basis for designing the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  scroll case, etc, under normal operating conditions can
be established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f3><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In those instances, where due to higher reservoir elevation, it is
necessary to set the stops on the main relay valve for a lower rate
of gate movement, water hammer effects will be computed for
this slower rate of gate movement also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reduction in head at various points along the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  will
be computed for rate of gate opening which is actually set in the
governor in those cases where it appears that the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>profi!e  of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  is unfavourable.
This minimum pressure will then be
used as a basis for normal design of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  to insure that
sub-atmospheric pressures will not cause a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  failure due to
collapse.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a surge is present in the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  system, the upsurge in the
surge tank will be computed for the maximum reservoir level
condition for the rejection of the turbine flow which corresponds
to the rated output of the generator during the gate traversing
time which is actually set on the governor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The downsurge in the surge tank will be computed for minimum

<<HEADING level=3>>A-3.1  The basic conditions to beconsidered as an emergency operation
are as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The turbine gates may be closed at any time by the action of the
governor head, manual control knob with the main relay valve or
the emergency solenoid device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The cushioning stroke will be assumed to be inoperative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a relief valve is present, it will be assumed inoperative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gate traversing time will be taken as the minimum time for
which the governor is designed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The maximum head including water hammer at the turbine and
along the length of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  will be computed for the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>L<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>=  the length of penstock, and
a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>=  wave velocity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a surge tank is present in the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  system, the upsurge in
the tank will be computed for the maximum reservoir head con-
dition for the rejections of full gate turbine flow at the maximum
rate for which the governor is designed. The downsurge in
the surge tank will be computed for the minimum reservoir
head condition for full gate opening from the speed-no-load
position at the maximum rate for which ‘the governor is designed.
In determining the top and bottom elevations of the surge tank
nothing will be added to the upsurge and downsurge for this
emergency condition of operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS
A BASIS FOR DESIGN<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.1 The other possible emergency conditions of operation are those
during which certain pieces of control are assumed to malfunction in the
most unfavourable manner.
The most severe emergency head rise in a
turbine<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  installation occurs from either of the two following
conditions of operation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rapid closure of turbine gates in less than<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-$econds  when the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>flow of water in the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  is maximum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rhythmic opening and closing of the turbine gates when a
4L
complete cycle of gate operation is performed in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-  seconds.

A-4.1.1 Since these conditions of operation require a complete malfunc-
tioning of the governor control apparatus at the most unfavourable
moment, the probability of obtaining this type of operation is exceedingly
remote,
Hence the conditions shall not be used as a basis for design.
However, after the design has been established from other considerations it
is desirable that the stresses in the turbine scroll case<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penstock  and
pressure control devices be not in excess of the ultimate bursting strength
or twisting strength of structures for these emergency conditions of
operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>-  This table has been arrived on the basis of observations and behaviour
of supports in Alpine tunnels where the load was designed mainly for loosening
type of rock and gives conservative values.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Norx2-  The roof of the tunnel is assumed to be located below the water table. If
it is located permanently above the water table<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fhe  values given for types 4 to 6 may
be reduced by fifty percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>-  Some of the most common rock formations contain layers of shale. In an
unweathered state,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>reai  shales are no worse than other stratified rocks. However, the
term shale is often applied to firmly compacted clay sediments which have not yet
acquired the properties of rock. Such  SO  called shale may behave in the tunnel like
squeezing or even swelling rock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  4 -If rock formation consists of sequence of horizontal layers of sand-stone or
lime stone and of immature shale, the excavation of the tunnel is commonly associated
with a gradual compression of the rock on both sides of the tunnel, involving a
downward movement of the roof. Furthermore, the relatively low resistance against
slippage at the boundaries between the so called shale and rock is likely to reduce very
considerably the capacity of rock located above the roof to bridge. Hence, in such
rock formations, the roof pressure may be as heavy as in a very blocky and seamy rock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.1.2 The rock load according to  the Russian practice<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>depends  upon
the degree of rock firmness.
