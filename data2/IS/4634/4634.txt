<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Pirst Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft finalized by the Construction
Plant and Machinery
Sectional Committee
had been ~approved
by the Heavy Mechanical
Engineer~ing Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The object of the concrete
mixer is to thoroughly
mix various constituents
of concrete
to a fairly
uniform proportion
everywhere
in the mix. Any test for the performance
of concrete
mixers has,
therefore,
to be based on the determination
of the uniformity
of the
concrete,
particularly
as
regards the even distribution
of the constituents
throughout
the batch mixed by the mixer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
lays down a method for assessing the performance
of batch-type
concrete
mixers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The recommended
method of test is based on the results of the tests conducted
by the Central
Building Research Institute,
Roorkee
under the aegis of the Construction
Plant
and Machinery
Sectional
Committee
of Bureau of Indian Standards.
While devising
this test, the considerable
amount
of relevant
work
done
in this respect
in other
countries
has also been taken into
consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The performance
test as explained subsequently
in this standard
is required
to be performed
on a
particular
type, model and capacity
of concrete
mixer and would serve as type test. Owing to the
large quantity
of materials,
considerable
time and the type of apparatus
involved
in  the test, it is
not considered
suitable as a batch test or a routine site test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1968. On the basis of experience
gained in usage of the
standard
during course of these years, a number of changes have been
made in this revision; the
prominent
among which are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Volumetric
measurement
of dry aggregates
for preparation
of mix has been deleted,
b) Mixing time allowed for mixing the various
constituent
of concrete
mix in the mixer
drum has been specified, and
c) Limits
for the percentage
variation
of cement, fine and coarse
aggregates
have been
added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the results of a test
or analysis made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final
value,observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded ofl, it shall be done in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960
<Rules for rounding off numerical~values

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The
mixer
performance
test
is used to
check the ability
of a mixer
to mix concrete
that
will be within
the prescribed
limits  of
uniformity.
The uniformity
of fresh concrete
is
evaluated
by finding:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.6 After
the
priming
batch
has
been
discarded
each of the following
three
batches
shall Abe sampled in the manner indicated
below.
The concrete
batch shall be discharged
in such
a manner that the batch
of concrete
forms
a
window or strip, one end  of  which
consists
of
the first material
to leave
the mixer and the
other end the last materials to leave. This may
be accomplished
by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>weighing
in water ) in two individual
halves of a batch and the
average of the
two halves of the batch, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the percentage
variation
between
the.
quantities
of cement, fine aggregates
and
coarse aggregates
( as found by weighing
in water ) in an individual
batch
and the
average of the three batches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) moving the mixer bodily during discharge,
or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1 Using the appropriate
mix ( see 3.1 ). four
batches
of concrete
( one priming
batch and
three
test
batches ) shall
be prepared.
The
total weight of concrete
in each batch shall be
the
nominal
batch
capacity
of
the
mixer
multiplied
by
the
weight
per cubic metre of
freshly mixed concrete
for the mix. The weight
per cubic metre ~of the concrete
mix
prepared
according
to
3.1.1
shall
be determined
in
accordance
with the appropriate
requirements
of IS 1199 : 1959, using a batch of concrete
mix
of suitable size prepared
by mixing in a similar
type of concrete
mixer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) by means of a swivelling
chute discharg-
ing the batch in the form of an arc, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) by drawing
a piatfrom,
through,
or a
long-wheel-base
trolley past the discharge
chute or by any other appropriate
means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When.the
batch has been discharged
it shall be
divided
into
two approximately
equal parts
leaving
the
transient
portion
that
is
the
concrete
which comes out of the
mixer :just in
the
beginning
and
at
the
fag
end
of the
discharge.
From each of these two halves
two
independent
representative
samples
shall Abe
taken by means of the scoop in an appropriate
number
of
increments.
Total
number
of
samples
thus
collected
for the three batches
shall be 12, each weighing approximately
4 kg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 The mixer shall be set on a ground
level.
All arrangements
shall be made
to see that
there
is no movement
and uplifting
of mixer
while the charging,
discharging
and mixing of
material
is being done.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 TESTING OF SAMPLES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3 The
first
batch
of concrete
shall be
regarded
as the
priming
batch
and shall be
prepared
one after another
for the purpose of
sampling and testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Each of the twelve samples
collected
shall
be weighed in water and
washed
on 4.75 mm
and 150 micron IS Sieves ( see IS 460 : 1985 for
sieve designations
). Coarse aggregates
and the
fine aggregates
retained
on the
above sieves
shall be weighed in water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4 The mixer drum shall not be washed or
cleaned
in any
way after
discharging
the
priming
batch or  between the three consecutive
test batches.
In case there is an interruption
in
completing
the work of taking four batches
as
per 5.2.3 and the time of interruption
is more
than 15 minutes, the mixer
drum in that case
should be thoroughly
cleaned and an additional
priming batch should be taken. This
should be
followed by taking of remaining
test batches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Weighing of t-he ingredients
in water
shall
be carried out in accordance
with the procedure
given under
analysis
of fresh
concrete
in
IS 1199 : 1959.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 For each of the three
ingredients
( coarse
aggregates,
fine aggregates
and
cement ), the
average of~the two representative
samples from
the each half shall be obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5 Time interval between the discharging
of
one batch and the beginning
of the
mixing of
the following batch
shall
be
such
that
the
stuck up material in the drum is not
set. This
is generally
15 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 ASSESSMENT
OF PERFORMANCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 The
performance
of the
mixer
shall
be
assessed on the basis of uniformity
of cement,
fine
aggregate
and
coarse
aggregate
in the
concrete
mixed by the mixer, that is, by finding
the percentage
variation of the three ingredients
as in 7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5.1 The
actual
mixing
time
allowed
for
mixing of various constituent
of concrete
mix in
the
mixer
~drum should -be between
4 to 5
minutes. The mixing time is measured from the
instant the dry materials first enters
the mixer
drum to the commencement
of the discharge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
