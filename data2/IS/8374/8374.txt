<<HEADING level=3>>SPECIFICATION FOR
BITUMEN MASTIC, ANTI-STATIC
AND ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING GRADE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 28 February
1977, after the draft finalized
by the Flooring
and
Plastering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 In
locations
where
it is necessary
to take precautionary
mrasures
agjinst
the
accumulation
of static
electricity,
the flooring
forms
an
important
link in providing
a safe path for the
discharge
of electricity
from objects.
Flooring
intended
to be used for this purpose
should
have
uniform
electrical
conductance
to a degree
which
will
always
ensure
that under
the fastest rate of generation
of any charge
that can
possibly
occur in practice,
a dangerous
potential
cannot
exist.
.
0.2.1
Bitumen
suitably
incsporated
with
certain
material
can
be made to acquire
electrical
conductive
and anti-static
properties.
One
of the material
commonly
used for incorporation
in
bitumen
mastic
is
carbon
black of conductive
grade
like graphite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0,s Experience
has shown
that
for
anti-static
purposes
the discharge
path
through
a product
should
normally
have
an electrical
resistance
of  less  than
10s ohms at any time throughout
its useful
lift.
A value
of
5 x 10’ ohms for anti-static
products
is suggested
as the
lowest
limit
of
resistance
to give adequate
protection
against
fire and dangerous
electric
shock in the event
of any apparatus
becoming
defective
when
operating
at voltages
up to 250.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and
practices
prevail-
ing in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the
field in this country.
This
has been
met
by derivi~ng
assistance
from
BS 2050  :  1961 ‘Specification
for electrical
resistance
of conductive
and
anti-static
products

DUCTANCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Preparation of the Surface -The
surface
to be used in test shall
be cleaned
by rubbing
with dry Fullers’
earth using a clear pad of cotton
wool, care being taken to avoid straining
the material.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
After
all traces
of the powder
have
been
cleaned
away,
the
surfaces
shall be wiped over with
a pad moistened
with
distilled
water
and rubbed
dry with a clean cloth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Test Procedure -Immediately  after the preparation
of the surface,
liquid electrodes
and metal contacts
as specified
in Appendix
B shall be
applied
as specified
in Appendix
C.
It shall then be kept
at a tempera-
ture of 21~2°C
at a relative
humidity
of less than
70 percent,
and the
resistance
test
as specified
in Appendix
C shall
be carried
out after a
period of not less than
15 minutes
or more
than
two hours.
As some
materials
are sensitive
to moisture,
great
care
shall
be taken
to avoid
breathing
on the samples prior to and during
the resistance
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. SAMPLING
AND CRITERIA
FOR
CONFORMITY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Lot
-
The entire
quantity
of bitumen
mastic
prepared
in
a single
charge
of
the
mastic
cooker
shall constitute
a lot.
In cases where the
practice
of returning

and the last portions
to the cooker
is
followed,
portions
thus returned
should
be excluded
from the lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  Sampling from Mastic Cooker -
When
bitumen
mastic
is to be
used directly
from the cooker,
a sample composed
of five increments
taken
at equal intervals
shall be withdrawn
from each lot during discharge
from
the mastic
cooker.
The increments
shall be taken at the beginning,
the
end, and soon after discharge
of one quarter,
half, and three
quarters
of
the
bitumen
mastic.
Each
increment
shall
be
at
least
2 kg
in
mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1
All the five increments
from
a lot shall
be thoroughly
mixed
together
at a temperature
of 150 to 205°C.
The
mixture
shall
by floa-
ted out on an iron plate with
the aid of a wooden
float
to a thickness
not less than 25 mm.
While
still warm the specimen
shall
be loosened
from the plate and a representative
portion
weighing
not less than
10 kg
shall be forwarded
to the laboratory
for examination
with
full
particu-
lars as given
in 7.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Each block shall be broken and a number
of pieces weighing

2 kg shall
be taken
from

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4  Criteria for Conformity
-
The
laboratory
sample
representing
the lot shall be tested for all requirements.
The
lot shall be considered
to conform
to the
requirements

if the laboratory
sample
passes tests for all the requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

DEFINITION
OF HARDNESS
NUMBER<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.1
The
hardness
number
is the
figure
denoting
the
depth,
in
hundredths
of a centimetre,
to which
a flat-ended
indentation
pin in the
form
of a steel
rod
6.35
mm
in
diameter
will penetrate
the mastic
under
a load of 31.7 kg, applied
for
1 minute,
the
temperature
being
maintained
at 35”*0’5”C.
This
load is equivalent
to 100 kg/cm2 and is
conveniently
applied
by means of a lever
giving
a suitable
mechanical
advantage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

shall be filled directly
from the mixer
at the time of laying,
into

which
are not less than
100 mm

or 100 mms,
and

The
samples,
which
shall
be
taken
in
duplicate,
shall
be
moulded
to a thickness
of 25 mm.
Where
it is necessary
to make
a test
on samples
cut from
the floor,
special
precautions
should
be taken
to
ensure
that the sample
is of uniform
thickness
and that the base is level.
The samples
should not be remelted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
