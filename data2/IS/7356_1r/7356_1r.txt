<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by
the Hydraulic

<<PARAGRAPH>>The porous tube piezometer
is a device for
measuring
pore water
pressures
primarily
in a
foundation
though it can also be used to measure pore pressure in an embankment.
It is more
sensitive to foundation
pressures or ground water fluctuations
and is more
resistant
to plugging
due to silting than the conventional
observation
well which
it replaces.
These tips
may not
indicate the correct
pressures where there is no sufficient
flow of water
into the standpipe
of
the piezometer,
as for example in partially
saturated
soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Even though foundation
pore pressures can be measured by the conventional
twin tube hydraulic
type foundation
piezometers,
there are locations
not easily
accessible
to these
piezometers,
in
view of the depths at which the tips are required
to be installed and of the necessity
of terminal
facilities.
The porous tube piezometer
can be installed at such locations
being an independent
installation.
Because of its simplicity,
and reliability,
the porous tube piezometer
can be used
by taking advantage
of the drainage tunnels and grouting
culverts to provide permanent
access
to the top of the holes.
Since porous tube piezometers
can be installed
after
completion
of
construction,
cbstruction
to construction
equipment can also be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published in 1974.
This
revision
has been
prepared
to incorporate
certain
changes found necessary in the standard
in the iight of the comments
received
from the
users.
The major changes in this revision
are in description
of equipments
i. e. porous tube,
stopper with rubber
seal, top adaptor.
The
accuracy
of water
well sounder has also been
reduced to 2 mm.

The porous
tube is set in a hole
which is either drilled or jetted into the founda-
tion to a predetermined
elevation
to intercept
ground water or pore pressure in the foundation.
The porous tube
is surrounded

<<PARAGRAPH>>pipe pulled up a few inches from the bottom of
the hole to be used as an intake.
The casing
should be kept filled by pouring in clear
water,
until all cloudiness disappears
from the effluent
( see phase 1, Fig. 2 ).
5.4 After the hole
is cleaned,
saturated
sand
should be poured
into the
casing
to fill the
bottom
of the porous
space.
The length
of
the porous space to be filled with sand should
depend
upon
the
relative
tightness
of the
natural soil surrounding
the hole,
that
is, the
lower the permeability,
the greater
the length
of the hole for the
intake
area
of the piezo-
meter.
The sand backfill
should
consist
of
clean sand,
which
should
satisfy
the
filter
requirements
vis-a-vis the surrounding
soil as
closely as possible, without
including
any silt
sizes.
Unless the side walls of the holes
have
a tendency
to cave in, the casing
should
be
raised approximately
by 60 cm before
backfill-
ing with saturated
clean
sand.
The casing
should be withdrawn
in such a way
that
the
surrounding
soils is not disturbed.
However,
if there is a danger
of sloughing,
the casing
should be withdrawn
in increments
of 15 cm
or less after lifts of sand are placed
to support
the hole.
The sand in the bottom of the hole
should be tamped with a bar or a pipe, before
installation
proceeds
( see phase 2, Fig. 2 ).
5.5 Next step is the lowering
of the porous
tube
to its designated
elevation.
Before this
is done, the required length of the
tubing
and
the joints should be tested for leak proofness
and then the porous
tube and tube assembly
should be immersed
about a metre
below
the
surface of water in the hole into the clear water,
and the plastic stand pipe should be connected
to a supply
tank,
a vaccum
should
be then
applied to the tank to draw water
through
the
porous tube to eliminate
air from
the system.
If the length of tubing
is loo much to handle
as a single Iength,
shorter
length
can be first
lowered
into
the
borchole
and
subsequent
lengths
be jointed
properly
afterwards.
To
expedite
saturation
and removal
of air from
the porous tube, it should be soaked in warm
water for several hours, or boiled in water
for
15 min before installation
( see phase 3, Fig. 2 ).
5.6 When lowering the assembled
porous
tube
and plastic
standpipe
into the hole, a small
positive pressure should be maintained
in the
tank to cause an outward
flow of water
from
the tip.
A pump of low capacity
may also be
used to draw water
through
the porous
tube
and to
maintain
a positive
pressure
while
lowering the tip.
This will prevent
movement
of fines into the porous tube.
With the assem-
bled porous
tube
resting on the
sand in the
bottom
of the hole, the casing is withdrawn in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 WATER LEVEL SOUNDER
4.1 The water level
sounder is required
to be
lowered from the surface into the
plastic
tube
with the
help
of
the
connecting
cable
for
taking
observations.
It
comprises
of two
insulated wires bared at the contact
end which
passes through a weighted probe of any suita-
ble material.
Suitable
markings
should
be
given on the cable
preferably
at every 0.5 m
intervals and should have an additional
arrange-
ment to measure with an
accuracy
of 2 mm.
The length of the wires should
be commensu-
rate with depth up  to  which
the observations
are required to be made.
The unit
should
be
battery
operated,
complete
with
reel/spool
of
cable extension rod of 0.5 m, leather
carrying
case, tripod stand and dummy probe with nylon
cord of 50 m.
The unit
should
also
carry
battery operated
indicator
and buzzer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 INSTALLATION
PROCEDURE
5.0 The procedure
given is for installation
of
porous tube piezometers
in drill holes where
it is considered
necessary
to provide
porous
tube
piezometers
within
the
embankment.
Where the
standpipes
are
expected
to pass
through
embankments
and concrete
structures,
necessary
provision
for extending
the stand-
pipes to successive Iligher elevations
should
be
made as the construction
operations
progress.
5.1 The
successive
steps
involved
in the
installation
of porous
tube
piezometer
are
described
in 5.2 to 5.10 ( see also Fig. 2 ).
5.2 A minimum
100
mm dia
cased hole is
advanced
to about 30 to 60 cm distance
below
the planned elevation
for
the
bottom
of the
porous tube by jetting
or by
other
accepted
procedures.
Use of bentonite
on drilling muds
should not be permitted.
Most of the casing
is usually removed from
the hole
during
ins-
tallation
of the apparatus
but if the casing is
expandable,
a sufficient length should be pulled
after installation
of porous
tube
so that the
sand-cement
grout
has
direct
contact,
if
possible, with an impermeable
stratum.
5.3 After the casing has reached
the designed
depth in the 100 mm dia hole, the hole
should
be washed clean to the bottom.
For a drilled
hole, clean water should be circulated
through
the drilled bit until the discharge is clear.
For
a jetted hole the pump is reversed
and the jet<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 7356 ( Part 1 )  :  1992<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where the sounding device given
indication
of
contact
with ground water should be read
off
from the marked cable.
This is the level
up
to which water
is standing
in the standpipe.
Distance from an even half metre mark on the
cable
could
be scaled
off by a metre
scale
graduated
to every
2 mm.
Knowing
the dis-
tance from top of the installation
to the water
surface in the standpipe,
the elevation
of water
surface can be determined.
The
difference
of
the elevation
of the water
surface
and
the
elevation
of
the mid-point
of
the
porous
tube gives the pore pressure of water in metres.
6.2 Measurements
for original elevation
of the
porous tube should be taken to the nearest one
centimetre.
However,
after
the installation
is completed,
elevation
on top of the
installa-
tion and the water
elevation
in the
standpipe
should
be made
to the nearest 2 mm.
The
elevation of top of PVC pipe be checked at least
once in a year to account
for change in RL of
top of PVC pipe due to settlement.
6.3 Sedimentation
around
the
porous
tube
reduces the sensitivity
of the piezometer.
In
order to retard
this,
the
water
level
in the
standpipe should be raised,
thereby
requiring
an outward flow to achieve
equilibrium.
This
should be done particularly
when an increase
in pore pressure around the tip is anticipated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>small  increments,
depending
on the
condition
of the wall of the hole
and saturated
sand is
poured into the hole to the level of the top of
the porous tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.1 The designed
elevation
for
the
porous
tube is the elevation
of the mid-point
along the
length of the tube.
The length
of the tube
including the projecting
rubber bushing should,
therefore,
be measured before the apparatus
is
lowered into the hole.
Measurements
for the
original elevation
of the porous tube
should be
taken to the nearest
1 cm.
However, after the
installation
is completed,
measurements
for
elevation
on top of each
installation
and the
water level in each pipe should be made to the
nearest 5 mm ( see phase 4, Pig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7 The casing should then be pulled
approxi-
mately 30 to 60 cm and that
portion
of the
hole
backfilled with saturated
sand.
A mini-
mum 30 cm of sand should be backfilled
above
the elevation
of the top
of the porous
tube
( see phase 5, Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8 The casing should
then
be pulled approxi-
mately one metre or as the hole
permits
and
the hole backfilled with sand-Portland
cement
grout having volume ratio one part cement
to
4 parts sand.
Sufficient water should be added
to dry volumes to  produce
workable
grout  mix.
The consistency
of the plugging
paste
should
be such that
the fines do not
penetrate
the
sand backfill.
Tamping bar should be lowered
into the hole at this stage to puddle the grout.
Attempt
should be made to maintain
the PVC
standpipe
in the centre of the hole during each
increment
of the
backfill
procedure
should
continue till appear.
One meter of the casing
remains in the hole ( see phase 6, Fig. 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7  FREQUENCY
OF OBSERVATIONS
AND
RECORDING
OF DATA<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Frequency of Observations
Pore
pressure
readings
should
be taken
at
every 15 days interval
during construction
and
at monthly intervals
during shut down.
After
construction,
during the filling and
depletion
of the reservoir,
the piezometer
should be read
for every 3 m rise or fall of the lake level.
Por
the first five years
after
completion,
fort-
nightly observations
should be taken if the rate
of change of water level is slower than 3 m per
fortnight.
After five years,
observations
may
be taken monthly.
During rainy seasons
more
frequent readings may be recorded,
if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9 The casing should be cut off at about 15 cm
above the ground surface.
The plastic
stand-
pipe should be cut off flush with the top of
steel casing and capped with a removable
pipe
cover.
The annular
space between
the steel
casing and
the plastic
standpipe
should be
filled with
grout to within approximately
5 cm
from top of the pipe.
The top of
stand pipe
casing pipe should now be individually
covered
with metallic pipe cap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  Recording
of Observeh Data
The
readings
taken
should
be -recorded
in a
suitable form.
A proforma
recommended
for
this purpose
is given in AnnexA.A
separate
register should be maintained
for
each porous

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10 Upon
completion
of the installation,
a

<<PARAGRAPH>>9 PRECAUTIONS
FOR ERECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 During
erection,
the
end
of standpipe
should be kept closed by caps to avoid
foreign
matter finding its way into
the pipes,
making
observations
of water
level unreliable,
if not
impossible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2 Ail pipes should be kept
vertical
to faci-
litate
lowering
of
the sounding
device
for
observations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 Each
installation
in structure
should
be
given
a distinct
number
and these
numbers
should be stamped on the
caps at the end of
the standpipes
and on the platform where these
are located.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
When there
are large
fluctuations
in up-
stream
and
downstream
water
levels,
for instance
during rising or falling floods or when
the
liver
is
being ponded
up,  to feed supplies
to canals
or for
gereration
of power, etc, the results
are likely to be
influenced
by time lag.
A rise in the upstream
level
will give relatively
lower
readings
and vice-versa.
When water levels
ale taken
at regular
intervals,
due allowance
should be made for such time lag and
its effect taken into account.
The time
lag can be
assessed
by filling
the standpipe
with
water
and
measuring
thk time of the water level to drop
down
to a constant
level.
This test
should
be performed
when the levels on the upstream
and the downstream
are almost
steady.
The time
lag should
be mea-
sured by an average
of three
such
trails.
The time
lag measurements
may
be done
allowing
about
a
month
after
installation
for
establishment
of
original
cor,ditions
and
once
every
six months
to
ascertain
the extent of choking
of the
installation,
ifany,
and to take into
account
the effect
of time
lag on the readings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10 MAINTENANCE
OF INSTALLATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1
Every fwo months
each
standpipe
should
be tested for any clogging.
Clogging
or sedi-
mentation
can be controlled
by raising the water
level in the pipe, thereby allowing outward flow
of water with sediments
from top of the pipe.
Compressed
air, however,
should not be used
to revive a piezometer
as this would
fill the
pores of the tube
with air, which
would be
impossible
to remove.
It is essential
that
air
should be prevented
from entering the pores of
the tube at all times as the presence
of air will<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
