<<HEADING level=3>>-0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This  Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution on 22 December 1976, after the draft finalized by the  Library
Buildings,
Fittings
an9  Furniture Sectional Committee had been  approved<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>by
ihe
Civil  Engineering
Division Council.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Extensive
schemes are.,,underway
to improve
the  existing
library
facilities
and
also for settmg u
of new library buildings in different
parts of India.
P
It has been we  1  recognjzed that any further
improve_<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ments
and
construction of.new library buildings should take into account
the knotiledge and experience gained in India and abroad  in the  design,
layout  ahd  functioning
of library buildings.
TO  give guidance
to, the
architects,
institutions and others concerned in planning of all  types of
library buildings IS  :  1553-1976*
was published.
During
the course
of
fOrmu]atiOn
Of  IS  Z  15S3-197C*,
the Committee
,noted that very little
attention was being paid to the provision  of  proper  library facilitiesin school<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>buildings
and
particular
recommendations
in this regard,
would be of
considerable assistance to the education departments and other authorities
concerned.
This was considered all the more urgent in view of the large
number of elementary
and secondary
schools coming up in urban and
rural areas.
This standard prepared accordingly gives recommendations
for  design
and
laybut  of school library buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3 The recommendations
,made
in this standard
may not, however,
meet all the situations..tbat
may arrse 1.n. Individual cases, and it
may<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>become
necessary  to deviate from the provIsIons of this standard or suitably
adapt them to meet such situatloas.<<HEADING_END>>

ments of libraries.<<HEADING_END>>
