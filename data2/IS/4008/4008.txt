FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
(  First Revision)
was
adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 October
1985, after the draft finalized
by the
River Valley
Planning,
Project
Reports,
Progress
and Completion
Reports
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Project
reports
are being
prepared
and submitted
to the concerned
authorities
in so many different
patterns,
sizes and formats
that
necessity
for some kind of uniformity
in presentation
has been felt since long.
This
standard
is proposed
to serve as a guide to achieve
this object.
Invariably
all the project
reports
have to include
a number
of drawings.
The sizes,
practices
and
standard
of preparation
of drawings
vary
so much
from
state to state and organization
to organization
that need for such
a guide
to bring
about uniformity
was felt.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This guide covers all important
items which are generally
considered
in the preparation
of project
reports for river valley projects
The
guide
will,
therefore,
provide
the
necessary
check
against
omission
of any
important
item while preparing
such project
reports.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard
was published
in 1967.
In this revision,
based on the
experience
gained
in the use of the standard,
drawing
sheet
sizes have
been modified
to correspond
to IS  :  1071 l-1983*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

date
of revision
and

shall consist of 3 parts as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Feature
number;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A three
letter
abberviation
defining
the project
to which
the
drawing
relates,
say BRG

NRM
for Narbada,
etc; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The assigned

number
under this particular
feature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Example  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1 I-BRG-40
would represent
serial No. 40 in the file relating

Project.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.7.1.1
A typical
list of the features
for different
items
is given at
Appendix
B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.8
Orientation
and Layout
-
As far as possible,
general
location
and
vicinity
maps should be oriented
with the North
to the top of the sheet.
A North-point
arrow shall be placed
on such drawings
and a streamflow
arrow shall be included
wherever
practicable.
Detail
maps,
plans
and
layout
drawings
for dams,
reservoirs
and other
major
structures
should
be oriented
so that the direction
of stream flow is towards
the top or the
right side of the sheet.
All sections parallel
to the direction
of streamflow
should be drawn with the direction
of ilow towards
the right,
unless
a
particular
detail cannot
be properly
illustrated
with such an orientation.
All vertical
section
and elevations
normal
to the direction
of flow should
be shown
looking
downstream
unless
such
arrangement
would
fail to
show the feature
intended
by the section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.8.1
As nearly
as possible,
the following
plan should be followed
for
the layout of the drawing.
The principal
views should be placed
at the
top and left of the sheet; the secondary
views to the right
or beneath
the
principal
views, and minor views ( miscellaneous
details,
etc ) where they
fit best, preferably
to the right or beneath
all other views.
After
all the
views are drawn,
letter designation
to view sub-titles
should
be assigned
in alphabetical
order,
from top and left towards
bottom
and
right.
All
notes and scales pertaining
to the drawing
should
be accommodated
in
the space reserved
for the purpose
above the title block.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
In a drawing
more
than
two scales should
not be used.
If any
particular
detail has unavoidably
to be shown on a third scale, that detail should
indicate clearly as drawn  ‘  Hot to Scale ‘.<<HEADING_END>>
