<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 4 March
1981 after the draft finalized by the Diversion
Works Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Prior to the commencement
of construction of any work in the bed of
a river, it becomes obligatory to exclude temporarily
the river flow from
the proposed work area during the construction
period, so as to permit
the work to be done in dry or semi-dry
conditions.
An
efficient
scheme of diverting the river flow away from the work area should aim
at limiting the seepage into the work area to a minimum,
so that
the
work area can be kept dry with minimum pumping capacity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 A temporary river diversion scheme essentially consists of:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) coffer dam(s) built across a part or full width of the river to
divert the flowing water away from the work area, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) works to transfer
the diverted
water
from upstream
to the
downstream of the work area without affecting the same, such
as  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) diversion through ( construction ) sluices in the main work;
2) diversion by one or more tunnels along the side of the main
work area;
3) diversion through low-level blocks of the main structure
left
for the purpose or through channels excavated
outside the
main structure; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) secluding part of the work area for construction and allowing
the river to flow through the remaining work area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 There are different types of coffer dams in vogue, such as masonry/
concrete/colloidal
concrete/earthfill/rockfill,
and steel and timber coffer
dams.

of factors
such
as the

materials,
construction

rate of construction,
incorporation
of
the coffer

and river flow conditions.
The proper choice of the type of coffer
dam
shall be made after considering
all the relevant
aspects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

DAMS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The
different
types of coffer
dams,
the
guidelines
for
choice
of
which
have been
discussed
in this
standard,
are
(i) masonry/concrete/
colloidal
concrete
coffer dams,
(ii) earthfill/  rockfill
coffer
dams,
(iii) steel
coffer dams, and (iv) timber
coffer dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1
Masonry/Concrete/Colloidal
Concrete Gofer Dam -
A masonry/concrete
coffer dam on a rocky foundation
is similar
to a masonry/concrete
dam
constructed
at site.
This
can be of gravity
or arch
type,
usually
the
former.
A brief description
of a colloidal
concrete
coffer
dam
generally
adopted
for river diversion
works is given below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.1
A colloidal
concrete
coffer dam consists
of two rows of piles
of 1 to 1.25 m diameter,
spaced
suitably
apart
and having
inter-locking
points.
Cylindrical
steel liners are driven
penetrating
into the bed rock<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Es : 9795 ( Part I ) - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>by about
1 m.
The overburden
of sand and gravel in front of and in the
immediate
vicinity
of the inter-locking
points is grouted to make the points
more
effective.
After
placement
of suitable
reinforcement
inside
the
cylindrical
liner,
the
same
is concreted
to form
an
RCC
pile.
To
facilitate
rubble
dumping
and grouting
simultaneously
with piling
work,
the
coffer
dam
is divided
into cells by providing
cross-rows
of piles,
penetrating
in the overburden
to a short
depth.
Horizontal
bracings
connecting
the two rows are also provided
for ensuring
stability
of piles.
Later,
the space between
the two rows of piles is filled
with rubble
and
concreted
so that the whole
structure
is stable
as one unit and prevents
seepage
into the work area.
For typical
plan, section and details of such
a colloidal
concrete
coffer dam, see Fig.
1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2
Earthjll~Roc~fill Gofer Dam -
In addition
to the
usual
type
of
earthfill/rockfill
coffer
dam
with a central
core
of impervious
soil,
a
coffer dam with single sheet pile at the centre, backed
by earthfill/rockfill
on either side of it is also used.
A typical
section of such a coffer dam
is
shown in Fig. ‘2.
Sometimes,
a coffer dam with a single sheet pile at the
centre,
backed
on either side by sand bags,
caged
suitably
by G. I. wire
mesh
of appropriate
gauge,
is also
adopted.
However,
due
to the
possibility
of rotting of gunny bags and sand spreading
thereby,
this type
of coffer darn can be suitable
only for short durations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2.1
Where
the height
of the coffer dam is not more than 3 m and
the foundations
are impervious,
a simpler
type of coffer
dam
with two
rows of parallel
walls of sand bags
with the space
between
them
filled
with impervious
soil can also be adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3
Steel Co$er  Dams<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3.1
Steel
coffer
dams
suitable
for
rocky
foundations
at very
shallow
depths are generally
of two types,
viz, direct
strutted
steel dam
and
cantilevered
steel
dam
[ refer
IS  :  4410
( Part
VIII
)-1968*
for
definitions].
However,
these steel
dams
are very rarely
used as coffer
dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3.2
In alluvial
reaches,
where only limited
area
is available
for
construction
of a coffer dam, sometimes
single steel sheet pile coffer dams
of the cantilever
type,
shown
in Fig.
3A may
also be used.
However,
where the bed is rocky,
single
sheet
pile
coffer
dams
of strutted
type,
shown in Fig. 3B, may be useful.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3.3
In alluvial
reaches,
the steel coffer
dam
used in
diversion
works of river valley projects
mainly
refers to steel sheet pile coffer
dam.
There
are two types of such steel sheet pile coffer
dams
generally
in use.
They
are (i) double
wall sheet pile with earth/sand
filling
type,
and (ii)
cellular
sheet pile with earth/sand
filling type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Timber
Coffer
Dams -
Timber
coffer
dams
suitable
for
rocky
foundations
at very
shallow
depths
made
of framed
members
are
generally
of three
types,
viz.,
(i) A-frame
type,
(ii) rockfilled
crib type,
and (iii) Beaver
type. In view of the high
cost
of timber
in
India,
this
type of coffer dam is not likely to be economical,
except in circumstances
for low height
coffer dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

FQR SELECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  In addition
to the criteria
of the cost of the structure
and the overall
economy
of the project,
there are some specific
guidelines
which
dictate
the selection
of a particular
type of coffer
dam.
Among
these
are the
availability
of space
and
materials,
construction
programme,
rate
of
construction,
incorporation
of coffer
dam(s)
as part of the main
dam,
foundation
characteristics,
river
flow  conditions
and passing
of floods,
The choice of the different
types of coffer
dams
with reference
to these
guidelines
is given in the following
par-as.
The
final
choice
of the type
of coffer dam may be made based
on
a study
of relevant
criteria
and
commensurate
with economy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Availability
of Space<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1  An earthfill/rockfill
coffer
dam
requires
more
space
due to its
wider base. For the sites where only limited
area is available
for construc-
tion of the coffer
dam
over rocky foundations,
in addition
to masonry/<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9795 ( Part I ) - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>concrete/colloidal
concrete
coffer
dams, steel and timber
coffer dams are
also suitable.
However,
since the latter
types
can
be considered
only
for depths up to 2 m, for conditions
of limited
area and rocky foundations,
a masonry/concrete
coffer dam is better suited than other types.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
However,
where there is no problem
of space
for the location
of
the coffer dam(s),
an earthfill~rockfill
coffer
dam
may be
the
suitable
choice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3
In
alluvial
foundations,
where
limited
space
is available
for
construction
of
coffer
dam(s)
due
to
the
construction
of
certain
structures
like navigation
facilities,
etc, a double
wall
steel
sheet
pile
coffer dam with proper earth/sand
backing
may be preferable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Availability
of Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1  Where
construction
materials
like earth,
rockfill,
steel and timber
for the construction
of coffer
dam ( s ) are not easily available,
if founda-
tion conditions
and other relevant criteria
are satisfied,
a masonry/concrete/
colloidal
concrete
coffer dam may be chosen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2
However,
where
sufficient
quantities
of embankment
materials
and
equipment
for the construction
of the embankment(
s) are
easily
available
an earthfill/rockfill
coffer dam is preferable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.3
The
selection
of a steel coffer
dam
will
depend
on the
easy
availability
of the required
steel sections
and the necessary
accessories
in
sufficient
quantity,
besides satisfying
the other criteria
like depth of water,
foundation
conditions,
etc.
In the alluvial
reaches,
the suitability
of steel
sheet pile coffer
dam will depend on the easy availability
of the required
sheet pile sections,
its quantity
and driving equipment
and transportation
thereof
to the site.
The
availability
of the required
amount
of foreign
exchange
needed
for procurement
of sheet piles and their driving
equip-
ment is also a factor
to be taken note of.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4
Subject
to satisfying
other
criteria,
a timber
coffer dam may be
chosen where timber
is cheap
and available
in plenty.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Construction
Programme<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1  Where
the coffer
dam
needs
to be retained
for more
than
one
working
season,
a masonry/concrete/colloidal
concrete
coffer
dam
is
preferable,
as it can be made
to withstand
overtopping
with
proper
protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2
However,
with the recent
advancement
in construction
techni-
ques, rockfill
coffer
dams
are also sometimes
allowed
to be overtopped<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_11>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9795 ( Part I ) - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>by provision of adequate
crated protection.
Under such circumstances,
rockfill coffer dams may also be considered where they are required to be
retained for more than one working season.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.3
Where a cellular type of steel sheet pile coffer dam is preferred
due to other criteria,
proper protection
against overtopping needs to be
provided in addition to increased
depth of driving and other protective
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5  Incorporation of Coffer Dam as Part of the Main Structure -
Where a diversion coffer dam of appreciable volume is to be built up, it
can be economically
incorporated
in the main dam with proper care taken
in the design of the main structure.
This type of construction
is more
suitable
for earthfill/rockfill
dams, than for masonry/concrete/colloidal
concrete coffer dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6  Rate of Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1  As the progress of construction
of an earthfill/rockfill
coffer dam
can be maintained
at comparatively
higher rates, this type of coffer dam
is preferable
where the time available
for the construction of coffer dam
is very limited, subject to availability
of space.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.2 As it takes
comparatively
more time
for the construction of a
masonry/concrete/colloidal
concrete dam than for the other types of coffer
dams, the availability
of construction time for the coffer dams needs to be
kept in view while selecting this type of coffer dam. However, in under-
water works, either a earthfill/rockfill
coffer dam or a concrete coffer dam
may be preferred. The choice of any of these types depends on the different
relevant aspects outlined in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7  Foundation Characteristics<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7.1  Where a rocky foundation is availableat
the bed level of the river
or at very shallow depths, masonry/concrete/colloidal
concrete coffer dam,
steel and timber coffer dams may be preferable for certain considerations.
However, from considerations of depth of water, availability
of materials,
etc, generally steel and timber coffer dams may not find favour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7.2 An earthfill/rockfill
coffer dam is suitable for almost any kind of
foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7.3 Steel sheet pile coffer dams are preferable
for rivers with alluvial
beds of great depths and with higher depths of flow in the lean period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.8  River Flow Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.8.1  Where the depth of flowing water in the lean season is low and
suitable
rocky
foundations
are available
at shallow depths,
masonry/<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9795 ( Part I ) - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>concrete/colloidal
concrete
coffer dams and steel and timber
coffer
dams
may be preferable.
However,
subject
to the availability
of materials,
steel and timber
coffer dams are not generally
useful for depths
of water
more than 2 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8.1.1
However,
where
suitable
rocky
or boulder
foundations
are
available
at shallow
depths,

the depth
of flowing water in the lean
season is more, concrete
coffer dams may be useful.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8.2
In alluvial
reaches,
for construction
of
structures
across
rivers
where the flow during
lean period
would
not go down low at any time,
steel pile coffer dams are preferable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8.2.1
For depths ofwater
up to 6 to 8 m, double
wall steel sheet pile
coffer dams
are suitable.
Where
the depth
of water exceeds
this value,
cellular
coffer dams are preferable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8.3
In alluvial
reaches!
where the estimated
scour
is of the order
of
6 m and more below
the river bed during
the period of construction
and
the coffer dam has to remain
in position
for more than
one season,
it is
preferable
to adopt a cellular
sheet pile coffer dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.9 The
various
guidelines
and requirements
for choosing
the type of
coffer dam to be adopted
have been listed is Table
