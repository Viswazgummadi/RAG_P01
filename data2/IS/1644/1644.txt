<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was
adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian Standards on
16 May 1988, after the draft finalized by the Fire
Safety Sectional Committee
had been. approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Indian Standards
relating
to fire safety
of
buildings have been formulated
covering
general
principles and fire grading, details of construction,
exposure
hazard
and
exit
requirements.
This
standard covering the last aspect was formulated
in 1960. In the past 25 years,
useful data has
been made available
by the
research
institutes
of this country as well as from
other
advanced
countries like USA, UK,
Canada,
etc. The pro-
vision
in this revision has, therefore, been made
based on the data adopted
by these
countries,
and therefore,
have been completed modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 It would be neither possible nor advisable to
rely on electrical or mechanical devices, such as
lifts for moving the population
of various
floors
to a place of safety
because of the probability
of
fire rendering
these devices inoperative.
There-
fore, staircases
with
associated
escape
routes
become all important
and staircases
considered
in this code are the means of communication
in
an up and down direction of a building and serve
not only as escape routes for occupants
but also
afford a direct means of access to the source
of
fire by the fire fighting -staff. In fact,
staircase
landings
of buildings
which
present a serious
hazard
are required
to have fire fighting equip-
ment mounted thereon comprising
hydrant stand,
pipes and accessories.
0.6 For the purpose of d!ciding whether a parti-
cular requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final value, ‘observed or
calculated,
expressing the result of a lest or analysis, shall be
rounded
off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that
of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The exit requirements
and personal
hazard
dealt with in this standard
is considered
as at
least of equal importance
to all other
aspects;
in fact in most cases, it is paramount
because of
the density of population
associated
with parti-
cular occupancy;
an example is that of a cinema
or similar densely occupied
building when con-
trasted with a godown of similar occupancy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Density
of
population
varies
from
one
building to another and also in the same building
from, time to time;
one example
is that of a
large general or mixed bazar, emporium or stores
where a great variety of goods are displayed
for
sale; and at certain periods
may be offered
