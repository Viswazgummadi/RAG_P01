FOR
PRECAST CONCRETE SEPTIC TANKS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This- Indian Standard
was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 30 June 1981, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.‘2 Many small towns and innumerable
villages suffer from the absence of
hygienic means for the disposal of sewage.
Concrete septic tanks offer
a very  economical and convenient solution to this problem, both far private
residences and for small communities.
Apart from the simplicity of cons-
truction
of concrete septic tanks, one of their greatest advantages is that
maintenance is very simple and does not require sustained attention.
The
sludge is required to be removed at intervals of about 6 months to one
year.
0.3 A concrete septic tank built of precastunits
makes possible the installa-
tion of a complete home sanitation system in a short time.
Use of this tank
eliminates mixing concrete at the job and requires no special equipment for
handling units.
Mass production of precast concrete tanks at central plants
simplifies inspection, lowers cost and improves quality.
03.1  Construction
of septic tanks with precast concrete
units is an
advantage where a larger number of tanks have to be built in out of the way
places, because precasting of elements makes possible the speedy erection of
a number of tanks and reduces, to a great extent, the employment of skilled
labour at site.
0.4 This standard covers the requirements of precast concrete septic tanks of
small capacities.
For recommendations
on capacities, size, etc, reference
has been made to IS  :  2470 ( Part I )-1968” and IS  :  2470 ( Part II )-1971t in
this standard.
Typical construction details of a rectangular septic tanks are
also givep in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1
General -
Plain concrete base slabs of 10 cm thickness shall be
provided with 40 mm deep grooves in them.
The two top slabs of the long
walls shall also have grooves in them to insert the 40 mm thick precast
concrete baffle.
The top of the tank shall consist of precast concrete cover
slabs as they permit opening up of the tank for cleaning, inspection, repairs,
etc.
The connection of precast units shall be effected as shown in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2  Forms -
The forms for #he wall, floor, baffle and cover slabs shall
conform to the required shapes and sizes.
By adhering meticulously to the
details given in the form drawings, the concrete slabs produced will fit
properly and can be erected rapidly.
Wooden forms, when properly made,
are satisfactory.
Since the forms have to be reused many times, a wood
that will not warp easily shall be used and it shall be well-seasoned and free
from knots.
A thin metal tubing for inserts in theholes of the divider strips
shall be used to make removal easier and also to prolong the usefulness of
the form.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.1 The built-up sections shall be glued with a water-proof glue and
nailed.
All new forms shall be soaked with light oil before initial use, then
thoroughly cleaned, and re-oiled each time they are filled. They shall be kept
on a flat surface, preferably under clamps or weights, and in the shade when
not in use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.2 The forms shall be bolted tightly to the platform to assure
production of slabs of uniform
thickness.
Forms shall be discarded when
the concrete
slabs made in them do not fit properly.
After forms are
assembled and before
each use, each piece shall be checked to make sure
that it is straight before setting it on the casting platform.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.3 When a large number of tanks are produced, steel forms made
from angles and solid bars may be more economical.
The samecasting plat-
form shall be used for either wooden or steel forms,
so that a change from
wood to steel can be made at any time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*The dimensions of the-bottom and top slabs also~should be increased suitably.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>32.3 Reinforcement -  The reinforcements
in the wall slabs shall consist
uf at least 6 mm dia bars at 10 cm centres bothways
placed in the centre of
slabs.
The baffle and floor slabs shall be provided
with a minimum
reinforcement of 0.15 percent of gross sectional ,area.
The cuver slabs shall
be reinforced
with 5 bars of 8 mm dia for tanks up to 90.cm width, and 4
bars of 10 mm dia for those 110 cm wide, located 20 mm from the bottom
of slabs.
Two short pieces of mild steel bars shall be bent to make handles
for cover slabs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE - The reinforcement recommended refers to mild steel reinforcement.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4  Casting -
The casting bed shall be cleaned and oiled to prevent
sticking. of the slabs.
The concrete shall be so spaded and tamped in the
formscthat all corners and shaped joints will be completely filled to produce
smooth
surfaces free from honeycomb
or rough spots.
Reinforcement
placed after the form is screeded half-full of concrete, shall remain in that
position
as the form is filled.  ,  The surface shall be screeded, floated,
and smooth-troweled
flush with the top of the form.
After hardening for
24 hours,
in warm weather under wet covering, the outer forms shall be
removed and the slab slid off the platform by using tapered wooden pegs or
suitable steel bolts as handles inserted in the holes provided in slab ends at
the time of casting.
When picked up by these pegs or bolts, the slab shall
swing down in position
for its erection
in  the tank and it shall then be
stacked on edge for further wet curing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.5  Curing and Maturing -  The period of curing shall not be less than
7 days.
From the date of casting, the precast units shall be matured for
the following periods before testing or despatch,
including the period of
curing, so that they will attain sufficient strength to ‘resist damage to them
when first handled:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.6  Assembling the Tank -
The digging for the septic tank shall first -be
carried out and then the bottom covered with fine dry earth or dry sand,
tamped and finally, screeded to a level surface.
Care shall be taken
to compact the foundation base adequately to avoid unequal settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.6.1 The following procedure is recommended
for assembling. the
tank units:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Lower bottom
slabs by rope slings attached
to handling
pins
in holes at slab ends: The centre slab is first placed in proper posi-
tion, then end slabs are set carefully fitting grooves in which cement
grout has been spread against the tongues of the centre slab.
Check slabs to see that they are square and level, then fill all grooves
in surface of bottom slabs with cement grout.
Set bottom side slabs in centre of 40 mm receiving grooves of the
bottom
slab.
Remove excess grout.
I-look two space-spreaders
over the top edges of these slabs near the ends to hold them
in position while being levelled.
Lower and hook bottom end slabs over the dovetailed end joints.
Check the first section erected-for square and matching corners.
Pour cement grout ( Portland
cement and water mixed to proper
consistency ) in the upper grooved edges of all slabs.

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.6.2 Immediately after the tank is assembled, earth backfill shall be
tamped in place around the tank while ‘grout in joints is still plastic.
A fillet of mortar, mixed with one part Portland cement and two parts clean
sand, is next placed from the top ta bottom in the inside corner of the tank
to seal the dovetailed joints,
This triangular fillet shall be at least 5 cm
thick at its centre and may be a run of stiff mortar placed with a trowel and
shaping block, or placed behind a 2.5 x 10 cm strip used across the corner as
a form.
3.2.6.3 Excess grout shall be scraped from all joints inside the tank
leaving smooth, well compacted surfaces.
A fillet of mortar 5 cm thick as
placed in vertical corners shall then be well compacted
and shaped at the
joint between the precast bottom
and walls of the tank.
When this water
seal has hardened, the tank shall be filled with water to a depth of at least
15_cm for this joint to cure under water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.6.4 The top surfaces of the tank shall be cleaned and wetted, and
al:2
cement mortar applied and levelled.
Strips cf paper shall be laid
over this fresh, soft mortar to prevent cover slabs from bonding to it when
placed in position without
sacrificing a close fit.
Lap joints of the cover
slabs need not be grouted.
The top of the tank may either be flush with or
approximately 30 cm below the ground surface.
The vent pipe shall extend
above the ground level.
3.2.6.5 Cast  in situ  concrete may be used for the tank floor if the top of
the digging cannot be readily levelled for precast slabs.
In this case, bricks
are set on edge at corners and the side and end slabs erected on them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Next concrete of grade M 15 and of mushy consistency is placed, so that the
bottoms of side and end slabs are embedded at least 40 mm in the concrete.
A  minimum reinforcement of 0-l 5 percent of sectional area shall be provided
for the cast  in situ  floor slabs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.7  Tank Connections -
Ordinarily, T-pipes ( see Fig. 1 Longitudinal
Section ) for inlet and outlet in the tank may prove satisfactory.
However,
slots for baffle are easily provided
in the required position by embedding
tapered
