<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 21 February
1976,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Terminology,
Notations and Drawings Sectional
Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The working drawings, together with the specifications,
are important
documents
constituting
the
contract.
They
translate
concept
into
acoomplishment.
On their quality
depend exactness in estimating and
effectiveness in building what was planned.
Their careful preparation is
the best insurance for the trouble free execution of the work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 It is the architect’s
or engineer’s responsibility
to determine
whether
construction
work is ‘executed
in accordance
with
the intent of’the
,
contract
documents,
and
he must take
sljecial
care to see that these
documents are complete and accurate
so their intent is clearly
discern-
able.
As interpretation
large!y
takes
place
in
the
field,
and
is
predominantly
dependent
upon the working
drawings,
the need for
clarity and accuracy
in the working drawing is self evident.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the preparation
of this standard, due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices in this
field in the country.
This has been-met by deriving assistance from IS0
1046-1973  ’  Architectural
and building drawings -Vocabulary’,
issued by
the International
Organization
for Standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 This standard is one of a series $f Indian Standards
on terminology,
notations and drawings.
Other standards published so far in the series
are given on page 8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.  COMPOSITION
OF WORKING
DRAWINGS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 General’Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  The purpose of the working drawings is to show how the design
is to .be materialized.
Working
drawings should give the contractor
exactly the information
he needs.
To accompli_sh this purpose the draw-
ings should be neatly arranged and systematically
numbered,
should be
clear,
simple, and clean; should have only relevant and necessary notes;
should be accurately drawn so that scaled measurements agree with figures;
and should be free of repitious details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2 The preparation
of working drawings require
considerable
skill.
A thorough knowledge of building materiakmethods
of construction and
the ability to comprehend the designers intent are prime requirements
of
good drafting.
In addition,
neatness,
an ability
for correlating
details
and their arrangement
in a logical sequence are required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3 During
the production
of working drawings their relationship
with the specifications should be kept in mind and the decision regarding
specifications
should be transmitted
to those engaged upon working
drawings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.4 Information
relative
to design, locations
and dimensions of the
elements
of a product
is the province of working drawings and that
having to do with quality of materials
and workmanship
belongs in the
specification.
Details
should indicate
the filling together
of materials
and the precise shape of the various parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1  The
resentation
of architectural
and
building
drawings
and
their details s hp ould be done with the minimum
number
of drawings
which
are necessary
for the complete
and unequivocal
definition
of the building
to be constructed.
The
drawings
mentioned
above shall include
plans,
elevations
and sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2 It is not always
possible
to present
all-the
necessary
drawings
‘on
one ‘sheet.
It is, therefore,
recommended
that.plans
should
be grouped
repar&Iy
from
elevations
and
sections.
Drawings
shall
as
far
as
possible
be of uniform
size and such which could be conveniently
used at
rite.
3.3.2.1
When
a project
comprises
of a number
of blocks/buildings
and
cannot
be accommodated
on one sheet, a key plan at a small scale
#hall
be  drawn
indicating
by
shading
the
portion
of
the
said
block/building
detailed
on the particular
sheet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS t  7973-g  1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3,3 When
several
plans
are presented
on the same sheet
it
is
recommended, to align them either vertically
or horizontally
and title
each of them separately.
3.3.4 When several elevations and sections are included on the same
sheet it is recommended
to align them horizontally.
Each section and
elevation
should
always
receive
an adequate
designation
and
cross
reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  Details -
As the work develops, rough details of parts at large scale
should be made when necessary.
These details aid in the preparation
of’
the final
details.
Details
should
indicate
the fitting
together
of the
materials and precise shape of the parts.
Each detail should be clearly
keyed, or referenced to the particular general drawing.
3.5  Dimeqsions -  Dimensmns
should
be related
to an established
reference plane and its relationship
to the established bench mark should
also be shown.
All dimensions
should read from the bottom or right
hand side of the sheet and should extend in single lines across the plans
and from bottom to top of the elevations and sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6  Notes -Notes
on the drawings should be held in the minimum
required to support the drawings.
A simple rule on the use of notes is to
ask first if the drawing conveys the designer’s intent.
If it does not, can
the drawing then be improved or
clarified.
If the drawing cannot be
improved or clarified only then a note is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7  Schedules -
Schedules
are of value
in covering
subjects
more
clearly than do drawings
and specifications.
Schedules may be applied
to columns, footings, windows, doors, hardware, room finishes, plumbing
fixtures, lighting fixtures, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.8  Graphical Symbols  -‘Graphical
symbols as given in IS  :  962-1967’
shall be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9  Revisions -  There are two basic methods of recording changes -to
provide substitute
drawings
or to revise original
drawings.
In
either
case a print of the original
drawing
should be retained as a record.
Substitute drawings should be dated, and the superseded drawings should
be listed thereon.
The number and date of revision shall be added in the
revision panel in accordance
with IS :962-1967*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10 Title
Block -
The title block is an important feature in a drawing
since it facilitates obtaining uniformity and represents details like title of
drawing, name of organization
,or firm, drawing number, scale, date of
drawing, etc, in a definite manner.
The title block shall be placed at
the bottom right-hand corner of the drawing sheet where it is readily seen
when the prints are folded
in the prescribed manner.
Layout of title
block shall be in accordance
with IS  :  962-1967*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
