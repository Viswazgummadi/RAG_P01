FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 23 May
1968, after the draft finalized
by the Construction
Plant and
Machinery
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineer-
ing Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Form vibrators
are generally
used for compaction
of concrete
in precast
concrete
moulds,
such
as pipes, gullies
and
deep post-tensioned
beams.
They are also used for compaction
of  in-situ  concrete
in small and narrow
sections or very heavily
reinforced
sections
where immersion
vibrators
can
not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
Form vibrators
are generally
powered by electric
or air motor and
are of two types, namely  ‘  the fixed or clamp type  ’  and  ‘  the manual
type ‘.
The clamp type is mostly
used although
hand held type is also sometimes
used in situations
where there are no means of fittings the clamps or where
continuous
movement
along
the forms
is desirable.
The
fixed type
is
always
directly
coupled
with the prime
mover unit whereas
the manual
type is either
directly
coupled
to the prime mover or is connected
to the
primer
mover
through
a flexible
shaft
drive.
This
standard
covering
electrically
operated,
fixed and manual
type form vibrator
has been pre-
pared
with a view. to providing
guidance
to the manufacturers
and users
in obtaining
form vibrators
capable
of giving satisfactory
service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard
lays down requirements
for material,
sizes, construction
and performance
of form vibrators
for concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The requirements
of this specification
apply mostly to electric
motor
driven form vibrators.
Pneumatic
powered
form vibrators are not covered
by thisstandard,
although
some of the provisions of this standard
may also
apply  to  these types of vibrators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

measured
with the
help
of piezoelectric
accelerometer,

set of osciloscope,
amplitude
measuring
apparatus
and electromagnetic
pick up, or any other
equally suitable apparatus,
calculated
