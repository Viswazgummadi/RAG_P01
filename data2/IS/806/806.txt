<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( First
Revision
) was adopted
by the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 5 January
1968, after
the draft
finalized
by the
Structural
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Structural
and
Metals
Division
Council
and
tile Civil
Engineering
Divi-
sion Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard
is one of a series
of Indian
Standards
being
publishrd
under
the IS1
Steel
Economy
Programme.
The
object
of this
pro-
qramme
is to achieve
economy
in the use of structural
steel
by establish-
ing rational,
efficient
and
optimum
standards
for
structural
sections;
formulation
of s‘tandard
codes
of practice
for the design
and fabrication
of steel
structures;
popularization
of welding
in steel
construction
and
co-ordination
and
sponsoring
of experimental
research
relating
to the
production
and
use of structural
steel
which
would
enable
the
formula-
tion
and
revision
of standard
specifications
and
codps
of practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This
standard
was first
published
in 1957.
Since
its publication
foul
amendments
have
been
issued.
In this
revision,
the following
modifica-
tions
have
been
incorporated:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Amendments

<<PARAGRAPH>>b)

given.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Mihimum

condi-
tions
being
observed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This
code
is complementary
to IS  :  800-1962*.
The
use
of tubular
steel
in structural
work
would
result
in considerable
savings,
particular-
ly in the case of roof

<<PARAGRAPH>>in general.
It would,
therefore,
be recognized
that
large
scale
use of
tubular
steel
in structural
work
is of considerable
importance
in the
interest
of steel economy.
0.5 In
order
to popularize
the use of tubular
construction,
it is also
proposed
to compile
design
handbooks,
typical
designs
and other aids to
design
which,
when
they become
available,
would
be of assistance
to
those not previously
experienced
in tubular
design
and construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 Grades
YSt 22, YSt 25 and YSt 32 of steel tubes mentioned
in this
standard
are covered
in IS  :  1161-1963*.
0.7 In the formulation
of this code, assistance
has been derived
from B.S.
449  :  1959  ‘  Use of structul.al
steel
in building’,
issued
by the British
Standards
Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.8 This standard
contains
clause
7.8 which calls for agreement
between
the purchaser
and
the manufacturer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.9
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
ex-
pressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
offin accordance
with IS  :  2-1962t.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded
off value
should
be the same as that of the specified
value
in
I
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE
1.1 This code deals
with the
use
of structural
steel
tubes
in  general
building
construction
and is complementary
to IS  :  800-19621.
Provisions
which
are of special
application
to construction
using
steel
tubes
are
included
in this code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. GENERAL
2.1 Unless
otherwise
specified
in this code, provisions
of IS  :  8OO-1962$
with regard
to terminology,
plans and c’rawings,
loads and general
consi-
derations
for the design,
fabrication
and erection
are applicable
in the
use of steel tubes
in general
building
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

processes,
or which  have
been subjected
to cold working,
shall be regarded
as hot finished
if  they
have subsequently
been
heat-treated
and are supplied

conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -

sectional
areas,
as the case may be, in 5.1 to 5.8 of this code, is applica-
able to steel tubes for which the minus tolerance
on the weight
per unit
length
of tube is not more than 4 percent.
If on the steel tubes used the
minus tolerances
on the weight per unit length
are larger
than 4 percent,
a corresponding
reduction
in cross-sectional
areas
is required
to be
made in applying
the permissible
stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General -The
principles
and
procedures
of design
contained
in
Section
IV of IS  :  80%1962*
generally
applicable
to structures
using
steel tubes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Basis of Design -The
basic methods
of design
for structures
using
steel tubes are generally
similar
to those for other types of elastic struc-
tures.
Welding
is generally
adopted
for connections
in tubular
steel
construction.
Since the connections
in such cases give rigid joints,
it is
desirable
to design
such welded
structures
taking
into consideration
the
actual
condition
of rigidity
particularly
since
such
design
results
in
saving
in materials
and greater
overall
economy.
For structures
design-
ed on the basis of fixity of connections,
full account
is to be taken ofthe
effects of such fixity.
6.2.1 Structural
frameworks
using steel
tubes
including
those
with
welded connections
may, however,
be designed
on a simple design basis,
comparable
with that given in IS : 800-1962*.
In such cases, secondary
stresses may be neglected
in the design of trussed
girders
or roof trusses,
except
where the axes of the members
do not meet at a point.
Where
there is such eccentricity,
the effects of the eccentricity
should
also be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2  Curved Members
and Bends  -The
design
of curved
members
and bends shall be given special
consideration,
alld allowance
shall
be
made
for any
thinning
of the bent
pal t which
may
be caused
by
bending
the member.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

material
before
being
assembled
shall
be
straightened,
if  necessary,
unless
required
to be of a curvilinear
form
and  shall
be free from twist.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.1  Washers
shall be specially
shaped
where
necessary,
or
other
means
used,
to give
the
nuts
and
the
heads
of
bolts
a satisfactory
bearing.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2
In all cases where
the full bearing
area
of
the bolt
is to be
developed,
the threaded
portion
of the
bolt
shall
not
be
within
the
thickness
of the parts bolted
together,
and washers
of appropriate
thick-
ness shall be provided
to allow the nut to be completely
tightened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4  Cut Edges -
Edges
should
be dressed
to a neat
and
workmanlike
finish and be free
from
distortion
where
parts
are
to be
in contact
metal-to-metal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5  Caps and Bases for Columns -
The
ends
of all
tubes
for
columns,
transmitting
loads through
the ends, should
be true
and square
to the
axis of the tube and should
be provided
with a cap or base
accurately
fitted to  the end of the tube and  screwed,
welded
or shrunk
on.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5.1
The
cap or base plate
should
be true and
square
to the axis of
the column.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6  Sealing of Tubes -
When
the end
of a tube
is not
automatically
sealed
by virtue
of its connection
by welding
to another
member,
the
end shall be properly
and completely
sealed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6.1
Before
sealing,
the inside
of the
tube
should
be dry
and
free
from loose scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7 Flattened
Ends -
In tubular
construction,
the ends of tubes may be
flattened
or otherwise
formed
to provide
for welded,
riveted
or bolted
connections
provided
that
the
methods
adopted
for
such
0attening
do not injure
the material.
The change
of section
shall be gradual.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8  Oiling and Painting -
If  not galvanized,
all tubes shall, unless other-
wise specified,
be painted
or oiled or otherwise
protectively
coated
before
exposure
to the weather.
If they are to be painted
in accordance.with
any special
requirements,
this shall be arranged
between
the purchaser
and the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
