<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Code (Part
1) (First Revision)
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized
by
the Hydraulic
Structures
Instrumentation
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Water
Resources
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements
of relative
horizontal
displacements
of points
in the interior
of a dam provide
the simplest
and
direct method of the structural
behaviour
of the dam. Measurements
of structural
deformation
over a considerable
period oft ime (several
years) furnish
information
regarding
the general elastic behaviour
of the entire structure
and foundation
and provide
a means
for determining
the elastic
shape
of the deflected
structure
which
will
permit
distinction
of load and thermal
deflection
components
and with precise
alignment
data,
provide
for
estimating
the amount
of translation
or sliding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deflection
cycles of remarkable
uniformity
in amplitude
and period become
clearly evident
from the initiation
of observations
if any deviation
is apparent.
Study of this deviation
helps in detecting
development
of distress
conditions
in structure
or foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depending
upon the amount and type of related and supporting
information
available, plumb line observations
can
be used for ascertaining
the elastic and inelastic physical properties of the concrete or masonry and foundation
rocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Relative displacements
are measured by means of collimators
and by the use of plumb lines with pendulums
placed
inside a shaft in the dam. The displacement
of the wire is measured
normal to and parallel to dam axis in straight
gravity dams (radial and tangential
direction in case of arch dams) with respect to fixed points in the shaft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Though
the measurement
of displacement
by pendulums
is restricted to significant
individual
points or change of
direction
of significant
lines, pendulums
are the foremost
instruments
for the observation
of behaviour
of dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Using micrometer
microscope
accuracy
as high as 0.05 mm can be obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two types of plumb lines are in use, namely (a) Direct plumb line, also designated
as pendulum;
and (b) Inverted
plumb
line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Direct
plumb
lines are used for measurement
of the relative
horizontal
deflections
of points
inside
the dam,
relative
to a reference
point in the lowest gallery,
available
closest to the base of the dam. As it is not advisable
to instal the permanent
deflection
measuring
equipment
for plumb line observations
while the construction
is in
progress,
on account
of the great likelihood
of damage
to such costly equipment,
it is a usual practice
to instal
temporary
plumb
lines for observations
during
construction.
Observations
are made on temporary
plumb
line
till such a time that the permanent
deflection
measuring
equipment
is installed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>in the case of a inverted plumb line the vertical line is established by anchoring the bottom point of the plumb line and
fixing a float to the top point. Depending on how deep the bottom point is anchored so as to be free from the influence
zone of the dam and reservoir
load, the deflections
of points in the dam as observed are more or less absolute.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For choice and location of instruments
in masonry
and concrete dams, reference
is made to IS 7436 (Part 2) :1997
‘Guide
for types
of measurement
of structures
in river valley projects
and criteria
for choice
and location
of
measuring
instruments:

incorporated
in this revision
are as following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The words
‘Regular

Observation
recesses
at gallery
locations
are provided
and fitted
with airtight
steel doors
to prevent

of wire, after installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Code
gives
the

of the
installation,

<<HEADING level=3>>SECTION
1 DIRECT
PLUMB
LINE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The plumb line wire is suspended
at the upper end of
the shaft by means of a collet and nut in the centre of
a heavy
steel suspension
spider
(see Fig. 2) placed
over the shaft opening.
Alternatively
the arrangement
shown in Fig. 1 detail Xmay
be used. The suspension
device
F  consists
of a roller
bearing
protected
by
housing.
Below the suspension
device  F is  the topmost
clamping
point
or the point
of rotation
in the fixed
plate  K.  The observations
of the plumb
line at any
other
point
are thus
relative
to this
point
N. This
separation
of the rotation
point
from the supporting
device
ensures
that the topmost
point
of rotation
of
the plumb
line is not influenced
in any way by the
plumb weight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 PRINCIPLE
AND CONSTRUCTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Plumb line essentially
consists
of a rust resistant
wire
suspended
from the top of the plumb line well (shaft)
provided
for the purpose
in the body of the dam, by
some suitable
suspension
arrangement
and carrying
a
heavy
plumb
bob (weight)
immersed
in a damping
fluid contained
in a can provided
at the bottom
of the
plumb
Iine well (see Fig. 1). Observation
recesses
are
provided
at the bottom
and at suitable
intermediate
locations
of the plumb
line well (shaft)
wherein
are
fixed
deflection
measuring
equipments
for
observations
of position of the plumb wire with respect
to a fixed
reference
mark
in the observation
recess.
The
observations
may
be made
mechanically
by
directly
reading the position
of the wire against scales
fixed to the observation
recess walls, as in the case of
temporary
plumb
lines
or by using
micrometer
microscope.
Difference
of the observed
values of wire
position
from the reference-readings
(initial readings)
when processed,
provide values of the dam deflections
at the level of suspension
and at the level of observation
recekses relative
to the lowest measuring
point of the
plumb
line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For accurate
measurement
a thermometer
stud must
be fixed at right angle to the support.
It can be-made
from
a piece
of iron
piping
40 mm
long,
I2 mm
external
diameter
and 8-9 mm internal
diameter.
One
end of the tube is closed by a bottom of 3 mm thickness.
In half the width of the beam a hole of corresponding
diameter
is bored and the stud is pressed in. The edges
are elastically
or autogeneously
welded
in order
not
to weaken
the girder.
The stud is used to receive
a
mercury
thermometer.
The
diameter
of
the
thermometer
should not exceed 8 mm. The change
in
distance
of the plumb
line pivot from the wall due to
change
in temperature
can be computed
from
the
temperature
readings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 EQUIPMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The various components
that constitute
the plumb

Wire Plumb Bob and Dashpot<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to obtain
a greater
measuring
accuracy,
the
plumb bob must be as heavy as possible.
But an upper
limit is given by the strength
of the wire. A suitable
material
for the wire
is rust

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 mm diameter
maybe
used for the plumb line, for
plumb
bobs weighing
150 N and 350 N respectively.
An
invar
wire
having
low coefficient
of thermal
expansion
may be used
for long plumb
lines in an
environment
susceptible
to
large
variations
in
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

— support
bars<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Within each observation
recess two vertical
12 mm thick plates
welded
to form a right
angle are placed
in a position
to contain
the
plumb
line within
the 90° quadrant
formed
by the plates.
A stainless
steel micrometer
microscope
support
bar and reference
bar
each extend
at right angle
from each of the
above plates,
as shown
in Fig. 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The weight of the plumb bob depends
on the length of
the plumb
line, mode of measurement
and the desired
accuracy
of measurement.
Solid
brass
cylinder
weighing
about
150 N and 350 N may be used as a
plumb
bob
for
optical
and
mechanical
mode
of
measurements
respectively
for the line length of 30 m
to 200 m. For mechanical
mode of measurement
the
plumb bob is much heavier
than that for optical mode
of measurement,
to reduce
the
small
horizontal
displacement
produced
by the contact
arm
of the
instrument
to a negligible
amount.
The
cylinder
dimensions
should
be such so as to keep it immersed
in non-corrosive
damping
oil contained
in galvanized
steel container
for damping
possible
vibrations
of the
wire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>As shown in Fig. 3 carriage
is constructed
in
such
a manner
that
its
base
slides
over
carriage
rod
and
anchored
by conepoint
screws seating into drilled recesses
in the rod.
Lead screw knob provides
for reading
to the
nearest
0.05 mm. The carriage
should
have
a total
travel
range
sufficient
to cover
the
anticipated
horizontal
deflection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Microscope

piece has been found suitable for observations
of plumb

in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.4 Suitable
arrangement
should be made to prevent
moisture
condensation
from falling into the oil. Where
it happens
to be excessive,
a deflecting
metal cover
may be clamped
around
the wire a few centimetres
above
the
dashpot
to
prevent
cumulative
contamination
of oil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 INSTALLATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is advisable
to instal the plumb
line assembly
as
soon as possible atler completion
of the structure.
Care
should be taken for keeping
the plumb line wire at the
centre of the plumb line shaft by adjusting
suspension
device suitably.
Initial reading should be recorded
and
treat
this
reading
that
is reading
at the
time
of
installation
as zero.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

providing
measurement
of plumb

against
scales
fixed in the observation
recesses
parallel
and normal
to dam

is suitable.
The
scales
should
be rust

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  Recess
Fixture
Installation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The recess fixture
should
be assembled
as shown
in
Fig.
3. Drill
holes
for
expansion
anchors
and
reinforcing
dowels
in the recess concrete.
Dril Iing of
these holes should be done carefully
to ensure desired
accuracy
in alignment.
Alignment
maybe
maintained
by using a small wood jig, set on the floor of the recess
to hold the fixtures
level and parallel
to the faces of
the recess. Exact alignment
is to be obtained
by smal I
transit
so as to set up and turn 90° in galleries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It may be further
improved
by providing
an electric
circuit so that the contact of the moving point attached
to the vernier
with
the plumb
line
is indicated
by
lighting
a lamp.
This
reduces
personal
error
in
establishing
the contact.
More
accurate
instruments
like micrometer
screw can be used instead of vernier
for measuring
the deflection.
The choice of a particular
design
depends
on
the
desired
accuracy.
A
sophisticated
instrument
of this
type
is described
below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(see Fig. 2). Kinks
and twists
in the wire should
be
avoided when installing the same. The wire previously
wound on a spool in a reeling rack is threaded
through
a hole in the centre of the plumb bob plug, removed
previously,
the interior
of which
contains
a recess.
The wire is twisted
around
a short nail and hot solder
poured
in the cover of the nail to fill the recess. After

<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Observations
with the Co-ordimeter<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Taking observation
with a co-ordimeter
is simple. The
reading
of the left (scale
1) and right (scale 2) of the
co-ordimeter
are taken
and
the
longitudinal
and
transverse
deflections
worked
out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>if intermediate
observation
points
described
in 3.2.5
are provided,
they are turned
in from top to bottom
and the corresponding
readings
are taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 FREQUENCY
OF OBSERVATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Weekly
observation
should
be made during
the first
tilling of the reservoir after which fortnightly
schedule
of reading
may be adopted.
More frequency
schedule
of reading
may be adopted
when rate of reservoir
rise
is fast. At least one reading
must be obtained
for the
highest and lowest reservoir
level attained
every year.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the readings
are taken
the wire
is released
by
swinging
out the clamping
plates from bottom to top.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the direct

that the reference
point,
10.2 Wire
and Deflection
Measuring
Equipment
namely, the point corresponding
to the lowest reading
station,
remains
fixed
and does not experience
any
shift in its position.
In actual
practice,
however,
the
reference
point
itself undergoes
horizontal
displace-
ment
on
account
of
the
foundation
horizontal
displacement
under
operating
loads.
So in order
to
obtain correct evaluation
of the displacements
of dam
points
it is essential
to ascertain
the magnitude
of
foundation
displacement
and hence the shift of point
corresponding
to the lowest reading
station resulting
from varying
reservoir
level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See 3.2.3 and 3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3 Float<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Float is essentially
a double walled hollow cylinder
of
steel covered
at top and bottom
but having
a central
hole through the top and the bottom cover for threading
the plumb
wire from below
and connecting
it to the
suspension
collet fitted in a suspension
spider centrally
supported
on top of the float. The central
opening
in
the float should
be of sufficient
size to accommodate
horizontal
deflection
of the dam at float level without
contact
with the plumb wire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
measurement
is made
possible
by the use of
inverted
plumb
line, which
essentially
consists
of a
rust-resistant
wire the lower end of which
is attached
to an anchor grouted
to the bottom
of a drilled hole in
the foundation
while the suspension
point (upper end)
is attached
to a float which is buoyed
up by water in a
covered
tank.
To reduce
evaporation,
the water
is
covered
by a film of oil,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The size and height
of the cylindrical
float has to be
designed
in accordance
with
buoyancy
principle
to
provide the specified
liquid level below the top of tbe
float as also below the top level of the cylindrical
pipe
welded
in the centre
of the tank bottom
to provide
continuation
of the plumb
line opening
for extension
of the plumb wire through
it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>[f the suspension
point
and float arrangement
of the
inverted
plumb
line is installed
in a gallery
in which
tbe plumb
bob and damping
medium
for the regular
plumb
line
is housed
and
the
arrangement
is so
positioned
as to permit
observation
of the inverted
plumb line at an elevation
corresponding
to the lowest
reading
station
elevation
of the regular
plumb
line,
the horizontal
deflection
at this elevation
as noted by
the reverse
plumb
line can be added algebraically
to
the relative horizontal
deflections
of points in the dam
at higher elevations
as noted by the direct plumb
line
to give the absolute
horizontal
deflections
of these
points.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.4 Tank<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tank is cylindrical
in shape and maybe
fabricated
from
steel. An upright
cylindrical
pipe of the same
size
as that
of the plumb
well
should
be welded
centrally over the hole in the centre of the tank bottom,
to provide
continuity
of the plumb well for extending
the wire to the suspension
point on the float. The height
of the upright pipe should be such as to preclude
over-
topping when tank is tilled with water to such specified
level that the resulting position
of the float in the water
would cause 150 N/mm2 of tension
in the plumb wire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tank should
be provided
with
airtight
cover
to
prevent
evaporation
of water
and tampering
of tloat
and suspension
assembly.
Suitable arrangement
should
be provided
for lifting the tank for repositioning
it in
case the wire gets in contact with the above mentioned
upright
cylindrical
pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However.
if the inverted
plumb
line is extended
all
the way up to the topmost available observation
station,
values
of the absolute
horizontal
deflections
of dam
points become
directly
available
by simple difference
of the initial and successive
observations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is then lowered
into the hole
and positioned
so that wire occupies

of the net vertical

of the hole. The grouting
of the anchor should be done with a long pipe lowered
