<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
Surface Covered
Cultivation
Structures
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Food and
Agriculture
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Development
of surface covered cultivation structures and greenhouse cultivation technology is of recent
origin. Its usage is increasing and the technology covers large number of new equipment
and systems
designed, developed
and manufactured
in the country. Need was therefore,
felt for a comprehensive
terminology to avoid any ambiguity in the usage of terms and to provide their authentic
definitions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In preparation
of this standard,
assistance has been derived from ASAE EP 460-1995
Commercial
greenhouse
design and layout
and 406.2, 1995 Heating
, ventilating
and cooling
of greenhouses.
Published by American Society of Agricultural
Engineers, USA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
