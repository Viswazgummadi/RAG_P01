<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Fourth Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalixed
by the Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1953 under the title ‘Code of practice for plain and reinforced concrete for
general building construction’ and subsequently revised in 1957. The code was further revised in 1964 and
published under modified title ‘Code of practice for plain and reinforced concrete’, thus enlarging the scope of
use of this code to structures other than general building construction also. The third revision was published in
1978, and it included limit state approach to design. This is the fourth revision of the standard. This revision
was taken up with a view to keeping abreast with the rapid development in the field of concrete technology and
to bring in further modifications/improvements in the light of experience gained while using the earlier version
of the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This revision incorporates a number of important changes. The major thrust in the revision is on the following
lines:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  In recent years, durability of concrete structures have become the cause of concern to all concrete
technologists. This has led to the need to codify the durability requirements world over. In this revision
of the code, in order to introduce in-built protection from factors affecting a structure, earlier clause on
durability has been elaborated and a detailed clause covering different aspects of design of durable
structure has been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Sampling and acceptance criteria for concrete have been revised. With tbis revision acceptance criteria
has been simplified in line with the provisions given in BS 5328 (Part 4):1990 ‘Concrete: Part 4
Specification for the procedures to be used in sampling, testing and assessing compliance of concrete’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some of the significant changes incorporated in Section 2 are as follows:
a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All the three grades of ordinary Portland cement, namely 33 grade, 43 grade and 53 grade and sulphate
resisting Portland cement have been included in the list of types of cement used (in addition to other
types of cement).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The permissible limits for solids in water have been modified keeping in view the durability requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The clause on admixtures has been modified in view of the availability of new types of admixtures
including superplasticixers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In Table 2 ‘Grades of Concrete’, grades higher than M 40 have been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It has been recommended that minimum grade of concrete shall be not less than M 20 in reinforced
concrete work (see also 6.1.3).
The formula for estimation of modulus of elasticity of concrete has been revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0
8)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the absenceof proper correlation between compacting factor, vee-bee time and slump, workability
has now been specified only in terms of slump in line with the provisions in BS 5328 (Parts 1 to 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Durability clause has been enlarged to include detailed guidance concerning the factors affecting durability.
The table on ‘Environmental Exposure Conditions’ has been modified to include ‘very severe’ and
‘extreme’ exposure conditions. This clause also covers requirements for shape and size of member,
depth of concrete cover, concrete quality, requirement against exposure to aggressive chemical and sulphate
attack, minimum cement requirement and maximum water cement ratio, limits of chloride content, alkali
silica reaction, and importance of compaction, finishing and curing.
A clause on ‘Quality Assurance Measures’ has been incorporated to give due emphasis to good practices
of concreting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Proper limits have been introduced on the accuracy of measuring equipments to ensure accurate batching
of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 456  :  2000<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>m) The clause on ‘Construction Joints’ has been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n) The clause on ‘Inspection’ has been modified to give more emphasis on quality assurance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The significant changes incorporated in Section 3 are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requirements for ‘Fire Resistance’ have been further detailed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The figure for estimation of modification factor for tension reinforcement used in calculation of basic
values of span to effective depth to control the deflection of flexural member has been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommendations regarding effective length of cantilever have been added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommendations regarding deflection due to lateral loads have been added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommendations for adjustments of support moments in restrained slabs have been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the detemination of effective length of compression members, stability index has been introduced to
determine sway or no sway conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommendations have been made for lap length of hooks for bars in direct tension and flexural tension.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
j)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommendations regarding strength of welds have been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommendations regarding cover to reinforcement have been modified. Cover has been specified
based~on durability requirements for different exposure conditions. The term ‘nominal cover’ has been
introduced. The cover has now been specified based on durability requirement as well as for fite
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The significant change incorporated in Section 4 is the modification-of the clause on Walls. The modified clause
includes design of walls against horizontal shear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In Section 5 on limit state method a new clause has been added for calculation of enhanced shear strength of
sections close to supports. Some modifications have also been made in the clause on Torsion. Formula for
calculation of crack width has been-added (separately given in Annex P).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Working stress method has now been given in Annex B so as to give greater emphasis to limit state design. In
this Annex, modifications regarding torsion and enhanced shear strength on the same lines as in Section 5 have
been made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Whilst the common methods of design and construction have been covered in this code, special systems of
design and construction of any plain or reinforced concrete structure not covered by this code may be permitted
on production of satisfactory evidence regarding their adequacy and safety by analysis or test or both
(see 19).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this code it has been assumed that the design of plain and reinforced cement concrete work is entrusted to a
qualified engineer and that the execution of cement concrete work is carried out under the direction of a qualified
and experienced supervisor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Creep of concrete depends,in addition to the factors
listed in 6.2.4, on the stress in the concrete, age at

assumed to be proportional to the stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.25.11n the  absence of experimental data and detailed
information on the effect of the variables, the ultimate

<<PARAGRAPH>>d<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A durable concrete is one that performs satisfactorily
in the working environment during its anticipated
exposure conditions during service. The materials and
mix proportions specified and used should be such as
to maintain its integrity and, if applicable, to protect
embedded metal from corrosion.
8.1.1  One of the main characteristics influencing the
durability of concrete is its permeability to the ingress
of water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, chloride, sulphate and
other potentially deleterious substances. Impermeability
is governed by the constituents and workmanship used
in making the concrete. with normal-weight aggregates<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>workmanship, to obtain full compaction and
efficient curing; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the shape and size of the member.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The degree of exposure anticipated for the concrete
during its service life together with other relevant
factors relating to mix composition, workmanship,
design and detailing should be considered. The
concrete mix to provide adequate durability under these
conditions should be chosen taking account of the
accuracy of current testing regimes for control and
compliance as described in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Specialist literatures may be referred to for durability
requirementsof concrete surfaces exposed to abrasive
action, for example, in case of machinery and metal tyres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The shape or design details of exposed structures
should be such as to promote good drainage of water
and to avoid standing pools and rundown of water.
Care should also be taken to minimize any cracks that
may collect or transmit water. Adequate curing is
essential to avoid the harmful effects of early loss of
moisture (see 13S).Member
profiles and their
intersections with other members shall be designed and
detailed in a way to ensure easy flow of concrete and
proper compaction during concreting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.2.3  Freezing and thawing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where freezing and thawing actions under wet
conditions exist, enhanced durability can be obtained
by the use of suitable air entraining admixtures. When
concrete lower than grade M 50 is used under these
conditions, the mean total air content by volume of
the fresh concrete at the time df delivery into the
construction should be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concrete is more vulnerable to deterioration due to
chemical or climatic attack when it is in thin sections,
in sections under hydrostatic pressure from one side
only, in partially immersed sections and at corners and
edges of elements. The life of the strycture can be
lengthened by providing extra cover to steel, by
chamfering the corners or by using circular cross-
sections or by using surface coatings which prevent or
reduce the ingress of water, carbon dioxide or
aggressive chemicals.

Cement content given in this table is irrespective of grades of cement.
2
Use of supersulphated cement is generally restricted where the prevailing temperature is above 40 “c.
3
Supersulphated cement gives~an acceptable life provided that the concrete is dense and prepared with a water-cement mtio of 0.4 or
less, in mineral acids, down to pH 3.5.
4
The cement contents given in co1 6 of this table are the minimum recommended. For SO, contents near tbe upper limit of any class,
cement contents above these minimum are advised.
5
For severe conditions,  such as  thin sections under hydrostatic pressure on one side only and sections partly immersed, considerations
should be given to a further reduction of water-cement ratio.
6
Portland slag cement conforming to IS 455 with slag content more than 50 percent exhibits better sulphate resisting properties.
7
Where chloride is encountered along with sulphates in soil or ground water, ordinary Portland cement with C,A content from 5 to 8
percent shall be desirable to be used in concrete, instead of sulphate resisting cement. Alternatively, Portland slag cement conforming
to IS 455 having more than 50 percent slag or a blend of ordinary Portland cement and slag may be used provided sufficient information
is available on performance of such blended cements in these conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the total water-soluble sulphate content of the concrete
mix, expressed as SO,, should not exceed 4 percent by
mass of the cement in the mix. The sulphate content
should be calculated
as the total from the various
constituents
of the mix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.5.1
General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For concrete to be durable, careful selection of the mix
and materials
is necessary,
so that deleterious
constituents
do not exceed the limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The 4 percent limit does not apply to concrete made

cement complying with IS 6909.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.5.2  Chlorides in concrete<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Whenever
there is chloride
in concrete there is an
increased risk of corrosion of embedded metal. The
higher the chloride content, or if subsequently exposed
to warm moist conditions,
the greater the risk of
corrosion.
All constituents
may contain chlorides and
concrete may be contaminated
by chlorides from the
external
environment.
To minimize
the chances of
deterioration
of concrete from harmful chemical salts,
the levels of such harmful salts in concrete coming
from concrete materials, that is, cement, aggregates
water and admixtures, as well as by diffusion from the
environment
should be limited.
The total amount of
chloride content (as Cl) in the concrete at the time of
placing shall be as given in Table 7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.5.4  Alkali-aggregate
reaction<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some aggregates
containing
particular
varieties
of
silica may be susceptible
to attack by alkalis (N%O
and %O) originating
from cement or other sources,
producing
an expansive
reaction
which can cause
cracking
and disruption
of concrete.
Damage
to
concrete from this reaction will normally only occur
when .a11 the following are present together:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A high moisture level, within the concrete;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A cement with high alkali content, or another
source of alkali;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Aggregate
containing
an alkali
reactive
constituent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total acid
soluble chloride content should be
calculated from the mix proportions and the measured
chloride contents of each of the constituents. Wherever
possible,
the total chloride content of the concrete
should be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the service
records
of particular
cement/
aggregate combination are well established, and do not -
include
any instances
of cracking
due to alkali-
aggregate reaction, no further precautions
should be
necessary.

It is important to maintain
the water-cement

of moisture content
in the aggregates, IS 2386 (Part 3) may be referred to.
To allow for the variation in mass of aggregate due to
variation in their moisture content, suitable adjustments
in the masses of aggregates shall also be made. In the
absence of -exact data, only in the case of nominal
mixes, the amount of surface water may be estimated

with form release agent. Release agents should be
applied so as to provide a thin uniform coating to the
forms without coating the reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12 ASSEMBLY OF REINFORCEMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1 Reinforcement

<<PAGE_27>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 456  :  2000<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>steel bars are bent aside at construction joints and
afterwards bent back into their original positions, care
should be taken to ensure that at no time is the radius
of the bend less than 4 bar diameters for plain mild
steel or 6 bar diameters for deformed bars. Care shall
also be taken when bending back bars, to ensure that
the concrete around the bar is not damaged beyond
the band.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or straightened without the approval of engineer-in-
charge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bar bending schedules shall Abe prepared for all
reinforcement work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2 All reinforcement shall be placed and maintained
in the position shown in the drawings by providing
proper cover blocks, spacers, supporting bars, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.1 Crossing bars should not be tack-welded for
assembly of reinforcement
unless permitted by
engineer-in-charge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.6 Reinforcement should be placed and tied in such
a way that concrete placement be possible without
segregation of the mix. Reinforcement placing should
allow compaction by immersion vibrator. Within the
concrete mass, different types of metal in contact
should be avoided to ensure that bimetal corrosion does
not take place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3 Placing  of Reinforcement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rough handling, shock loading (prior to embedment)
and the dropping of reinforcement from a height should
be avoided. Reinforcement should be secured against

<<PARAGRAPH>>13 TRANSPORTING, PLACING,
COMPACTION AND CURING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3.1  Tolerances on Placing of Reinforcement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified by engineer-in-charge, the
reinforcement shall be placed within the following
tolerances:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1 Transporting and Handling<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After mixing, concrete shall be transported to the
formwork as rapidly as possible by methods which will
prevent the segregation or loss of any of the ingredients
or ingress of foreign matter or water and maintaining
the required workability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1.1 During hot or cold weather, concrete shall be
transported in deep containers. Other suitable methods
to reduce the loss of water by evaporation in hot
weather and heat loss in cold weather may also be
adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>123.2 Tolerance for Cover<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless specified ~otherwise, actual concrete cover
should not deviate from the required nominal cover<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>~by  +lz  mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.2  Placing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nominal cover as given in 26.4.1 should be specified
to all steel reinforcement including links. Spacers
between the links (or the bars where no links exist)
and the formwork should be of the same nominal size
as the nominal cover.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  concrete shall be deposited as nearly as practicable
in its final position to avoid rehandling. The concrete
shall be placed and compacted before initial setting of
concrete commences and should not be subsequently
disturbed. Methods of placing should be such as
to preclude segregaion.
Care should be taken to
avoid displacement of reinforcement or movement
of formwork. As a general guidance, the maxi-
mum permissible free fall of concrete may be taken
as 1.5 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spacers, chairs and other supports detailed on
drawings, together with such other supports as
may be necessary, should be used to maintain the
specified nominal cover to the steel reinforcement.
Spacers or chairs should be placed at a maximum
spacing of lm and closer spacing may sometimes be
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.3  Compaction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concrete should be thoroughly compacted and fully
worked around the reinforcement, around embedded
fixtures and into comers of the formwork.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spacers, cover blocks should be of concrete of same
strength or PVC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.4 Welded JoInta or Mechanical Connections<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.3.1 Concrete shall be compacted using mechanical
vibrators complying with IS 2505, IS 2506, IS 2514
and IS 4656. Over vibration and under vibration of
concrete are harmful and should be avoided. Vibration
of very wet mixes should also be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welded joints
or mechanical
connections
in
reinforcement may be used but in all cases of important
connections, tests shall be made to prove that the joints
are of the full strength of bars connected. Welding of
reinforcements shall be done in accordance with the
recommendations of IS 275 1 and IS 9417.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Whenever vibration has to be applied externally, the
design of formwork and the disposition of vibrators
should receive special consideration to ensure efficient
compaction and to avoid surface blemishes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.5 Where reinforcement bars upto 12 mm for high

<<PARAGRAPH>>of ordinary Portland Cement-and at least 10 days where
mineral admixtures or blended cements are used. The
period of curing shall not be less than 10 days for
concrete exposed to dry and hot weather conditions.
In the case of concrete where mineral admixtures or
blended cements are used, it is recommended that
above minimumperiods may be extended to 14 days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.4 Construction
Joints and Cold Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Joints are a common source of weakness and, therefore,
it is desirable to avoid them. If this is not possible,
their number shall be minimized. Concreting shall be
carried out continuously up to construction joints,
the position and arrangement of which shall be
indicated by the designer. Construction joints should
comply with IS 11817.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.52  Membrane Curing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Construction joints shall be placed at accessible
locations to permit cleaning out of laitance, cement
slurry and unsound concrete, in order to create rough/
uneven surface. It is recommended to clean out laitance
and cement slurry by using wire brush on the surface
of joint immediately after initial setting of concrete
and to clean out the same immediately thereafter. The
prepared surface should be in a clean saturated surface
dry condition when fresh concrete is placed, against it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Approved curing compounds  may Abe  used in lieu of
moist curing withthe permission of the engineer-in-
charge. Such compounds shall be applied to all exposed
surfaces of the concrete as soon as possible after the
concrete has set. Impermeable~membranes such as
polyethylene sheeting covering closely the concrete
surface may also be used to provide effective barrier
against evaporation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>135.3 For the concrete containing Portland pouolana
cement, Portland slag cement or mineral admixture,
period of curing may be increased.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of construction joints at locations where
the previous pour has been cast against shuttering the
recommended method of obtaining a rough surface for
the previously poured concrete is to expose the
aggregate with a high pressure water jet or any other
appropriate means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6 Supervision<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is exceedingly difficult and costly to alter concrete
once placed. Hence, constant and strict supervision of
all the items of the construction is necessary during
the progress of the work, including the proportioning
and mixing of the concrete. Supervision is also of
extreme importance to check the reinforcement and
its placing before being covered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fresh concrete should be thoroughly vibrated near
construction joints so that mortar from the new concrete
flows between large aggregates and develop proper
bond with old concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where high shear resistance
is required at the
construction joints, shear keys may be-provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.6.1 Before any important operation, such as
concreting or stripping of the formwork is started,
adequate notice shall be given to the construction
supervisor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sprayed curing membranes and release agents should
be thoroughly removed from joint surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.5  Curing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Curing is the process of preventing the loss of moisture
from the concrete whilst maintaining a satisfactory
temperature regime. The prevention of moisture loss
from the concrete is particularly important if the-water-
cement ratio is low, if the cement has a high rate of
strength development,
if the concrete contains
granulated blast furnace slag or pulverised fuel ash.
The curing regime should also prevent the development
of high temperature gradients within the concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14 CONCRETING
UNDER SPECIAL
CONDITIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.1 Work in Extreme Weather Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During hot or cold weather, the concreting should be
done as per the procedure set out in IS 7861
(Part 1) or IS 7861 (Part 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.2 Under-Water  Concreting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rate of strength development at early ages of
concrete
made with supersulphated
cement is
significantly
reduced
at lower temperatures.
Supersulphated cement concrete is seriously affected
by inadequate curing and the surface has to be kept
moist for at least seven days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2.1  When it is necessary to deposit concrete under.

materials
and
proportions of the mix to be used shall be submitted to
and approved by the engineer-in-charge before the
work is started.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2.2 Under-water concrete should have a slump
recommended in 7.1. The water-cement ratio shall not
exceed 0.6 and may need to be smaller, depending on
the grade of concrete or the type of chemical attack.
For aggregates of 40 mm maximum particle size, the
cement content shall be at least 350 kg/m3 of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>135.1  Moist Curing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Exposed
surfaces
of concrete
shall be kept
continuously in a damp or wet condition by ponding
or by covering with a layer of sacking, canvas, hessian

layers. If the charge in the tremie is lost while
depositing, the tremie shall be raised above the
concrete surface, and unless sealed by a check
valve, it shall be re-plugged at the top end, as at
the beginning, before refilling for depositing
concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to ensure still water if practicable, and in any case to
reduce the flow of water to less than 3 mAnin through
the space into which concrete is to be deposited.
Coffer-dams or forms in still water shall be sufficiently
tight to prevent loss of mortar through the walls.
De-watering by pumping shall not be done while
concrete is being placed or until 24 h thereafter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2.4 Concrete cast under water should not fall freely
through the water. Otherwise it may be leached and
become segregated. Concrete shall be deposited,
continuously until it is brought to the required height.
While depositing, the top surface shall be kept as nearly
level as possible and the formation of seams avoided.
The methods to be used for depositing concrete under
water shall be one of the following:
a>  Tremie-The
concrete is placed through vertical
pipes the lower end of which is always inserted
sufficiently deep into the concrete which has
been placed ~previously but has not set. The
concrete emerging from the pipe pushes the
material that has already been placed to the side
and upwards and thus does not come into direct
contact with water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Direct placement with pumps-As
in the case
of the tremie method, the vertical end piece of
the pipe line is always inserted sufficiently deep
into the previously cast concrete and should not
move to the side during pumping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c) Drop bottom bucket -The
top of the bucket shall<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>be covered with a canvas flap. The bottom doors
shall open freely downward and outward when
tripped. The bucket shall be filled completely and
lowered slowly to avoid backwash. The bottom
doors shall not be opened until the bucket rests
on the surface upon which the concrete is to be
deposited and when discharged, shall be
withdrawn slowly until well above the concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bags -
Bags of at least 0.028 m3 capacity of
jute or other coarse cloth shall be filled about
two-thirds full of concrete, the spare end turned
under so that bag is square ended and securely
tied. They shall be placed carefully in header
and stretcher courses so that the whole mass is.
interlocked. Bags used for this purpose shall be
free from deleterious materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When concrete is to be deposited under water
by means of tremie, the top section of the tremie
shall be a hopper large enough to hold one entire
batch of the mix or the entire contents the
transporting bucket, if any. The tremie pipe shall
be not less than 200 mm in diameter and shall
be large enough to allow a free flow of concrete
and strong enough to withstand the external
pressure of the water in which it~is suspended,
even if a partial vacuum develops inside the pipe.
Preferably, flanged steel pipe of adequate
strength for the job should be used. A separate
lifting device shall be provided for each tremie
pipe with its hopper at the upper end. Unless
the lower end of the pipe is equipped with an
approved automatic check valve, the upper end
of the pipe shall be plugged with a wadding of
the gunny’sacking or other approved material
before delivering the concrete to the tremie pipe
through the hopper, so that when the concrete is
forced down from the hopper to the pipe, it will
force the plug (and along with it any water in
the pipe) down the pipe and out of the bottom
end, thus establishing a continuous stream of
concrete. It will be necessary to raise slowly the
tremie in order to cause a uniform flow of the
concrete, but the tremie shall not be emptied so
that water enters the pipe. At all times after the

should be
preferably investigated by analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>17.8 anon-destructive
Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Non-destructive
tests are used to obtain estimation of
the properties of concrete in the structure. The methods
adopted include ultrasonic pulse velocity [see IS 133 11
(Part l)] and rebound hammer [IS 13311 (Part 2)],
probe
penetration,
pullout
and maturity.
Non-
destructive tests provide alternatives
to core tests for
estimating the strength of concrete in a structure, or
can supplement
the data obtained
from a limited
number
of cores.
These
methods
are based
on
measuring
a concrete
property
that bears some
relationship to strength. The accuracy of these methods,
in part, is determined
by the degree of correlation
between strength and the physical quality measured
by the non-destructive
tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-Dead
load includes
self weight
of the structural
members plus weight of finishes and walls or partitions, if -any,
as considered in the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>17.6.3 The deflection due to imposed load only shall
be recorded. If within 24 h of removal of the imposed
loa< the structure does not recover at least 75 percent
of the deflection under superimposed load, the test may

than 80 percent, the structure shall be deemed to be
unacceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>18.1 Aim of Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18.3  Durability, Workmanship
and Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  aim of design is the achievement of an acceptable
probability that structures being designed will perform
satisfactorily
during their intended life. With an
appropriate degree of safety, they should sustain all
the loads and deformations of normal construction and
use and have adequate durability and adequate
resistance to the effects of misuse and fire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is assumed that the quality of concrete, steel and
other materials and of the workmanship, as verified
by inspections, is adequate for safety, serviceability
and durability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18.4  Design Process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design, including design for durability, construction
and use in service should be considered as a whole.
The realization
of design objectives
requires
compliance
with clearly defined standards for
materials,
production,
workmanship
and also
maintenance and use of structure in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18.2  Methods of Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.1  Structure and structural elements shall normally
be designed by Limit State Method. Account should
be taken of accepted theories, experiment
and
experience and the need to design for durability.
Calculations alone do not produce safe, serviceable and
durable structures. Suitable materials, quality control,
adequate detailing and good supervision are equally
important.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19  LOADS AND FORCES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In structural design, account shall be taken of the dead,
imposed and wind loads and forces such as those
caused by earthquake, and effects due to shrinkage,
creep, temperature, em, where applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.2 Where the Limit State Method can not be
conveniently adopted, Working Stress Method (see
Annex B) may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18.2.3  Design Based on Experimental Basis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.2 Dead Loads<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Designs based on experimental investigations on
models or full size structure or element may be
accepted if they satisfy the primary requirements
of 18.1 and subject to experimental details and the
analysis connected therewith being approved by the
engineer-in-charge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Dead loads shall be calculated  on the basis of unit
weights
which
shall be established
taking
into
consideration the materials specified for construction.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.2.1  Alternatively, the dead loads may be calculated
on the basis of unit weights of materials given in
IS 875 (Part 1). Unless more accurate calculations are
warranted, the unit weights of plain concrete and
reinforced concrete made with sand and gravel or
crushed natural stone aggregate may be taken as
24 kN/m” and 25 kN/m” respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.2.3.1 Where the design is based on experimental
investigation on full size structure or element, load tests
shall be carried out to ensure the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The structure shall satisfy the requirements for
deflection (see 23.2) and cracking (see 35.3.2)
when subjected to a load for 24 h equal to the
characteristic load multiplied by 1.33 y,, where
y, shall be taken from Table 18, for the limit state
of serviceability. If within 24 h of the removal
of the load, the structure does not show a
recovery of at least 75 percent of the maximum
deflection shown during the 24 h under,the load,
the test loading should be repeated after a lapse
of 72 h. The recovery after the second test should
be at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection
shown during the second test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19.3 Imposed Loads,  Wind Loads and Snow Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Imposed loads, wind loads and snow loads shall be
assumed in accordance with IS 875 (Part 2), IS 875

shall
be calculated in
accordance with IS 1893.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19.5  Shrinkage, Creep and Temperature
Effects<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the effects of shrinkage, creep and temperature are
liable to affect materially the safety and serviceability
of the structure, these shall be taken into account in
the calculations (see 6.2.4, 6.2.5 and 6.2.6) and
IS 875 (Part 5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE-If
the maximum deflection in mm, shown during
24 h under load is less than 40  P/D  where 1 is the effective span
in m; and  D  is the overall depth of-the section in mm, it is not
necessary for the recovery to be measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Forces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>21.1  A structure or structural element required to have
fire resistance should be designed to possess an
appropriate degree of resistance to flame penetration;
heat transmission and failure. The fire resistance of a
structural element is expressed in terms of time in hours
in accordance with IS 164 1. Fire resistance of concrete
elements depends upondetails of member size, cover
to steel reinforcement detailing and type of aggregate
(normal weight or light weight) used in concrete.
General requirements for fue protection are given in
IS 1642.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When dead load counteracts the effects due to other
loads and forces in structural member or joint, special
care shall be exercised by the designer to ensure
adequate safety for possible stress reversal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.9 Design Load<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design load is the load to be taken for use in the
appropriate method of design; it is the characteristic
load in case of working stress method and characteristic
load with appropriate partial safety factors for limit
state design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>21.2 Minimum requirements of concrete cover and
member dimensions for normal-weight aggregate
concrete members so as to have the required fire
resistance shall be in accordance with 26.4.3 and

<<HEADING level=3>>20.1 Overturning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The stability of a structure as a whole against
overturning shall be ensured so that the restoring
moment shall be not less than the sum of 1.2 times the
maximum overturning moment due to the charac&stic
dead load and 1.4 times the maximum overturning
moment due to the characteristic imposed loads. In
cases where dead load provides the restoring moment,
only 0.9 times the characteristic dead load shall be
considered. Restoring moment ilue to imposed loads
shall be ignored.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>21.3 The reinforcement detailing should reflect the
changing pattern of the structural section and ensure
that both individual elements and the structure as a
whole contain adequate support, ties, bonds and
anchorages for the required fire resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>21.3.1 Additional measures such as application of tire
resistant finishes, provision of fire resistant false
ceilings and sacrificial steel in tensile zone, should be
adopted in case the nominal cover required exceeds
40 mm for beams and 35 mm for slabs, to give
protection against~spalling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>20.1.1 The anchorages or counterweights provided
for overhanging members (during construction and
service) should be such that static equilibrium
should remain, even when overturning moment is
doubled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

5 STRUCTURAL
DESIGN (LIMIT STATE METHOD)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>limits of cracking would vary with the type of structure
and environment. Where specific attention is required
to limit the designed crack width to a particular value,
crack width calculation may be done using formula
given in Annex F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>35  SAFETY AND SERVICEABILITY
REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>35.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the method of design based on limit state concept,
the structure shall be designed~to withstand safely all
loads liable to act on it throughout its life; it shall also
satisfy the serviceability
requirements,
such as
limitations on deflection and cracking. The acceptable
limit for the safety and serviceability requirements
before failure occurs is called a ‘limit state’. The aim
of design is td achieve acceptable probabilities that
the structure will not become unfit for the use for which
it isintended, that is, that it will not reach a limit state.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The practical objective of calculating crack width is
merely to give guidance to the designer in making
appropriate structural arrangements and in avoiding
gross errors in design, which might result in
concentration and excessive width of flexural crack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface width of the cracks should not, in general,
~exceed 0.3 mm in members where cracking is not
harmful and does not have any serious adverse effects
upon the preservation of reinforcing steel nor upon the
durability of the structures. In members where cracking
in the tensile zone is harmful either because they are
exposed to the effects of the weather or continuously
exposed to moisture or in contact soil or ground water,
an upper limit of 0.2 mm is suggested for the maximum
width of cracks. For particularly
aggressive
environment, such as the ‘severe’ category in Table 3,
the assessed surface width of cracks should not in
general, exceed 0.1 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>351.1 All relevant limit states shall be considered in
design to ensure an adequate degree of safety and
serviceability.
In general, the structure shall be
designed on the basis of the most critical limit state
and shall be checked for other limit states.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>35.1.2 For ensuring the above objective, the design
should be based on characteristic values for material
strengths and applied loads, which take into account
the variations in the material strengths and in the loads
to be supported. The characteristic values should be
based on statistical data if available; where such data
are not available they should be based on experience.
The ‘design values’ are derived from the characteristic
values through the use of partial safety factors, one
for material strengths and the other for loads. In the
absence of special considerations these factors should
have the values given in 36 according to the material,
the type of loading
and the limit state being
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>35.4 Other  Limit States<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Structures designed for unusual or special functions
shall comply with any relevant additional limit state
considered appropriate to that structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>36 CHARACTERISTIC AND DESIGN
VALUES AND PARTIAL SAFETY  FACTORS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>36.1 Characteristic
Strength of Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  term ‘characteristic strength’ means that value of
the strength of the material below which not more than
5 percent of the test results are expected to fall. The
characteristic
strength for concrete shall be in
accordance with Table 2. Until the relevant Indian
Standard Specifications
for reinforcing steel are
modified to include the concept of characteristic
strength, the characteristic value shall be assumed as
the minimum yield stress/O.2 ~percent proof stress
specified  in the  relevant Indian Standard Specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>35.2 Limit State of  Collapse<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  limit state of collapse of the structure or part of
the structure could be assessed from  rupture  of one or
more critical sections and from buckling due to elastic
or plastic instability (including the effects of sway
where appropriate) or overturning. The resistance to
bending, shear, torsion and axial loads at every section
shall not be less than the appropriate value at that
section produced by the probable most unfavourable
combination
of loads an the structure using the
appropriate partial safety factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>36.2  Characteristic
Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  term ‘characteristic load’ means that value of load
which has a 95 percent probability of not being exceeded
during the life of the structure. Since data are not
available to express loads in statistical terms, for the
purpose of this standard, dead loads given in IS 875
(Part l), imposea loads given in IS 875 (Part 2), wind
loads given in IS 875 (Part 3), snow load as given in
IS 875 (Part  4)  and seismic forces given in IS 1893
shall be assumed as the characteristic loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>40.5.3  Enhanced Shear Strength Near Supports
(Simplified Approach)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>40.5  Enhanced Shear Strength of Sections Close
to supports<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  procedure given in 40.51 and 40.5.2 may beused
for all beams. However for beams carrying generally
uniform load or where the principal load is located
farther than 26 from the face of support, the shear
stress maybe calculated at a section a distance  d  from
the face of support. The value of 2, is calculated in
accordance with Table 19 and appropriate shear
reinforcement is provided at sections closer to the
support, no further check for shear at such sections is
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>40.5.1  General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shear failure at sections of beams and cantilevers
without shear reinforcement will normally occur on
plane inclined at an angle 30” to the horizontal. If the
angle of failure plane is forced to be inclined more
steeply than this [because the section considered
(X - X) in Fig. 24 is close to a support or for other
reasons], the shear force~required to produce failureis
increased.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The enhancement of shear strength may be taken
into account in the design of sections near a support
by increasing design shear strength of concrete to
2d z, /a, provided that design shear stress at the face
of the support remains less than the values given  in
Table 20. Account may be taken of the enhancement
in any situation where the section considered is closer
to the face of a support or concentrated load than twice
the effective depth,  d.  To be  effective, tension
reinforcement should extend on each side of the point
where it is intersected by a possible failure plane for a
distance at least equal  to the,effective depth, or be
provided with an equiv.dent anchorage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>41 LIMlT STATE OF COLLAPSE  :  TORSION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>41.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In structures, where torsion is required to maintain
equilibrium, members shall be designed for  torsion in
accordance with 41.2,41.3 and 41A. However, for such
indeterminate structures where torsion can be eliminated
by releasing redundant restraints, no specific design for
torsion is necessary, provided torsional stiffness is
neglected in the calculation of internal forces. Adequate
control of any torsional cracking is provided by the shear
reinforcement as per 40.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -The
approach to desip in this clause is as follows:
Torsional reinforcement is not calculated separately from that
required for beading and shear. Instead the total longitudinal
reinforcement is determined for a fictitious bending moment
which is a function of actual bending moment and torsion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

prevented. In the latter case, it is recommendded that
the effective length ratio  Id/l  may not be taken to be
less than 1.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>CALCULATION OFCKACK WIDTH<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provided that the strain in the tension reinforcement
is limited to 0.8  FYI Es, the  design surface crack width,
which should not exceed the appropriate value given
in 35.3.2 may be calculated from the following
equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X=
the depth from the compression face to the
neutral axis,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f,=
the maximum compressive stress in the
concrete,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f,=

<<PARAGRAPH>>Es  =  the modulus of elasticity of the reinforcement<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3%  Em<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, as an approximation, it will normally
be satisfactory to calculate the steel stress on the basis
of a cracked section and then reduce this by an amount
equal to the tensile force generated by the triangular
distributions, having a value of zero at the neutral axis
and a value at the centroid of the tension steel of
1N/mm2 instantaneously, reducing to 0.55 N/mm2 in
the long-term, acting over the tension zone divided by
the steel area. For a rectangular tension zone, this gives<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
