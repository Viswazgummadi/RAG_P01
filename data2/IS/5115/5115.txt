This
may be done by
means of a L shaped probe inserted
into the duct and arranged
so that the

while sample is withdrawn.
When
the

PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.1  Light the gas and continue
heating
until
three consecutive
readings
of the gas rate indicate
that a minimum
has been reached
in the case of a
gradual
acting
thermostat,
or that the main gas supply has been closed in
the case of a snap-acting
thermostat.
Turn
out the gas, admit
cold water
at the manufacturer’s
rated flow, and plot a curve of outlet
water tempera-
ture against
volume
of water delivered,
taking
temperature
readings
every
few seconds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

FOR DETERMINATION

THERMAL
EFFICIENCY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-O.  This test is to determine
the proportion
of the heat input to the burner
that is recovered
in the water when a known
weight
of water is heated,
through
an observed
temperature
range using Test Gas A or Test Gas B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D-l. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-l.1
The
appliance
shall be filled with cold water
at 20 f 5°C
to its
normal
capacity
less 1 litre for each 20 litres and fraction
thereof.
of the water shall be noted.
Weight
The lid of the appliance
shall be fitted with
an
aluminium
stirrer
and
a mercury-in-glass
thermometer
calibrated
to 0.5%
least count.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.2  To commence
the test, initial temperature
of water shall be recorded
and the burner lighted;
simultaneously
the stop watch shall be started and
meter
reading
noted.
Thermometer
shall
be observed
periodically
and
stirring commenced
when the temperature
reaches
80°C. When the temper-
ature reaches
85”C, the gas shall be turned off and watch stopped.
Stirring
is continued
until the maximum
temperature
is reachedon
the thermometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D-1.3
Cold water at a measured
temperature
and at a steady flow shall be
ad,mitted at the top.
The displaced
water shall be drawn off through
the
shortest possible length of pipe at the bottom into weighed- bin (or sequence
of bins  ),  the temperature
being measured at the point of draw-off every few
seconds and observations
shall be continued
until the temperature
of wat .r
being drawn off is within
1°C of the inlet water temperature.
A smooth
curve of temperaturdagainst
time shall be plotted;
the area  A  below
the
curve shall be computed,
and from this area and the rate of flow of water,
the total heat content
of water shall be calculated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
