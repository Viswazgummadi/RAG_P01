FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
( Part VI ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 13 September
1963, after the draft finalized by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Building
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 One
of the
major
contributing
factors
to the quality
of corlcrete
is
the qualitv
of aggregates
used therein.
The
test methods
given
in this
standard
are intended
to assist in assessing the quality of aggregates.
In
iI
given
situation,
for a particular
aggregate,
it ma)’ r.ot be necessary
to
pssess all the qualities ancl therefore
it is necessary
to determine
beforehand
the purpose
for which a concrete
is being used and the qualities
of the
aggregate
which
require
to he assessed.
Accordingly,
the
relevant
test
methods
may be chosen
from amongst
the various
tests covered
in this
standard.
For the convenience
of the users. the test methods
are grouped
into
the fol!owing

and has relnlrd the standard to the
practices

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
st.andard
( Part VI ) covers the test procedure
for measuring
the
mortar-making
properties
of fine aggregate
for concrete
by
means
oi
a compression

made from  a  mortar of a plastic consistency
and gauged to a definite water-cement ratio.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

non-abrasive
material,
such as medium-hard
rubber or seasoned oak wood rendered
non-absorptive

200°C
and shall
have a cross-section
of 12.5. x 25 rnnl and a convecient

MORTAR<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Place cement and water in quantities that will give a water-cement ratio
of O-6 by weight in an appropriate vessel .and permit the cement to absorb
water for one minute.
Mix the materials into a smooth paste with a spoon.
Beat into the mixture a known weight of the sample of sand under test that
has been brought to a saturated
surface-dry condition.
Mix until the
material appears to be of the desired consistency ( flow 100 f 3 ).
Continue
the mixing for 30 seconds and make a determination
of the flow in
accordance with 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>61  Carefully wipe the Row-table top clean and dry, and place the flow
mould at the centre.
.Lmmediately after completing the mixing operation,
place a layer of imortar about 25 mm in thickness in the mould and tamp
20 times with the tamper.
The tamping pressuxe shall be just sufficient to
insure uniform filling of the mould.
Fill the mould with mortar and tam
as specified for the first layer.
Cut off the mortar to a plane surface, flu J 1
with the top of the mould, by drawing the straight edge of a trowel ( held
nearly perpendicular to the mould) with a sawing motion across the top of
the mould.
Wipe the table top clean and dry, being especially careful to
remove any water from around the edge of the flow mould.
Lift the mould
away from the mortar one minute after completing the mixing operation.
Immediately, drop the table through a height of 12.5 mm ten times in (i
seconds.
The flow is the resulting increase in ,average diameter of the
mortar mass, measured on at least four diameters at approximately equal
angles, expressed as a percentage of the original diameter.
Should the flow
be too great, return the mortar to the mixing vessel, add additional sand,
and make another determination of the flow.
If more than two trials need
be made to obtain a flow of 100 $5,
consider the mortar as a trial aiortar,
and prepare test specimens from a new batch.
If the mortar is too dry,
discard the batch.
Determine the quantity of sand used by subtracting the
weight of the portion ren;aining after mixing from the weight of the initial
Sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

immediately
after theit removal

If more
than one specimen
at a time is removed
from the moist
closet for the 24-1~~~
tests, keep these specimens
covered
with a damp
cloth
until
time of testing.
If more than one specimen at a
time is removed from the storage water for testing, keep these specimens
in
water at a temperature
of 27
