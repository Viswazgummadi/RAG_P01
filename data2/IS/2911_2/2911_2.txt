<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
(  Part II ) ( First Revision)
was adopted by the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 29 February
1980,
after
the
draft
finalized by the Foundation
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Piles find application
in foundation to transfer loads from a structure
to competent sub-surface
strata having adequate
load bearing
capacity.
The load transfer mechanism
from a pile to the surrounding
ground is
complicated
and could not yet be fully determined,
although
application
of piled foundations
is in practice
over many decades.
Broadly,
piles
transfer axial loads either substantially
by friction
along its shaft or by
the end bearing or both.
Piles are used where either of the above
load
transfer mechanism
is possible depending upon the subsoil stratification
at a particular
site.
Construction of pile foundations
requires
a careful
choice of piling system depending
upon the subsoil conditions, the load
characteristics
of
a structure,
the
limitations
of
total
settlement,
differential
settlement,
and any other special requirement
of a project.
The installation
of piles demands
careful
control on position, alignment
and depth, and involves specialized skill and experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Timber
piles find extensive use for compaction
of soils and also for
supporting as well as protecting
water-front
structures.
The choice for
using a timber
pile shall
be mainly
governed by the site conditions,
particularly
the water-table
conditions.
Use of treated or untreated piles
will depend upon the site conditions
and upon whether
the work is
permanent or of temporary nature.
They have the advantages
of being
comparatively
light for their strength and are easily handled.
However,
they will not withstand as hard driving as steel or concrete piles.
Timber
has to be selected carefully and treated where necessary
for use as piles,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

rock or firm stratum has been encountered.
The nature of soil
both around and beneath the proposed piles should be tested for
strength
and
compressibility.
Ground
water
level
and
conditions ( such as artessian conditions ) should also be recorded
and chemical tests to ascertain the sulphate, chloride and other

<<HEADING level=3>>5.  DESIGN
CONSIDERATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 General
-Pile
foundations shall be designed in such a way that
the load from the structure it supports can be transmitted
to the soil
without causing
any soil failure and without causing such settlement,
differential or total, under permanent or transient loading as may result
in structural damage or functional distress.
The pile shaft should have
adequate
structural
capacity
to withstand all loads (vertical,
axial or
otherwise ) and moments which are to be transmitted to the subsoil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Adjacent
Structures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1  When
working near existing structures,
care shall be taken to
avoid any damage
to such structures.
Figure
1 of IS : 2974 ( Part I )-
1969*
may be used as a guide for qualitatively
studying the effect
of vibration on persons and structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 In case of deep excavations
adjacent
to piles, proper shoring or
other
suitable
arrangement
shall be done to guard against the lateral
movement of soil strata or releasing the confining soil stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Soil  Resistance
-
The bearing capacity of a pile is dependent on
the properties of the soil in which it is embedded.
Axial load from a
pile is normally
transmitted
to the soil through skin friction along the
shaft and bearing at its tip.
A horizontal
load on a vertical
pile is
transmitted
to the subsoil primarily
by horizontal
subgrade reaction
generated
in the ‘upper part
of the shaft.
A single pile is normally
designed to carry load along its axis.
Transverse
load-bearing
capacity
of a single pile depends on soil reaction
developed and the structural
capacity of the shaft under bending.
In case the horizontal loads are of
higher
magnitude
it is essential to investigate
the phenomena
using
principles of horizontal subsoil reaction adopting appropriate
values for
horizontal modulus of the soil.
Alternatively,
piles may be installed in
rake.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Structural
Capacity-
The pile shall have necessary structural
strength to transmit the load imposed on it ultimately to the soil.
Load
tests shall be conducted on single and preferably on a group of piles.

<<PARAGRAPH>>aompaction piles, tests should be done on a group of piles with their cap
resting on the ground [ su IS  :  2911 ( Part IV )-1979*].
If such test data
are not available, the load carried by the pile shall be determined by the
Engineering News formula ( see Note).
Care shall be taken that while
counting the number of blows, the head of the pile is not broomed or
brushed and in case of interrupted driving counting shall be done after
30 cm of driving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Spacing of Piles -
The centre to centre spacing of pile is considered
from two aspects as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Practical aspects of installing the piles, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The nature of the load transfer to the soil and possible reduction
in bearing capacity of group of piles thereby.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of the spacing is normally

capacity mainly from end bearing the spacing will be governed by the
competency of the end bearing strata.
The minimum spacing in such
cases shall be 2.5 times the diameter of the shaft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.2 Piles deriving their bearing capacity mainly from friction shall
be sufficiently apart to ensure that the zones of soil from which the piles
derive their support do not overlap to such an extent that their bearing
values are reduced.
Generally, the spacing in such cases shall not be
less than 3 times the diameter of the shaft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3  In the case of loose Sand or filling, closer spacing than in dense
sand may
be possible
since displacement
during
the piling
may be
absorbed by vertical and horizontal compaction of the strata.
Minimum
spacing in such strata may be twice and half the diameter of the shaft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
In the case of piles of non-circular
cross
section,
diameter
of the
circumscribing
circle shall be adopted.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 Overloading
-When
a pile in a group, designed for a certain
safe
load
is found, during or after execution,
to fall just short of the load
required to be carried by it, an overload
of up to 10 percent of the pile
capacity
may be allowed on each pile.
The total overloading
on the
group should not be more than 10 percent of the capacity
of the group
nor more than 40 percent of the allowable load on a single pile.
This is
subject
to the increase
of the load on any pile not exceeding
10 percent
of its capacity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  CLASSIFICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Depending
upon the use, that is, type of structure and the size, piles
shall be classified as Class A and Class B.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1
Class A -
Piles for railway
and highway
bridges, trestles, docks
and wharves.
The
butt diameter
or sides of square shall be not less
than 30 cm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2 Class  B -
Piles for foundation
work other than those specified
in
6.1.1
and
temporary
work.
Piles
used
for
the
compaction
of
ground shall be not less than 10 cm in diameter or side in case of square
piles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. TIMBER

AND DRIVING
STRESSES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1  The working stresses shall be as given in IS  :  883-1970*.
These may
be exceeded by not more than 100 percent during driving.<<HEADING_END>>

should
be in
accordance
with IS  :  456-l 9787.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Pile cap shall be deep enough to allow for necessary
anchorage
of
the column and pile reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3 The pile cap should normally be rigid enough so that the imposed
load could be distributed on the piles in a group equitably.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.4 The clear overhang of the pile cap beyond the outermost pile in the
group shall normally be 100 to 150 mm, depending upon the pile size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.5 The
cap is generally
cast over 75 mm thick
levelling
course
of
concrete.
The
clear
cover for main reinforcement
in the cap slab shall
not be less than 75 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.6 The pile should project 40 mm into the cap concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.  CUTOFFS
AND THEIR
TREATMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  After driving,
pile tops shall be cut off to a true plane and shall
show a solid head at the plane of cutoff.
After cutoff the pile tops shall be
treated with a preservative
(see IS  :  401-1967:
)  .
If metal top-covers are
specified these shall be placed immediately
after
the treatment.
Any
holes and cuts if required for framing shall be suitably treated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2 Capping
-Capping
shall be done when the piles are in correct
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.  CONTROL

<<HEADING level=3>>12.1  The
piles in each
bent of a pile trestle
shall
be
selected
for
uniformity of size to facilitate placing of brace timbers.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2 The pile tip shall be pointed ( unless the driving is wholly in soft
strata)
in the form of truncated
cone or a p ramid
having the end
25 cm2 to 40 cm2 in area and the length shall

<<HEADING level=3>>12.3 To  prevent splitting and reduce brooming,
the head of the pile
should be hooped wit11 a suitable ring or wrapped with wires.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3.1
The heads of the piles shall be further protected by the provision
of cushion blocks.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3.2
Use of followers shall be avoided as far as possible.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.4 If the piles are required to be formed from two or more lengths, the
butting surfaces should be cut square to ensure contact over the whole
cross section of the pile.
A thin steel plate placed between the butting
surfaces will reduce the tendency to brooming.
The pieces should also
be secured with steel tube or steel flats.
Splices near the middle of the
pile should be avoided.
If it is necessary to obtain increase in size and
length of pile by building up piles from several timber sections, the
joint should be staggered and timber members connected by means of
bolts or coach screws.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.5  Control
of Alignment
-
Piles shall be installed as accurately
as
possible according
to the designs and drawings
either
vertically
or
to the specified batter.
Greater
care
should be exercised
in respect
of installation
of single piles or piles in two-pile groups.
As a guide,
for vertical
piles a deviation of 1.5 percent
and for
raker
piles a
deviation of 4 percent should not normally
be exceeded
although
in
special cases a closer tolerance may be necessary. Piles should not deviate
more than 75 mm from their designed positions at the working level of
the piling rig.
In the case of a single pile in a column positional
tolerance should not be more than 50 mm.
Greater
tolerance
may be
prescribed
for piles driven over water and for raking piles.
For piles to
be cutoff at a substantial depth, the design should provide for the worst
combination
of the above tolerances in position and inclination.
In case
of piles deviating beyond these limits and to such an extent that the
resulting eccentricity
cannot
be taken care of by a redesign of the pile
cap or pile ties, the piles should be replaced or supplemented by one or
more additional piles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE
-In
case of raker piles up to a rake of 1 in 6, there may be no  reduction
in the capacity
of thr pile.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.6 Sequence
of Piling<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.6.1  In a pile group
the sequence of installation
of piles shall
normally be from the centre to the periphery of the group or from one
side to the other.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_14>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2911 ( Part II ) - 1980<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.6.2  Consideration
should be given to the possibility of doing harm
to a pile recently formed by driving the pile nearby.
The danger of
doing harm is greater in compact soils than in loose soils.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.6.3
DrizGg n Croup  of  Friction Piles -
Driving piles in loose sand tends
to compact
the sand which
in turn increases the skin friction.
There-
fore, the order of installing of such a pile in group should avoid creating
a compacting block of ground into which further piles cannot be driven.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In
case
where
stiff
clay
or
compact sand layers have to be
penetrated, similar precautions need be taken.
This may be overcome by
driving the piles from the centre outwards or by beginning at a selected
edge or working across the group.
However, in the case of very soft soils,
the driving
may have to proceed from outside to inside so that the soil is
restrained from flowing out during operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.7  Jetting -Jetting  of casing by means of water shall be carried out
if required
in such a manner as not to impair the bearing
capacity
of
piles already
in place,
the stability
of the soil or the safety of any
adjoining buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.8 Defective
Pile -
In case defective piles, they shall be removed or
left in place, whichever
is convenient,
without affecting performance
of
the adjacent
piles or the cap as a whole.
Additional
piles shall
be
provided to replace them as necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.9 Amount  of Driving -  Care shall be taken not to damage the piles
by over-driving.
Any sudden
change in the rate of penetration which
cannot be ascribed to the nature of the ground shall be noted and its cause
ascertained,
if possible, before driving is continued.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.  RECORDING
OF DATA<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.1  A competent
inspector
shall
be
maintained
at
site
to record
necessary
information
during installation
of piles and the data to be
recorded
shall include the following:<<HEADING_END>>
