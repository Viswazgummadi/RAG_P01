<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
(First
Revision)
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 15 May
1970,
after the draft
finalized
by the
Stones Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Data
in regard
to the dimensions
and workmanship
of the natural
building
stones,
based on the information
collected
up to the year 1957,
by this Institution
were included
in the earlier version
of this standard
which
was
published
in
1957.
In
the
next
13 years
considerable
changes
in the method of construction
of stone masonry have occurred
so
as to keep in line with the latest development
in the building construction.
It has been,
therefore,
found
necessary
that
this standard
should
be
revised and its requirements
should now be based on the practice followed
in this country
by the various
organizations
like Military
Engineering
Services,
Central
Public Works Department,
Railways,
State Public Works
Departments,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Details regarding
construction
of stone masonry
have been prescribed
separately
in
IS: 1597
(Part
I)-1967’
and
IS: 1597
(Part
II)-1967t.
In this standard
recommendations
in regard
to
the
dimensions
and
workmanship
of the natural
buildiug
stones which are required
for the
various types of the stone masonry
have been covered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The
Sectional
Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of
this
standard
has taken into consideration
the views of producers,
consumers
and technologists,
and has related the standard
to the manufacturing
and
trade practices
followed in the country
in this field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.5
For the purpose of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final value,
observed
or calculated,<<HEADING_END>>
