<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 15 September 1981, after the draft finalized by the
Wrought Steel Products Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Structural and Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  This standard was first published in 1951 and was revised in 196l
and in 1972. While reviewing the standard in the light of the
experience gained during these years, the Sectional Committee
decided that this standard be further revised. In this revision the
following main modifications have been made:
a) Load is specified in terms of newtons (N) in alignment with the
adoption of the SI units both nationally and internationally,
b) Sampling requirements have been modified, and
c) Reference has been given to the latest standards available for
supply
of
material
(IS : 8910-1978*)
and
for
chemical
composition (IS : 7887-1975†).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3  This edition 4.2 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (March 1984) and
Amendment No. 2 (June 2001). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960‡. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

10.1.1  The inner diameter of each coil shall not exceed 600 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11. MARKING
11.1  Each coil of wire shall be securely tagged with a label suitably
marked with the following:
a) Manufacturer’s name or trade-mark,
b) Year of manufacture,
c) Coil number, and
d) Weight of coil.
11.2  Each coil shall be sealed with a lead disc which shall bear the
purchaser’s acceptance mark. The lead disc shall be perforated
parallel to the face so that the wire can be passed through it. The end
of the wire shall then be flattened and the disc slipped over the
flattened portion and secured by one or two blows with a hammer and
stamped.
11.2.1  The coil may also be marked with the ISI Certification Mark.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — The use of the ISI Certification Mark is governed by the provisions of the
Indian Standards Institution (Certification Marks) Act and the Rules and
Regulations made thereunder. The ISI Mark on products covered by an Indian
Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced to comply with the
requirements of that standard under a well-defined system of inspection, testing
and quality control which is devised and supervised by ISI and operated by the
producer. ISI marked products are also continuously checked by ISI for conformity
to that standard as a further safeguard. Details of conditions under which a licence
for the use of the ISI Certification Mark may be granted to manufacturers or
processors may be obtained from the Indian Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

from col 1 and 2 of Table 2, adequate length of test piece shall be cut
from each end and subjected to physical tests, namely, size, surface
condition, tensile, wrapping, coating and resistance tests. A test piece
failing to meet any one of the requirements, shall be called a defective.
If the number of defectives found is less than or equal to the
permissible number of the defectives specified in col 3 of Table 2, the
lot shall be considered to have conformed to physical requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

agreed, the following procedure shall be followed for chemical
requirements:
From those tests pieces which have conformed to physical
requirements, further test pieces shall be selected at random
according to col 4 of Table 2. These samples shall be tested for all
the chemical requirements. If a test piece fails to meet the
respective chemical requirement, it shall be called a defective. The
