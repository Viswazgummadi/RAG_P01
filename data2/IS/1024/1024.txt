in 1968 and subsequently
revised in 1979. While reviewing
the standard
in the light of experience

<<PARAGRAPH>>All structural
details shall be designed
to avoid, as
far as possible, stress concentrations
likely to result
in excessive
reduction
of the fatigue
strength
of
members or connections.
Care shall be taken to avoid
sudden change of shape of a member or part of a
member, especially in regions of tensile stress or local
secondary bending, and steps shall be taken to avoid
aerodynamic
and similar vibrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

divided into atleast live selected representative
stress levels
approximately
equally
spaced
between the minimum and the maximum of the
stresses to be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Loads and Stresses to be Considered<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Working stresses shall be reduced, where necessary,
to allow for the effects of fatigue.
Allowance
for
fatigue shall be made for combinations
of stresses due
to dead load, live load, impact, lurching and centrifugal
force, including secondary stresses due to eccentricity
of connections
and off-joint
loading
in latticed
structures.
Stresses
due to wind, temperature
and
longitudinal
and nosing force, and secondary stresses
due  to elastic deformations
and joint rigidity, may be
ignored in considering
fatigue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For each of the stress cycles the maximum
allowable number of cycles N,, N,, etc, shall
be determined
from
Tables

interpolating
the values, if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -  If the stress level under consideration ,f,,, is smaller<<HEADING_END>>

the relevant value of N may be found by extrapolating the
design tables for the pnrticular detail and value of .jM,JMu

<<PARAGRAPH>>8 DESIGN OF WELDED JOINTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  Dynamic
loads may be repetitive, fluctuating
or
reversible.
The factors to be considered in the design
of members
and welded joints are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3.5 Butt joints between parts of unequal cross section
arranged in line will result in a local increase in stress
in addition to stress concentration
caused by the profile
of the weld itself.
If the stresses induced by these
effects are unacceptable,
the parts should be shaped
so as to reduce the stresses.
Where the difference
in thickness
of the parts exceed 25 percent of the
thickness of the thinher part or 3 mm’ whichever
is
greater, the dimensions
of the wider or thicker part
shall be reduced at the butt joints
to those of the
smaller part, the slope being not steeper than 1 in 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
number
of loading cycles, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
constructional
details
like arrangement
and
location of joints,
form of the joints, contours
and
finish of welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.1
Stress raisers, such as excessive or inadequate
reinforcement,
sharp reentrant
angles, sudden change
of sections,
accidental
dents,
arc strikes,
welded
attachments in highly stressed zones, angular notches,
rough flame cut edges, undercutting
in welding, slag
inclusions
and incomplete
penetrations,
will cause
reduction in fatigue strength. Such stress raisers should,
therefore, be avoided where such reduction in strength
may cause failure of the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 Fillet Welds<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.1  In case of fillet welds,
where reduction
in
working
stress
in weld results
in larger
welds,
consideration
shall be given to shift the joint in order
to avoid or reduce the stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 The design
of welds
shall
generally
be in
conformity
with IS 9595.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 1024  :  1999<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.2  A normal fillet weld is one in which the depth
of penetration
beyond the root is less than 2.4 mm,
while a deep penetration
fillet weld is one in which
the depth of penetration
beyond the root is 2.4 mm
or more.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>dynamic
loaded structures,
except for connecting
intermediate
stiffeners to webs of beams and  girders.
It  may be used in structures not subjected to transfer
calculated
stress across a joint
when the strength
required is less than that developed
by a continuous
fillet weld of the smallest
allowable
size for the
thickness
of the part joined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.3 Normally
both the leg lengths shall be equal
and the size of the normal fillet shall be taken as the
minimum
leg length,
while
the size of a deep
penetration fillet weld shall be taken as the minimum
nominal leg length plus 2.4 mm. The minimum
size
of the first run of a single run fillet weld shall be
as given in Table 8 to avoid the risk of cracking in
the absence of preheating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.2 Intermittent
fillet welds shall not be  used  where
they would result in the formation
of rust pockets.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5.3 The distance along an edge of a part between
effective lengths of consecutive intermittent fillet welds,
whether the welds are in line or staggered on alternate
sides of the edge, shall not exceed 12 times the thickness
of the thinner part when in compression
or 16 times
the thickness of the thinner part when in tension, and
shall in no event exceed 200 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.4 The effective throat thickness of a flat or convex
fillet weld connecting
parts, the fusion faces of which
form an angle between 60” and 120”, may be derived
by multiplying
the leg length by the appropriate factor
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.54
Where intermittent
fillet welds are used to form
T joints, the thickness referred to above shall be that
of the Table 8. In a line of intermittent
fillet welds,
there shall be a weld at the ends of the part connected,
for welds staggered along two edges this shall apply
to both edges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

side
fillet welds shall be used at the ends for a length not
less than the width of the plate concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.6  T Butt Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.5 The effective length of fillet weld shall be taken
as the overall length less twice the leg length, thereby
discounting
the contribution
of the stop and start
positions which are generally of reduced profile.
In
any case, the effective length shall not be less than
four times the leg length, subject to a minimum
of
40  mm. Fillet welds terminating  at the ends or sides
of parts shall be returned
continuously
around the
corners for a distance of not less than twice the leg
length of the weld unless access or the configuration
render this impracticable.
This procedure is particularly
important for fillet welds on the tension side of parts
carrying a bending
load. The weld shall be of full
size throughout,
and defect free.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Butt welds in T joints shall be completed
by means
of fillet welds each having a size not less than 25
percent of the thickness
of the outstanding
part.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.7  Fillet Welds Applied to the Edge of a Plate or
Section<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.7.1  Where a fillet weld is applied to the square edge
of a part, the specified size of the weld shall generally
be at least 1.5 mm less than the edge thickness,
in
order to avoid melting down of the outer comer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.7.2 Whereas fillet weld is applied to the rounded
toe of a rolled section, the specified size of the weld
shall generally
not exceed 314th of the thickness
of
the section at the toe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.6 For critical
applications,
the use of full
penetration
fillet weld shall be considered.
In fillet
welded joints carrying a compressive load, it shall not
be assumed that the part% joined are in contact under
the joint.
Fillet welds at right angles to the lines of
principal stress in a plate subject to tension shall be
avoided in dynamically
loaded structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.7.3 Where a fillet weld equal in size to the thickness
of the section at the toe of a rolled section or at the
square
edge of a plate
is required
from design
consideration and is specially designated in the drawing,
the toe or edge shall be specially built up with weld
metal in such a manner as to ensure full throat thickness,
full fusion area and no injury to the parent metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.7 If side fillets alone are used in end connections,
the length of each side fillet shall not be less than
the distance between the fillets.
Side fillets may be
either at the edges of the members or in slots or holes.
The weld shall be of full size throughout
and defect
free.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.8  Fillet Welds in Slots or Holes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.8.1  When welding inside a slot or a hole, in a plate
