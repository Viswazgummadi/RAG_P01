<<PARAGRAPH>>Cosmetics Sectional Committee, PCD 19<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Cosmetics Sectional Committee had been approved by the Petroleum, Coal and Related
Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cosmetics preparations are employed for different kind of functions. Covering up skin blemishes
and imperfections and giving uniform colouration and improve the attractiveness is one of the
major requirements. Such products which decorate the skin are called make-up preparations. The
pigments which have property of covering up are usually powders and these pigments do not
adhere very well. The adhesion of powder is considerably improved by treating the skin with a
preparation on which the powder will remain much longer. Such preparations are called
foundation creams. These creams are similar to vanishing cream, day creams, etc. A foundation
make-up is a preparation which contains both powder and foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is necessary that all ingredients used are such that in the concentration in which they would be
present in the foundation cream, are free from any harmful effects. For determining the
dermatological safety of a new formulation, or of a new raw material in an old formulation,
reference may be made to IS 4011 : 1982 for prophetic testing. It shall be the responsibility of the
manufacturer to satisfy itself of the dermatological and microbiological safety of its formulation
according to IS 4011 : 1982 and the test method given in Annex D of this standard respectively
before releasing the product for sale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.2 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (January 1999) and Amendment No. 2
(April 2001). Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of the
amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

batch. Make a composite sample by pooling
these samples. Take 1.0 g of the composite
sample and add 9 ml of dilutant. Make a

of each dilution to duplicant petri-dishes. Add
approximately 15 ml of nutrient agar or TSA to
the petri-dishes and mix. Allow the agar to
solidify. Repeat the above procedure for
Sabouraud Agar or PDA for fungal counts.
Nutrient agar (or TSA) plates should be
incubated at 28-30°C for 48 h and the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
