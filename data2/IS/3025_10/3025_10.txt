<<HEADING level=3>>(  First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I. Scope -
Prescribes nephelometric method for the measurement of turbidity of water. This method
is applicable to all types of water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Principle
-
It is based on comparision
of the intensity
of  light scattered by the sample under
defined conditions with the intensity of light scattered by a standard reference suspension
under the
same conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The higher the intensity of scattered light, the higher the turbidity.
Formazin polymer is generally
used as turbidity
standard because it is more reproducible
than other types of standards used
previously. The turbidity of a particular concentration of Formazin suspension is defined as 40 Jackson
turbidity
units. The same suspension
of Formazin has a turbidity of approximately 40 units when
measured on Jackson candle turbidimeter.
Thus turbidity
units based on the Formazin preparation
closely approximate those derived from Jackson candle turbidimeter but may not always be indentical
to them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. Interferences
-
Coloured solutes cause low turbidity values.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Sample Tubes -
The sample tubes should be of clear and colourless glass.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Turbidimeter-
The turbidimeter shall consist of a nephelometer with a light source for illuminat-
ing the sample and one or more photo electric detectors with a readout device to indicate the intensity
of light scattered at right angles to the path of the incident light. The turbidimeter should be SO
designed that little stray light reaches the detector in the absence of turbidity and should be free from
significant drift after a short warm-up period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. Reagents<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Turbidity-Free
Water -
Pass distilled
water through
membrane filter having a pore size not
greater than 0’45 pm, if such filtered water shows a lower turbidity than the distilled water. Discard the
first 200 ml collected. Otherwise use distilled
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Hexamethylene Tetramine Solution -
Dissolve 10’0 g hexamethylene tetramine
in demineralised
water and dilute to 100 ml.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Hydrazine
Sulphate
Solution -
Dissolve
1’000 g hydrazine
sulphate (NH&HaSOI)
in deminera-
lised water and dilute to 100 ml.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4  Turbidity Standard Suspension I ( Formazin)
-
In a 1 O&ml volumetric flask mix 5’0 ml hydratine
sulphate solution with 5’0 ml haxamethylene tetramine solution.
After 24-hour standing at 25 f 3”C,
dilute to 100 ml with demineralised water and mix well. Prepare fresh monthly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5  Turbidity Standard Suspension II -
Dilute IO ml turbidity standard suspension I to 1OQ ml with
demineralised water, The turbidity of this suspension is defined as 40 Jackson Turbidity
units
(JTU).
Prepare fresh weekly.
This suspension
may be diluted
as required to prepare more dilute turbidity
standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. Sample
Handling
and Preservation
-
Preservation of sample is not practical.
Analysis should
begin as soon as possible.
Refregeration
or chilling
to 4°C
is recommended to minimize
micro-
biological reaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Turbidimeter Calibration-Follow
the manufacturer’s operating instructions. Measure the standards
on turbidimeter
covering
the range of interest. If the instrument
is already calibrated in standard
turbidity units, this procedure will check the accuracy of calibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The turbidity
of sample is the reduction
of transparency
due to the presence of particulate
matter
such
as clay
or silt,
finely
divided
organic matter, plankton
or other microscopic
organisms.
These
cause light to be scattered and absorbed rather than transmitted
in straight
lines
through
the sample.
The method
is applicable
to drinking,
surface and saline waters  in the range of turbidity
O-40
NTU.
Higher values may be obtained
by dilution
of the sample. The values are expressed
in nephelometric
WrLidity
units (NTU).
The NTU considered
comparable
to the previously
reported
Jackson
Turbidity
units
(JTU)
and Formazin
Turbidity
units
(FTU).
The standard
method
for
the
determination
of
turbidity
is based on Jackson candle turbidimeter
and the lowest turbidity
values that can be measured
on this instrument
is 25 units.
As turbidity
of treated water is usually
in the range of O-5 units indirect
secondary methods have been used which,
however,
do not duplicate
the results obtained
on Jackson
Candle
Turbidimeter
for all the samples.
Due to fundamental
differences
in optical systems, results
obtair,3d
with
different
types
of secondary
instruments
do not check closely with one another even
though
instruments
are precalibrated
against
candle
turbidimeter.
Use of suspensions,
of different
types of particulate
matter, for preparation
of calibration
curves
may also cause discrepancies.
Most
commercial
turbidimeters
fcr measuring
low
turbidities
give
comparatively
good
indications
of the
intensity
of light
scattarcd
in one particular
direction
predominantly
at right angle to the incident
light.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
