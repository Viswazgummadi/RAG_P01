FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 29 February
1980, after the draft finalized by the Diversion
Work
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Prior to the commencement
of actual construction
of any work in the
bed of a natural river, it becomes obligatory
in most cases, to exclude
temporarily
the river flow from
the proposed
work area during the
construction
period, so as to permit the work to be done in the dry areas.
An efficient scheme of diverting the river flow away from the work area
should be capable of limiting the seepage into the work area to a minimum
so that the work area can be kept dry with minimum pumping capacity.
The diversion of river flow, though of a preliminary and temporary nature,
more than often presents difficult and complex problems and becomes a
major construction
work in itself.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 A temporary river diversion scheme essentially consists of:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>coffer dam(s) built across a part or full width of the river to divert
the flowing water away from the work area; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>works to transfer the diverted water from upstream to the down-
stream of the work area without affecting the same, such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Diversion through  (  construction ) sluices in the main work,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Diversion by one or more tunnels along the side of the main
work area,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Diversion through low level blocks of the main structure left
for the purpose or through channels excavated outside the
main structure, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Secluding part of the whole work area for construction
and
allowing the river to flow through the remaining work area,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9461 - 1980<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  In case of the temporary diversion works, economy considerations weigh
more heavily and the importance
of collecting minimum basic field data
after requisite investigation
of local conditions, therefore, cannot be over-
emphasized.
The data collected for the permanent structure may be used
for the design of temporary diversion works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test or analysis shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard covers the investigations and observations in respect of
collection of basic data prior to the commencement
of planning and design
of works for temporary river diversion, after preliminary selection of site of
diversion works has been made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  DATA REQUIRED<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  The following data are required to enable planning and design of works
.  for temporary river diversion:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Topographical
Survey
2.1.1 An index map on a suitable scale shall be prepared
showing the
main work proposed to be taken up, the entire scheme of river diversion
and other important works affected by the proposed Scheme, road, railway,
habitation,
cultivated land, other public utilities and places of religious and
antique interest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2 A contour plan of the area around the proposed site of the main
work extending well beyond the proposed sites of the river diversion works
shall be prepared with contour intervals of 0.5 to I.0 m (depending
upon
the magnitude of the work) up to an elevation of at least 2.5 m above the
design flood level for the diversion structure.
The survey should be plotted
to a suitable scale and should show all the salient features like firm banks,
rock outcrops, deep channels, large shoals and islands, deep pools, impor-
tant land marks, etc.
2.1.3 Cross-sections
of the river shall be observed at intervals of up to
200 m (the spacing may be at closer intervals, if site conditions so require)
covering the entire area of the works of the diversion scheme and extended
up to at least 600 m beyond on either side. The cross-sections should be
extended on both banks up to about 25 m above the design flood level. All
the cross-sections
should indicate the highest observed
flood level at
the site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS :  9461- 1980<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.4  Longitudinal
section of the river with water levels along the deep
current shall be surveyed for a distance 1 km upstream and 600 m down-
stream -beyond the area covered by the entire scheme of diversion works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.5 Erosion characteristics of the river should be observed and marked
on the plan and cross-sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Hydrological
Data<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Daily rainfall recorded at different rainfall gauging stations in and
around the catchment area and data regarding storms in respect
of successive positions of the centre of the storm on the catchment
shall be collected for as many years as possible.
The storms
causing peak discharges should be separated for unit hydrograph
analysis.
Pattern of rainfall in the area in previous years with
durations of dry and wet spells in general should also be studied
to help in forming an idea as to the periods available for con-
struction
without
interruption
as well as with short duration
interruption;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flood hydrographs
for isolated rain storms shall be observed for
working out unit hydrograph;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Peak flow data separately for monsoon and non-monsoon
periods
shall be collected for the river for as many years as possible for
frequency analysis;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Information
regarding high flood level shall be collected from
flood marks and local enquiry at site of works, so as to estimate
the maximum flood by slope area method in accordance
with
IS:2912-1964*; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Data for gauge discharge relationship ( see IS: 2914-19647 ) shall
be collected from suitable sites, at least one from upstream and
one from downstream of the permanent work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Sediment and Boulder Studies -The
data regarding quality and quantity
of bed and suspended sediment and boulders carried by the river, specially
during the flood season, should be collected. For measurement of suspended
sediment, IS  :  4890-1968: may be referred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Timber Survey<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.1 A detailed survey shall be carried out to collect information
about
the size and quantities of timber sleepers and wooden logs floating down<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

through/over
diversion works or for planning timber collection and extrac-
tion devices from the river upstream of the diversion works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5  Surface and Subsurface Investigations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.51  Subsurface investigation should be carried out in accordance with
IS  :  6955-1973*.
Bore-holes should be driven at specified intervals and bore
legs be prepared in accordance with IS  :  4464-1967t, covering the entire area
of the diversion scheme.
The location of borings shall be correctly marked
and numbered on the survey sheets.
These borings should be carried to
hard rock level or to a depth 15 to 25 m below the deepest river bed level
depending upon the strata and the component
structure
of the diversion
scheme (coffer-dam,
conduit or an open diversion channel).
Trial pits may
be excavated to determine the nature and characteristics
of overburden and
loose deposits.
In case of diversion through
tunnels, drill holes should
preferably
penetrate
the tunnel alignment.
Drifts of size 1.8 mx 1’5 m
minimum should be driven at suitable locations to determine the properties
along diversion tunnel alignment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.2 Where the nature of rocks warrants and the diversion tunnels are
to be used as permanent
structures, it is desirable to conduct one or all of
the following tests:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Plate-bearing
tests ( both horizontal
and vertical ) ( see IS: 1888
1971: );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flat jack test in 3 directions ( see IS  :  7292-1974s );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rock shear tests at site are also necessary which may be carried
out in open foundation.
These tests will be useful in finding
shear characteristics
of rocks necessary to design structures on rock
and also in design of tunnels ( see 18:7746-197511 );  and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Uniaxial jacking tests ( see IS  :  7317-1974~~ ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.3 The following further
investigations
should be done in case of
alluvial reaches of the river:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For sandy foundations

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.4 Bore holes should be drilled for a minimum depth of 2 m into fresh
rock in the foundations
(for
rock foundations
at shallow depth  )  to
ascertain the depth to weathered zones, extent of joints and fissures and to
determine the necessity or otherwise of grouting to minimize seepage into
the main work area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.5 Field permeability
tests should
be carried
out to estimate the
amount of seepage through the diversion works required to be pumped out
from main working pit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5.6 Observations of water table in the region adjacent to the diversion
scheme area should be carried out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Construction
Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.1  Survey of availability of construction
materials in the near vicinity
with leeds and lifts is necessary to decide upon the type of works to be
adopted for temporary
river diversion.
Laboratory
and field tests should
be carried out to determine the engineering properties of the construction
materials including their permeability values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7  Other Miscellaneous
Studies<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7.1  Type of Construction of Main Work  -This
should be decided
before hand to help in realistic planning of the scheme of temporary river
diversion.
When the river diversion works include passing of floods over
the partly built main structure, suitable measures should be adopted in the
design of permanent structure consistent with the construction
programme
to allow the flow over the structure without causing damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Period and Scheme of Construction -  If the period of construction
of the main work is to extend over more than one working season, the total
period and the scheme of construction
should be studied to enable deciding
the magnitude of maximum ~discharge required to be handled for diversion
as also the duration for which this discharge is to be handled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
