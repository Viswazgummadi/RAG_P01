<<HEADING level=3>>0.  FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 28 November
1986, after the draft finalized by
the Building
Materials
and Components
Sampling
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Sampling
is of equal importance
to testing
and a
man
drawing
samples
shall
use every precaution
to obtain samples that will show the
true nature and condition
of the materials which they represent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 One of the major
contributing
factors
to the quality
of concrete
is the quality
of aggregates
used therein.
It is, therefore, imperative
that due consideration
is given to sampling
procedures
which
will help
in the proper and objective evaluation
of the quality of aggregates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard
was originally
issued in 1969.
This has been revised
so as to make it more easily implementable
in practice and bring it in
line with the current
national
and
international
trade practices.
[ In
this
revised
version,
the weight
of
the gross sample and number of
increments
have been modified so that it may be more
economical
to
use them in practice.]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In preparing
this standard,
assistance
has
been
derived
from
the
following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASTM/D

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2 Potential sources of bank run sand may include previously worked
pits from which there is an exposed face or potential deposits discovered
through
air-photq,
interpretation,
geo-physical
exploration
or
other
types of investigation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3 Samples shall be so chosen from each of the

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.4
If the deposit is worked
as an open-face
bank or pit,
the sample
shall
be
taken
by
channelling
the face vertically,
top to bottom,
so as
to represent
the materials
proposed
for use.
Over-burden
and disturbed
material
shall
not
be
included
in
the
sample.
Test
holes
shall
be
excavated
or drilled
at
numerous
locations
in the deposit to determine
quality
of material
and the extent
of the
deposit
ljeyocd
the
exposed
face,
if
any.
The
number
and
depth
of these lest holes will depend
upon the quantity
of the materia1
to be
used,
topography
of the
area,
nature
of the
deposit,
character
of the material
and potential
value of
the material
in the deposit.
Separate
samI>les
shall
be
obtained
from
the face of the bank and from test holes.
If visual
inspection
indicates
that
there
is considerable
variation
in material,
indivii;ual
samples
shall
be selected from the material
in each well defined
stratum.
Each
sample
shall
be thoroughly
mixed
and quartered,
if necessary,
so that the.gross
sample
obtained
wail be of at least
12 kg
for
sand
and
33 kg
If the
deposit
contains
an
appreciable
amount
of coarse
aggregates.
If the
deposit being
in\,estiqated
does not have
an
open
face,
sample
shall
be obtained
entirely
from test holes as outlined
herein.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.1  The increments shall be taken at equal
intervals
preferably
from
the
cross
section and thickness of the stream  in one operation.
When
the aggregates
are in motion,
the most
reliable
means
of taking
such increments
is to sample
at a point
where
the
material
discharges
from
the
belt.
The
best
possible
increment
is one which
cuts across
entirely
the falling
steam
of the
material
by
means
of
a
suitable
receptacle
passed
from
one
side
of the
steam
to the other without
allowing
the receptacle
to overflow.
If the whole
of the
steam
cannot
be
covered
by
one increment
without
overflowing
the receptacle,
the
steam should
be sampled
systematically
by
taking
material
from
all
portions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.2
If’it
is not possible
to sample
satisfactorily
at the
point
of
discharge,
increments
may
be
drawn
from the moving
belt itself.
In
this case, the increments
shall
be col1ecte.d
from
the
centre
and
the
left and right side of the belt along
the same width.
To ensure
that very
small material
is also
correctly
obtained,
a scoop
should
sweep
the
conveyor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3
The material
collected
from
various
increments
in
a
sub-lot
shall be combined
and mixed
together
to constitute
a gross sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Sampling

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1  Sub-lots -
For  the purpose
of sampling,
all the carriers
( wagons/
trucks/boats
) in a lot shall be divided
into a suitable
number
of sub-lots
of approximately
equal
size in accordance
with
the
requirements
of
Table
1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.1
A representative
gross sample
shall be drawn
from
each
of
the sub-lots
and
shall be kept separately.
Thus,
there will be as many
gross samples
as the number
of sub-lots
into
which
a lot
has
been
divided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2
In order
to get
a representative
gross
sample,
the aggregates
shall be sampled
as far as possible
when
in
motion,
during
loading
or
unloading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2.1
A minimum
of 25 percent
of the
carriers
shall
be
selected
at
random
from
the sub-lot.
‘For the random
selection
of carriers,
the
procedure
given
in
3.1 of IS  : 4905-1968”
may  be followed.
Ten
increments
shall
be
taken
from
the
selected
carriers
and a suitable
weight
of the increment,
not less than

shall
be used
SO  that
a

of the
quantity
required
m Table 2 is obtained.
The

from top to
bottom over the area of a circle of 20 cm diameter for aggregates
more
than 20 mm
nominal size.
For doing so, aggregate
from the surface up
to a depth
of approximately
45 cm shall
be collected
at first.
The
bottom of the hole so formed shall then be covered by a plate
and
the
aggregate
lying
on the sides shall be removed up to that plate so that,
when the hole is dug further, the material
from
the sides
does not fill
up the hole by falling down.
The procedure
is repeated till the bottom
is reached.
For aggregates up to 20 mm nominal
size and
fine aggre-
gates a sampling auger may be used in a casing pipe of 15 cm
diameter
and
length
slightly
more
than
the height of the sub-lot.
The casing
pipe is pushed vertically
down till it touches the bottom of the lot.
The
entire material
from the inside
of the ca$ing
pipe is removed
by the
auger to give an increment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.3.2
In sampling coarse aggregates
from
loaded
carriers
effort
should
be made
to enlist’ the services of power equipment
capable of
exposing the material
at various levels
and
random
locations.
When
power
equipment
is not available
the procedure
given in 4.3.3.1
may
be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Sampling from Stacks or Stock Piles<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1  For sampling
material
from
stock piles or stacks,
it is
very
difficult
lo ensure unbiased samples, due to the segregation
which often
occurs when material is stacked,
with coarser
particles
rolling
to
the
outside face of the pile.
For
coarse or
all-in aggregates
every
effort
should
be made
to procure
a power equipment to develop a separate,
small sampling pile composed
of materials
drawn
from
various
levels
and
locations
in the main
pile after which several increments may be
combined to compose the gross sample.
If it is necessary
to
indicate
the
degree of variability
existing within the main pile, separate samples
should be drawn from separate areas of the pile.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2
Where power equipment
is not available,
samples
from sack
piles should be made up of the required
number
of increments
taken<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_11>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:2430- 1986<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>equally
from
top  third,
at the
mid
point
and at the  bottom third  of the
volume
of the pile.
A board
put vertically
into the pile just
above
the
sampling
point
helps in preventing
further
segregation.
In
sampling
stock
piles
of the
aggregates,
the outer layer which
may have become
segregated,
should
be removed
and the sample
taken
from
the
material
beneath.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.3
Sub-lots
-
For
the
purpose
of
sampling,
the
quantity
of
aggregates
in a stack shall be divided
into a suitable
number
of sub-lots
of approximately
equal
size in accordance
with Table
1.
4.4.3.1
A representative
gross sample
shall be drawn
f;om
each
of
the
sub-lots.
Thus
there
will be as many
gross samples
as the number
of sub-lots
into which
the lot has been divided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.4
Sampling
of aggregates
from stacks shall be carried
out
as far
as possible,
during
the making
( or breaking
) of the stack.
4.4.4.1
A minimum
of ten increments
shall be taken
from a sub-lot
for making
up a gross sample.
The weight
of the gross
sample
shall be
according
to Table
2 for
various
sizes
of aggregates.
The
weight
of
the
increment
shall
be governed
by the weight
of the gross simple
and
minimum
number
of increments
i.e. 10.
This
weight
of increment
shall not be less than
1 kg.
The number
of increments
shall be equally
distributed
over
the
sub-lot.
Increments
shall be drawn
with the help
of a suitable
scoop ( see Fig. 1 ) at
regular
intervals
in
the
course
of
making
or unmaking
of the stacks.
4.4.5
When
it becomes
necessary
to sample
a stationary
stack,
trench
sampling
method
( see 4.4.5.1
and 4.4.5.2
) may be used.
This
method
is applicable
for stacks up to a maximum
height
of 1’5 m only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.5.1
The
weight
of the
gross
sample
shall
be
according
to
Tabfe
2 and minimum
number
of increments
from a sub-lot
shall be ten.
These
increments
shall be collected
according
to 4.4.5.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.5.2
Along
a randomly
chosen
line on the
aggregates
surface
of
the sub-lot,
a  trench
shall be dug right
down to the ground
level.
From
the trenches
so dug, the required
number
of increments
shall be collected
with
the
help
of
a
suitable
sampling
scoop ( see Fig. 1 ) at various
points
randomly
spread
over the two exposed
sides
of the
trenches.
In
case of large
stacks, in addition
to the trench,
the sides of the
piles
may
also
be
opened
to expose the aggregates
down to the bottom
at places
where the trench
does not expose the aggregates
inside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. REDUCTION
OF GROSS
SAMPLE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Each gross sample
shall
be
reduced
separately.
The
process
of
mixing
and
reduction
of each
gross sample
shall be repeated
until
the
material
required
for  each test, as specified
in the
relevant
test
method
specification,
IS  :  2386 ( Parts
1 to 8 )-1963*
is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Reduction
by  Riffle Divider
-
The aggregates shall be well mixed
and poured into the riffle.
This process shall be repeated using different
size riffles according
to the size of the aggregates.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Coning
and
Quartering
Method
-
The
aggregates
shall
be
mixed and then scooped into a cone-shaped
pile.
Care
shall be taken
to drop each scoopful exactly
over the same spot as otherwise the central
axis
of the, cone
will
be slackened
and an uneven distribution
of the
particle sizes will result.
After the cone is formed,
it shall
be flattened
by pressing
the top of the cone with the smooth surface of the scoop.
Then it is cut into quarters by two lines which intersect
at right
angles
at
the
centre
of the
cone.
The
bulk
of the sample is reduced by
rejecting
any two diagonally
opposite quarters.
Accuracy in quartering
is most easily
attained,
in the case of fine and all-in-aggregates,
with
damp material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. PACKING
AND MARKING
OF SAMPLES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Each sample
shall
be packed
separately
and despatched
to the
testing
laboratory,
great care being taken in packing to prevent the loss
of any fine material.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
Coarse aggregates shall be packed in secure containers
or sample
bags.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2
