<<HEADING level=3>>SPECIFICATION FOR
ELECTROPLATED COATINGS OF
ZINC ON IRON AND STEEL<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>( Second Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Second Revision 1 was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 10 September 1986, after the draft finalized by the
Metallic  and Non-metallic Finishes Sectional Committee had been approved
by  the Structural and Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard was first published in 1960, revised in 1970 and covered
three types of zinc plating depending on the coating thickness. In the first
revision of the standard, grades of thickness were revised keeping in view
the utility of the coatings and the trade practices followed in the country.
In this revision, efforts have been made to include many details to make
this standard
a comprehensive
one. Additional
terms are included under
terminology, limitations are referred
to regarding
finish and appearance
under coating requirements.
More details are furnished under information
to be given by the purchaser
and the manufacturer
regarding
chromate
passivation,
test for coatings, handling, inspection, packaging and service
life of the coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Unlike cadmium, zinc is of low toxicity and zinc coatings
are widely
used but prolonged
contsict with some liquids or damp foodstuffs which
are acidic or liable to become acidic, should be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Zinc protects
steels cathodically,
that is by sacrXcia1 protection in
most environments and this protection
is given to steel even at disconti-
nuities in thecoatings.
But zinc plating looses its initial bright appearance
due to environmental
conditions
like dust, condensed moisture at high
relative humidities, acidity,
high ambient
temperatures,
etc, and forms
bulky,
white corrosion
products, usually of basic zinc carbonate.
One of
the best methods of retarding this type of corrosion
is by the application
of inhibitive
chromate
passivation films. Passivation by chromate conver-
sion coatings gives additional protection against corrosion
and should be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Is: 1573 - 1986<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>applied unless there
is a reason to the contrary.
Articles which are to be
frequently painted may require alternative treatment
such as phosphating
to provide
good adhesion. Chromated
zinc coatings may also be further
protected, if necessary,
by water-based
lacquer,
or nitrocellulose
( NC )
lacquer
( conforming
to IS  :  349-1981* ) or
any
transparent
lacquer
coatings. NC lacquer
coatings
give better corrosion
protection
under
tropical conditions than water-soluble lacquer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - Chromate passivated zinc coatings contain hexavalent chromium which
may irritate the skin and cause ulcers on the skin. Cotton, nylon or rubber hand
gloves may be used to prevent skin ulceration while handling chromated  zinc coated
parts. This will also prevent finger print corrosion on zinc coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  This standard
includes
the whole range of iron and steel products as
basis metals. Designers are advised, however, that all forms of iron and
steel are not equally readily
electroplated.
Many castings can be satis-
factorily plated but are apt to be more difficult than forgings. Acid zinc
plating baths or neutral chloride baths are available commercially to plate
satisfactorily the carbo-nitrided
steel castings and other difficult-to-plate
iron and steel substrates. Conventional cyanide and low cyanide baths may
also be used with adequate precleaning steps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5.1 Attention
is also drawn to the effects of the contour of the article
to be plated. In general, the requirements
for minimum
thickness
apply
only to those portions of the article which can be described
as stgnificant
surfaces.
It helps to reduce process costs if the designer of an electroplated
part consults

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result ~of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accor-
dance with IS  :  2-1960t. The number of significant places retained
in the
rounded
off value should be  the  same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose of this standard; the following definitions shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Surface -
The part
of the surfaces on which the electroplater
has to
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Sign&ant
Sorface -
Significant s&aces are those surfaces,
normally
visible, which are essential to the appearance or serviceability
of the article
when assembled-in normal position, or whichmay
be the source of corro-
sion products
that deface visible surfaces on the assembled article and are
subject td wear or corrosion or both, or surfaces on which the coating
is
otherwise
functionally
necessary. This applies also to surfaces visible by
reflection<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -  The  significant  surfacemay be generally de&d
as that part of the
visible surface which can be touched with a ball of diameter 20 mm or a diameter
agreed upon by the manufacturer and the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  2 -The
designatiob of significant surface shall be agreed upon by the
manufacturer and the purchaser and may be indicated in the drawings.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Non-significant
Surfaces -
Surfaces
such as holes. recesses, bases of
angles and similar areas where a controlled
deposit
ordinarily
cannot

Local Thickness -
This is defined as the lowest value of the
coatipg thickness at any point on the significant surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5  Minimum  Average Thickness -
This is the average of thicknesses
at a

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
In any  particular environment, the protective value of a zinc coating is
directly proportional
to its mass per unit area. Therefore, a coating of 40 pm mini-
mum thickness and  60  pm average thickness may also be used for special purposes.
When very long service life is required, for example, on structural steel components,
the thicker zinc coatings required are usually applied by hot-dip galvanizing or by
zinc spraying.
NOTE 2 - Barrel-plated
items like screws, nuts, bolts, etc, are usually plated
according to classification Fe/Zn 5 and FelZn 7.5. Tolerances and inspectionproce-
dure shall be as agreed mutually.
