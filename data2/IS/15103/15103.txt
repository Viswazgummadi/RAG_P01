<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Wrought
Steel Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Metallurgical Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These steels find applications in those structural parts which are prone to fire and are subjected to fluctuation of
stresses. Fire resistant properties are obtained by the incorporation of low proportions of alloying elements such
as chromium and molybdenum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS  2:
1960 ‘Rules  for rounding off numerical values (  revised)’.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

strips, sections and flats, bend
tests shall be carried out on rectangular test sample,
which, as far as possible, should be of the till thickness

<<PARAGRAPH>>One tensile test shall be carried out from finished steel
for every heat or 100 tonnes whichever is less, rolled
continuously from each cast and for every class of
product. When more than one diameter or thickness
of the bar is specified, one additional tensile test shall
be made for each diameter or thickness of the bar
ordered, if so desired, by the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7 Before test sample are detached, full particulars

accordance with 1S 1608.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.8 Test samples shall be cut in such a manner that
the deformation

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.1 As a rule, test pieces with a proportional gauge
length complying with the requirements L.O= 5.65 ~0
should be used for the tensile test, where LOis the
gauge length and SOis the cross sectional area of the
test piece.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.9 Test samples shall not be subjected to heat treatment
unless the material from which they are cut is similarly
treated, inwhich case the test samples shall be similarly

testing. Any slight straightening of test samples which
may be required shall be done cold.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.1.1 Test pieces with a non-proportional
gauge

sections and flats ) rolled from a cast.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.1
In case of sections, the thickness of which is
not uniform throughout the profile, the limits of sizes
given in Table 3 shall be applied according to the actual
maximum thickness of the piece selected for testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.2
Should the tensile test piece break outside
the middle half of its gauge length ( see IS 1608) and
the percentage elongation obtained is less than that
specified,
the

be
discarded
at
the
manufacturer’s option, and another test made from
the same plate, strip, section, flat or bar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
