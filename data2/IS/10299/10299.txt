SPECIFICATION
FOR
CAST IRON SADDLE PIECES FOR
SERVICE CONNECTION
FROM ASBEST6S
CEMENT PRESSURE PIPES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 30 September 1982, after the draft finalized by the Cast Iron & Mallea-
ble Cast Iron Sectional Committee had been approved by the Structural
and Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard has been prepared with a view to help both the manufac-
turers and users with regard to the various requirements of saddle pieces
for service connection from asbestos cement pressure pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 It has been felt desirable to specify
only the essential dimensions
required for proper functioning and interchangeability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Connection to consumers from asbestos cement water mains can easily
and quickly be provided by means of a cast iron saddle piece assembly on
the pipe.
Each assembly consists of two cast iron straps, two
rubber
gaskets and two bolts and nuts.
The top strap with the boss is called
saddle and the lower one is called strap.
The boss of the saddle is drilled
and tapped to the required size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded- off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers the requirements
for cast iron saddle piece for
service
connection
from asbestos cement pressure pipes conforming
to
IS  :  1592-19707.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2. SUPPLY OF MATERIAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The genera1 requirements
relating to the supply of saddle piece shall be
as laid down in IS  :  1387-1967*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. MANUFACTURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The metal used for the manufacture
of saddle and the strap shall be of
quality not less than that specified in IS  :  210-1978t Grade FG 150.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Both the cast iron parts of saddle piece, that is saddle and the strap shall
be stripped with all precautions
necessary to avoid warping or shrinking
defects.
They shall be free from defects, other than any unavoidable surface
imperfections which results from the method of manufacture
and which do
not affect the use of saddle pieces.
By agreement between the purchaser
and the manufacturer,
minor defects may be rectified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 The cast iron parts shall be such that they could be cut, drilled or
machined.
In case of any dispute, the castings may be accepted provided
the hardness measured on the external unmachined surface does not exceed
215  HB.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  MECHANICAL TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.0 Mechanical
tests shall be carried out during manufacture
and at the
most twice per day of castings. The results obtained are taken to represent
all the saddle pieces of all sizes made during the day.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Tensile Test -  Two tensile tests shall be made on bars cast from the
same metal in accordance with the method specified in Appendix A.
The
results of the tests shall show a minimum
tensile strength
of 150 MPa
( 15 kgf/mm2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Brine11 Hardness Tests
in 3.3,
-For
checking
the Brine11 hardness specified
Brine11 hardness tests shall be carried out on the test bars used for
the tests in  4 1.  The test shall be carried out by applying either a load of
3 000 kg to a ball of 10 mm diameter for 15 seconds, or a load of 750 kg to
a ball of 5 mm diameter for 10 seconds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3  Retest -  If any test piece representing a lot fails to pass the test in the
first instance, two additional tests shall be made on test pieces made from
the same metal used from the same lot.
Should either of these additional
test pieces fail to pass the test, the lot shall be deemed as not complying
with the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
