<<PARAGRAPH>>Water-Proofing and Damp-proofing Sectional Committee, CED 41<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Water-proofing and Damp-proofing Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen felts may be of different types depending upon the raw material used and their
construction. IS 1322 : 1993 ‘Specification for bitumen felts for water-proofing and damp-proofing
(  fourth revision  )’ and IS 1793 : 1993 ‘Specification for glass fibre base coal tar pitch and bitumen
felts (  first revision  )’, covers bitumen felts of hessian based and glass fibre base respectively. The
above standards require amongst other requirements, detailed testing of each of these products.
Various methods of test relating to each product for determination of physical properties have
been included in the separate standards. All types of felts have to satisfy some common essential
physical requirements for which methods of test are same. A series of standards covering methods
of test have therefore been formulated to cover the determination of various physical requirements
of bitumen felt. This standard covers pliability test. Other parts of this standard are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1
Breaking strength test
Part 3
Storage sticking test
Part 4
Pressure head test
Part 5
Heat resistance test
Part 6
Water absorption test
Part 7
Determination of binder content<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (August 1999). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>PART 2
PLIABILITY TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>depending upon the type of felt as specified, in
the relevant Indian Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 2) covers method for the
determination of pliability of bitumen based
felts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Preparation of Sample<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 REFERENCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ten test pieces, 25 mm wide and at least
250 mm long shall be cut from each of the
samples, five in longitudinal direction and five
in the transverse direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The
Indian
Standard
IS 4911 : 1986
‘Glossary of terms relating to bituminous
water-proofing and damp-proofing of buildings’,
is necessary adjunct to this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Conditioning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test pieces in each direction shall be
conditioned for 3 hours at the required
temperature and immediately tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.0  For the purpose of this standard, the
definitions given in IS 4911 : 1986, in addition
to the following, shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Pliability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test pieces shall be wound round a mandrel
at a uniform speed of 25 mm/s. The strip shall
be placed on a plain surface, the loose end held
down by suitable clamp, and the mandrel then
rolled over the felt to bend it at the required
speed maintaining contact with the mandrel
surface throughout. Unrolled test piece shall be
checked for any crack and rupture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pliability of a felt is the resistance of the felt
against damage or crack on being unrolled on a
fairly smooth and flat surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  A metallic mandrel of diameter ranging
from 50.0 mm to 75.0 mm made from a piece of
pipe or bar of the correct diameter, slotted in
such a manner that one end of the felt strip can
be inserted.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 REPORTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall be reported whether the roll shows any
cracks or rupture exceeding 5 mm after
unrolling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
