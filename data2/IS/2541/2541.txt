<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Second
Revision > was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after
the draft finalized by the Building Lime and Lime Products Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lime concrete, in spite of its low strength,
may be used in several situations in construction,
such
as in well foundations
for moderately
tall buildings, under floor finishes, for filling haunches over
masonry arch work and for roof terracing work.
This standard is intended
to provide
guidance
with respect
to preparation
and use of lime concrete
on the basis of existing knowledge and
experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lime concrete is found to have many desirable properties
and advantages
for use in construction.
Properly prepared,
compacted
and laid, lime concrete is durable
under
normal
exposures.
Lime
concrete possesses considerable
resistance to sulphate attack, and can be used in foundations
and
areas in which soil contain
considerable
quantities
of soluble sulphate or where sub-soil water
table is high.
The effect of temperature
fluctuations
on the volume
change
is negligible
in lime
concrete,
compared
to that of moisture variations.
after setting and initial shrinkage.
It also undergoes negligible volume change<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In view of a comprehensive
Indian Standard being available on lime concrete for waterproofing
treatment
[ see  IS 3036 : 1980 ‘Code of practice for laying lime concrete for a waterproofed
roof
finish (first revisions )’ I, this information
has not been covered in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1965 and subsequently
revised in 1974.
Since publication
of
the first revision
of this standard, most of the referred standards have been revised and, as such
it was felt necessary to revise this standard so as to update all the references
for the convenience
of the users.

In this revision the general requirements
regarding laying of concrete have also been<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular requirement
of this standard
is complied with

with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical values ( revised )‘. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>with 50 to 75 mm slump ( see Annex B ) will be
generally
found
suitable
for uses
indicated
in 5.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6  Strength Requirement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.1  The strength of lime concrete will depend
on the class of lime type
and size of coarse
aggregate, proportion
and quality of pozzolanic
materials
used in mortar
for preparation
of
concrete.
The process of strength development
in lime concrete is slow and may extend through
years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Rate  of Hardening and Setting Time<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.1  The hardening
df lime concrete
will be
slower than that of cement concrete,
but will be
satisfactory
for most
of the normal
uses
to
which
it is put in building work, except where
early strength is required,
such as in emergency
works
or in works under very wet conditions.
In case of structural
lime concrete subject to
load, such as in foundations,
further
construc-
tion shall not be started earlier than a period
of
seven days after concrete
has been laid and
consolidated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.2 The minimum
strength
of lime concrete
of mix proportions
specified in Table
1, when
tested in accordance
with procedure
laid down
in Annexes
B and C shall be 1 N/mm2
of
compressive strength at 28 days and 0’2 N/m2 of
transverse strength at 90 days.
The compressive
strength
at 90 days
is expected
to rise to
1’2  N/mm2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.2 Setting time of concrete will deperd
upon
the class of lime used in the preparation
of
mortar
and will be variable.
Though
initial
set may occur in 2 to 3 h, where Class A lime is
used,
the final set does not usually
occur in
less than 10 to 12 h.
Placing
of concrete
and
compaction
shall be completed before thp initial
set has started after which the concrete shall not
be  disturbed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2 The concrete
shall b= laid carefully
in
position
( not thrown
from
a height ) while
fresh,
in layers
not
exceeding
150 mm
in
thickness
when
consolidated.
Care
shall be
taken
while
placing
the
concrete
so
that
segregation
of aggregate
particles and mortar
does not
take
place.
Each
layer
shall be
thoroughly
rammed
and consolidated
before
succeeding
layers
is placed. During
laying and
consolidation,
concrete
shall be kept free from
contamination
by leaves, straw,
twigs, dirt and
other
deleterious
matters.
Alternatively,
duty
plate or surface
vibrators
may be
used
for
uniform and good compaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3  Mixing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1  Lime concrete
may be hand mixed or a
small hand operated
mixer rnly be used.
For
larger quantities the use of a mechanical
mixer
would be desirable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2  Hmd
Mixing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mixing
shall be done
on a clean water tight
platform
of sufficient
size to provide
ample
mixing
area.
The platform
shall have tight
close joints so that there is no leakage of water
or mortar
through
them and the mixing tool
does not strike the joints while in operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.3 Heavy rammers shall be used and ramming
shall be continued
until a skin of mortar
covers
the surface
and completely
hides the aggregate
( iron rammers
weighiyg
4h to
5& kg and
;i;nrore
fhaa
300 cm
in area are generally
satisfactory
).
Square
rammers
are
helpful
in consolidation
of edges.
No water
shall b: added during
ramming.
Where joints
in the same layer are unavoidable,
the end of
each layer shall be sloped at an angle of 30” and
made rough
to ensure
proper
bond with new
concrete.
The surface of each completed
layer
shall be watered,
roughened
and cleaned
by
wire brushing
or
any
other
suitable
means
before
the next
layer is laid over it.
Where
vertical
joints
occur in an upper and a lower
layer, they
shall be at
least
600 mm
apart
horizontally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2.1 The
coarse
aggregate
shall
first
be
stacked
to an even surface
on the platform.
Lime mortar ( or lime-pozzolana
mortar ) in the
specified proportion
shall then be evenly spread
over the aggregate
and the whole thoroughly
mixed.
Water in just
sufficient
quantity
shall
be applied with a sprinkler, to enable the mortar
to adhere
to each piece of
aggregate.
The
mixing shall be done by turning it over and over
several times, until all the particles of aggregate
are covered
with mortar
and a concrete
of
uniform appearance
and consistency is obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3  Machine

the contents mixed well.
The required
quantity
of cement
shall then be added,
if necessary.
Mixing
shall be continued
until
there
is
a
uniform
distribution
of the
materials.
Final
adjustment
of water,
to obtain
