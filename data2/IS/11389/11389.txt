<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 30 September
198.5, after
the draft
finalized
by the Construction
Plant and Machinery
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The vibration
characteris,tics
for concrete vibrators,
immersion
type
are indicated
in IS  :  25051980*
which also recommend
the
methods
for measuring
these characteristics.
While specifying
these vibration
characteristics,
the Committee
had appreciated
that even the require-
ments
in regard
to amplitude,
frequency
and
acceleration
could
considerably
vary from case to case and, therefore,
the attempt in the
specification
had been to lay down
only the limiting
values of the
vibration
characteristics
and the physical dimensions of the vibrators
on
the basis of available technical
literature,
experience
and the manufac-
turing
practices
in the country.
A mere measurement
of amplitude,
frequency and acceleration
of vibration
may not yield a firm basis for
judging the efficiency  of  a immersion type concrete vibrator and therefore,
a direct measurement
of the range of action of vibrating
needle
and
leakage as well as endurance
test would give a more convincing
and
fairer appreciation
of its quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In this standard an attempt
has been made to arrive at a method of
test for measurement
of limiting values of the characteristics,
such as
amplitude,
frequency
and acceleration,
range
of action,
leakage and
endurance tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>04. For the purpose
of decidiog
whether a particular
requirement
of
this standard is complied with, the final value,
oberved
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test analysis, shall be rounded off in accor-
dance with IS : 2-1960t.
The number
of significant
places retained in
the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
covers the method of testing performance
of concrete
vibrators
immersion type,
in terms
of limiting
values of operational
characteristics,
like, amplitude,
frequency
and acceleration,
range of
action and leakage, and endurance
tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The requirements
of this standard
apply mostly to flexible
shafts
driven and immersion vibrators powered by different types of motors, as
well as electrically
driver motor-in-head
type vibrators
up to 90 mm size.
Pneumatic
motor-in-head
type immersion
vibrato!-s
and flexible shaft
driven or motor-in-head
type vibrators
of size larger than 90 mm are
not covered
by this standard
although
some of the provisions
of this
standard
may also apply to these types of vibrators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  For the purpose of this standard,
the definitions given in IS : 250sa
1980” shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  MATERIAL FOR TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  For conducting
range of action test, the concrete
shall be prepsred
in accordance
with the requirements
of IS  :  456 - 1978-j’.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. SIZE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The size of vibrator
shall be denoted
by nominal
outside diameter
of the vibrating
needle expressed in millimetres
and shall be in accot’~
dance with. 1.5  :  2505-1980*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. METHOD
OF TEST<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Measurement of Frequency  and Amplitude of Vibration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1 The frequency
and amplitude
shall be determined
under no load
condition
( operation
in air ) by operating
the vibrating
needle
kept
horizontally
on a piece of sponge rubber or substance of similar softness
more th tn 25 mm thick.
The flexible shaft shall also be kept horizontal
during the operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2 The measurement
of frequency
shall be carried aut with the
help of an electromagnetic
vibration
pick up or read vibr’.rtor or strabos-
cope or tachometer
or any other equally suitable instrument,
However,
tachometer
shall not be used with vibrator
whose rotation peer minute
and frequency
are not the same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3 Average
value of the frequency
of vibration
measured
shall
conform
to  6.1.1  of IS  :  2505-1980*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The amplitude
shall be measured
by combined
set of oscilloscope,
atiplittide
measuring
appxrztus
and electromagnetic
pickup,
or any
other equally suitable instrument.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>&3 At least three measurement,
top, middle and bottom, over the length
of needle should be taken. The minimum value of amplitude for vibrator
under test shall confora
to 6.1.2 of IS  :  2505 - 1980*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Measurement
of Vibration Acceleration -
The acceleration
shall be
either
measured
with the help of piezo-electric
accelerometer
or by
combined
set of oscilloscope,
amplitude
measuring
apparatus
and
electromagnetic
pickup,
or any other suitable
apparatus
or calculated
from the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A = ( 11’18 a R3 10-7 ) g<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A  = vibration
acceleration,
a = amplitude of vibration
in mm,
n * measured frequency
of vibration in cycles per minute,
and<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g  = acceleration
due to gravity expressed in m/sec2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5b4.1 In plactice
and in absence of acceleration
measuring instruments
it is easier to conipute vibration
acceleration
by substituting
the values
of amplitude of vibration
and frequency
of ihe vibrator
under test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Measurement
of Range of Action -
The concrete shall be shovelled
into a strong right circular
cylindrical
container
of cross-sectional
area
at least 50 percent
greater
than
the expected
area of action of the
‘vibrator and of depth at least 25 percent
greater than the length of the
vibrating
needle.
The vibrator
shall then be started and when it has
attained its full speed, it shall be inserted into the middle ofthe container
filled with concrete,
so that the working part of the needle is immersed.
The area of action shall be observed by operating the needle continuously
in this position for not less than two minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5J
The area of action shall be determined
by any of the following
Imethods, given under (c) shall be used only if agreed to between the
purchaser
and the supplier:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

lines
of the concrete surface with the help of photographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
By determining
the radius
of area in which the
concrete
surface is glossy as indicated by visual observation
of a sharply
defined plane surface in the immediate neighbourhood
of the
vibrating needle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.2 The area of the range of action of the vibrating needle measured
in accordance
with 5.5, in concrete
with maximum
nominal
size of
aggregate not more than 20 mm and of workability
0’74 to 0’82, com-
pacting factor shall be not less than 100 times the cross-sectional
area
of the needle. The cross-sectional
area of the needle shall be calculated
from its nominal diameter
( see IS  : 2505-1980*
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6  Leakage Test -
The vibrator
shall be operated
for one hour in
75 mm slump concrete to determine its ability to operate with the needle
submerged and to determine
if the needle is completely
sealed against
the entrance
of concrete
and water.
After one hour of operation,
the
vibrator needle shall be dis-assembled
and
examined
for presence
of
concrete
or water
inside
the vibrator
head.
The presence of either
concrete. or water on the inside
mechanism
shall be the cause for
rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7  Endurance Test -
The vibrator
shall be operated
continuously
for
20 hours with not more than two stoppages
of 15 minutes required
for
change of prime mover in a barrel of crushed stone aggregates, sand and
water simulating a concrete mix.
The minimum size of the barrel shall
be such that the cross-sectional
area is at least equal to the range of
action, the depth being at least twice the length.
The vibrator
shall be
able to complete this test without any breakdown
(see  Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
