F O R E W O R D
0.1  This Indian Standard (Part II) (Third Revision) was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 20 September 1974, after the draft
finalized by the Civil Works Measurement Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2  Measurement occupies a very important place in planning and
execution of any civil engineering work from the time of first estimates
to final completion and settlement of payments of the project. The
methods followed for measurement are not uniform, and considerable
differences exist between practices followed by one construction agency
and another and also between various Central and State Government
departments. While it is recognized that each system of measurement
has to be specifically related to the administrative and financial
organizations within the department responsible for work, a
unification of the various systems at the technical level has been
accepted as very desirable, especially as it permits a wider circle of
operation for civil engineering contractors and eliminate ambiguities
and misunderstandings arising out of inadequate understanding of
various systems followed.
0.3  Among various civil engineering items, measurement of building
had been first to be taken up for standardization and this standard
having provisions relating to all building works, was first published in
1958 and revised in 1964.
0.4  In the course of usage of this standard by various construction
agencies in the country, several clarifications and suggestions for
modifications were received and as a result of study, the Sectional
Committee responsible for this standard decided that its scope, besides
being applicable to building, should be expanded so as to cover also
method of measurement applicable to other civil engineering works
like industrial and river valley project works.
0.5  Since various trades are not related to one another, the Sectional
Committee decided that each type of trade as given in IS : 1200-1964*<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Method of measurement of building works (  first revision  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1200 (Part II) - 1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>be issued in different parts which will be helpful to the specific users in
various trades. This part covering method of measurements of concrete
works applicable to building as well as civil engineering works was,
therefore, issued as a second revision in 1968.
0.6  This part is, therefore, intended to provide comprehensive
guidance for measurement of concrete construction in wide field of
building and civil engineering works including bridges, industrial
structures, etc, taking into account in a large measure advanced
practice of concrete construction. This, third revision, has been done so
as to keep the provision as per latest practices.
0.7  This edition 4.2 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (December 1981) and
Amendment No. 2 (February 1984). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.
0.8  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a measurement, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
