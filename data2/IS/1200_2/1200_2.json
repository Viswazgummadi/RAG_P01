The\nmethods followed for measurement are not uniform, and considerable\ndifferences exist between practices followed by one construction agency\nand another and also between various Central and State Government\ndepartments. While it is recognized that each system of measurement\nhas to be specifically related to the administrative and financial\norganizations within the department responsible for work, a\nunification of the various systems at the technical level has been\naccepted as very desirable, especially as it permits a wider circle of\noperation for civil engineering contractors and eliminate ambiguities\nand misunderstandings arising out of inadequate understanding of\nvarious systems followed.\n0.3  Among various civil engineering items, measurement of building\nhad been first to be taken up for standardization and this standard\nhaving provisions relating to all building works, was first published in\n1958 and revised in 1964.\n0.4  In the course of usage of this standard by various construction\nagencies in the country, several clarifications and suggestions for\nmodifications were received and as a result of study, the Sectional\nCommittee responsible for this standard decided that its scope, besides\nbeing applicable to building, should be expanded so as to cover also\nmethod of measurement applicable to other civil engineering works\nlike industrial and river valley project works.\n0.5  Since various trades are not related to one another, the Sectional\nCommittee decided that each type of trade as given in IS : 1200-1964*",
