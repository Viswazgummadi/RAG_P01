by the Indian
Standards
Institu-
tion on 22 March
1957, on approval
by the Building

and reinforted.
is being extensively
used
in the various
multi-purpose
projects
of the Central
Government
and irri-
gation
and power development
schemes sponsored
by the States.
American
and British
practices
are being generally
followed in the execution
of these
works.
Indian
conditions
.differ in many
ways from those found
in UK
or USA.
The Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
felt it desirable
that a code of practice
which would take into consideration
the variations
obtained
under
Indian
conditions
would
be a useful
guide
td  engineers
and their
technical
assistants
incharge
of such works.
This code has been
prepared
with this object in view.
0.3 In
the
preparation
of this
standard,
valuable
assistance
has bee!\
derived
from the published
materials
of the Bureau
of Reclamation,
Ten-
nessee Valley
Authority
and the
American
Society
for Testing
and
Materials.
This assistance
is appreciatively
acknowledged.
0.4 This standard
forms one of a series of Indian

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  General -
The concrete used in dams and other structures  may vary
in  character
from mass concrete having a maximum size of aggregate from
10 cm  (  preferahly 15 cm  )  to 23 cm [ or 4 in  (  ljreferably 6 in  ) to 9 in I
and a  cement  content ranging from about 150 to 235 kg per iu m ( or 250
to 400 lb  per  cu  yd)
to  heavily reinforced concrete having a maximum
size of  aggregate  of 2 cm  (  or $  in  )  and a cement ‘content of approximately
355  kg  per cu m  (  or 600  lb per  cu  yd ).
To effect the greatest economy,
the concrete should preferably contain the maximum size aggregate  S?litdh?

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1
Determination of Surface Moisture -
In the case of fint? aggre-

the surface
moisture
shall
be determined
in accordance
with
the
method
prescribed
in Appendix
Dof *IS: 456-1957.
In the case of coarse
aggregates,
percentage
of free water
shall
be determined
by weighing
a
representative
sample,
then
surface-drying
each particle
individually
with
a clean
towel
and reweighing
the surface-dry
sample
to determine
the
amount
of water
removed.
In calculating
the
water-cement
ratio,
the
total weight
of water in the mixture
including
all free water
in the aggre-
gate but
not including
any
absorbed
moisture,
shall

However,
the consistency

and
that

surrounds
completely

tion of free water.
To this end, the mix may be adjusted

vided und$r

to provide
more  workability

Flanged
steel
pipe of adequate strength to sustain the greatest length and weight
required for the job should preferably be used.
A separate lifting
device shall bc provided for each tremic pipe with its hopper at
the upper end.
Unless the rower end of the pipe is equipped with
an approved automatic check valve, the upper end of the pipe shall
be plugged with a wadding of gunny sacking or other approved
material, before delivering the concrete to the tremie pipe through
the hoppei.
The plug of sacking or other material is forced out at
the bottom end of the pipe by filling the pipe with concrete.
It is
necessary to raise slowly the tremic in order to cause iI uniform
flow of the concrete,
but care shall be taken not to empty the
tremie SW that water enters above the concrete in the pipe.
At
all times, .after the placing of concrete is started and until all the
concrete is placed. the lower end of thcb tremip pipe shall be below
the top surface of t!le plastic concrete.
This causes the concrete
to build up from below instead of flowing out over the surface and
avoids formation of laitancc layers.
If the charge in the tremie is
lost while depositing, the tremic shall be raised above the concrete
surface, and unless sealed by a check valve it shall be re-plugged at
the top end, as at the beginning, before being refilled for depositing
concrete.

The top of the bucket shall be open.
The

The bucket shall bc filled completely and lowered slowly
to avoid backwash.
It shall not be dumped until it rests on the
surface upon which the concrete is to be deposited and when dis-
charged shall be withdrawn slowly until well above the concrete.

suitable non-staining oil, and, immediately
before concrete is placed, pre-
cautions shall be taken to see that all forms are in proper alignment and
that all form anchors and ties are thoroughly secure and tight.
Special
care shall be- taken to oil thoroughly the form strips for narrow grooves
so as to prevent swelling of the forms and consequent damage to the con-
crete prior to or during the removal
of forms.
Where forms for con-
tinuous surfaces are placed in successive units, the forms shall fit tightly
uver the completed surface so as to prevent leakage of mortar from the
concrete and to maintain
accurate
alignment of the surface.
Care shall
be taken to -see that the construction
joints formed are smooth, free from
sharp deviations, projections, or edges.
Particular attention shall be given
in setting and tightening the form, so that the construction joint surfaces
are plumb and accurately
aligned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5  Removal of i!‘wms -  Removal of forms shall never be started until
the concrete has thoroughly set and has aged to give it sufficient strength
to carry twice its own wtiight plus the live load which is likely to come
on the structure
during the course of construction.
The length of time,
the forms would remain in place, shall be decided with reference to weather
conditions, slope and position of the structure
or  structural member and
the nature and amount of dead and live loads.
55.1
In no case should forms be removed until there is assurance
that their removal is possible without chipping, spalling or defacing the
concrete surface.
Furthermore,
heavy loads shah not be permitted until
after the concrete has reached its designed strength.
All forms shall be
entirely
removed from a lift to permit inspection
before the forms for
the next lift are set.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

POOINT LOADING METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.2
Apparatus
for making
flexure
tests of concrete
should
be designed
to incorporate
the following
principles:
a) The
distance
between
supports
and
points
of load
application
should
remain
constant
for a given
apparatus;
b) The load should
be applied
normal
to the loaded
surface
of the
beam and in such a manner
as to avoid eccentricity
of loading;
c) The direction
of the reactions
shdd
be parallel
to the direction
of the applied
load at all times during
the test;
d) The load should bc aeplied
at a uniform
rate and in such a manner
IS to avtiid shock;
and
e) The ratio of distance
between
point of load application
and nearest
reaction
to the depth of the beam should be not less than one,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_44>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS :  457 - 1957<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.2.1  The directions
of loads
and reactions
may
be maintained
parallel by judicious
use of linkages,
rocker bearings,
and flexure plates.
Eccentricity
of loading can be avoided by use of spherical or roller bearings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3.  TEST
SPECIMEN<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-3.1  The test specimen
shall have a span as nearly as practicable
three
times its depth as tested.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-4.
PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-4.1
The test specimen
shall be turned on its side with respect to its
position as moulded and centred on the bearing blocks.
The load-applying
blocks shall be brought in contact with the upper surface at the third point
between
the supports.
If full contact
is not obtained
between
the speci-
men and the load-applying
blocks and the supports,
due to the surfaces
of the specimen
being out of plane, the surfaces
of the specimen
where
they are in contact
with the blocks or supports
shall be capped to meet
the requirements
given in Appendix
E of*IS: 456-1957.
The load may be
applied rapidly up to approximately
50 percent of the breaking load, after
which it shall be applied at such a rate that the increase in extreme fibre
stress does not exceed 10 kg per sq cm  (  or 150 lb per sq in ) per minute.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

MEASUREMENT
OF SPECIMENS
AFTER
TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ES.1  Measurements
to the nearest 0.25 cm ( or O-1 in  ) shall be made to
determine
the average
width
and average
depth of the specimen
at the
section
of failure.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-6. CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-6.1
If the fracture occurs within
the middle
third of the span length,
the modulus
of rupture shall be calculated
as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R
PC
=  bd’<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
P =  modulus
of rupture
in kg per sq cm  (  or pounds
per
square inch ),
R =  maximum
applied
load indicated
by the testing machine
in kg (or  lb),
c
b
=  span length
in cm ( or in  ),

in cm ( or in ), and
d =  average depth of specimen
in cm  (  or in ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
