<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after the draft finalized by the
Pesticides Residue kraljrsis Se&iional Committee had been approved by the Food and i;tgricultdre
Division CounCil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>hietalaxyl formulations are used as fungicides in agriculture. This standard will enable the food,. health
authorities armothers engag& in the field to follow uniform test procedure for the estimation of residues
of metalaxyi ih various agricultural and food commoditks;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, dtie consideration has been given to the provisions of&ev~tk~ti-of
Food Aduiteiation Act, J954  and Ruies framed thereunder and  Standtirds of Weights and Measures
(Packaged Commodities) Rult?s, 1977.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value,
observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be dohe in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
prescribes
a gas chrom-
atographic method for determination of residues of
metalaxyl [methyl N - (2 - methody - acetyl)-N-(2,6-
xylyl)-DL-aladinate] in agricultural and food com-
modities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of 0.05 ,@g (0.05 ppm) using a alkali-flame ioniza-
tion detector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gas chromatograph shall be fitted with an
alkali-flame

ml of volume). Drain the solvent to the top of the
alumina. Dissolve the residue from partitioning
in
5 ml of n-hexane by immersing the flask into the
ultrasonic bath for 3 minutes. Transfer this solution
to the column. Rinse the flask twice with 5 ml of
n-hexane and t~ransfer each portion to the column.
Rinse the flask and then the column with 100 ml of
n-hexane. Rinse the flask and then the column with
30 ml of a mixture of n-hexane and diethyl ether
(1:l). Discard both eluatcs. Elute the active in-
gredient with further~80 ml of the mixture of n-
hexane and diethyl ether (1:l). Collect the eluate
and evaporate to dryness in a rotation evoporator
