<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Pesticides Residue Analysis Sectional Committee had been approved by the Food and
Agriculture Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Captafol<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2-dicarboximide<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1  is used in
agriculture for the control of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fungal  diseases.
Assessment of its residues in food commodities is
therefore an important step in safeguarding human health.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard will enable the health authorities and others engaged in the field to follow uniform
test procedures for the estimation of captafol residues in food commodities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, due consideration has been given to the maximum limits of
dithiocarbamate residues laid under the provisions of  Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954  and
the Rules framed thereunder.
The test method is restricted to the prescribed level of residues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final
value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance, with IS 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method of extraction is common for most
food commodities and the procedure described
in 7.2 can be used for grains, straw, fruits and
vegetables, oils and nuts, as well as meat and
egg. However, for high fat substances, the
additional acetonitrile partition clean up is
required before estimation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

75 ml portions of benzene. Wash the sodium
sulphate layer with 10 ml additional benzene.
Collect the benzene extracts and evaporate off to
dryness in a vacuum rotary evaporator. No
additional clean up is required for water samples.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

products covered by an Indian Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply with the requirements of that standard under a well defined system of inspection,
testing and quality control which is devised and supervised by BIS and operated by the pro-
ducer.
Standard marked products are also continuously checked by BIS for conformity to
that standard as a further safeguard. Details of conditions under which a
icence for the use
of the Standard Mark may be granted to manufacturers or producers may be obtained from
