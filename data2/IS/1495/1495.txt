FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( First Revision ), was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 24 November 1970, after the draft finalized by the
Builders’ Hardware Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The specification for mild steel dust-bins was first issued in 1959 to
recommend suitable designs of mild
steel dust-bins
for collection
and
removal of solid refuse from offices, residences, etc.
The revision of the
standard has been issued to make improvements in the same in the light
of the comments received from users and manufacturers.
The standard
also makes reference
to the recent
Indian Standards
on materials
of
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination among the standards and practices
prevailing
in .different countries in addition to relating it to the practices
in the field
%r this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This
standard
is one of a series of Indian Standards-on
builders’
hardware.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded
offvalue
should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard lays down the requirements
regarding material,
size,
shape and dimensions, manufacture, workmanship and finish for mild steel
dust-bins.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  rcuised ).<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2. MATERIALS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 7%~  materials used for the manufacture of dust-bins shall comply with
the requirements given in Table 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. NOMINAL
CAPACITY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 The dust-bins shall be of four sizes having nominal
capacities
of
30, 60, 70 and 100 litres.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.1
The dust-bins may be made in other capacities where so agreed
to between the manufacturer and the purchaser.<<HEADING_END>>

agreed to between the manufacturer and the purchaser.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. MANUFACTURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Body -
The body shall not be made from more than two pieces so as
to avoid unnecessary joints and the seams shall be either locked and
grooved or seam-welded.
The sheets shall be carefully shaped to ensure a
close fit at the seam and the inner surface of the joint shall be smooth.
In
the case of galvanized steel sheets welded construction is not employed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1 The thickness of the black sheets and galvanized steel sheets shall
comply with the requirements given in Table 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Top Rim of the Body<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1  In the case of 30-, 60- and 70-litre bins, the top
rim of the
body shall be rolled and reinforced by a mild steel wrre of 5 mm diameter in
the case of 30-litre bin and by 6 mm diameter wire in the case of larger
bins.
The rolled edge shall cover the wire completely as shown in Fig. 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>59.2
In the case of 100~litre bin the top rim of the body shall be stiffened
with a hoop made from mild steel angle 25 x 25  x  3 mm closely fitted
round the top edge and securely attached
to the body by riveting or
welding.
There shall be at least six welds in case the hoop is welded.
The ends of the flat shall be welded and smoothly finished level with top
edge of the body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
