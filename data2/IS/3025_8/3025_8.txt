TASTE
RATING
(First
Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  scope-
Prescribes a method for taste rating of water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 This method is applicable only to water and not to waste water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Principle
-
Each panelist
( tester  )  is presented
with a list
of nine statements about the water,
ranging from very favourable to very unfavourable.
The tester selects
a statement that best expresses
his opinion.
The scored rating is the scale number of the statement selected. The panel rating is the
arithmetic mean of the scale numbers of all testers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Tasting -
Present each sample to the observer in a clean 50-ml beaker filled to the 30 ml level.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Temperature Control-
Temperature
of the samples
shall
be
such that the observers find
it
pleasant
for drinking.
Maintain
this temperature
by a water-bath.
A temperature of 15°C is recom-
mended but in any case do not allow it to exceed 27°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Reagents
- Taste and odour-free water and a 2 000 mg/l
solution
of sodium chloride
prepared
with taste and odour-free water as reference sample.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 For test efficiency,
a single
rating session may contain up to 10 samples, including the reference
samples given in 4.1. Observers should
work alone
after receiving thorough instructions
and trial or
orientation sessions followed by questions
and discussion
of procedures. Select panel members on
the basis of performance in trial sessions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Rate the samples as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) Initially taste about half of the
sample by taking
the water
into
the mouth, holding it for
several seconds, and discharging it without swallowing;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) Form an initial judgement
on the rating scale;
c) Make a second tasting the same manner ae the first;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d) Make a final- rating for the sample and record the results on the appropriate data form;
e) Rinse the mouth with taste-and odour-free water; and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>f) Rest for one minute before repeating steps (a) to (e) on the next sample.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3. Independently
randomize
sample order for each judge.
Allow
30
minutes
of rest between
repeated
rating sessions.
The observers
should
not know
the composition
or source of specific
samples.
Use the scale given in 6 for rating and record ratings as integers ranging from one to nine,
with
one  given the highest quality rating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>a)  I  would be very happy to accept this water as my everyday drinking water;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)  I  would be happy to accept this water as my everyday drinkin.g water;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c)  I am sure  that I could accept this water as my everyday drinking water;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d)  I  could accept this water 2s my everyday drinking water;
e) May be I could accept this water as my everyday drinking
water;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>f)  I do not  think I could accept this water as my everyday drinking water;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>g)  I can not  accept this water as my everyday drinking water;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>h) tcould
never drink this water: and<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7. Precautions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Make taste tests only on samples known to be safe for ingestion.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Do not use samples that may be contaminated
with
bacteria,
virus, parasites or toxic chemicals
such as arsenic, dichlorinating
agents or that derived from an unesthetic  source.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Do not make taste tests on waste water or similar untreated effluents.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Observe all sanitary and esthetic precautions with
regard to apparatus and containers containing
the sample. Practice hospital-level
sanitation of these items.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5 Make
analysis
in a laboratory.
free from interfering
background
odours.
If possible, provide
carbon-filtered
air at constant temperature and humidity
because without
such precautions
the test
measures flavour and not taste.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. Calculation
-
Calculate
the mean and standard
deviation
of all rating given to each sample.
Report the temperature at which the sample is tested.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the purpose of the test is to estimate taste acceptability,
the taste rating procedure should
be followed.
The test may be used with water samples from public
sources, in laboratory research and
consumer surveys in order to recommend standards governing mineral content in drinking water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
