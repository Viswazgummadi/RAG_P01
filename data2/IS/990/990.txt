<<HEADING level=3>>SPECIFICATION FOR

<<HEADING level=1>>( Second Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.  F O R E W O R D<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 29 January 1982, after the draft finalized by
the Cutlery Sectional Committee had been approved by the Consumer
Products and Medical Instruments Division Council.
0.2  This standard was first published in 1957, and was subsequently
revised in 1964 to cover soup spoons in place of egg spoons and to
incorporate Metric Units. In view of the experience gained through its
implementation by the industry as well as the consumers during past
years a number of suggestions were received. This second revision
incorporates manufacturing tolerances for dimensions and certain
other modifications necessary for the effective implementation of the
standard.
0.3  This standard deals with the requirements for spoons made of
stainless steel. Designs other than those covered by this standard are
also popular with certain users to suit aesthetic requirements. In such
cases, it is recommended that the spoons may be made according to the
designs of individual users but other provisions of this standard shall
apply to guide the manufacturer and the purchaser. An important
aspect of table cutlery is that the different items in a set, such as
spoons, forks and knives should match in shape and appearance. This
factor is to be borne in mind by the manufacturers when supplying
cutlery in sets.
0.4  This edition 3.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (June 1988). Side
bar indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of
the amendment.
0.5  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded-off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

manufacturing defects. All edges shall be well rounded. The handle
and the bowl shall be in proper alignment. The spoons shall be finished
smooth and polished all over.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Staining Test  — The spoon, when dipped for 16 h in each of the
following solutions, shall not show any sign of staining after removal
from each solution at the end of above period:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Ten grams of analytical grade acetic acid conforming to
IS : 695-1975* dissolved in distilled water conforming to
IS : 1070-1977† to make 100 ml, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Five grams of pure sodium chloride conforming to IS : 4408-1967‡
dissolved in distilled water to make 100 ml.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Bending Test  — The spoon shall be clamped at middle of the

equal to 2 × thickness of the handle approximately) through 180° over
the handle. There shall be no cracking or breakage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Load Test  — The spoon shall be held tightly from its handle end
and supported in the middle of the length in such a way that the

<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  — The use of the ISI Certification Mark is governed by the provisions of the
Indian Standards Institution (Certification Marks) Act and the Rules and
Regulations made thereunder. The ISI Mark on products covered by an Indian
Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced to comply with the
requirements of that standard under a well-defined system of inspection, testing and
quality control which is devised and supervised by ISI and operated by the producer.
ISI marked products are also continuously checked by ISI for conformity to that
standard as a further safeguard. Details of conditions under which a licence for the
use of the ISI Certification Mark may be granted to manufacturers or processors,
may be obtained from the Indian Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
