FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part
XXXV
) was adopted
by the Indian
Stand.trds
Institution
on 21 February
1974, after the draft finalized
by the
Soil
Eugineermg
Sectional
Commutee
had
been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establish
uniform
procedures
for the determination
of
different
characteristics
of soils and
also
for facilitating
a comparative
study of the results,
the Indian
Standards
Institution
is bringing
out the
Indian
Standards
methods
of test for soils ( IS  :  2720)
which wit1 be pub-
lished in parts.
This part ( Part
XXXV)
deals
with the measurement
of
negative
pore
water
phases,
namely,
solid,
pressure.
In partially
saturated
s$o
all the three
liquid
and
gas exist;
the liquid
phase
is usually
water
and
the gaseous
phase
usually
air.
At the interfAces: of air
and
water,
the  surfke
tension of  water
is  operative,
the interfaces
are curved,
and water exists at a pressure
loiver
than
the pressure
in the air.
When
air
pressure
is atmospheric
water
pressure
is, consequently,
less than
atmospheric,
or negative,
that
is, water
is in
a state
of tension.
This
negative
pore water pressure
tends
to hold
soil particles
together,
it thus
imparts
rigidity
and strength
to soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting
the result of a test or analysis
made
in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS : Z-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
( Part  XXXV) lays  down
the method
for  determining
the  negative
pore water pressure
in partially
saturated
soils.
in
the
range
of 0 to
For pressures
-
0.75 kg/cm2
the measurement
can be obtained
directly.
For this range
as well as for greater
negative
pressures,
measure-
ment
is possible
in soils in which air continuity
exists and themeasurement<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*R&s for rounding off numerical values (raised).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2726 (  Part XXXV ) - 1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>is achieved
indirectly
by the axis translation
technique
by artificially
increasing
pore air pressure
and ambient
pressure
until
pore
water
pressure
is in the positive
range.
The
maximum
magnitude
of the
measurement
thus possible
is limited to the air entry value of the fine
ceramic porous stone used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 For the purpose of this standard
the terminoloc;y given in IS : P809-
1972’ shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The set up of the apparatus
as shown in Fig.
1  is sufficient for both
direct measurement
of negative
pore water pressure as well as measurz-
ment of pore water pressure using the axis translation technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 For
direct
measurement
of negative
pore water pressure it is not
necessary
to apply cell pressure or air pressure.
Valves A, and C, are
thus kept closed durin, v the measurement
and the apparatus
tonne.. +i
to
them
is redendant.
For
the same reason,
the polyester
fabric
discs
(13); the coarse porous stone (12), and the top cap (6) with the air lead
are unnecessary and should be replaced by just an ordinary top cap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 For indirect measurement
of negative pore water pressure the balanc-
ing manometer
(1)
is unnecessary;
valves D, and Us can thus be left
closed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 The apparatus consists of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5  Use
of the
balancing
manometer
during
direct
measurement
of
negative
pore water pressure
enables
positive
pressure
to be maintained
in
almost
the
entire
pore
water
pressure
measuring
system.
The
zone in
which
water
is subjected
to negative
pressure
is confined
to the null
indicator
and
the
pore water
line
between
the level of mercury
in the
balancing
manometer
near valve  Da  to valve B,.
The volume
of water
in
this
zone
is susceptible
to cavitation
and
therefore
shall be kept
to a
minimum.
It is necessary,
thclefore,
to locate valve  B,  as near the cell as
possible,’ to locate
the null
indicator
as near
the cell as possible
and to
locate the balancing
manometer
as  near
the null
indicator
as possible.
It
shall be ensured
that the water
in this zone
is as thoroughly
de-aired
as
possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6 As far as possible,
the measurements
should
be made
in an environ-
ment in which
the ambient
temperature
is kept constant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Placement and Sealing of Fine Ceramic Porous Stone<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1  Ensure
that the flat surfaces of the stone have zero curvature.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2
Place stone centrally

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3
Fill
annular

that no air gets trapped
in the groove.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.4  Let epoxy resin seal set for 24 hours.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Saturation
of Fine Ceramic
Porous
Stone and De-airing of
Pore Water
Pressure
Lines -
Measurement
of negative
pore water
pressure
is not possible
unless
the fine ceramic
porous
stone
is saturated
with
de-aired
water
and
the pore pressure
lines are thoroughly
de-aired
and filled
with
de-aired
water.
The
saturation
and de-airing
process
is
thus
the
most
important
step
in
commissioning
the
apparatus.
The
process is described
below and the description
assumes
that
all valves
are
initially
closed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1
De-air
water by boiling
and
subjecting
it to vacuum.
Quantity
of water to be de-aired
should
be sufficient
to fill about
four triaxial
cells.
The
mercury
pot system
and
the screw controlled
cylinder
in X and Y
should
be filled up with
this water
( for explanation
regarding
X and
Y
(see Fig. I ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
Open
valve C, and fill the empty
cell ( no top cap assembly
and
no soil sample ) with
de-aired
water
when
the water
is still warm
from
having
been boiled.
Apply

valves  B,  and  B,  and let the water
flow through the
ceramic
stone,
the
pore

Flush
water
equivalent to about half the volume of the cell then close valves  B,  and B,.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4
Open
valves D1 and  Dz  and tilt the null indicator
so that
mercury
is out of the flow circuit and let the water flow through the
ceramic stone, the pore water line, the null indicator into the water bottle
through valve  D,.
Flush water equivalent to about half the volume of the
cell then close valves  D,  and  D,.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.5
Set pressure beyond valve  B3  in 2” equal to 5 kg/cm2, open valves
B1  and  Bs  and let the water flow through the ceramic
stone the pore
water line into the mercury pot system in Y.
Flush water equivalent
to
about half the volume of the cell then close valves  B1  and  BB.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.6
Set pressure beyond valves  D,  and  D5  in X equal to 5 kg/ems,
open valves  D,  and  D4  and with the null indicator
tilted so that mercury
is out of the flow circuit let the water flow through the ceramic
stone, the
pore water line, the null indicator
into the mercury
pot system  in X.
Flush
water
equivalent
to about
half the volume
of the cell then close
valves  D1  and  D,.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.7
Open valves  B,  and  B, ( see  Note ), reduce pressure in cell to zero,
empty the cell of water, let water seep slowly from burette through valves
Bs and  B1  to  ceramic stone.
The surface of ceramic
stone should always
have water standing
on  it.
The
burette
should always have
de-aired
water in it at an elevation little higher than that of the ceramic stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  At this stage  by  measuring flow of water per unit time into the burette, and
by  knowing the cell pressure,  the cross-section  area  and the thickness of the ceramic
stone, the pbrmeability of the ceramic stone should be determined.
If the permeability
so determined is markedly higher than that specified by the manufacturer
it may be on
account
of a leak in the araldite
seal.
The leak should be plugged and the seal
perfected before proceeding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Raise
air pressure in increments
of O-5 kg/cm2 reducing
the
increment to O* 1 kg/cm”- as the air pressure approaches
thz expected air

Let each successive value of the air
pressure act on the ceramic stone for half an hour and before applying the

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.5
The
reading
in the burette
will remain
constant
for
all
air
pressures less than the air entry value of the ceramic stone unless the epoxy
resin seal has a leak ( see Note ).
When the air pressure equals the air
entry value
of the ceramic
stone air will enter the stone and push the
water in the pore water line into the burette raising the level of the water
in the burette.
The pressure at Which one observes the level of the water
in the burette rising is thus the air entry value of the ceramic stone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
If the measured
air entry
value as given in 4.3 is very much
lower
than
that
specified
by the manufacturer
it may be on account
of a leak in the epoxy

seal.
The leak should
be plugged
and the seal perfected
before
proceeding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.6
During determination
of the air entry value of the ceramic stone,
air enters the ceramic
stone and the pore water lines.
The system has
therefore
to be saturated
and de-aired
again as indicated
in 4.2 before
using it for measuring negative pore water pressure in soil samples.
NOTE -The

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6
Wipe off excess water on the top of the ceramic

Observe
the
reading
of the water level in the burette.
Put a pinch
of wet soil ( same
soil as in soil sample whose negative
pore water
pressure
is to be measur-
ed ) on top of ceramic
stone
and spread
it on top of ceramic

immediately
place
soil sample
on ceramic

assists in proper seating of soil sample

The cell pressure and pore air pressure applied should bc of equal
magni-

In a soil in which

<<PARAGRAPH>>same magnitude.
Hold each applied
increment
of cell pressure
and pore
air pressure long enough
to ascertain
whether
soil is sucking
water from
burette
or not.
Once
the cell pressure
and pore air pressure
are raised
sufficiently
to have neutralized
the negative pressure in the pore water of the
soil sample,
water will be seen to rise in burette.
When
this is observed
to occur,
close valve  Bl  and record
the level of the water
in the burette.
The di.fference
in this reading
and the initial
reading
( as in 7.6 ) in the
burette
represents
the water absorbed
by the soil in the process
of setting
up the sample.
The negative
pore water pressure of the sample
as set up
is thus different
from
that
of the sample
prior
to being
set up,
This
deviation
is reduced
by minimizing
the water
absorbed
by
the
sample
during set up as noted in 7.7,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.10
With
valve  B,  closed the positive
pore water
pressure
produced
in
the sample will tend to push mercury
down from
the null position
in the,*”
null indicator.
This is to be prevented
and null position
maintained
by w
increasing
pressure
in X.
The
null position
should
be maintained
until
equilibrium
is achieved.
During
the process
of achieving
equilibrium
it
may be. necessary
to further
increase
the cell pressure
and the pore
air
pressure,
so as to keep the pore water pressure in the positive range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.11
The
absolute
value
of the negative
pore
water
pressure
in the soil
sample is equal to the applied
pore air pressure
minus
the measured
posi-
tive pore water pressure
at equilibrium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.12
Having
determined
the
negative
pore
water
pressure
in the soil
sample
as in 7.11
it is necessary
to check
that air continuity
did indeed
exist in the soil sample.
This is accomplished
by once again increasing
the
cell pressure
and the pore air pressure
by the same
amount
and observing
the increase
in pore water
pressure
as null
condition
is maintained.
If
the pore water pressure
increases
by an amount
equal
to  the increase
in
cell pressure
and air pressure,
then air continuity
exists and the determina-
tion of negative
pore water pressure
in 7.11 is valid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.13
Close valve  D,,  partially
open valve  Bl,  reduce cell pressure and pore
air pressure
to zero, drain watrr from cell, close valve C,, A, and A,, and
d&assemble
cell
and
soil
sample.
Open
valve  B1  completely
and let
water
flow from
burette
to  top of ceramic
stone,
Clean

Equipment
is now
ready
for the next
measurement,
unless there
is an
indica.tion
to suggest that air has come

in the pore water
line; if so, the system should first be again de-aired
as given in 4.2
