<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
Geological Investigation and Sub-surface Exploration Sectional Committee had been approved by the
River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ground water is of vital importance to the civil engineers not only as a source of water supply but as a
controlling factor in all drainage operations, foundation excavations, reservoir storage, etc. Despite this
importance,
ground water is the most neglected aspect in civil engineering constructions
especially
hydraulic structures. If the ground water data are not considered properly or if these are not obtained
with due care and caution, it may lead to damage or even failure of thehydrological
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final
value, observed or calculated expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

It will create appreciable pore pressure and
thereby reducing the shear strength of the

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thisstandard deals with various aspects which have
to be considered while carrying out ground water
investigation for hydraulic structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These cfrects lead to the conclusion
that slides
normally occour in wet weather and the drainage
system offers an effective remedy for preventing
landslides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian standard 693.5  :  1973 ‘Method for dcter-
minationofwater
level in a bore hole’ is a necessary
adjunct to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 GEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 ENGINEERING CONSIDERATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The geological aspects as given in 4.2 to 4.6
should be considered for carrying out systematic
investigation for ground water at the site of any
hydraulic structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Dam Foundations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to excavation
of the foundation
hydraulic
structure,
it is essential
to
of any
have a
knowledge of the ground water distribution in the
area. When the water table is higher than the
recommended
depths of cut-off/foundation,
espe-
cially when thick pervious unconsolidated
strata
like sand and gravel is present, the problem of
dewateringduringexcavationshould
bcanticipated
in advance. The possibilities of presence of artesian
water should also be studied by observing the water
table and the geological data and suitable measures
for depressing the water table should be thought of
prior to taking up foundation excavation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Influence  of the Nature of  Rock<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1
Rocks seldom show the same water bearing
qualities in different regions. The two most impor-
tant properties which make a rockmass an aquifer
of any importance are porosity and permeability.
Ground
water
occurs
in consolidated
rock
materials (hard rock) and in loose unconsolidated
materials
(soft rock). Any type of rock that is
sedimentary, igneous or mctamporphic,
whether
consolidated
or unconsolidated,
may form an
aquifer if it is sufficiently porous and permeable.
Based on these factors of porosity and permeability,
the water bearing properties of the more common
rock groups arc discussed in 4.2.1.1 to 4.2.1.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Reservoir<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1  Competency of Reservoir<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The position of the water table in the proposed
reservoir area should be thoroughly established, as
well as the fluctuation it undcrgocs during the year.
Such studies will indicate the possibility of seepage
from the reservoir and provide a sound basis for
calculations to be made for arriving at the inventory
of the reservoir and its vicinity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>4.2.1.1
Sedimentary rocks

Since these materials
are both porous and pervious they may act
as most ideal-water bearing strata.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>clrl}Js nnd Sl1nles - As a general rule, these
do not contain any ground water. Hard
shales may yield water at joints.
Sandstones -
These sedimentary
rocks
show great variation in their water yielding
capacity which is chiefly controlled by the
texture and nature of ccmcnting materials.
Coarse graincd sandstones with impcrfcct
cementing
material
may prove excellent
aquifers while fine graincd varieties which
are thoroughly cemented may yield a poor
quantity of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2  Stability ofReservoir Rim<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Occurrence
of landslides in reservoir arcas is a
common phenomenon.
In a reservoir arca of high
relief
with adversely
oriented
joints/bedding
planes, landslides may occur.
The
process may
accelerate if the drawdown is sudden. The prcscnce
ofground water has three main effects:
a)
It wili increase the effective weight of the
material that it saturates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_4>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 14330  :  1996<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Limestones -  These rocks also show great
variation in their water yielding capacity. If
the rock is having solution channels, cavities
and crevices, etc, it may be a good aquifer.
When such openings are absent it  may  prove
to contain very little water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.2 &neous rocks<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acid Volcanic Roth -  These rocks may or
may not prove to be successful wa ter bearing
strata because acidic lava is comparatively
viscous and generally fragmentary at the
time of eruption. Interstices will normally
be common in such lava and hence the pos-
sibility of their retaining water, however
these interstices may subsequently get filled
with ash or other materials and hence the
uncertainty
of these rockmasses
being
aquifers.
Basic Volcanic Rocks -
These rocks are
characterized by high mobility at the time of
eruption and hence they flow to a great dis-
tance. They may thus form thick sheets rich
in cavities (occurring due to escape of gases
from cooling lava) and cracks (due to con-
traction) and hence may be sulXcicntly per-
meable to be water bearing strata.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3.2
The ultimate permeability of a rockmass is
the outcome of the combination of the factors given
in 4.2.3.1 which most obviously cannot, and do not,
fall strictly under any thumb rule generalization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3
Influence of Geolpgical Structures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1
Underground
conditions afccting
ground
water differ from the ideal case not only because of
the wide variety of materials in contact with the
water but also because of the way in which the
various rock strata are arranged in general and in
relation to one another. The disposition of the
pervious and impervious strata below the surface
and its influenceon ground water table is illustrated
in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.3
Metanzorpkic rocks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rocks like schist, slate and even gneiss which
are often foliated and highly fractured may prove
exceptionally
good aquifers.
But marble and
quar_tzite are normally almost impermeable, except
along
original
beddings.
Where
folding
is
pronounced, quartzite is usually jointed in nature,
at these locations quartzite may prove to bc water
bearing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4
Quality of Ground Water<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  quality of ground water is a matter of vital
importance
as the water is used for industrial,
domestic and/or construction
purposes. Ground
water will almost certainly contain dissolved solids
and gases. Most ground
water
contains
no
suspended matter and practi~cally no bacteria. The
main gaseous impurities are methane, hydrogen
bisulphide, carbon.dioxide, etc. It should be kept in
mind that severe corrosion
is observed in steel
pipelines due to presence of free carbon dioxide.
Pure water will dissolve only 20 ppm (parts per
million) of calcium carbonate and 20 ppm of mag-
nesium carbonate,
but water containing carbon
dioxide will dissolve many hundreds of parts per
million of the solid. The
dissolved
carbonates
impart temporary hardness to the water while the
dissolved sulphatcs
cause permanent
hardness
which cannot be removed by simple chemical pro-
cedures. Chemical analysis is necessary to deter-
mine the degree of hardness of the water, and if this
exceeds about 200 ppm of calcium carbonate the
water rcquircs softening. The presence of high con-
centrations of calcium and magnesium sulphatcs in
ground water can cause serious trouble with concrete
work in contact with the ground. This can, howcvcr,
be solved by use of sulphate resisting cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

By using measurcmcnts
of ground

the levels at which springs occur, it is possible to
make contour maps of the water tablcwhich would
give an idea about the depth below which ground
water is stored and the direction
in which it is
moving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5
Ground Water Survey<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.51
Ground water survey for hydraulic struc-
turcs should always be associated with geological
information of the dam vicinity and rcscrvoir arca.
This information should include regional and local
geological maps and cross sections, lithological
characteristics of the rocks, structural fcaturcs, well
inventory, etc. The ground water survey should be
carried out by sub-surface cxploralion by means of
drilling, geophysical survey, well inventory, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2
In well inventory, the information on exist-
ing wells is gathered. The information on location,
depth and diamctcr of well, depth to water table,
aeount of water pumped, type and nature of rocks
the wells have penetrated through, yualityofwater,
etc, are collcctcd.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.5
Reduced water level map prepared on the
basis of well inventory, in the rcscrvoir and vicinity
area, will be helpful in establishment of the influent
or effluent nature of the stream across which the
structure is proposed. If the ground water level
contours are decreasing beyond the periphery of
the reservoir, there are chances of losing wa tcr from
the reservoir after impounding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.3
Information obtainable from the drill holes
may be two fold, that is for the overburden as well
as for the rock underneath. Overburden may con-
sist of soil, clay, sand, gravel, boulders, glaciated
materials,
etc, whereas
rock may be igneous,
metamorphic, sedimentary or a combination therc-
of. Depth to wcathcring, jointed and /or sheared/
faulted zones could also be present. In drill holes
water level measurements
should be made in ac-
cordance with IS 6935  :  1973.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

above the critical water lcvcl (WZ in the figure) and
the broken

that leakage will occur from valley_4 to valley  B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

After
impounding
of the reservoir
the
groundwater table in the area around the reservoir
rises due to artifical recharge. A similar condition
also occurs in the command area of the dam due to
water flow in the canals. This phenomenon creates
the problem of water logging whereby all vegeta-
tion including crops are badly affected due to decay
of the roots.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1
Construction of a dam and subsequent im-
pounding of water behind it causes interference
with natural conditions. Adifference is set up in the
level of the water table corresponding to the height
of the dam between the two sides of the dam. As a
consequence, there will be a tendency for the im-
pounded
water to find some means of escape
through any weakness that may exist in the struc-
ture of the ground. In order to assess this behaviour,
a study of~the ground water, its position and move-
ment in the area adjoining the reservoir site is of
primary importance. This will detcrminc how the
filling of the reservoir will affect these factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fig. 3 DIAGRAM Z&OWING RELATION OF RESER-
VOIR LEVEL TO HIGI-I WATER TABLE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.2.2
Springs in the reservoir site arc favourable
indication of a water table sloping
towards the
valley. If they are large, attention should be given
to their discharge pressure: for, if~it is insufficient
to raise thewatcr to the reservoir Icvel, the flow may
be revcrscd when the reservoir is filled. But since
this head is not directly measurable, it should be
determined indirectly from the level of the water
table in the surrounding area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Reservoirs Arem with Deep ~Water Table<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.2.1
After impounding
of the reservoir, the
water soaks into the ground until it meets the water
table, and consequently
changes the grade of the
water table. If the surface of the reservoir is below
the ground water divide, there will be no loss by
seepage and the ground water will flow into the
reservoir (see Fig. 3). In addition, there will be
under ground water storage between the old and
the new position of the water table. The volume of
this newly saturated ground water will depend on
the level of the reservoir and the slope of the
original water table. If the ground water divide is
lower than the reservoir flow line, the ground water
forms an under ground spillway with possible
leakage on the opposite side of the ridge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
