DETERMINATION
OF RESIDUE ON SLAKING

<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part III ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 22 March
1973, after the draft finalized by the Building
Limes
Sectional
Committee
had tieen approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Hitherto,
methods
of tests for assessing
qualitative
requirements
of
building
limes were included
in IS : 712-1964.
For facilitating
the use of
these tests it has been decided to print these tests as different parts of a separate
Indian
Standard.
This part covers determination
of residue on slaking of
quicklime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In reporting
the results of a test .or analysis made in accordance
with this
standard,
if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it
shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
( Part III ) covers the method of test for determination
of
residue
on slaking
of quicklime
including isothermal
slaking of the sample.<<HEADING_END>>

( see IS  :  1070-1960$

<<HEADING level=3>>2.3 Isothermal Slaking of Sample and Preparation of Putty<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1  The sample of quicklime shall be sieved through 2.36~mm IS Sieve
( conforming to IS  :  460-1962*
) and the residue, if any, shall be broken in
a manner so as to avoid undue production of fines and again sieved through
2.36~mm IS Sieve until the whole quantity passes through
that
sieve.
This sample of lime shall be slaked isothermally by immersing in hot water
maintained
at a substantially uniform temperature
during
the actual
slaking process in
accordance
with method specified in 2.3.1.1.
The
quantity of water required for slaking shall be equal to 4 times the mass of
quicklime for the majority of limes.
However, with certain high calcium
limes of high volume yield it may be found necessary to use 8 times the mass
of the lime in order to obtain a product which could be conveniently
handled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1.1
When a slaking temperature has been speci6ed by the vendor,
place a sufficient quantity of water as specified in 2.3.1
in a large clean
metal
vessel ( for example,
a large circular bin approximately
45 cm
in diameter and 50 cm deep ) equipped with a thermometer, reading to 1°C
and with means for heating.
Adjust the temperature of water to within
+2“C of the specified temperature, add 5 kg of the crushed quicklime sample
m small quantities at a time, and then stir constantly and thoroughly at
such a rate that not less than 5 minutes are required to introduce the whole
quantity.
During this process and a total period of 1 hour, control the
temperature
of the mixture to within f2”C
of the specified isothermal
temperature by the addition of cold water or by the application of heat.
Spray through a rose, whilst stirring rapidly, any such additional water
so as to avoid excessive local chilling of the mixture.
Allow the product
to stand for 24 hours from the time the quicklime was added to water and
allow to cool’gradually to room temperature during this period. Thoroughly
stir it with a wooden stirrer at least twice during this period.
The last
stirring irhal.l, however, be done within one hour before the expiration of the
24 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where a slaking temperature has not been specified by 6e vendor,
carry out slaking on two separate quantities, each of 5 kg of crushed quick-
lime, but with the temperature of water adjusted to and maintained at
50°C in one case and 100 f 2°C in the other case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  Procedure -
The product obtained after slaking on expir y of 24 hours
shall be used.
Sieve first the supernatant liquid and then the remainder
after stirring thoroughly with a wooden stirrer through 850-micron
IS Sieve
and then through 300micron
IS Sieve into a vessel similar to that used for
the slaking.
Fit the vessel with a  temporary  filter cloth such as a rectangular
sheet of close woven unbleached calico of size about 1.0 x 1.5 m which has
been previously washed free from dressing.
Take special care to see that the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>contents of the slaking vessel are completely transferred on to the sieves by
washing out the slaking vessel with a jet of water.
Wash the residues on both
the sieves with a moderate jet of water from a flexible tube, the whole opera-
tion taking not more than 30 minutes.
The residue shall not be rubbed
through the sieves. Dry the residue at 100 f 10 “C to constant mass. Weigh
separately the residue on each of the sieves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5  Report of Test Results -
The residues on the respective sieves shall
be reported as the percentage of mass of quicklime taken for the test.<<HEADING_END>>
