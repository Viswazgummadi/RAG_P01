<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 4) was adopted by the
Earthquake Engineering Sectional Committee had
Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hinlalayan-Naga Lushai region, Indo-Gangetic Plain, Western Indi%Kutch and Kathiawar regions are geologically
unstable parts of the country where some devastating earthquakes of the world have occurred.
A major part of
the peninsular India has also been visited by strong earthquakes, but these were relatively few in number occurring
at much larger time intervals at any site, and had considerably lesser intensity. The earthquake resistant-design
of structures, taking into account seismic data from studies of these Indian earthquakes, has become very essential,
particularly in view of heavy construction programme at present all over the country. It is to serve this purpose
that IS 1893 : 1962 ‘Recommendations
for earthquake resistant design of structures’
was published
and
subsequently revised in 1966, 1970, 1975 and 1984.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>in view of the present state of knowledge and in order to update this standard, the committee has decided to
cover the provisions for different types of structures in separate parts.
This standard has been split into five
parts. Other parts in this series are :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1 General provisions and buildings<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pafl.2 Liquid retaining tanks-elevated and ground supported<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part”3 Bridges and retaining walls<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 5 Dams and embankments<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part I contains provisions that are general in nature and applicable to a[l types of structures.
Also, it contains
provisions that are specific to buildings only. Unless stated otherwise, the provisions in Part 2 to Part 5 shall be
read necessarily in conjunction with Part 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard contains provisions on earthquake resistant design of industrial structures including stack-like
structures. Industrial structures are covered in Section 1 and Stack-like structures are covered in Section 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All sub-clauses under the main clause 0.0 of 1S 1893 (Part 1) are also applicable to this part except the 0.4.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard considerable assistance has been provided by BHEL, IIT Roorkee, IIT Bombay,
[IT Kanpur, NTPC, EIL, TCE, DCE, NPC and various other organizations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be -rounded off in accordance with
IS 2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised)’.
The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3
Thedesign
approach adopted in this standard
is to ensure that structures possess minimum strength
to withstand minor earthquakes (< DBE) which occur
frequently,
without
damage;
resist
moderate
earthquakes
(DBE) without
significant
structural
damage though
some non-structural
damage may
occur; and withstand
a major earthquake
(MCE)
without
collapse.
Actual
forces
that appear
on
structures during earthquakes are much greater than
the design forces specified in this standard. However,
clucti[ity, arising from inelastic material behaviour and
detailing, and overstrength, arising from the additional
reserve strength in structures over and above the design
strength, are relied upon to account for this difference
in actual and design lateral loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SECTION 1 INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 DESIGN CRITERIA<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Categorization
of Structures<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To perform well in an earthquake,
the industrial
structure should possess adequate strength, stiffness,
and ductility.
Generally
structures
have
large
capacities of energy absorption in its inelastic region.
Structures which are detailed
as per IS 13920 or
SP 6 (6) and equipment which are made of ductile
materials~art withstand earthquakes many fold higher
than the design spectra without collapse; and damage
in such cases is restricted to cracking only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reinforced and prestressed concrete members shall be
suitably designed to ensure that premature failure due
to shear or bond does not occur,
subject
to the
provisions of IS 456 and IS 1343.
Provisions for
appropriate
ductile detailing of reinforced concrete
members are given in 1S 13920.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Structures
are classified
into the following
four
categories:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>the

The mass ratio in Fig. 1 is the modal mass ratio

the ratio of uncoupled

secondary and primary systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 Time Period Estimation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The time period of different industrial structures would
vary considerably depending on the type of soil, span
and height of the structure, distribution of load in the
structure and the type of structure (concrete, steel and
aluminum).
It would be difllcult to give one or two
generalized
formulae to cover all such structures.
Accordingly, no simple guidelines can “be given for
estimation of time periods of industrial structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.2.10
For a secondary system dominant mode and
the primary system mode i, the modal mass ratio can
be estimated by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3.2 For preliminary design, the time period can be
established based on its static deflection under mass
proportional
loading in each of the three principal
directions. This load is applied by applying a force
equal to the weight of the structure or equipment at
each mode in X, Y or Z direction. Where the founding
soil is soft soil, the effect
of the same shall be
considered in the estimates for static deflection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

E,.A.g<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The damping factor to be used in determining S./g
depends upon the material and type of construction of
the structure
and the strain

damping factors are recommended
as guidance for
different materials for fixed base condition and are

by Rayleigh’s

<<PARAGRAPH>>The dynamic analysis using response spectrum method
should
be carried
out for important
stack-like
structures.
The number of mode to be considered in
the analysis should be such that about 90 percent of
modal mass is excited.
The modes could then be
combined by modal combination
of corresponding
respcmse like shear, moment, etc, as suggested in
IS 1893 (Part 1). The detailed dynamic analysis using
time history shall be required where analysis is based
on site-specific response spectrum and compatible time
history of ground motion. For combination of three-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mathematical model of stack-like structures should
be able to represent sufficiently the variation in its
stiffness (variation in cross-section and thickness of
shell), lining mass and foundation .modelling (that -is
foundation stiffness, soil deformations).
The number
of elements shot.dd be such as to capture the variation
of stiffness and mass of the system. A minimum of
ten beam elements should in general be sufficient. For
axi-symmetric structures axi-symmetric finite elements
shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
