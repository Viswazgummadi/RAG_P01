<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen Tar and Their Products Sectional Committee, PCD 6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by
the Bitumen Tar and Their Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Petroleum, Coal and Related
Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was published in 1983, which was largely based on UOP 46-64. Since the present method is having
the following disadvantages the Committee decided to revise the standard to align the same with DIN 52015:1980
‘Determination of paraffin wax content in bitumen’ in order to over come the disadvantages:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The method is not specific to ‘Paraffin wax content’ only but specifies the wax content which includes wax
and micro-crystalline wax,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The method does not mention the purity of ‘fullers earth’,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) There is no mention of ‘Reproducibility’ in the method,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Fullers earth having the particle size within the range 10-35 p, is not available indigenously,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) There is no mention about the availability of fullers earth,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) The sieves required to check the particle size of fullers earth are not available indigenously, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) The wax content value varies with the quality of fullers earth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value, observed or
calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values  (revised)’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

through, disconnect the filter assembly with vacuum
pump, lift off the filter using the pincers and place it in
the funnel situated over the evaporating dish, which
has been previously weighed to-the nearest 0.5 mg.
Dissolve ‘the crude par~ffin residue
by carefully
spraying heated petroleum spirit over it. Dissolve in
the same way any paraffin that may be adhering to the
thermometer or to the test tube. Evaporate the mixed
filtrates in the evaporating dish over the steam bath.
To prevent the liquid creeping over the rim, carry out
the evaporation in a weak air or nitrogen stream. Dry
the residue for 15+ 1 min at 125 * 5 ‘C in the heating
cabinet and then allow it to COOL As soon as the
previously purified paraffin waxes have cooled down
but have not quite solidified, add 15 ml of acetone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6 PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1
Melt the bitumen sample, pour 25 + 1g into the
distillation flask and weigh to the nearest 10 mg ( MA).
Heat the distillation flask with a 150 mm high flame,
that has just ceased to be luminous, in such a way that
the first distillate drop is produced within 3 to 5 min.
The guard ring, loosely fitted on the distillation flask,
shall prevent possible burning of the cork stopper. Take
care that the vapours produced during distillation are<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>largely
condensed.
For this purpose, the distillation
receiver, weighed to the nearest 10 mg, into which the
lower bent end of the outlet tube projects to itsfull length
(see Fig. 3), shall be immersed as far as possible into a
mixture of finely reduced ice and water. There shall,
however, still be a field of vision to allow the rate of
distillation to be checked.
Adjust this rate so that a
drop falls from the end of the outlet tube into the
distillation receiver approximately every second. When
no more drops are produced over a period of 10 s,
continue heating for a further 1 min with a completely
non-luminous flame until the flask glows red. Complete
the distillation in a maximum of 15min. Do not transfer
the condensate left in the outlet tube after distillation to
the distillation receiver. Mix the distillate thoroughly
by gently warming it whilst at the same time carefully
swirling the receiver.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6 Dissolve the paraflin waxes by gently heating and
carefully swirling the evaporation dish. Make up any
acetone lost by evaporation. Cool the acetonelparaffln
wax solution in a water bath to 15* 0.5 ‘C and separate
by filtering
the paraffin
waxes.
Then wash the
evaporating dish, the thermometer and the filter several
times with acetone brought to 15* 0.5 ‘C from a wash
bottle.
The total volume of washing liquid shall be
30  G  1ml. Dissolve the paraffin waxes purified in this
way, by carefilly spraying them with heated petroleum
spirit and collect them again in the evaporating dish
already used. Then evaporate the collected liquid in a
weak air flow or nitrogen stream over the steam bath.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 After cooling, weigh the distillate contained in the
receiver to the nearest 10 mg ( MJ.
Depending on the
expected paraffh wax content, weigh to the nearest 2
to 4 g + 5 mg (mass Mc) of the warm distillate into the
test tube (provided with spout).
If the paraflln wax
content cannot be estimated in advance, an initial mass
of approximately 3 g is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.7 Dry the crystallized paraflln waxes obtained, at
125 * 5 “C for 15 * 1 min in the heating cabinet and
after cooling inthe desiccator weigh them to the nearest
0.5 mg ( MJ.
This final mass shall be between 50 and
100 mg.
Otherwise, reject this result and repeat the
test with an appropriately changed initial mass of the
same distillate (Mc).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Dissolve the initial mass of distillate in 25 * 1 ml
of ether and add 25 * 1 ml of ethanol. Close the test
tube with a stopper fitted with a thermometer extending
down intothe liquid and place the test tube inthe cooling
bath.
Cool the bath liquid by adding finely reduced<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 If the values measured for both test portions do not
differ by more than 0.3 percent by mass, determine the
mean of the two values.
Otherwise,
carry out a
determination on a third test portion of 25 g and take
the mean of the two values being the closest together.
These values, however, shall not differ by more than
0.3 percent

If the first two values are
equidistant from the third, specify the third value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

they are considered to be acceptable and in accordance

differ by more than 1.0 percent by mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
