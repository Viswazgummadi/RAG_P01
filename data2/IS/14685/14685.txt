<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the Soil
Quality and Improvement Sectional Committee had been.approved by the Food and Agriculture Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fertility of Indian soils varies with geographical existence. Various types of Indian soils are enriched with few
major and/or minor nutrients responsible for successful crop production. Sulphur is one of them and responsible
for successful crop production.
There is no standard procedure available for determination
of sulphur and
sulphur compounds in Soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A need was, therefore, felt to formulate standard procedure for determination of sulphur and sulphur compounds
for the benefit of research organisations and those engaged in organised farming including Plantation Crops.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final value, observed or
calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (revised)’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Aliquots more than 2 ml should be reduced in volume
by evaporationoraddition of reducing agent. Also, soilswith very
high iron contentmay require the addition ofextra reducingagent.
When the reducing agent is added to the sample aliquot in the
boiling flask, the need for extra amounts may easily bejudged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard prescribes the method for determination
of total sulphur and sulphur compounds in soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Weigh 1 g of the grounded and air-dried soil into a

(see 3.2.2) and evaporate to diyness on a water bath.
Place the beaker in a muffle furnace, heat at 5000Cfor
3 h. After cooling add 5 ml of 25 percent nitric acid
(see 3.2.1)
and again
digest
the
contents
for
1 h on a water bath. Extract the soluble salts with
distilled
water and filter the solution
through
a
Whatman No. 42 or equivalent filter paper. Dilute to
a known volume and take a suitable aliquot of the
filtrate for the turbidimetric determination of sulphate.
A blank shall also be carried out with each sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Weigh 2 g soil sample into a 150 ml beaker, add 3 ml
nitric acid (see 2.2. 1), cover the beaker with a watch
glass, mix by swirling and heat on a water bath for
1 h. Remove the beaker after heating from water bath,
uncover, and add perchloric acid and phosphoric acid
mixture (see 2.2.4). Heat on a hot plate at 190” to
210“C until heavy white fumes of perchloric acid are
visible. Replace the watch glass and continue heating
for 30 minutes. Cool, uncover, add 2 ml hydrochloric
acid (see 2.2.5) and heat again until perchloric acid
fumes
are again
visibie.
Transfer
to a 100 ml
volumetric flask and make up to volume with dilute
hydrochloric
acid. The total acidity of the diluted
sample should be at least one molar. The siliceous
residue -may be removed by filtration
or allowed to
settle in the volumetric flask.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

fuge, if necessary, to separate the extract from the soil.
Take with a pipette an aliquot of the supematant liquid

<<HEADING level=3>>8.3  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Take 10 g dried soil in a gooch crucible. Add 50 ml of
1 N hydrochloric
acid (see 8.2.1) and shake well.
Transfer the contents in a porcelain crucible through
Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Wash the residue with
100 ml calcium acetate solution (see 8.2.2) followed
by distilled water alone to remove the excess calcium
acetate. Dry the crucible and contents at 105°C to
permit final calculations
made on the basis of the
original mass of soil sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2 Add 2 ml acetone and about 0.2 ml chloroform
to the 50 ml round bottom
flask containing
the
evaporate sample as described in 7.3.1. Place about
0.2 g iron powder in the flask and attach the flask to
the distillation apparatus. Sweep the apparatus free of
air by passing nitrogen for a few minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Place 10 ml sodium hydroxide solution in a 2.5 cm
diameter test tube and attach it to the side arm so that
the test tube dips below the surface. Fill the graduated
receptacle with the hydrochloric acid and run 10 ml
into the apparatus.
Apply
a low flame
with
a
microbumer and allow 10 to 15 minutes for transfer
of sulphide. Detach the glass tube from the apparatus
and leave it in the test tube. Add 10 ml of the acetone:
dithizone solution (see 7.2.5) to the test tube washing
the inside of the glass tube with it. Titrate against the
mercuric chloride to a pink end point. It is convenient
to stir the solution during titration by bubbling nitrogen
through it. Standardize the mercuric chloride solution
against standard solutions of sulphur reduced in the
same way.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pass the soil sample through a 20 mesh sieve. Weigh
and place 2.5 g soil in a suitable porcelain crucible.
Thoroughly mix 0.5 g sodium bicarbonate with the
soil, and then add an additional 0.5 g uniformly as a
surface layer. Ignite the mixture at 500”C in muffle
furnace for 3 h. Allow the sample to cool, and then
transfer
the contents
of the crucible
to a 50 ml
Erlenmeyer flask. By means of a pipette, add 25 ml
extracting solution, using the first 10 ml to rinse the
crucible and adding the rest slowly to avoid loss by
spattering.
After the reaction
subsides,
shake the
contents of the flask for 30 minutes. Filter the soil
suspension through a dry Whatrnan No. 1or equivalent
filter_paper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — One advantageof this prwedure is that wet soiIscanbe
extracted without preliminary drying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The determination
of sulphate in an aliquot of the
filterate can be carried out by turbidimetry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 DETERMINATION
OF ORGANIC SULPHUR<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The initial extraction with 1N hydrochloric acid to
remove sulphidesmay not remove certain sulp~~dcsfor example,
Cu, As, Sb, etc. Also, it may be preferable to substitute a calcium
phosphate solution for calcium acetate to ensure removal of
adsorbedsulphate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
