<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the  draft finalized by the Environmental
Protection
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by
the Chemical Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Copper is found mainly as a sulphide, oxide or carbonate
in the
minerals.
Copper
enters
the
water system through mineral dissolution,
industrial
effluents, because of its use as algicide
and
insecticide
and through corrosion
of copper
alloy
water
distribution
pipes.
It may occur
in
simple ionic form or in one of many
complexes
with
groups,
such as cyanides,
chlorides,
ammonia
or organic ligands.
The test for copper
is essential
because
dissolved
copper
salrs
even in low concentrations
are poisonous
to some biota.
Desirable
limit for copper in potable
water is 0.05 mg/l maximum which can be relaxed
in the absence of better
alternate
source
to
1.5 mg/l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard,
considerable
assistance
has
been
derived
from
American
Society for Testing and Materials,
USA (  ASTM Annunl Book Section 11, 1983 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
th results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final
value,
obcerved
or calculated,
is to
be rounded
off, it shall be done
in accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding ofI numerical
values ( revised )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

rinsing with water.
The water samples should
be collected
and stored
for 24 h preferably
in
polypropylene
or
chemically
resistant
glass
containers.
For
preservation,
the
samples
should be acidified
with
concentrated
nitric
acid
( 2 ml of AR grade
nitric
acid to
1
litre just
to bring down
the pH
below
2 ).
Unacidified
samples should be analysed on the
same day while the acidified
samples
may be
stored for a few days in a refrigerator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
prescribes
four methods
for
determination
of copper as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Neocuproine
method,
b) Atomic absorption
method
( direct ),
c) Atomic absorption
method ( chelatiori -
extraction
), and
d) Differential
pulse anodic
stripping
volt-
ammetry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 QUALITY
OF REAGENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 Tlie choice of the method
depends
upon
the
concentration
range
and interference.
When
the
concentration
levels
are below
500 g/l, pre-concentration
is carried out either
by chelation
and extraction
prior
to atomic
absorption
spectrophotometer
( AAS ) or by
depositing
as in
differential
pulse
anodic
stripping voltammetry
method.
For
dissolved
copper
content
filtertition
membrane
filter is required.

,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Iron interferes
when present
at levels
greater
than the
copper.
This
can be overcome
by
subtracting
the
anodic
peak
current
for
a
voltammogram
without
deposition
from
that
for the stripping voltammogram.
The presence
of any neighbouring
stripping
peaks
which
is
less than
100 mV from
that
of copper
will
interfere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If the

dissolved copper alone is to be determined,
the
sample
should
be filtered

For
total
recoverable
copper, digest the
sample
with 3 ml each
of
concentrated
hydrocloric
acid and nitric
acid.
Evaporate
the solution  to  15 to 20 ml.
Cool
and make up to 100 ml in a volumetric
flask.
Take 10 ml of the sample in the polarographic
cell and de-aerate
for
15 minutes.
The
cell
should be covered
with
nitrogen
gas
during
the
experiment
( Fig. 2 ).
Generate
a new

of mercury
and put
