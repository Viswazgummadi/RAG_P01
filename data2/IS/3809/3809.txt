FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 September
1979, after
the
draft
finalized
by the Fire Safety Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
stpndard
has been
prepared
with
a view
to determining
the
extent
of resistance,
in terms
of fire, which
the built-up
elements
of a
building
structure
would
offer to fire.
This standard
was first published
in 1966. The
present
revision
has been
based
on IS0
834-1975
‘  Fire
resistance
tests-elements
of building
construction
’  issued by the Inter-
national
Organization
for Standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting
the results of a test or analysis
made in accordance
with
this standard,
the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off,  it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
specifies
standard

of various
categories,
such
as walls
and partitions,
columns,
beams,
floors, roofs, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
The
list is not exhaustive.
Elements
which
fall into
none
of these
categories
may be tested by analogy with a similar element.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The test provides
for the determination
of fire resistance
of elements
of building
construction
on the basis of the length
of time for which
.  he
test specimens
of specified
dimensions,
satisfy
the
criteria
laid
down
under
the prescribed
test conditions
during
the period
of fire exposure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

a different
approach
and an attempt
shall
be made to reproduce
the boundary
conditions
and the method
of fixing
or support
representative
of that used in practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.1
A tes,t specimen
shall include
at least
one of each represent-
ative type ofjoint.
A specimen

a specimen
represents
a column
forming
the side of
an opening
in a wall,
it shall
be suitably
shielded
on the unexposed
face or faces to represent
the protection
provided
by the wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
The materials
and standard
of workmanship
of the test specimen
shall be representative
of those applying
in good
practice,
as defined
by
existing
Indian
Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3
Conditioning
-
The
test specimen
shall be conditioned
in such a
way that
it corresponds
as closely
as possible
in temperature,
moisture
content
and
mechanical
strength,
to the expected
state
of
a similar
element
in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1
Moisture Content -
The test specimen
shall not be tested
until its
moisture
content
is in dynamic
equilibrium
with an ambient
atmosphere
approximating
to that
expected
in service.
This
dynamic
equilibrium
may be checked
either
on the test specimen
itself or on a representative
sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.1
The
drying
of the
test
specimen
may
be by
natural
or
artificial
means
but a temperature
shall
not
be
reached
which
could
impair
the fire-resisting
properties
of the element.
It is recommended
that a temperature
of 60°C should not be exceeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.2
When
possible
the moisture
content
of the principal
material
of the element
shall
be measured
at the time of the test
and the values
shall be stated
in the test report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  Restraint end Loading<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.1
The role of the element
in service
shall
be analyzed
so that
the methods
adopted
for supporting
or restraining
the ends
or sides of a
test specimen
during
a test are, as far as possible,
similar
in nature
to
those
which
would
be applied
to a similar
element
in
service.
If
restraint
is applied
in the test, then
the
restraint
conditions
shall
be
specified
with
regard
to free movements
of the element
and
so far as
possible,
those
external
forces and
moments
which
are transmitted
to
the element
by restraint
during
the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.2
For floors and
beams with
uncertain
or variable
boundary
service
conditions,
the test specimen
shall be simply
supported
all round
the
edges
or at the ends.
For
columns
and
walls
with
complete
or
partial
restraint
to longitudinal
elongation,
for a full evaluation
of the
structural
behaviour,
it may be necessary
to conduct
a complementary
test under
longitudinal
restraint
conditions
which
are as close as possible
to conditions
in practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.3
At least
30 minutes
before
heating,
the load-bearing
test
specimen
shall be subjected
to a loading
which,
in the critical
regions
of
the
elemrnt,
produces
stresses
of the
same
magnitude
as wbuld
be
produced
normally
in the full-size
element
when
subjected
to the design
load
( see  2.2
for load
equipment
). When
it
seems
appropriate,
a
preloading
shall
be
applied
to
the
test
element
to
guarantee
a
stabilization
of the deformation
and of the support
and
load equipment.
The
load
application
may
be repeated
a
number
of times
for this
stabilization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.4
The
level and
distribution
of the applied
loading
shall
be
maintained
constant
during
the test period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1.5
Test
specimens
of non-load-bearing
elements
shall
not be

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Observations
During
Test -
The fire resistance
of a load-bearing
structure
or structural
element
shall
be judged
by the criterion
of load-
bearing
capacity,
that
of a separating
element
by the criteria
of insulation
and
integrity,
and
that
of a load-bearing
and
separating
element
by the
criteria
of
load-bearing
capacity,
insulation
and
integrity
whichever
occurs
or manifest
itself
first.
In most
cases,
only
a small
loss of integrity
( initial
integrity
failure
) can
be accepted,
in other
cases,
a larger
loss
of integrity
(  ultimate
integrity
failure
) can be accepted.
In all cases
of
separating
structural
elements,
the
initial
integrity
failure
shall
be
determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  Load-Bearing

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1.1
For
a load-bearing
test
specimen,
the
time
at
which
the
specimen
can no longer
support
the test load
shall
be measured
and
used
to assess
the performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1.2
Where
possible,
the following
properties
and
characteristics
shall
also be noted
during
the whole
test period:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Deformations
which
can
facilitate
an analysis
of the structural
behaviour
of the element
and
an application
of the test results;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Free
movements
of the element;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Forces
and
moments
transmitted
to the
element
by restraint,
according
to 5.1.1.1;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Other
phenomena
which
are of importance
for
the load-bearing
capacity
of the element,
such
as cracking,
splitting
and
structural
transformations
of materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
needed
for an application
of the
test results,
the temperature
distribution
in the interior
of the
test specimen
shall
be determined
by
means
of thermocouples
placed
in such
a manner
that
they
provide
a
satisfactory
basis
for estimating
the
function
and
the
behaviour
of the
specimen
during
the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1.3
For
a separating
element,
such
deformations
as may
have
substantial
effects
on the function
of the element
shall
be measured
and
noted
during
the
whole
test
period.
Note
shall
be made
of the

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2.1  Average  temperature
of  unexposed face -
In the case of elements
with an unheated
surface,
the temperature
of the unexposed
face shall be
measured
by means
of not
fewer
than
five thermocouples,
one
placed
approximately
at the centre
of the face and the others
approximately
at
the centres
of the straight
lines
joimng
the centre
and
corners.
Any
additional
thermocouples
shall be disposed
as uniformly
as possible
over
the
unexposed
face
of the
specimen.
None
of these thermocouples
intended
for measurement
of mean
temperature
rise shall
be fixed in
position
with through-metal
connections
or closer
than
100 mm to edge
of the test specimen.
In the case of structures
comprising
composits
elements,
the arrangement
of the test
specimen
shall
ensure
that
the
j,)ints
do not coincide
with the points
of measurement
specified
above.
The average
of the temperatures
measured
at the points
specified above,
omittine;
temperatures
measured
at joints,
is deemed
to be the temperature
of the unexposed
face.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2.2
Maximum
temperature
of
unexposed
face
-
In addition,
the
temperature
shall be measured
at the point
that appears
to be the hottest
at any time during
the test.
This
temperature
shall not
be used in the
calculation
of average
temperature,
unless
the
point
at
which
this
temperature
occurs corresponds
to one of the locations
specified
in 5.2.2.1,

without
any
admixture
of artificial
fibres,
and shall
have a mass between
3 and 4 g.
The
pad
shall be conditioned
by drying
in an oven at 100°C for at least
0.5 hour.
The pad shall be attached
by wire clips to a 100 X 100 mm
frame
of 1 mm diameter
wire
to which
a wire
handle
approximately
750 mm
long is fixed.
