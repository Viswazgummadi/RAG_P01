<<HEADING level=3>>0.  FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 27 May
1987, after the draft finalized
by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Granulated
slag is used for the manufacture
of hydraulic
cement
by
mixing Portland cement clinker,
gypsum and granulated
slag in suitable
proportions
and grinding
the mixture to get a thorough and intimate mix
between the constituents.
Portland slag cement may also be manufactured
by separately grinding Portland
cement clinker,
gypsum and granulated
slag and then mixing them intimately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 This standard
contains clause 5.1 which calls for agreement
between
the purchaser
and the supplier regarding the manner in which granulated
slag shall be supplied and whether moisture content is to be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with., the final value,
observed or calculated,
expres-
sing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance ~with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Granulated Slag -
Slag is a non-metallic
product consisting
essenti-
ally of glass containing
silicates
and aluminates
of lime and other bases, as
in the case of blastfurnace
slag,
which
is developed
simultaneously
with
iron
in blastfurnace
or electric
pig iron furnace.
Granulated
slag is obtain-
ed by further
processing
the molten slag by rapidly
chilling
or
quenching
it with water or steam and air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. COMPOSITION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
The physical
state

of granulated
slag shall be in the
form of granules.
The proportion
of lumps exceeding
50 mm size shall not
constitute
more than 5 percent
of the mass of slag.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 When
tested in accordance
with the methods
given in IS  :  4032-1985*,
the composition
of granulated

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Granulated
slag shall be supplied
in. lots of 500 tonnes each. If the
quantity
of slag delivered
is less than 500 tonnes, it shall be considered
a lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Samples shall be drawn from at least five points of the wagon or truck
as the case may be. Each sample shall weigh about one kg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The samples belonging to one lot collected as in 4.2, shall be thoroughly
mixed and a composite sample of 20 kg shall be collected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 The sample of 20 kg, obtained,
as under 4.3, shall be divided into two
equal
parts. One part shall be retained in a tightly sealed container for
future reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 From the remaining portion ofthe slag sample, three samples of about
one kg each shall be drawn by methods
of reduction

content
adopting
the procedure
given in
Appendix B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6 The remaining
sample of slag, after drawing three samples as under
4.5,
shall be air dried and blended
thoroughly
with the dry samples
obtained from 4.5 and tested for conformity with 3.1. The coarse and fine
fractions obtained in this test shall be blended again thoroughly and ground
to pass 150 pm IS sieve. The material
obtained
as above shall be treated
as the sample for all the tests under 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
In case the moisture content of the slag is not to be determined,4.5
may
be skipped and the entire material
remaining after 4.4 shall be air dried and tested
for conformity
with 3.1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. INSPECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 The manner
in
which granulated

used generally
for the examination
of thin sections,
and should
have

<<HEADING level=3>>A-3. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1  From
about
5 g of a representative
sample of powdered
slag, a frac-
tion passing through
90 pm iS Sieve and retained
on 52 pm IS Sieve shall
be treated
as the sample for microscopic
investigation
as under A-3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.2
About one mg of powdered
slag is placed
on
a rectangular
glass
slide and a cover glass having its size less than the width of the rectangular
slide is placed
on the material.
One
or two drops of bromoform
or any
other suitable
liquid
( see A-2.1
) is added at the rim of the cover
glass.
It
is seen that the liquid
enters between
the cover
glass
and
glass slide.
A
gentle relative
motion
between
the slide and cover glass shall be created
to
disperse
the material
evenly
in the immersion
liquid. No attempt
shall be
made to rub one slide over the other after the bromoform
has been added.
The
powder immersion
section is examined
with transmitted
light
under
the
polarizing
microscope
at a magnification
of about 200.
About
1 500
grains are counted
(JI,)
by changing
the field of view and traverses
using
a mechanical
stage with the help of cross-wire
in the eye piece. Subsequcn-
tly under
crossed nicols, the same field of view already scanned
is examined
once
again
in similar
fashion
and
grains
which
appear
anisotropic
and
opaque
are counted
