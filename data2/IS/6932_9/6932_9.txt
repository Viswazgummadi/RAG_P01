<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This  Indian Standard (Part IX)
was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 22 March 1973, after the draft finalized by the Building Limes
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2  Hitherto, methods of tests for assessing qualitative requirements of build-
ing limes were included in IS  :  712-1964.
For facilitating the use of these
tests it has been decided to print these tests as different parts of a separate
Indian Standard.
This part covers determination of soundness of building
limes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,
it shall be done in accordance with IS  : 2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3. TEST FOR SOUNDNESS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Apparatus -The
apparatus for conducting the  ‘  Le-Chatelier  ’ test
shall conform to IS  :  5514 - 1969*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Preparation of Sample for Test -
A suitable amount of hydrated
lime shall be mixed with one-third its mass of Portland cement ( conforming
to IS  :  269-19677 ) and 4 times its mass of standard sand ( conforming to
IS  :  650-1971$.
The ingredients shall be mixed dry and then gauged and
mixed with 12 percent by mass of water calculated
on the dry mixture.
It shall then be used for conducting the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Procedure -
Three  ‘  Le-Chatelier  ’  moulds shall be used for conducting
the test.
These shall be well greased internally.
Each mould shall be
placed upon a small non-porous plate and filled with the mortar under test,
care being taken to keep the edges visibly open.
The mould shall then be
covered with another non-porous plate, upon which a small weight shall be
placed.
The 3 moulds shall be left undisturbed for 1 hour.
At the expira-
tion of this period the distance separating the indicator points shall be
measured and these moulds transferred to a damp air cupboard for a period
of 48 hours.
They shall then be removed, Cith covers in place, from the
damp air cupboard and placed in a suitable steam boiler, in which water is
already boiling vigorously, and subjected to the continuous action of saturated
stream at atmospheric pressure for a period of 3 hours; but it shall not be
immersed in water.
At the end of this period, the moulds shall be removed
from the steam and allowed to cool and the distances between the indicator
points again measured.
The increase, if any, over the former measurement
shall in no case exceed 10 mm after the deduction of 1 mm-( to allow for the
expansion of the added cement ) from the measured expansion.
The figure
so obtained shall be recorded as the net expansion due to lime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
