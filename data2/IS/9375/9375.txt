FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 November
1979, after the draft finalized
by the Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Precast
reinforced
concrete
plant guards
have
a number
of advant-
ages;
they
have
relatively
a long
life,
require
little
or no maintenance
and
give
a
neat
appearance.
The
Sectional
Committee,
therefore,
decided
to evolve
a specification
to cover
the requirements
of precast
concrete
plant guards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This standard
is intended
to serve
as a guide
for the manufacture,
installation
and
testing
of reinforced
concrete
plant
guards
and there-
fore
has been related
to the relevant
practices
followed
in the country.
This
standard,
however,
covers only fractionalized
( multi-pieces
) plant
guards
which
may be arrangrd
in triangular
or square pattern
and does
not cover single piece plant
guards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
For
the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a test
or
analysis,
shall
be rounded
off
in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
When reinforced

under field conditions. in
the absence
of a mechanical
vibrator,
thorough
rodding
of the concrete
wilh a

12 mm diameter rod followed by tamping with a suitable device shall
be effective in compacting
concrete.
At the beginning of the rodding operation,
