<<PARAGRAPH>>related
to one another,
the Sectional
Committee
decided
that each
type of
trade
as given
in IS  :  1200-1964*
be issued in different
parts which will be
helpful
to specific
users in various
trades.
This
part covering
method
of
measurement
of demolition
and dismantling
applicable
to building
as well as
civil engineering
works was therefore
issued as second
revision
in
1971.
The
third revrston incorporates
all the changes
decided
by the Sectional
Committee
in the past 3 years including
the provision
of dismantling
of
masonry and concrete met during excavation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the
result of a measurement,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960t.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
