<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 20 March
1989, after
the
draft
finalized
by the Gypsum
and Gypsum
Based Products
for Buildings
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>India
is endowed
with
more
than
1 200 million
tonnes
of mineral
gypsum.
Out
of it, about
92 percent
occurs
in Rajasthan
alone.
High
grade
gypsum
is required
for the manufacture
of
fertilizer,
as an additive
to Portland
cement
or for surgical,
ceramic
plaster,
etc.
However,
large
deposits
of low grade
gypsum
are
available
at several
places
in Rajasthan
and
are
considered
unsuitable
for the above
uses and hence
remain
unutilized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Studies
carried
out at Central
Building
Research
Institute
( CBRI
), Roorkee
have
shown that
suitable
plaster
for use as masonry
mortar
and for making
blocks
can be produced
from gypsum
having
purity
less than 70 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considering
the huge availability
of low grade
gypsum
and its scope for utilization
in the
building
construction,
the Committee
felt it necessary
to bring
out a code
of practice
on the use of low
grade
gypsum
in building
construction
as this gypsum
can be conveniently
used as mortar
and in
the manufacture
of light weight
blocks
for non-load
bearing
walls.
This standard,
it is expected,
wquld
help in promoting
the wider use of low grade
gypsum
in low cost housing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expresisng
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off
in
accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960
‘Rules
for
rounding
off numerical
values
(revised)‘.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same
as that
of the
specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

standard

the preparation

gypsum
made

and its use in masonry

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Gypsum
should
be
calcined
by
methods,
such
as,
open
pan
or
rotary
drum
or kettle
calcinators
or by any
other
suitable
method.
Before
calcination,
gypsum
should
be crushed
and
ground
generally
to
a fineness
of about
60 percent
passing
through
150 pm
1s
Sieve.
Gypsum
starts
giving
out
steam
after
the
removal
of
mechanically
held
water.
The
temperature
of calcination
should
be controlled.
Gypsum
starts
boiling
at
about
120°C
and
during
the
entire
calcination
process
the maxi-
mum
temperature
should
not
exceed
170%.
During
the calcination
process,
the temperature
remains
constant
when
the entire
charge
boils
vigorously.
The
calcination
of
gypsum
is
considered
complete
when
boiling
stops
and
the calcined
material
starts settling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

shall

dry in the required
propor-
tions to obtain
a uniform
colour.
The required
quantity
of water
shall
than be added
and the
materials
mixed
thoroughly
to
produce
a
mortar
of
workable
consistency.
In
case
of
mechanical
mixing,
the mortar
shall
be mixed
for
at
least
three
minutes
after
addition
of
water.
In the case of hand
mixing,
the mortar
shall
be thoroughly
mixed
for 5 to 10 minutes
with addition
of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should
be made

<<HEADING level=3>>7.5  Application
of Gypsum Mortar<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gypsum
mortar
is generally
recommended
for
use
as internal
plastering
and
masonry
work.
It shall
not
be
exposed
to
external
weather
conditions
except
where rainfall
is very scanty.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3  Consistency
of Gypsum Mortar<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The field performance
of gypsum
mortar
can be
assessed
by
applying
a mixture
of
1 part
of
gypsum
plaster
and
2 parts
of
sand
with
50 percent
water
( all by mass)
on a clean
and
wetted
brick surface.
The set mortar
shall not
show
any
visible
shrinkage
crack,
chalking,
crazing,
etc,
when
observed
after
48 h
of
application.
‘l’he set mortar
shall
adhere
well
with the masonry
surface
and shall not peel off
after drying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
working
consistency
of mortar
is usually
judged
by the worker
during
application.
The
quantity
of water
should
be enough
to maintain
the
fluidity
of
the
mortar
during
application
but
at the same
time
it shall
not be excessive
leading
to segregation
of aggregates
from
the
gypsum
plaster.
The
quantity
of
water
required
for maintaining
consistency
of fluidity
will
depend
upon
the masonry
for which
the
mortar
is used,
for example,
thinner
joints
will
require
greater
fluidity
and
bed joints
subject
to heavy
pressure
may require
stiffer mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
