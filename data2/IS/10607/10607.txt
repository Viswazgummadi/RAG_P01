<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 21 April 1983, after the draft finalized by the Refractories
Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Structural and Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard has been prepared for rationalizing
the requirements of
refractory bricks and refractory
castables used for lining of cement rotary
kilns. In the preparation of this standard, data collected from the cement
manufacturers as well as the refractory manufacturers regarding the type of
bricks and other refractory materials presently being used in the country,
were analysed, and after deliberations, it was decided to restrict therequire-
ments to three types of alumina-silicate and high alumina bricks, three types
of refractory
castables and one type of insulating castable for use in the
cement rotary kilns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The use of basic bricks is not prevalent to a very great extent in our
country at present, and therefore basic bricks have not been covered in the
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard describes the service conditions in the different zones of
cement rotary kilns, makes recommendations
for the types of refractories to
be used in the different zones and specifies the requirements for the different
types of refractories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0 For the purpose of this standard, the following definitions shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules for  rounding off numerical values  (revised).<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  10607 - 1983<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Cement Manufacturing Process -
Ordinary portland cement is obtained
from a clinker which is produced by burning a finely ground thoroughly
homogenized mixture of raw materials, generally consisting of limestone and
clay in requisite proportions with or without other corrective materials, at
1400-l 500°C  in a kiln. The manufacturing
process is designated as dry,
semidry and wet, depending on whether the raw mix, fed to the kiln, is in the
form of  a  dry powder, green nodules or an aqueous slurry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  Rotary Kiln -
Rotary kilns are steel tubes having an inner refractory
lining, with a slope of  3-4  percent to the horizontal, and rotating on its long
axis usually with a speed of 1 to 2 rpm. The tubes generally have a diameter
in the range of 2’5 to 5 m ( maximum up to 7 m as presently known ). The
length of the tubes vary from 14-17 to 32-35 times the diameter. The tube
is mounted on a number of roller supports.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Zonation in Cement Rotary Kiln -
Depending on the function of a
rotary kiln and the transformation
that takes place during the passage of a
raw mix through it, a rotary kiln is divided from the feed end to the dis-
charge end in the following zones; drying, preheating,
transition or inter-
mediate, burning, cooling or discharge. The zonation is conceptual but the
operating conditions in each zone are different. Typical illustrations for dry
and wet process kilns are given in Fig. 1 and 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  Suspension Preheater -
It  is a preheater used in the dry process of
manufacture and consists of a system of cyclones ( generally 2 or 4 ) with
connecting pipes, through which the exist gases of a rotary kiln are passed
by means of a fan. The raw mix which passes through the system in the
opposite direction to the gases ( counterflow ) is separated from the gas
stream in each cyclone and is reintroduced into the stream, in the next stage.
The raw meal is conveyed through the pipes by the hot gases ( uniflow ).
In the suspension preheater the raw mix is partially calcined ( 40 to 50 per-
cent ) before it reaches the rotary kiln.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5  Precalcinator -
It  is a calcining system introduced in a dry-process
suspension preheater kiln between the suspension preheater and the rotary
kiln for precalcination of raw mixes to an extent of 85 to 90 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6  Concentrator -
A concentrator ( also called a calcinator ) is a heat ex-
changer made of a slow rotating drum with built-in heat-transfer
elements
and installed before the rotary kiln. The hot gases from the kiln are passed
through the drum for effective heat transfer between the raw mix and hot
kiln gases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7  Grate Preheater -
It is a travelling grate carrying a bed of nodulized
raw meal through which the hot kiln gases are passed for heat transfer. The
grates can have a double-pass system in which the kiln gases are passed
twice through the bed of nodules.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
