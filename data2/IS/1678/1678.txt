<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This specification has been prepared with a view to clarifying and defining design requirements for different types
of prestressed concrete poles used in overhead electric power transmission, traction and telecommunication
lines.
This specification mainly relates to prestressed concrete poles in which initial compression has been induced by
one of the pretensioned systems. This specification also covers the requirements of earthing to be provided for
prestressed concrete poles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1960 and subsequently revised in 1978. The present revision incorporates the
modification found necessary in the light of experience gained with the use of this standard and due to revision
ofvarious other standards referredin this standard. The major changes incorporated in this revision are modifications
in respect of materials, cover and spacing of prestressed steel, sampling and inspection. In this revision, a method
for measuring the uprightness of poles has also been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation
of this standard is given in
Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2  :
1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
