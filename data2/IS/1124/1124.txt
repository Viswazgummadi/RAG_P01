FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 8 October
1974, after the draft finalized by the
Stones Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Buildmg stones are available
in large quantity in various parts of the
country.
To choose and utilize them for their satisfactory
performance,
it is necessary
to know the various
strength
properties
determined
according
to standard
procedure.
This standard
had, therefore,
been
formulated
to cover the standard
method
for determining
the water
absorption of natural
building
stones.
This standard was published in
1957 and is being revised based on the actual
use of the standard in the
past 17 years and the experience
gained
in testing of building stones for
these properties in the various research
laboratories
of this country.
In
this revision,
besides water absorption the property of apparent specific
gravity
and porosity which was earlier
covered
in IS  :  1122-1957*
has
also been covered as the same test pieces and method can be utilized for
both purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-19607.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard lays down the procedure for determination
of water
absorption, apparent specific gravity, apparent porosity and true porosity
of building stones used for constructional
purposes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Methods
for determination
of specific gravity and porosity
of natxal

<<HEADING level=3>>2. SELECTION
OF SAMPLES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The sample shall be selected to represent a true average of the type
or grade of stones
under consideration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The sample shall be selected from
the quarried
stone or taken from
the natural rock as described in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 and shall be of adequate
size to permit the preparation
of the requisite number of test pieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1
Stone from ledge or quarry
face of the stone shall be inspected
to determine
any variation in different strata.
Differences
in colour and
structure shall be observed.
Separate samples of stone weighing at least
25 kg each of unweathered
specimens
shall be obtained
from all strata
that
appear
to vary in colour
and structure.
Pieces
that have been
damaged by blasting shall not be included in the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Field Stone and Boulders-
A detailed
inspection
shall be made of
the deposits of field stone and boulders over the area where the supply is
to be obtained.
T,he different kinds of stone and their conditions
in the
various deposits shall be recorded.
Separate samples shall be selected of
classes of stone that would be considered
for use in construction
as
indicated
by visual inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 When
perceptible
variations
occur
in
the quality
of rock,
the
purchaser shall select as many samples as are necessary for determining
the range in properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  TEST PIECES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 The  test pieces selected as in 2 shall be crushed
or broken,
and the
material passing 20-mm IS Sieve and retained
on lo-mm IS Sieve shall
be used for the test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Cylindrical
Measuring
Glass Jars -
of 1 OOO-ml and
IOO-ml
capacity
shall be used.
The lOO-ml capacity
jar shall have graduation
mark of 1 ml.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Glass
Vessel-
of about
l-5-litre

The vessel shall then be emptied
and the test piece be allowed
The test piece shall then be placed
on a dry cloth and gently
surface
dried
with
the
cloth.
It shall
be transferred
to a second

no further
moisture.
It shall be spread
out not more than one stone deep on the second

in the larger cylinder
while
taking
care to remove
entrapped
