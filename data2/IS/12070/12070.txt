FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 30 April
1987, after the draft finalized
by the Rock
Mechanics
Sectional Committee
had
been
approved
by
the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Shallow
foundation
cover such type of foundation in which load
transfering is through
direct bearing pressure of bearing
strata and is
normally up to 3 m from natural ground level. Rock is usually recognised
as the best foundation
material. However,
design engineers should be
aware of the dangers associated with hetrogeneity and unfavourable
rock
conditions since over stressing a rock foundation
may result in large
differential
settlements or perhaps sudden failure. Therefore, a separate
code covering shallow foundation on rock has been formulated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this’
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test of analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
w~ith
IS  :  2-1960*. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should-be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard covers the design, construction and methods of estimat-
ing the safe bearing pressures of rocks for shallow foundations based on
strength, allowable settlement and classification criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard,
the definitions of terms given in

<<HEADING level=3>>3. GENERAL,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The  design of a foundation unit normally requires
that both bearing
capacity
and settlement
are checked.
While either bearing
capacity or
settlement
criteria
may provide the limiting condition,
it is normal for
settlement
to govern. Structural
distress from settlement as evidenced by
such occurrences as cracking and distortion of doors and window frames,
is common experience in hills.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-3.2 The calculation
of bearing capacity, the distribution
of stresses, and
the prediction
of settlement
and the choice of allowable load will depend
on the following factors, which should be fully considered during design:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)  Occurrences During
Excavation
a) Undulating
rock surface below a level ground;
b) Hetrogeneity
of rock mass ( the bearing
capacity may vary
up to 10 times in apparently the same rock mass because of
presence of localized
fractures/shear
zones/clay gauge/clay
weathering/alternate
hard land soft beds, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Solution and gas cavities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>d) Wetting, swelling and softening oI’>shales/phyllite  and expan-
sive clays;<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Bottom heave;
f) Potential
unstable conditions of the slope; and
g) High  in situ  horizontal stresses.
ii)  Adjacent Construction Activities
a) Blasting ( Controlled blasting techniques such as line drilling,
cushion blasting and presplitting are available if it is necess-
ary to protect
the integrity
of the work just outside  the
excavation
);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Excavation:
and
c) Ground water lowering ( excepting
in highly pervious sedi-
mentary
rock,
this phenomenon is rare in most of igneous
and metamorphic rocks )  ;  and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Undesirable
seismic response of the foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>iii)
Other Effects<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)  Scour and erosion ( in case of abutments and piers );
b) Frost action;<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Flooding ( only erodible rocks like sale and phyllite ); and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Undesirable
seismic response of the foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
The
permissible
settlement
for calculation
of safe
bearing
pressure
from plate load test should be taken as 12 mm even for large loaded areas.
The low value for settlement
of foundation
is due to hetrogeneity
of rocks.
In
case
of rigid
structures
like
R.C.C.
silos,
the permissible
settlement
may be increased
judici&sly,
if required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Where
site is covered
partly by rocks and partly
by talus
deposits
or
soil, care should be taken to account
for hetrogeneity
in deformability
of
soil
and rocks.
It is recommended
that
plate load tests be conducted
on
talus
or soil
and bearing
nressure
be recomrncnded
considering
12 mm
settlement,
as is for rock, - *<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Universally applicable values of safe bearing pressure cannot be given.
Many factors influence the safe bearing pressure and it will frequently be
controlled by settlement criteria. Nevertheless, it is often useful to estimate
the safe bearing pressure for preliminary design on the basis of the classifi-
cation although such values should be checked or treated with caution for
final design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

also be  used
to  give net allowable

to 6 m thickness to be less than 12 mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1  The RMR
for use in Table 3 should be the average within a
depth below foundation level equal to the width of the foundation, provi-
ded the RMR is fairly uniform within the depth. If the upper part of the
rock, within a depth of about one fourth of the width of foundation,
is of
lower quality the value of this part should be used or the inferior rock
should be removed.
Since the values in Table 3 are based on limiting the
settlement, they should not be increased if the foundation is embedded
into the rock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Where
the rock is sound the strength
of the foundation
rock is gener-
ally much in excess of the design
requirements,
provided
the walls of the
discontinuities
are closed and they are
favourably
oriented
( see Fig.

with respect to the applied forces.
The investigations
should, therefore,
be
concentrated
on:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>i) The identification
and mapping
of all discontinuities
in the
rock
mass within the zone of influence of the foundation
including
the
determination
of the aperture
( opening
) of discontinuities;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ii) An evaluation
of the mechanical
properties
of these discontinui-
ties, frictional
resistance,
compressibility
and
strength
of infilling
material
;  and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>iii) The
identification
and
evaluation
of the strength
of the
rock
material
according
to relevant
Indian
Standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2
In case of rock mass with favourable
characteristics
that is, rock
sur-
face is parallel
to the base of the foundation,
the load has
no
tangential
component,
the rock mass has no open discontinuities
).
The safe bearing
pressure should be estimated
from the equation

It is common
practice
in such cases to consider
the rock

on
the basis of conventional
soil mechanics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

PLATE
LOAD
TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  Plate load test is still the most practical and proven test for recommen-
ding bearing pressures inspite of many limitations.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 It is recommended
that plate load tests be conducted
on poor  I-ocks
where
safe bearing
pressure is suspected to be less than
100 t/ma. A
frequent mistake is committed
in ignoring the fact that rock mass is very
hetrogeneous
material as compared to soil. So a large number rof observa-
tion pits be made at a rate of at least three per important
asucture and
tests be conducted in the pit representing poorer rock
qualitise.
The final
trimming of rock surface should be done according to IS  :  7317-1974*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>-8.3  Plate load test should be performed according to IS  :  1888-1982t
and
safe pressures be obtained for settlements of plate. For a given settlement of
footing,
the settlement
of plate
is
obtained
by using
the
following

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.4 Effect of Orientation
of Joints on Pressure
Bulb -  The orienta-
tion of the continuous
joints
has a profound
effect
on the pressure
bulb.
It is seen that normal
stresses are transmitted
mainly
in
two
directions,
parallel
to the joints and perpendicular
to the major
joints
( see Fig. 2 ).
When
the major joints
are gently sloping,
the extent
of the pressure
bulb
across
major
joints
is more than
that
along
the joints.
The
converse
is
true for steeply-inclined
major joints.
The
practical
implications
are seri-
ous,
for
example,
the
elongated
stress
bulb may
act
as an imaginary
impervious
curtain
below
a concrete
dam founded
on
stratified
rocks.
Further
the
rock
mass
rating
will be reduced
considerably
in case of
unfavourably
orientation
of continuous
joints.
Accordingly
the
bearing
pressure will also be reduced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.6
In case rock is available
in smalt area of the raft,
Inverted-T-beam
of
raft foundation
be allowed to rest on the rock and soil, as the confinement
effect of T-beams
will improve
the stiffness of soil, thereby
reducing
the
hetrogeneity
in deformability
of soil and rock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.7
In
case of R C.C.
strip
foundation
on hetrogeneous
soil and rock
deposit,
longitudinal
reinforcement
( along wall ) should
also be provided
to take care possible bending
moments.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8
For similar reasons, circumferential
reinforcement
should be provided
in ring foundation
on hetrogeneous
soil and rock deposit.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10. TREATMENT
OF FOUNDATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  If at the time of actual excavation,
major solution cavities have been
found which have rendered
the ground
surface uneven,
the depth
of foun-
dation should be taken to a level such that 80 percent
rock
area
is avail-
able.
It must be ensured that the raft does not over hang at any corner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2
Otherwise
excavate
the filled up soil up to 80 percent
area level and
backfill it by lean concrete
of required
strength.
However,
the rock has to
be excavated
up to the pre-selected
foundation
level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3
If after
excavation,
loose pockets of talus’deposit
are found
out at a
few places, the same should be cleaned
and-backfilled
with lean concrete.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>JO.4 If very deep observation
pits
have been made
at the site, the
same
should be backfilled by lean concrete
up to the foundation
level.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>JO.5 Due attention
should be paid to problems
of foundation
on hetro-
geneous
rocks
particularly
foundations
on
rock
slopes
and
neces ary
remedial
measures
should be taken.<<HEADING_END>>
