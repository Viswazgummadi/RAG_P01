<<HEADING level=3>>0 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7.1
for extension/compression
movements
:
Difference between the maximum
and the mini-
mum width of a given joint caused
by extension/
compression movements.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International
Standard
does not include
all
necessary technical
terms on jointing
products.
The given selection has been based on relations
with other standards and the need for definitions
before specific test methods are elaborated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7.2
for
shearing
movements
:  Maximum
length
of the motion,
measured
in a direction
parallel to the sliding, of two points on the faces
of the joint which were initially
located on a line
perpendicular to the axis of the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Material
properties are defined
in general
terms
without reference to related quantitative
SSPeCtS
such as the influence of specitic
test conditions,
for example, temperature or rate of strain.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.8 movement
capability
:  Quantitative
state-
ment of the ability of a sealant
to accommodate
movement
of the joint
into which
it has been
filled, while maintaining
an effective seal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope and field of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This International
Standard defines technical terms
for sealants for building
purposes and applies to
joints
filled
with
hardening,
plastic
or
elastic
materials which are not preformed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.9 primer
:  Surface coating applied to the faces
of the joint before placing the sealant in order to
ensure its adhesion.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.10 back-up
material
:  Material
inserted
in a
joint, which limits the depth
of sealant
applied,
and which defines the back profile of the sealant.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 Terms and definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 to seal  :  To place the appropriate products in
the joint in order to prevent the penetration
of
moisture and/or the passage of air between
the
elements, components,
and assemblies
made of
the same or dissimilar materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.11 compatibility
:  For a sealant,
the property
of remaining
in contact
with
another
material
without
unfavourable
physical
or
chemical
interactions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 sealant
:  A material which,
applied
in
an
unformed state to a joint, seals it by adhering
to
appropriate surfaces within the joint.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.12 cohesion

:  Rupture in the body of<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 elastic
sealant
:  Sealant
which
after appli-
cation
exhibits
predominantly
elastic behaviour,
i.e, remaining stresses induced in the sealant
as
a result of joint movement are almost proportional
to the strain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.14
adhesion
:  Property of a sealant to stick to
a given substrate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.15
adhesion
failure
:  Rupture at the interface
between a sealant and a substrate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 plastic
sealant
:  A sealant which after appli-
cation
retains predominantly
plastic
properties,
i.e. the remaining stresses induced in the sealant
as a result of joint movement are rapidly relieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.16 elastic
recovery
:  Property
of
a
sealant
whereby the initial shape and dimensions
of the
material are wholly
or partially
restored on remo-
val of the forces causing deformation.<<HEADING_END>>

having a vertical surface.<<HEADING_END>>

sealant
: Sealant

ed  in the form
of several
separate
components
to
be mixed
together
before use,
in
accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions,<<HEADING_END>>

between
the tensile stress of a sealant at a particular rela-
tive elongation and that relative elongation.<<HEADING_END>>
