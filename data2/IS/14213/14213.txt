<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Housing
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stone is a potential building material in those areas where it is available
in abundance.
Stones
of
irregular
shape and size, when used in the form of random rubble masonry for construction
of
walls, consume excessive materials and are undesirably
massive.
Besides such construction
is time
consuming and requires skilled labour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of stone spalls of varying size and shape in the form
of precast
concrete
stone masonry
blocks ensures consistent quality, uniform strength,
increase in speed
of construction,
reduction
in materials requirement,
lower foundation
loads, better aesthetic
look and performance
and saves
the
floor
space
in building.
Hence,
use of precast
concrete
stone masonry blocks leads to
substantial economy because of following aspects:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Fewer joints,
due
to
uniform
shape
and size, result in considerable
saving in mortar as
compared
to normal random rubble masonry construction;
b) The true plane surface obtained obviate the necessity of plaster
for unimportant
buildings
situated
in low
rainfall
areas
and wherever plastering is required lesser thickness can be
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Because of uniform shape and size of the units, considerably
thinner
walls are possible
as
compared
to random rubble masonry,
thus increasing the effective floor space and reducing
the load on foundation,
and ensures speedy construction
which reduces the cost of construc-
tion substantially.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the construction
with these blocks, it is also possible to have stone texture
exposed in walls and
thus giving an attractive appearance.
It lends itself to a wide variety of surface finishes for both
exterror
and
interior
walls.
The
precast
units,
used
in this construction,
provide a strong
mechanical bond, uniting the masonry units and finish ( that is, mortar ) in a strong
permanent
bond.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the technical committee responsible
for the formulation
of this standard
is
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
otf numerical values (  revised )‘.  The number
of significant places retained
m the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>-This standard
lays
down recommendations
for
construction
of walls
using
precast
concrete
stone masonry blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water used for making
masonry
mortars
shall
be clean and free from injurious quantities of
deleterious
materials.
Potable water is generally
considered
satisfactory.
Requirements
regarding
permissible limits of deleterious
materials in the
water shall be as given in IS 456  :  1978.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Any  of  the reinforcing
materials
recommended
in IS 456  :  1978 may be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of this standard, the definitions,
given
in IS
1905  :  1987, IS 2212  :  1991
and
IS 12440 : 1988 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 PLANNING
CONSIDERATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Building Dimensions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 MATERIALS/COMPONENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As the cutting
of these blocks is not possible,
building
dimensions
shall be planned
to suit
block
dimensions,
which
in turn
have been
selected
keeping
in view the requirements
of
modular co-ordination.
Hence,
all lengths
of
walls,
openings,
spaces
between
openings,
etc, should
be in multiples
of
10 cm
and
all heights
in multiples of 15 cm.
However,
in
cases where the height does not fall in multiple
of 15 cm, cement
concrete
having a strength
at least equal to the strength
of precast concrete
stone masonry blocks shall be laid on the top
course
of the wall for a depth not exceeding
15 cm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The
precast
concrete
stone masonry units
shall conform to IS 12440 : 1988.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Mortar<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mortar used for laying the blocks should be
of relatively lower strength than that of the mix
used for making precast units in order to avoid
formation
of cracks.
Guidance
for preparation
and use of mortars may be taken from IS 2250  :
1931. Cement sand mortar not leaner than 1  :  6
mix or where good quality lime ( see 4.2.1 ) is
available, lime  surkhi  or lime cinder
mortar
not
leaner than
1  :  3 mix or equivalent
composite
mortar may be us:d.
It is preferable
to use a
composite
mortar of mix not leaner than 1 : 1 : 9
cement lime sand.
The selection of mortar
shall
also be governed by
the
strength
required
for
the masonry and reference
may be inade for this
to IS 1905  :  1987.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Thickness of Joint<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thickness of the bed joints shall ,be such that
four blocks and three joints taken
consecutively
in vertical direction
shall measure equal to four
times
the height
of precast
blocks plus 3 cm.
However,
no bed joint
‘shall be thizker
than
12 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1  Lime<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Structural
Stability and Strength<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydraulic and semi-hydraulic
limes correspond-
ing to classes A, B and E of IS 712  :  1984 may be
conveniently
used in masonry
mortars, whereas
fat limes, corresponding
to classes C and D will
reqtiire
mixing
of burnt
clay
pozzolana
and
other pozzolanic
material.
Quick lime shall not
be used.
Slaking
in case of quick lime may be
done
at site in accordance
with IS 1635  :  1992
before using it for preparing mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design with regard to structural
stability
shall
be dcne
as per
recommendations
given
in
IS 1905  :  1987.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Resistance to Moisture Penetration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.1  The performance
of wal!s made of precast
concrete stone masonry block against penetration
ofmoisture
is comparable
to that of brick wall
using bricks of water absorption
of about 12
percent. Rain penetration
can be further checked<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2  Fine Aggregate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sand shall conform to IS 2116  :  1980.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>be stacked
in regular
tiers
even as they are
unloaded, to minimize breakages and defacement.
The supply of blocks shall be so arranged
that,
as far as possible abcut two days requirement
of blocks are available at site at any time. Blocks
to be used for different situations of use in work
shall be stacked separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>by filling the junctions
between
exposed
stone
pieces
and lean
concrete
with cement
sand
mortar
not
leaner than
1  :  6 ( cement  :  sand )
and plastering
the external
face.
In areas of
high rainfall,
the outer face of the wall shall be
plastered rendered with mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.2
Walls 15-20 cm and a,bove in thickness
may be made as external walls while partition
walls shall have minimum
thickness
of 10 cm.
Cavity. walls as recommended
in 5.5.2 may also
be used for reducing moisture ingress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  Cement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement shall be stored
above ground
level
in
perfectly dry and watertight
sheds. Cement sball
be stacked not more thrn eight bags high.
The
bags shall be stacked
in a nlanner to facili!ate
removal and use in the order in which
they are
received.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5  Thermal Performance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.1  Recommendations
for satisfactory
thermal
performance
of non-industrial
buildings
are
covered in IS  3792  :  1978.
If thinner
walls are
provided,
their
thermal
performance
can be
improved
by
applying
white
wash
or
light
colour wash on external face and/or by providing
shading
devices.
Hence,
from
thermal consi-
deration only the external wall, facing west may
be made
30 cm thick
while other
external
walls may
be made
20 cm thick with
other
treatment
for improving
therms1
p:rformance,
if required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Lime<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quick
lime shall be siacked
soon
after
it is
received.
Storage
of unslacked
fat
or semi-
hydraulic
lime
is not
desirable
as the lime
deteriorates
by absorption
of moisture from the
atmosphere.
Slacked lime shell be stored in the
manner described  in IS  4052  :  1977.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Mortars<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.2 For
achieving
recommended
level
of
thermal
comfort,
cavity walls may also be used
in place of 30 cm or more thick walls.
For a
thermal performance
index ( T.P.I. ) equivalent
to that of 30 cm thick wall, a cavity wall with
two leaves each of 10 cm thickness separated
by
a 5 cm thick airgap are sufficient.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1  Lime mortars using hydraulic
limes which
sometimes require to be used after a day or two
of their grinding, shall be prevented
from drying
out by occasional
sprinkling
of water and/or
protective
covering.
Mortars
with
ce’ment,
cement
lime or
hydraulic
lime shall be used
immediately
after preparation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.3  Control of Shrinkage
Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.2 Mixing and transportation
of mortars shall
be such as to avoid seggregation
and formation
of laitance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to confine cracks due to shrinkage
to
the joints
and
to
dissipate
these into a large
number
of fine joints,
it is desirable that the
mortar used shall be weaker than the blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 SETTING
OUT OF WALLS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Setting out of walls shall be done in accordance
with IS 2212  :  1991.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.1 Cracking
due
to
shrinkage
normally
occurs at openings
or other
points
where
the
vertical or horizontal
section of a wall changes.
Metal
reinforcements
may
be embedded
in
masonry at points
where cracking
is likely to
occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 SCAFFOLDING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S.l Only double scaffolding
shall be used and
no holes in the masonry for supporting
scaffold-
ing shall be allowed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6  Footings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
design
and
construction
of foundation
footings
in
precast
concrete
stone
blocks,
reference
may be made to IS 1080  :  1986. Same
provisions
as applicable
to
brick
or
stone
masonry
foundations
shall apply
for precast
concrete
stone blocks
also.
The width of the
footing in this case shall be in multiple of 10 cm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Scaffolding shall be designed
to withstand
all the dead,
live and impact
loads which are
likely to come on them.
They
shall
be
so
designed as to ensure the safety of the workmen
using them and shall conform in all respects
to
the
requirements
of the
relevant
building
regulations
on safety,
health
and welfare and
also the local building bye-laws.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

rather
than the blocks being wetted to suit the
mortar.
However,
in dry hot climate, the blocks
should
be
wetted
on the surface only, by sprinkling
water in order
to reduce
suction
of
moisture
from the mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.6.1 Vertical joints shall be broken in alternate
courses
by using
smaller

of brick/cut
brickslclosers
) shall not apply for
laying of blocks and in place of such provisions,
recommendations
as given in this standard
shall
apply. Such other provisions
as are recommend-
ed in 10.6 to 10.9 shall also apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.6.1.2 At T-junction
of 20 cm wall and 10 cm
wall with 10 cm wall the joints are staggered
-by
using l/3 size and 2/3 size block
respectively

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  The block shall be laid dry preferably,
using
composite
mortars of
suitable
mix proportions
of cement  :  lime  :  sand depending upon loading.
In hot climate, the blocks may be slightly wetted

performance.
The inspection
shall be carried out as per broad
recommendations
given
for
brickwork
in
IS 2212 : 1991.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2 For
curing,
the
mortar
joints
shall be

<<PARAGRAPH>>13 MAINTENANCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3 To accommodate
the changes in length due
to shrinkage of blocks,
joints
called controlled
joints shall be provided at suitable intervais,
for
example, at 8 to 10 m spacing
in free standing
walls, at 15 to 18 m intervals
in walls which
are connected
by cross walls, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Defects in the masonry
