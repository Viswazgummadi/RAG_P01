<<PARAGRAPH>>1
Scape<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
par!
of
IEC
3OO/ISO 9000
provides
guidance
on
dependability
programme
management.
It covers
the
essential
features
of  a  comprehensive
dependability
programme for the planning,
organization,
direction
and control of resources
to produce
~products which will be reliable
and maintainable.
In management
terms, it is concerned
with what h-as to be done, and why, and when and how it has to be done, but it is not
specific
about who should
do it and where,
because
organizations
and projects
vary
widely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of IEC 3OO/ISO 9000 is applicable to hardware and/or software products,
where
dependability
characteristics
are significant
during the operation
and -maintenance
phase.
The requirements
are maimed primarily
at controlling
influences
on dependability
at all
product life-cycle phases from product planning to operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any agreement
using the guidance
given
in this part of IEC 3OO/ISO 9000 may use
selected
parts to fit particular
circumstances.
The parties involved
shall agree upon and
record the extent to which it is applied, including the guidance given in other parts of the
IEC 300 series. Any selected clauses used in this way become requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
The guidance given in this part of IEC 3OO/ISO 9000 primarily applies to a supplier with a small
number of qualified customers but it can also be applied to the supply of consumer products.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2
The -guidance given in this part of IEC 3OO/ISO 9000 addresses the life-cycle phases as defined and
would also apply to any further subdivision of phases.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3
The masculine gender is used in this part of IEC 3OO/ISO 9000 to represent also the feminine gender
where applied to persons.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4
In the context of this part of IEC 3OO/ISO 9000 the terms ‘document’ and ‘documentation’
are not
restricted to-paper media.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
The term “customer’ used in this part of IEC 3OO/ISO 9000 is synonymous with the term ‘purchaser’.<<HEADING_END>>
