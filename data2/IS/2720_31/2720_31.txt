<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Part
31 ) ( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Soil and Soil Engineering
Sectional Committee
had been approved by
the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bearing ratio test ( generally
known as the California
bearing ratio test ) is an ad hoc penetration
test used for the evaluation
of the strengths of sub-grade
and bases for roads and runaway pavements.
The results
obtained
from these
tests are used in conjunction
with the empirical
curves, based on
experience
for the
design of flexible
pavements.
The test gives empirical
strength values which may
not be directly
related to fundamental
properties
governing
the
strength
of soil. The test is either
performed
in the laboratory
[ see IS  :  2720 ( Part 11 )  :  1971 ] or directly
in the field. The test may
also be performed
in the laboratory
on undisturbed
sample or sample re-compacted
to the field density.
The laboratory
procedure
has been covered in IS 27.0 ( Part 16 )  :  1987.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
covers the method of test to be conducted
in the field. This standard
was first published
in 1969.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The principal
modifications
made in the revision are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Revising the method of procedure
based on the experience
gained in the use of this test in the

that the

<<HEADING level=3>>4.10 Surcharge Weight<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One  annular
metal weight of mass 5 kg and of
250 mm diameter with a central hole 53 mm in
diameter.
Two circular slotted weights of mass
5 kg and of diameter
215 to 250 mm with a
central
hole
and slot width
of 53 mm. Two
circular
slotted
weights of mass 10 kg and of
diameter
215 to 250 mm with
a central hole
and slot width of 53 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 The surcharge
annular weight of mass 5 kg
should be kept in position on the surface
to be
tested
so that
when the
piston is lowered, it
will pass through the hole in the annular weight.
The penetration
piston should
be seated with
the smallest possible load not exceeding a total
load of 40 N ( or unit load of 0.02 MPa) so that
full contact
is established
between the piston
and the surface to be tested. For materials with
irregular
surface
the piston
may
be seated
on a thinnest
practical
layer of fine limestone
screening
or plaster
of Paris spread over the
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and
IS  2720 (  Part
29 )  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5 While the
seating load is on the piston,
a
3 to 6 mm layer of clean sand should be spread
over the surface to be covered by the surcharge
annular
weight.
This helps
in distributing
the
surcharge
load over the surface uniformly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 The general surface area to be tested should
be exposed,
cleaned
of all loose
and
dried
material
and
levelled.
Extreme
care shall be
taken
not
to disturb
the
test
surface.
The
spacing of the tests should be such that
opera-
tions in one area do not disturb the soil in the
other
area. For testing operations
this spacing
may
be 50 cm for the penetration
piston used
in the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 Surcharge
weights, sufficient
to produce an
intensity
of loading, equal to the weight of the
base material
and pavement,
except
that the
minimum
weight
applied
should
be
150 N
including
that
of the
annular
weight [ this
weight
gives an intensity
of loading approxi-
mately
equal to that in the laboratory
bearing
ratio test [ see IS 2720 ( Part 16 )  :  1987  ]  should
be applied.
The
penetration
indicating
dial
should
be suitably
fixed for reading the pene-
tration
and the dial set to zero. A diagrammatic
set up of the test is shown in Fig. 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 If actual
service
conditions
in the field
warrant,
the surface to be tested may be soaked
to the desired
degree. During
the process of
soaking
the required
surcharge
weights should
be kept in place.
The test
surface
should be
drained
of all free water, levelled and allowed
to stand for at least lfimminutes before
starting
further
operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7 Load
shall be applied
on the penetration
piston so that the penetration
is approximately
1.25 mm/min.
The load readings shall be recor-
ded at penetration
of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0,
4.0, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 and 12.5 mm. The maximum
load and penetration
shall be recorded
if it
occurs
for a penetration
less than 12.5 mm.
The set up may then be dismantled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 The
equipment
used
to
provide
load
reaction
( truck, tractor,
truss etc ), should
be
so located
that the centre of the beam against
which
the loading
jack will work is over the
centre
of the surface
to be tested.
If loaded
truck
or
tractor
is used for
providing
the
necessary
reaction,
the rear wheels of the truck
or
tractor
should
be
completely
raised
by
means
of the track type jacks placed below the
frame of the body
near the wheels in order to
avoid
the loss of loading
effort which would
otherwise
be spent on the flexing of the axial
springs of the vehicle at the time of testing.
In
order
to avoid accidents
due to the failure of
jacks
near the wheels and the
lifting of the
vehicle
at higher
loads, the rear side of the
body
of the vehicle should be placed over two
rigid
supports.
The
screw
jack
with
swivel
should
be installed
to the underside
of the
equipment
-providing
reaction,
at. the correct
position
for
the test. The proving
ring should
be connected
to the bottom end of the jack and
the
piston
connector
to
the bottom
of the
proving ring. The piston should then, be connec-
ted using,
if necessary,
lengths
of
extension<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8 After the completion
of the test,
a sample
shall be collected
from the point of penetration,
for
moisture
content
determination.
The
moisture content
shall be determined
in accord-
ance with IS 2720 ( Part 2 ) : 4973. Besides the
moisture
content,
the in-place density shall be
determined
in accordance
with IS 2720 ( Part
~28 )  :  1974 or IS 2720 ( Part 29 )  :  1975 about
15 cm away from the point of penetration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  The bearing ratios are
usually calculated’
for peretration
of 2.5 mm and 5 mm. Generally
the bearing
ratio at 2.5 mm penetration
will
be greater than that at 5 mm penetration

such a case the former
shall be taken as the
bearing ratio for design purposes. If the bearing
ratio
corresponding
to a penetration
of 5 mm
exceeds
that for 2.5 -mm, the test
shall
be
repeated.
If identical
results follow, the bearing.
ratio corresponding

shall
be taken for design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7  REPORT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  The bearing ratio shall be reported
correct
to the first decimal
place. The details

results given in Annex B shall be given.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 NUMBER  OF FIELD TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  Three in-place
bearing

tests shall be
performed
at
each
location
to
be tested.
However,
if the results of the three tests in any
group do not show reasonable
agreement,
three
additional
tests shall be performed
at the same
location
and numerical
average of the six tests
shall
be used as the bearing
ratio
at
that
location.
A reasonable
agreement
between the
minimum
and maximum
values
of the
three
tests where the bearing
ratio
is less than 10%
permits a tolerance
of 3%, from 10% to 30% a
tolerance
of 5%, from 30% to 60% a tolerance
of lo%,
and greater
than SO%, a tolerance
of
25%. If it is known that single value is erratic
for any reason, that value should
be discarded
and another test performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
