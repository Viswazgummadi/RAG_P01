<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Part XV/Set
3 ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 March
1977, after the draft
finalized
by the
Terminology
Relating
to River
Valley
Projects
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number
of Indian
Standards
have been
published
covering
various
aspects of river valley projects and a large number
of similar
standards
are
in the process of formulation.
These standards
include
technical
terms, the
precise
definitions
of which
are
required
to avoid
ambiguity
in
their
interpretation.
To achieve
this end, the Institution
is bringing
out IS  :  4410
‘  Glossary of terms relating
to river valley projects  ’  which is being published
in parts.
This
part contains
definitions
of terms relating
to flumes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  This part ( Part
XV ) covers the important
field of canal structures
and
in view of the vastness
of this subject,
this is being
covered
in
different
sections.
Other sections in the series will be the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Section

Section

Section

Section

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in
different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in
this country.
This has been met by deriving
assistance
from the following
publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
