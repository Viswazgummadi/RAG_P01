FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 22 March
1973,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Water
Supply
and
Sanitation
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineer-
ing Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 With
the
increasing
number
of multistoreyed
buildings
in major
cities in the country,
need for developing
suitable
methods
for collection
and removal
of refuse
and garbage
from
buildings
is receiving
urgent
consideration
of
the
Civic
and
Public
Health
Authorities
to avoid
insanitary
conditions
in
buildings
and
public
places.
This
code
of
practice
has been prepared
to give guidance
for proper methods
of refuse
collection
from multistoreyed
buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1
This
code covers
the requirements
of chute
system
and explains
the design,
construction
and location
of the three functionally
important
components
namely
the
chute,
the
inlet
hopper
and
the
collection
chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded
off value
should
be the same as that
of the specified
value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.1
This
standard
covers
the
requirements
of the
refuse
chute
system
built in multistoreyed
residential
buildings
for transporting
and collecting
in a sanitary
way the refuse from flats at different
heights.
The
refuse is
received
from the successive
flats through
the inlets located
on the vertical<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>system  of pipes that
convey
refuse
through
it and
discharges
into
the
collecting
chamber
from where the refuse is cleared
at suitable
intervals.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(revised).<<HEADING_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  6%4 -  1973<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard,
.the following
definitions
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Chute-
A  vertical
pipe system
passing
from floor to floor provided
with
ventilation
and inlet
openings
for receiving
refuse
from successive
hats and ending
at the ground
floor on the top of the collecting
chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Inlet Hopper-
A receptacle
fitting
for receiving
refuse
from
each
flat and dropping
it into the chute.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3 Collection
Chamber-A
compartment
situated
at the lower end of
the chute for collecting
and housing
the refuse during
the period between
two successive
clearings.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  CHUTES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Number
of Chutes-The
number
of chutes
depends
upon
the
convenience
to the user and the quantity
of refuse to be handled
between
two subsequent
clearings.
Appendix
A gives the method
of calculation
of quantity
of refuse f&m
residential
buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Individual
or Combined
System-In
continuation
to 3.1, if the
chute system is designed
as individual
system,
where each flat is served by
an independent
hopper,
it will be to the utmost
convenience
to the user.
However,
a common
hopper
may be provided
in each
floor
for each
chute
whose
number
is further
decided
by
the
quantity
of refuse
to
be handled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Material
of Construction
-
Chutes
may
be constructed
out of
asbestos
cement
or R.C.C.
pipe with smooth
inside finish.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Diameter
of the Pipe-
Chutes
shall
be of a minimum
internal
diameter
of 38 cm in order to avoid any chokage
inside the chute
and to
enable provision
of a choke-free
inlet hopper connection.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5  Finish  -The
inside
surface
of the
chute
should
be finished
as
smoothly
as possible
so as not to allow any sticking
of refuse particle
that
may cause choking
eventually.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6  Location-The
chute may be carried
through
service
shafts
meant
for
carrying
drainage
pipes.
However,
the
location
shall
be
mostly
determined
by the position
of inlet
hopper
and the collecting
chamber
that
is most
convenient
for the user.
It should
also be considered
to
locate the chute away from living rooms in order to avoid noise and smell
nuisance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7  Construction-The
chute pipes should be assembled
vertically
and
properly
clamped
to the wall.
The joints
should
be of cement
mortar
and the chute may be squarely
embedded
into the surrounding
walls.
A
