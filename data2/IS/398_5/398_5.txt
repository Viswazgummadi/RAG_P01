Committee,
ET 37<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
the draft finalized by
( First Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the Conductors
and Accessories
for Overhead
Lines
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Electrotechnical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
has been prepared
to cover the requirements
of ACSR conductors
for use on extra
high voltage lines ( 400 kV and above ).
At such high voltages
corona
and radio interference
attain great importance
and special attention
has to
be paid
to the finish
of the conductor.
Tests to ascertain
conformity
in,this regard have also been stipulated
in the standard:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
( Part 5 ) was first published
in 1982.
At that
time the
development
of EHV
network
was envisaged
at 400 kV ac only.
For
this
system after
detailed
techno-economic
studies by_CEA, 54/3. 53 mm Al+ 7/3-53 mm steel
conductor
in the form
of horizontal
twin
conductor
bundle with a subconductor
spacing of 450 mm was identified
as the most
suitable
conductor.
However,
with the expansion
of 400 kV network
and with
the development
of
f 500 kv dc and 800 kV ac systems, use of additional
types
of ACSR
conductors
is envisaged
in the country.
This revision,
therefore;
covers three types of conductors
instead of only
one
covered in t-he earlier
version
of the
standard.
It is, however,
not intended
to restrict
the
standard
to the parameters
of these conductors
only and requirements
for other
conductors
for
EHV  purpose will be added  later as and when the need arises.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the standard value adopted
for
resistivity
of EC grade
aluminium is O-0282 64 ohm. mm*/m
at 20°C which is the value adopted
in the IEC Standard
also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part deals with aluminium conductors
galvanized
steel reinforced
for high voltages
( 400 kV
and above ) and it forms Part 5 of the series.
The other parts in the series are given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1  :  Aluminium stranded
conductors
Part 2  :  Aluminium
conductors
galvanized
steel reinforced
Part 3  :  Aluminium conductors,

Part 4  :  Aluminium

conductor<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 398 ( Part 2 )  :  1976
to which
reference
has been made
in this
standard
is a  necessary
adjunct to this standard.
Should, however, any deviation
exist between
IS 398 ( Part 2 ) 1976
and those of this standard,
the provision
of the latter shall  apply,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is  complied
with,
the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off -in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
ofi numerical
valves. ( revised ).’
The
number of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value
should be the same that
of the
specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
( Part 5 ) covers the requirements
and tests for aluminium conductors,

for
extra

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Resistivity<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The resistivity

depends upon its
purity
and its physical
condition.
For
the
purpose of this standard,
the
maximum
value
permitted
is O-028 264 ohm.

and this value has been used for
calculation
of
the maximum permissible
value of resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

listed
in Annex A are
