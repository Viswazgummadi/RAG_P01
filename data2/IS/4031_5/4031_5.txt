0.1  This Indian Standard (Part 5) (First
Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards on 10 March 1988, after the draft
finalized by the Cement and Concrete Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.
0.2  Standard methods of testing cement are
essential adjunct to the cement specifications.
This standard in different parts lays down the
procedure for the tests to evaluate the physical
properties of different types of hydraulic
cements.
The
procedure
for
conducting
chemical tests of hydraulic cement is covered in
IS : 4032-1985*.
0.3  Originally all the tests to evaluate the
physical properties of hydraulic cements were
covered in one standard; but for facilitating the
use of this standard and future revisions, it has
been decided to print the different tests as
different parts of the standard and, accordingly
this revised standard has been brought out in
thirteen parts. This will also facilitate updating
of individual tests. Further, since publication of
the original standard in 1968, a number of
standards
covering
the
requirements
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>different equipment used for testing of cement,
a brief description of which was also covered in
the standard, had been published. In this
revision, therefore, reference is given to
different instrument specifications deleting the
description of the instruments, as it has been
recognized that reproducible and repeatable
test results can be obtained only with standard
testing equipment capable of giving desired
level
of
accuracy.
This
part
covers
determination of initial and final setting times
of cement.
0.4  This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment
No. 1 (March 1993). Side bar indicates
modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.
0.5  For the purpose of deciding whether a
particular requirement of this standard is
complied with, the final value, observed or
calculated, expressing the result of a test or
analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant
places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard (Part 5) covers the procedure
for determining the initial and final setting
times of cement.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  The moist closet or moist room shall be
maintained at 27 ± 2°C and at a relative
humidity of not less than 90 percent.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. APPARATUS
4.1 Vicat Apparatus  — Vicat apparatus
conforming to IS : 5513-1976*.
4.2 Balance  — The balance shall conform to
the following requirements:
On balance in use, the permissible variation
at a load of 1 000 g shall be ± 1.0 g. The
permissible variation on new balance shall
be one-half of this value. The sensibility
reciprocal shall be not greater than twice the
permissible variation.
N OTE  1 — The sensibility reciprocal is generally defined
as the change in load required to change the position of
rest of the indicating element or elements of a
non-automatic indicating scale a definite amount at any
load.
N OTE  2 — Self-indicating balance with equivalent
accuracy may also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. SAMPLING AND SELECTION OF TEST
SPECIMEN
2.1  The samples of the cement shall be taken in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
IS : 3535-1986* and the relevant standard
specification for the type of cement being
tested. The representative sample of the
cement selected as above shall be thoroughly
mixed before testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY
3.1  The temperature of moulding room, dry
materials and water shall be maintained at
27 ± 2°C.
The
relative
humidity
of
the
laboratory shall be 65 ± 5 percent.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Standard Weights  — The permissible
variations on weights in use in weighing the
cement shall be as prescribed in Table 1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>allow
it
to
remain
there
except
when
determinations of time of setting are being
made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1 — Clean appliances shall be used for gauging.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  2 — All the apparatus shall be free from vibration
during the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  3 — Care shall be taken to keep the needle
straight.
5.2 Determination
of
Initial
Setting
Time  — Place the test block confined in the
mould and resting on the non-porous plate,
under the rod bearing the needle (  C  ); lower
the needle gently until it comes in contact with
the surface of the test block and quickly
release, allowing it to penetrate into the test
block. In. the beginning, the needle will
completely pierce the test block. Repeat this
procedure until the needle, when brought in
contact with the test block and released as
described above, fails to pierce the block beyond
5.0 ± 0.5 mm measured from the bottom of the
mould. The period elapsing between the time
when water is added to the cement and the
time at which the needle fails to pierce the test
block to a point 5.0 ± 0.5 mm measured from
the bottom of the mould shall be the initial
setting time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Determination of Final Setting Time  —
Replace the needle (  C  ) of the Vicat apparatus
by the needle with an annular attachment (  F  ).
The cement shall be considered as finally set
when, upon applying the needle gently to the
surface of the test block, the needle makes an
impression thereon, while the attachment fails
to do so. The period elapsing between the time
when water is added to the cement and the
time at which the needle makes an impression
on the surface of test block while the
attachment fails to do so shall be the final
setting time. In the event of a scum forming on
the surface of the test block, use the underside
of the block for the determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Preparation of Test Block  — Prepare a
neat cement paste by gauging the cement with
0.85 times the water required to give a paste of
standard consistency. Potable or distilled water
shall be used in preparing the paste. The paste
shall be gauged in the manner and under the
conditions
prescribed
in
IS : 4031 (Part 4)-
1988†. Start a stop-watch at the instant when
water is added to the cement. Fill the Vicat
mould  E  with a cement paste gauged as above,
the mould resting on a nonporous plate. Fill the
mould completely and smooth off the surface of
the paste making it level with the top of the
mould. The cement block thus prepared in the
mould is the test block.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. REPORTING OF RESULTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  Immediately after moulding, place the
test block in the moist closet or moist room and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The results of initial and final setting time
shall be reported to the nearest five minutes.<<HEADING_END>>
