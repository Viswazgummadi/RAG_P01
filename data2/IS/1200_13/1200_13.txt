<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering (Excluding River Valley Projects)
Sectional Committee, CED 44<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Fifth Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Methods of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering (Excluding River
Valley Projects) Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement occupies a very important place in planning and execution of any civil engineering
work from the time of first estimates to final completion and settlement of payments of the project.
The methods followed for measurement are not uniform and considerable differences exist
between practices followed by different construction agencies and also between various Central
and State Government departments. While it is recognized that each system of measurement has
to be specifically related to the administrative and financial organizations within the department
responsible for work, a unification of the various systems at technical level has been accepted as
very desirable, specially as it permits a wider circle of operation for civil engineering contractors
and eliminates ambiguities and misunderstandings arising out of the inadequate understanding of
various systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Among various civil engineering items, measurement of building had been first to be taken up for
standardization and this standard, having provisions relating to all building works, was first
published in 1958 and then revised in 1964. In its second revision, the standard was issued in
different parts corresponding to different trades in building and civil engineering works. This part
covering methods of measurement of white-washing, colour washing, distempering and painting
applicable to building as well as civil engineering works was, therefore, issued as a second revision
in 1970. The third revision of the standard was published in 1976 and the fourth revision in 1987.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This fifth revision has been brought out to incorporate the changes found necessary in light of the
usage of this standard and the suggestions made by various bodies implementing it. The principal
modifications made are in respect of conversion of areas of uneven surfaces into equivalent plain
areas, wherein provision for sponge finished plaster has also been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for preparation of this standard is given at
Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 6.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (May 2002). Side bar indicates modification of the
text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a measurement, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
