<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 2% Sovember
1986, after the draft finalized
by the Water
Supply
and Sanitation
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 For the majority
of water
supply
systems;
tuberculation
presents
no
problem;
however,
in certain
cases, uncoated
or unlined
cast iron water
mains
had lost an appreciable
part
of their
original
carrying
capacity
after
many
years
of service.
In these relatively
limited
areas,
reduced
carrying
capacity
was
generally
caused
by
tuberculation,
a nodulose
growth
on
the inside
of the pipe caused
by tuberculating
water.
It is
now known,
and has been
conclusively
demonstrated,
that
the use
of
cement
linings
prevents
tuberculation
by
keeping
the “active”
water
from coming
into contact
with
the iron.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The principal
advantage
of cement
linings
is
increased
carrying
capacity
when
the pipe is new and maintained
carrying
capacity
as the
pipe grows older since
experience
has
shown
that
less friction
results
when
cement
linings
are used even where non-tuberculating
waters
are
transported.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this
standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of
a test
or
analysis,
shall
be rounded
off
in
accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of
significant
places
retained
in
the
rounded
off
value
should
be the same as that of the
specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.  METHOD
OF LINING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Lining
of Pipe aad Fittings
-
The
cement
mortar
of the lining
is cast centifugally
inside the pipe.
Fittings
shall be lined
by
a process
that
will produce
lining conforming
to the requirements
of this standard;
such lining
may be carried
out by one of the following
methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Centifugally
spraying
and
subsequent
rotated
to
achieve
smoothing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Centrifugahy
spraying
and
simultaneously
smoothing
by
trowelling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The waterway
surfaces
of pipe
and
fittings
shall
be
completely
covered
with
the specified
mortar.
The
mortar
lining shall be entirely
free from cavities or visible air bubbles
and shall be thoroughly
compacted
throughout.
The consistency
of the mortar
and the time
and
speed
of
centrifuging
of the pipe shall be adjusted
so that
segregation
of the sand
from
the
cement
is reduced
to minimum.
Vibration
may be applied
to shorten
further
the duration
of rotation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Repair
of Defective
or Damaged
Areas of Linings
-
Defective
or
damaged
areas
of
linings
may
be
patched
by cutting
out the
defective
or damaged
lining
to the metal so that the edges
of the
lining
not
removed
are
perpendicular
or
slightly
undercut.
A stiff mortar
shall be prepared
in accordance
with
2.4.
The
cut-out
area
and
the
adjoining
lining shall be thoroughly
wetted,
and the mortar
applied
and
trowled
smooth
with the adjoining
lining.
.4fter

OF THICKNESS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  Lining
thickness
shall
be
determined
on
the
freshly

at intervals
frequent
enough
to assure compliance.
Thickness
of lining
may be determined
by means
of a steel
pin
not
larger
than
1.5 mm
in
diameter
or
on
a hardened
mortar
by means
of a non-
destructive
measurement
process.
The lining
shall be
measured
at four
equidistant
points on two cross sections
of the barrel
at each
end
of the
pipe or fittings.
The first set shall be at least 200 mm from
the respective
ends of the nioe or fitting.
The
second
set shall be
made
as far into
the
interior’
df the
pipe-or
fitting
as can
be readily
reached
injuring
the lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.  CURING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  The lining shall be cured in such a manner
as to produce
a properly
hydrated
mortar
lining
that
is hard
and
durable
and will otherwise
meet the requirements
of  10.
After final setting of lining
mortar,
curing
water
may
be
applied
by
laying
sprinkler
hose
at the invert.
The
curing may also be effected
by covering
with a layer
of sacking,
canvas,
hessian
or similar
materials
and kept constantly
wet for at least 7 days<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

shall
be
protected
from
direct
sun
light
by
putting
moist
hessian
or similar
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Membrane curing may also be used with approved curing components
in lieu of the moist curing with the permission of the Engineer-in-Charge.
Such
compounds shall be applied as soon as the mortar has set.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10. LINING

<<PARAGRAPH>>Longitudinal
cracks
developed
due to shrinkage,
less than 225 mm

or less than the nominal
diameter,
whichever

are
permitted.
Circumferential

Surface
crazing

<<HEADING level=3>>11. LINING
OF SPECIALS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  Whenever
practicable,
special
shall
be
made from cut lengths
of
matured
lined straight
pipes.
The lining
shall be cut back
from the end
to ends to be bevelled
and welded,
for a sufficient
distance
to ensure that
any of the mortar
which is intended
to remain
as part of lining
shall not
suffer damage
by the cutting
or welding
process.
The
lining
shall
be
made good by rendering
by hand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.1  Hand
rendering
of
specials
shall
consist
of
freshly
mixed
mortar
of a mixture
equivalent
to
that
of the lining being repaired,
and shall be thoroughly

and finished
to
a smooth
surface
of
the correct
form.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.  SEAL COAT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1  The
seal coat as pore sealer may be applied
to the surface
of lining
with
the
prior
approval
of engineer-in-charge.
The
seal coat shall be
continuous
and shall adhere
to
the
mortar
lining
at all
points.
The
seal
coat
after
drying
for at least 48 hours,
shall have no harmful
effect
to the quality
of the water
or on the lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
