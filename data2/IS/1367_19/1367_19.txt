<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
(Part 19) which is identical
with IS0 3800 : 1993 ‘Threaded

issued by the International

(ISO), was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on the recommen-
dation of Bolts, Nuts and Fasteners

Sectional
Committee
and approval
of the Light
Mechanical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The text of the International
Standard
has been approved
as suitable
for publication
as an Indian
Standard without
deviation.
Certain terminology
and conventions
are not identical
with those used
in Indian Standards.
Attention
is drawn to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Wherever the words ‘International
Standard’appear,
referring to this standard,
they should be
read as ‘Indian Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Comma ( , ) has been used as a decimal marker while in Indian Standards
the current practice
is to use a point ( . ) as the decimal
marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this adopted standard, reference appears to certain International

depends, on the selected statistical

and the required prediction

for the probabili-

<<PARAGRAPH>>A comparative
assessment
of fatigue strength values
is only possible when the tests and ?he evaluation
of
results are carried out in a uniform manner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fatigue strength
values can be determined
in the fi-
nite life range (failure of all test pieces before a pra-
determined
number of stress cycles is reached) and
in the transition
range where, up to the predetermined
number
of stress cycles
(in general
5 x IO6 to 10’
stress cycles), failures as well as non-failures
will oc-
cur (see figure 10). As a  function
of the test objective,
the fatigue
tests are carried out and evaluated
ac-
cording to two methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum
number
of test pieces should not be
less than six.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The scatter in the finite life range on one stress !evel

<<PARAGRAPH>>The test in the finite life range is the test for obtaining

<<PARAGRAPH>>cles  NG,  the load amplitude is subsequently increased
until the first test piece fails. In the example, this is
the load amplitude  F,,
=  4 000 N.  Carry out several
tests on the level on which there is now for the first
time an event (failure or non-failure) deviating from the
previous tests. Thereby the number of test pieces
depends on the required accuracy of the result. In this
example, the number of test pieces is eight. For the
selection of the second load amplitude, it is advan-
tageous to know the width of the transition range; this
allows the second level to be chosen, in a math-
ematically useful way, at its limit where the expected
result becomes more exact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Test the first test piece at a stress level which shall
be as close as possible to the expected median of the
transition range. If failure occurs, decrease stepwise
the load for the next test pieces (the same step size)
until there is non-failure. After a non-failure, increase
the load stepwise until failure occurs. If non-failure is
recorded for the first test piece, the procedure is re-
versed. In practice, the procedure very quickly centres
on the median and, in the case of a large number of
test pieces and a favourable position of the starting
stress level, the frequencies of failure and non-failure
are the same or nearly the same. The event occurring
less frequently as a whole is used for the calculation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedure for the arc sine method is similar to
that for the boundary method. Carry out fatigue tests
on several equidistant alternating load levels with the

these levels, calculate the corres

<<PARAGRAPH>>At least 14 specimens are required for the test, that
is 2 specimens for each of four stress amplitude lev-
els (8 pieces in total) in order to determine the inclined
part of the S/N cutve, and 6 specimens in order to
determine the horizontal part because the staircase
method requires a small number of specimens. Since
the test does not always proceed, in practice, as
shown in figure 11 and there are some cases where
more than 14 specimens are required, reserve some
extra specimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
