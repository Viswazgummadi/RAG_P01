<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the
Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft finalized by the Soils and Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee,
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With a view to establish uniform procedures
for the determination
of different
characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating
comparative
studies
of the results, an Indian Standard methods
of test for soils ( IS  :  2720 ) has been published in 41 parts.
This part deals with the deter-
mination of moisture content-dry
density relation of soil using a constant mass of dry soil. This
is a rapid
method and is essentially useful as a field control
method.
It may be used as a
substitute
for the tests covered by IS 2720 ( Part 7 )  :  1980 ‘Methods of test for soils: Part 7
Determination
of water content-dry
density relation
using light compaction
(  second revision )’
and IS 2720 ( Part 8 )  :  1983 SMethods of test for soils: Part 8 Determination
of water
content-
dry density relation using heavy compaction
(  second revision )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1971.
In this revision
apart
from
general
updation,
the
amendment
issued has been incorporated.
Further the revision has been made in SI units only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the results of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall
be done in accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

down the
method
for
the

of the
dry

to have a combined height
of about 550 mm
and a total mass of 2.6 kg.
The rod shall also
carry a cap for the tube.
The rammer
shall
have a drop of 310 mm.
When the rammer
is
resting on the base plate without the specimen
the position of the
rod touching
the
cap of
the tube shall be marked zero.
The rod
shall
then be marked
in cm and mm
upto 8 cm,
downwards from zero.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -As
the  internal
diameter
of the tube
is
50 mm and dry mass of  soil for each stage in the
test is 200 g, if R is the reading on the rod of the
rammer
(height
of compacted
soil in the tube)
in centimetres,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>200 g  of oven-dried
soil shall be taken.
If IV
percent is the
moisture
content
of the
air-
dried soil sample obtained in accordance
with
5.2,  then for 200 g of oven dried soil for each
test the mass of the air-dried soil to be taken
will be ( 200 + 2 w ) g. Water
shall be added
in measured
quantity
so as to have a known
moisturezontent
on the oven-dry
mass of soil.
This shall be thoroughly
mixed with a spatula
and then
poured
into
the mould.
The wet
soil shall be given 8 blows of the rammer
for
light compaction
tests and 36 blows of the
rammer
for heavy
compaction
tests falling
through a height
of 310 mm.
The height
of
the compacted
mass shaI1 be read from the
calibration
on the rod.
Similar tests
shall be
carried
out
with
increasing
percentage
of
moisture,
each
time
using a fresh
specimen
obtained from the sample in 5.2 so as to have
enough points even after the volume has started
increasing after decreasing
initially.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
