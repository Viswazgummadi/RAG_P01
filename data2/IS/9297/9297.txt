<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 October
1979,
after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Dam
Sections
(Non-overflow)
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard
lays the guidelines
for
provision
of
various
facilities
such as
lighting,
ventilation,
water
supply,
etc,
inside
dams so as to
achieve
maximum
productivity
coupled
with high standard
of safety
and
welfare.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Proper
lighting
inside
dams
is essential
for
creating
good
visual
environment
and for permitting
a high degree of efficiency
in seeing what-
ever equipment/machinery
is of special importance.
Lighting
is considered
good when it is suitable
both in quality
and quantity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
To cater for the requirement
of fresh
air
inside
the Adam galleries
which
are
not normally
connected
to outside
atmosphere,
provision
of
good ventilation
system to ensure the required
number
of air changes
is
essential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 The other
facilities
recommended
in this standard
for provision
inside
dams
include
water supply, compressed
air supply, drainage
system, fire-
fighting
system,
telephone
system,
elevators,
entrance
doors and first-aid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
covers the
requirements
of lighting,
ventilation
and
other facilities
such as water supply, compressed
air supply,
drainage,
fire
fighting,
telephone
system,
elevators
and first
aid
inside
dams
and
the
methods
of achieving
the same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  LIGHTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 General
-
Good and proper lighting
is a necessity
inside
all
dams
and
has
certain
primary
requirements.
Lighting
Iinstallation
should<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:9297 - 1979<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>provide
satisfactory
illumination
so as to allow
personnel
to
carry
out
their
task without
any strain
on the eye.
There
should
be spatial distri-
bution
of light.
This includes the combination
of diffused and directional
light, the distribution
of luminances,
the amount
of homogeneity
and the
amount
of glare.
It is necessary
not only to provide a sufficient
quantity
of light but also ensure proper quality
OF light depending
upon
the
type,
location
and
brightness
of light source.
The light source should provide
minimum
of glare;
its brightness
should be kept to a low value and
shall
be located
in such
a way that it does not come within the direct line of
vision.
In further
combating
glare,
good screening
of light
source
shall
be ensured.
The mounting
height can also help in preventing
glare.
The
light source shall be placed higher
up in order to remove
the
disturbing
brightness
as far as possible
from the centre of visuai field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1
An important
aspect
of lighting
is to
select
proper
colour
for
the
walls,
ceiling,
floor
and
equipment
in the area so as to reduce
the
brightness
contrasts
between
adjacent
surfaces.
In the selection
of room
colours,
the reflection
factors of the colours
shall be given due considera-
tion.
Glossy paints and highly polished
surfaces,
especially
those of metal
are often a source of eye irritation
and should be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2
Another
important
aspect of lighting
is that
it determines
the
atmosphere
in
a location
to a larger extent that is cool, warm,
pleasant,
gay or sobre.
Efficient
lighting
not only makes the space
visible
but its
quality
accentuates
its
character
and
thus
becomes
an integral
part of
the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.3
In the event of sudden failure of supply, it is necessary
to
have
provision
for
emergency
lighting,
at essential
points like stairways,
adits
cross galleries
and near instruments,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Lllumination
Levels
-  The general
illumination
levels required
for
various
locations
inside the dam are given below.
Special
circumstances
may require
higher
intensities
than
those
normally
encountered
inside
dams.
The
intensities
given
below
are the average
illumination
values
maintained
on the work plane:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9297 - 1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.1  The recommended
level of illumination
of emergency
lighting
required
for various
locations
inside dams is of the order of lo-20 lux.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Lighting Fixtures -
The illumination
level is only one phase of the
task of seeing.
The source of theillumination
flux is just as important
as
its density.
The lighting
fixtures to be provided
at various locations
inside
the
dam
should
be so chosen as to provide
sufficient
illumination
on the
working
plane and to blend suitably
with the environments.
The
choice
of
the
luminairs
should
also
be
based
on the
total economics
of the
installation
over a period
of time including
the
annual
costs
of energy
and
maintenance.
This
means
that
in
most
cases lamps with higher
luminairs
efficiency
and
luminair
meeting
equal
quality
standards
as
regards
glare, etc, but with higher
output ratio,
are more advantageous
in
the long run.
In deciding
upon the choice
of the luminair,
the following
points are recommended
to be kept in view:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4
b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Discharge
lamps are more efficient than incandescent
lamps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lamps
with reflectors
are
more
efficient
than
those
without
rrflcctors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The higher
the wattage,
the more efficient
is the lamp.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Luminairs
which are easily maintained

<<HEADING level=3>>2.3.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The type of lighting
fixtures generally
recommended
for different
--.
galleries
in a dam are given at 2.3.1.1
to 2.3.1.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1.1
The requirement
of illumination
in inspection
galleries
is
more
of a functional
nature.
These
galleries
generally
have a very low
ceiling
height,
conscqucntly
recesses are formed
in the
ceiling
to
accom-
modate
the lighting
fixtures.
The spacing
recommended
is between
5 to
6’5 metres depending
upon the height
of the galleries.
In case
sufficient
head
room
is not available,
bulkhead
fitting may be provided
on the side
walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1.2
In case of inspection
and drainage
galleries
where
the
above
types
of recesses
cannot
be
formed,
incandescent
bulkhead
lighting
fixtures
are recommended.
These
are generally
installed
on the
fillet
of
the galleries
so that walls or ceilings
do not remain
dark.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1.3
In galleries
which
are
frequently
in
use,
such
as visitors
galleries,
fluorescent
light
fixtures
in
recesses
are recommended.
The
lighting
fixtures
can
be
with
either
perspex
cover or with
polystyrene
louvres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1.4
For equipment
galleries,
industrial

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9297 -  1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>lighting
fixtures
are
installed
on
the
ceiling.
The
bulkhead
lighting
fixtures
can also be installed
on the walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4  Wiring
-
All wiring shall be in conduits.
The joints
shall be
made
in junction
boxes provided
for the purpose
through
porcelain
connectors.
Screws in the porcelain
connectors
shall be kept tight
and
smeared
with
plastic
compound
to prevent
entry of moisture.
Temporary
connections,
straps or wires shall be made good as far as possible.
Untidy
porcelain
connectors
with loose screwed connections
are a potential
source of trouble
and should
be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Additional
plug points may be provided
in
the
galleries
for
special
lighting
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  VENTILATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 General
-
Galleries
inside dams
are
not
adequately
connected
to
outside atmosphere.
It is, therefore,
necessary
to provide positive
means of
ventilation
in the galleries.
Ventilation
is required
for supplying
fresh air,
diluting
inside air vitiated
by body odours,
relief of dampness,
removing
contaminants
in
air,
if any,
and
providing
thermal
environments
for
maintaining
heat balance
of the body for comfort
of working
personnel
in
the galleries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Recommended
Values
for Air Changes
-
Requirement
of
fresh
air supply to the galleries
may be very small as the number
of occupants
is
usually very low.
A minimum
of two
air
changes
per
hour
may
be
provided
( a change
per hour means that quantity
of air equivalent
to the
total volume of galleries
is supplied to and exhausted
from
the
galleries
each
hour ).
However,
for lavatories,
a minimum
of six air changes
per
hour should be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Mechanical
Ventilation
-
As the volume
of air to be
supplied
to
and
exhausted
from
galleries
is large, means of mechanical
ventilation
may
be
provided.
Mechanical
ventilation
can
be
effected
either
by
exhaust
of air or by positive ventilation
or combination
of the
two.
In
case
exhaust
method
cannot
be applied to the galleries,
because
of their
layout
the air should be supplied into the galleries
by centrifugal
or axial
fans through
ducting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1
Selection
of the fans shall
be
made
after
calculating
the
head
required
( in cm of water)
to overcome
the resistance
in the
duct
system
and by the characteristics
of the
fans.
Air
intake
openings
shall be
provided
with storm proof louvers and screens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
Where
temperature
and humidity
control
is required
inside
the
galleries,
air-conditioning/dehumidification
may be resorted
to.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
