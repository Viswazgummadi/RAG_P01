<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 20
*January
1982,
after the
draft
finalized
by the Soil
Engineering
and Rock Mechanics
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Undisturbed
samples
of
soil are required
for a number
of soil tests,
such as unconfined
compression
test, consolidation
test,
permeability
test
and triaxial
compression
test. It has been recognized
that it is not practi-
cable
to obtain
a truly undisturbed
sample,
but if certain
procedures
and
precautions
are
observed,
it is possible
to get
relatively
undisturbed
samples
which may be considered
sufficient
keeping
in view the nature
of
tests to be performed
on these samples.
This
code deals with the method
of obtaining
such samples
using
this wall sampler
with stationary
piston,
which are normally
used for clay and silt formation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test
or
analysis,
shall
be
rounded
off
in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in
the rounded
off
value
should
be
the same
as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the
piston rod, at its end outside
the sampler,
is connected
to a steel member,
known
as piston extension
( PE ) rod, which
has
the
same
diameter
as
that of the piston rod.
This
rod is generally
of 12 mm
diameter
and
it
operates
inside the
hollow
drill rod.

Assembling
of
Sampler
-
In
assembling
the
sampler,
close the
ventilation
arrangement
of
the
piston,
and check
if the backward
and
forward
movements
of the piston
inside the sampling
tube
are
without
obstruction.
Connect
it to the sampler
head tightly
using screws.
The
assembled
sampler
shall be stored properly
so as to protect
the edge of the
sampling
tube against
damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3
The
depth
of the bottom
of the
casing,
if used
below
ground
level, and water level in the borehole
shall be noted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4
Sampling
shall
be
done
as soon as possible
after the clean-out
operation
and shall not be done after an interval,
for
example,
where
a
borehole
has been cleaned
out and left overnight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.5
Lowering
of
the Sampler
-
While
lowering
the sampler
into the
borehole,
the piston  is  kept at its lowest point thus closing
the
lower
end
of the
sampler
and
preventing
the entry of any foreign
matter
into the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_12>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:10108
- 1982<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>sampler.
The conical
ball bearing
catch,
termed
as piston
rod
lock
in
Kg.
2, prevents
the
piston
rod from slippin, (I tlo\vnward
with respect to
the head of the sampler.
To prevent
upward
movement
of the
piston as
the sampler
is lowered
into
the
borehole,
the
piston
rod
has
a short
section
of left-handed
threads
which
engages
a matching
section
of
threads
in the sampler
head.
Uy rotating
the piston extension
rod counter-
clockwise,
the rod is threaded
into the sampler
Ilead
and
the
piston
is
locked
at
the
bottom
of the sampler.
The principle
of this operation
is
explained
by
a simplified
diagram
in
Fig.
GA.
When
the
sampler
reaches
the bottom
of the borehole,
hold the drill rod by a rod holder
to
prevent
sinking
of the sampler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.6
Pene!ration of Sampling Tube -
After lowering
the sampler
up ,to
the desired
depth in the
borehole,
give
several
clockwise
turns
to the
piston extension
rod,
so that
the piston gets released
from the sampler.
Now fix the piston extension
rod with the stationary
tower,
as shown
in
Fig. 5, so that
the piston remains
stationary
at the level of the bottom
of
the borehole.
Ensure
that the tower which supports
the piston
extension
rods is rigid,
as any
downward
movement
of the piston at the time of
penetration
of the sampling
tube will cause over-compression
of the
soil
sample.
Next,
by an
apparatus
mentioned
in 3.5, push the sampling
tube
into
the
soil
for
a length
which
is at least
90 percent
of
the
effective
sampling
length
of the
tube,
as
explained
in
2.1.7.
The
principle
of this
operation
is explained
by
a simplified
diagram
in
Fig.
6B.
The
sampler
should
be
made
to
penetrate
quickly
by
a
continuous
action
without
giving
shock
to it.
The
rate
of
penetra-
tion should
be preferably
10 to 15 cm per second.
In case the penetration
has to be stopped
midway,
record
its depth.
In
case the
soil becomes
stiffer
midway
of penetration
and
the sampler
cannot
be pushed
any
more,
do not push it by force but terminate
sampling
at that
depth
and
record
the same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measure
the sampling
length which
is equal to the extent of displace-
ment of the drill rod with respect

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.6.1
The following
precautions
during
penetration
of the sampling
tubes may also be taken:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) There
must not be
any
rotation
of
the
sampling
tube
during
downward
movement
and penetration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The total penetration
should
not
exceed
the
net
length
of the
sampler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.7
L$ting the Sampler -
The
sampler
should
be teared
at its bottom
by giving
rotation
before
lifting
it out, taking
sufficient
care not
to
give
any shock to the sampler.
After completion
of the driving
it is advisable<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Disembarkment
of the Sampler
-
The  sampler
shall
be disconnected
after
confirming
whether
the soil sample
is  secured
or
partly
dropped
out.
Before
extracting
the
piston
from
the
sampling
tube,
loosen the
ventilation
arrangement
in the piston,
and be careful
not
to deform
the
tube or to give shock to the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -
In very loose sand and silty soil below water table, provision
of core
catcher made of spring leaves at the cutting edge of the sampler, may be necessary
to avoid loss of sample  while lifting  it ( set Fig. 7 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2-
For minimising the disturbances
further, the thin  wall  piston  sampler
should
be operated
hydraulically,
for which the kit may be modified. to suit the
principle
of operation
explained
in Fig. 8.
It confers two  advantages,
namely,
(a) needs only one set  ofrods,
that “, ordinary
drill rods,  and (b) at full stroke, a
hole in the position rod releases the ~011  preawre and avoids overdriving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
