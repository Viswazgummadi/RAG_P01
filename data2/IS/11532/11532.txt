<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
final&d
by the River Training and Control Works Sectional Committee had been approved by River
Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>River embankment
(levee) is an artificial bank built along a river for the purpose of protecting adjacent
land from inundation by flood. Such type of structure is also called embankment, levee, ‘stop-bank’, ‘bund
or ‘dyke’  .  Construction
of embankment to control flood is an age-old practice and is still being followed
due to its proven suitability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Previously construction
and maintenance of river embankments were covered in two Indian Standards,
namely IS 11532  :  1985 ‘Guidelines for construction of river embankments
(levees)’ and IS 12028  :  1987
‘Guidelines for maintenance
of river embankments
(levees)‘. For the convenience
of users it was felt
necessaty to amalgamate these two standards and accordingly, the present revision has been taken up.
With the publication of this revised standard, IS 12028  :  1987 ‘Guidelines for maintenance
of river
embankments (levees)’ shall stand withdrawn. In this revision some of the provisions given in the earlier
standards have been modified based on the current practices in the iield and experience gained with the
use of the standards in addition to incorporating a table giving approximate values of maximum dry density
and optimum moisture content for different types of soil. Soil classification given in this standard is based
on IS 1498  :  1970 ‘Classification and identification of soils for general engineering purposes  cfirsfrevision)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers the guidelines regarding
construction and maintenance of river embank-
ments (levees).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

row pits from the toe of the embankments as well
as the depth of borrow pits should generally be as

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Construction of an embankment shoulden-
visage, for the sake of economy, maximum utiliza-
tion of natural unprocessed materials available
locally. Embankments may be homogeneous or
zoned. They should generally be of compacted roll
fill at controlled moisture content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Investigation of borrow areas, their location and
depth of excavation, foundation preparation,
earthwork, compaction, moisture control and slope
protection are the important aspects to be carefully
attended to during construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.7 In order to obviate development of flow
parallel to embankment, cross bars of width eight
times the depth of borrow pits spaced at 50 to 60
metres centre-to-centre should be left in the bor-
row pits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Borrow Pits<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1 Borrow areas should preferably be located on
the river side of the proposed embankment, be-
cause they get silted up in course of time, whereas
those located on the countryside remain a per-
manent disfiguration and are liable to induce or
aggravate seepage under the embankment, thereby
causing increased maintenance problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.8 All borrow areas/pits should be stripped of
the top soil, sod, loam and other objectionable
materials considered unsuitable for use in the
embankment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3 Lttboratory  Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For important and also for embankments higher
than 6 m, representative samples obtained from the
borrow areas should be tested in the laboratory to
determine the engineering properties of soils, such
as gradation, permeability, plastic limits, shear
strength,  dry  density, compaction tests, etc. as given
in design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2 For low embankment less than 6 m in height,
borrow areas should not be selected within 25 m
from the toe/heel of the embankment. In case of
higher embankment the distance should not be less
than 50 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3 Preliminary soil investigation may be done
from a few representative auger holes or borrow
pits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Preparation of Foundation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  seat of the embankment should be properly
prepared for fill placement. It should be  ensured
that  all stumps, brush, large roots, top soii and
other objectionable
materials are completely
removed before placement of the fill. Any ridges or
mounds, which are in line of embankment, should
be loosened by ploughing or stepped or dug or
provided with V-cut benching at intervals  running<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.4 After selection of an area apparently suitable
for borrow pits in accordance with 2.2.1,2.2.2
and 2.2.3, detailed investigations should be under-
taken for a systematic mapping and determination
of engineering properties such as gradation,
permeability, plastic limits, etc, of the soils in the
borrow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.5.4  Remodelling of Embankments<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5.1  Embankment Bofile<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When adding new earthwork to existing embank-
ment, the old bank should first be cut or benched
into steps with the treads sloping slightly towards
the centre of the embankment
and the surface of
the old work should be wetted so that new earth
may adhere to the old. Similarly, junctions should
be made by cutting grips or forks in the side slopes
of the  old embankment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A complete
profile of the embankment
with its
correct height, width and all slopes dressed to true
form should be laid by pegs, bamboo posts and
strings at 50 m intervals or by actual construction
of the embankment of 3 m length at 150 m intervals.
The actual construction
should, however, be done
by giving suitable settlement allowances which may
be about 1 to 2 percent of the embankment height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5.5  Incomplete Embankment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5.2  Embankment Involving Mechanical
Compaction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case the whole length is not taken up simul-
taneously,
the incomplete
embankment
should
have steps not steeper than overall longitudinal
slope of 1 in 5 to permit satisfactory bond with the
portion to be taken up iater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of embankment involving mechanical com-
paction, the materials free from all organic matter
should be compacted in layers of 15 to 20 cm for the
full width of the embankment
and carried up
regularly in accordance with embankment section.
All clods should be broken up to a size having not
more than 5 cm diameter. Each layer should be
properly
watered
and compacted.
The surface
should be well graded and crowned in the centre so
that during rain the surface water is carried rapidly
to the slopes of the fill.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.6  Compaction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.1  The basic
criteria
of the quality
and
suitability of the work done is the degree of com-
paction attained. For effective quality control of
compaction,
data on optimum moisture content
and maximum dry density obtained from laboratory
compaction tests are required. For small embank-
ments, in the absence of such laboratory
data,
values given in Table 1 may be used. The best result
is obtained by spreading materials with a moisture
content 1 to 2 percent less than the optimum mois-
ture content in layers of limited thickness and roll-
ing with properly designed rollers with sufficient
number of passes. Smooth contact surface between
successive layers should be avoided and unifor.m
density throughout the fill should be achieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.5.3  Embankment Involving Manual Compaction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of embankment
involving manual compac-
tion, the layers not exceeding
15 cm thickness
should be placed slightly sloped towards the centre
of the crest so that rainfall will naturally
con-
solidate the embankment
during the construction.
The materials should be free from organic matter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>the structure of the embankment when shaken by
wind storm which, in turn, causes cracks and leaks.
Shrubs, thorny bushes and short grass growing on
the slopes of embankments provide good protec-
tion against erosions, wave wash and stray cattle.
Generally the side slopes and 0.6 metre width in top
from the edges of the embankments should be
turfed with grass sods and this turfing should extend
beyond the toe to country-side and the river side by
6.0 metres and 3.0 metres respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.2 Compaction of each layer of fill materials
should proceed in systematic, orderly and con-
tinuous manner so as to ensure the specified
coverage by the compactors. Sheepfoot roller or
tamping type roller is generally accepted as the best
available means of ensuring proper compaction  for
average type embankment material. The accept-
able limit of compaction as compared to the dry
density at optimum
moisture content would
depend on the desired shear strength for the
stability of side slopes. For mechanical compaction
the minimum compaction should be 90 percent and
for manual compaction 85 percent. Adequate
quality control and field tests are needed to ensure
this.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 MAINTENANCE
3.1 Proper maintenance of embankments is ex-
tremely important as breaches in them can be dis-
astrous and may cause even greater damage than
the inundation by the floods where no embank-
ments are provided. The maintenance work can be
divided into 2 parts:
a) Pre-monsoon maintenance, and
b) Monsoon maintenance.
3.1.1 Pre-monsoon Maintenance<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.3 If the soil is granular with practically no
cohesion, road rollers are considered quite ade-
quate for compaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.4 Those parts of the fill which cannot be
reached by rolling equipment
should receive
equivalent manual compaction or mechanical
tampers. Particular care should be taken for
suitable compaction and jointing of embankments
with the structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.1 Existing embankments have to be repaired
or reconditioned to the original designed section in
advance for their efficient performance during the
ensuing monsoons. The free board may be checked
up for any rise in the bed level of the river or other
constrictions which may result in higher design
flood level and provided/maintained accordingly.
3.1.1.2 All hollows
and depressions
in the
embankment’s section, wherever existing, should
be made up with rammed earth after clearing the
site of all loose and vegetal materials. Where the
top material is sandy or silty, it is desirable to
provide a cover of soil containing 10 to 15 percent
of clay well rammed or rolled.
3.1.1.3 A register of leaks should be maintained
indicating the location and action taken during the
monsoon period. The leaks, which could not be
fully treated during the monsoon period, should be
attended to immediately afterwards. Such leakage
sites should be opened in the full width of the
embankment taking care to trace to its upstream
ends, and then be refilled with good earth in 15
centimetre layers, watered and rammed, the old
earth being stepped or benched back at the sides
and new earthwork properly bonded and interlock-
ed into the old.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7 Moisture Control for Mechanical Compaction<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7.1 Proper moisture control of the material is
very important in order to ensure proper compac-
tion. Materials may be conditioned to the desired
moisture content either at the site of excavation, on
the embankment or under same condition at both
the borrow pit and during placement. It is necessary
that some rapid and convenient
methods be
employed
to determine
whether or not the
materials have the desired moisture content as they
are placed on embankment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.7.2 The penetration resistance needle, which
makes use of the penetration resistance-moisture
relation for the material being placed, is very useful
for the purpose. It is desirable to establish field
laboratories to carry out tests  in the field while
compaction operation goes on.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8  Slope Protection<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface protection of embankment against ac-
tion of rain and wind is usually achieved by turfing.
In case of embankment
using non-cohesive
material, a cover of 0.3 to 0.6 m thick  cohesive
material can be given. Since velocities along river
side slopes of embankment are expected to be low,
no slope protection may ordinarily be required and
turfing on both sides may suffice. If river action is
more severe, suitably designed slope protection
should be adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.4 Rodents and other animals make holes,
cavities and tunnels through and under embank-
ments. These are sources of danger causing leakage
and excessive seepages which may give rise to
serious breaches during flood period. Such holes
should be carefully located, examined, provided
with an inverted filter, filled with earth and
rammed. Alternatively such holes should be filled
with well rammed stiff clay.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.8.1 The planting of trees on embankment should
not  be permitted because their roots tend ta loasen<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

watered and compacted, and brought to the design
section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2.2  Special
vigilance
is necessary
in the
countryside of the embankment to detect any for-
mation of boils due to seepage. This should be
immediately  attended  to by providing loading berm
to counter balance exit gradient. A suitable filter
material may be placed around the boil below the
loading berm to arrest fines in seepage water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.6  For embankments
which were severely
threatened
by erosion during the previous mon-
soon, revetment/rip
rap or other river training
works should
be separately
examined.
Where
stones or bricks, etc, are costly, cheaper means like
brushwood matting, etc, may be used. In case of
wave action, pitching should be taken at least
Cl.3 metre above the maximum height of wave ex-
pected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2.3 Water may seep through a sand stratum
under the levee and emerge on the countryside in
the form of bubbling springs. Under these condi-
tions, a stream of water bursts through the ground,
carrying with it sand which then settles around the
edge of the hole. These sandboils may be as large as
1 to 1.3 metres in diameter and may occur from 13
to 100 metres from the levee or even further away.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1.7 Approach roads and also top of embank-
ments,
wherever
they are designed
to carry
vehicular traffic, as well as ramps provided for in-
spection and maintenance should be kept in good
condition
so that they serve the purpose
of
transport of materials and inspections both during
the pre-monsoon and monsoon periods. No habita-
tion should be permitted on the embankments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a protective
measure embankments
of earth
filled sacks may be built around them thus ponding
the water and creating a head on the countryside
sufficient to stop the flow of silt through minimis-
ing the effective head of water. If other boils take
place outside this encircling embankment,
it may
be necessary to construct sub-levees around the

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2.5  Repair of rain cuts in the embankment,
stacking of material and machinery required for
repairing, putting the top of embankment in order,
etc, should also be made. Scouring and eroding
behaviour
of the river should also be carefully
watched
for taking
necessary
precautionary
measures. In this way, by means of proper vigilance
and timely action for repair works, flood disaster
can be reduced to a great extent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2.1 During monsoon, prompt maintenance of
the embankment
is required as the flood water of
river threatens the safety of the embankment most-
ly during this period. This is all the more important
in case of new embankments
and also in case of
those reaches of old embankments where breaches
occured in the past. The establishment required to
be engaged for proper maintenance of an embank-
ment will vary depending upon importance of the
embankment and behaviour of the river. As soon as
water touches the embankment
and river shows
rising trend of its water level, round the clock
patrolling
should
start by the establishment
engaged for this purpose and continue until water<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
