<<HEADING level=3>>CODE OF PRACTICE FOR
SUBSURFACE INVESTIGATION FOR
FOUNDATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>( First Revision)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
( First Revision)
was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 28 December 1979, after the draft finalized by the
Soil Engineering and Rock Mechanics Sectional Committee had been appro-
ved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2 A detailed investigation for site is essential before a design can be fina-
lized.
The object of subsurface and related site investigation is to provide
the engineer or architect with as much information
as possible about the
existing conditions,* for example, the exposed overburden, the course of a
stream nearby, a rock outcrop or a hillock, vegetation, and other geological
features of the  area.
It  is equally important to know the subsoil conditions
below a proposed structure.
0.2.1 The methods of subsurface investigation enable vertical sections of
the strata to be drawn and samples to be tested, on the site or in a labora-
tory for determining shear strength parameters, bearing capacity of the soil,
permeability, water table, type classification and other geophysical informa-
tion in the field.
This information, together with the normal topographical
survey, provides the engineer with complete details of the site and enables
him to prepare economical designs for the foundations.
0.2.2 Proper inspection and guidance in boring operations and investi-
gations are essential to ensure that the required data are obtained.
0.3 Because of the complexity
of natural deposits,
no one method of
exploration is best for all situations.
The choice depends upon the nature
of the material and on the purpose of the exploratory programme.
This
code is intended to summarize in a convenient form the information available
so that the desirable information may be obtained.
The code has been
prepared in relation to conditions and practices existing in India.
This
standard was published in year 1962. Based on further data collected in
past 18 years, this revision has been prepared.
0.4 Though this code is mainly intended to cover subsurface investigation
for foundations
of multi-storeyed buildings, most of the provisions
are<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1s :  1892 - 1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>generally applicable to other civil engineering works, such as roads! air
fields, bridges, marine works, etc. The following codes have been published
so far to cover special aspects of investigation for specific works:
*IS : 4078-1980 Code of practice for indexing and storage of drill
cores (first  revision ).
*IS : 4453-1980 Code of practice for exploration by pits, trenches,
drifts and shafts  (first revision ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

*IS  :  6926-1972 Code of practice for diamond core drilling for site
investigation for river valley projects.
*IS  :  69551973 Code of practice for subsurface exploration for earth
and rocktill dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In the formulation
of this standard, due weightage has been given to
imernational co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing in
different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement Of this
standard is complied with, the fmal value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS : 2-196Ot.
The’ number of significant places retained in the rounded  off  value should be
the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This  code deals mainly with subsurface investigations for foundations of
multi-storeyed buildings to determine,
a) Sequence and extent of each soil and rock stratum in the region
likely to be affected by the proposed work,
b) Nature of each stratum and engineering properties of soil and rock
which may affect design and mode of construction
of proposed
structures and their foundations, and
c) Location of ground water and possible corrosive effects of soil and
water on foundation materials.

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:1892-1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.1  Aspects relating to procuring representative samples of the soils and
rocks, obtaining general information
on geology, seismicity of the area,
surface drainage, etc, and subsurface investigations for availability of con-
struction materials are also mentioned briefly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.13 Most of the provisions of this code are also applicable to subsurface
investigation of underground
and overhead water tanks, swimming  ~001s
and ( abutments of) bridges, roads, air fields, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GENJSRAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  In areas which have already been developed, advantage should be taken
of existing local knowledge, records of trial pits, bore holes, etc, in the
vicinity, and the behaviour of existing structures, particularly
those of a
nature similar to that of the proposed structure.
In such cases, exploration
may be limited to checking that the expected soil conditions are those as in
the neighbourhood.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 If the existing information
is not sufficient or is inconclusive the site
should be explored in detail so as to obtain a knowledge of the type,
uniformity, consistence, thickness, sequence and dip of the strata and of the
ground water conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1  Site Reconnaissance -
Site reconnaissance would help in deciding
future programme
of field investigatiofis? that is, to assess the need for
preliminary or detailed investigations.
This would also help in determining
scope of work, methods of exploration
to be adopted, field tests to be
carried out and administrative arrangements required for the investigation.
Where detailed published information on the geotechnical conditions is not
available, an inspection of site and study of topographical features are help-
ful in getting information
about soil, rock and ground-water
conditions.
Site reconnaissance
includes a study of local topography,
excavations,
ravines, quarries, escarpments; evidence of erosion or landslides, behaviour
of existing structures at or near the site; water level in streams, water courses
and wells; flood marks; nature of vegetation; drainage pattern, location of
seeps, springs and swamps. Information on some of these may be obtained
from topographical
maps, geological maps, pedological and soil survey
maps, and aerial photographs.
2.2.1.1 Data regarding removal of overburden by excavation, erosion
or land slides should be obtained.
This gives an idea of the amount of
pm-consolidation
the soil strata has undergone.
Similarly, data regarding
recent f?lls is also important to study the consolidation characteristics of the
fill as well as the original strata.
2.213
The type of flora affords at times some indication of the nature
of the soil.
The extent of swamp and superficial deposits and peats will
usually be obvious. In general, such indications, while worth noting, require
to be conflrmed by actual exploration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>‘Is : 1892 - 1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1.3  Ground-water conditions T The  ground-water
level ff uctuates
and will depend upon the permeability ‘of the strata and the head causing
the water to flow. The water level in streams and water courses, if any, in
the neighbourhood, should be noted, but it may be misleading to take this
as an indication of the depth of the water table in the ground. Wells at
the site or in the vicinity give useful indications of the ground-water condi-
tions. Flood marks of rivers may indicate former highest water levels.
Tidal Auctuations may be of importance. There is also a possibility of
there being several water tables at ditferent levels, separated by impermeable
strata, and some of this water may be subject to artesian head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2  Enquiries Regarding Eatlfer Use of the Site -  In certain cases the
earlier uses of the site may have a very important bearing on proposed new
works.
This is particularly so in areas.where there have been underground
workings, such as worked-out ballast pits, quarries, old brick fields, coal
mines and mineral workings.
Enquiries
should be made regarding the
location
of shafts and workings,
particularly
shallow ones, where there
may be danger of collapse, if heavy new structures are superimposed.
2.2.2.1 The possibility of damage to sewers, conduits and drainage
systems by subsidence should also be investigated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3 Geophysical investigations
of the site may be conducted
at the
reconnaissance stage since it provides a simple and quick means of getting
useful information about stratifications.
Depending on these information,
detailed subsoil exploration
should -be planned.
Important
geophysical
methods available for subsoil exploration are:
a) electrical resistivity method, and
b)  seismic  method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3.1  Electrical resistivity methdd - The  electrical resistivity method,
in which the resistance to the flow of an electric current through the subsur-
face materiaIs is measured at intervals of the ground surface, may be useful
for the study of foundation problems and particularly for finding rock strata
under deep soil cover.
2.2.3.2  Seismic method - The  seismic method makes use pf the variation
of elastic properties of the strata which affect the .velocity of shock waves
travelhng through them, thus providing a usable tool for dynamic
elastic
moduli determinations in addition to the mapping  of the subsurf’
hori-
zons.
The required shock waves can be generated by hammer blows on the’
ground or by detonating a small charge of explosives.
This method is quite
useful in delineating the bedrock configuration and the geological structures
in the subsurface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3 Outline of Procedure
2.3.1  Number and Disposition of Trial Pits and Borings -  The disposttion
and spacing of the trial pits and borings should be such.  as  to reveal any<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  1892 - 1979<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>major changes in thickness, depth or properties of the strata over the base
area of the structure and its immediate surroundings.
The number and
spacing of bore holes or trial pits will depend upon the extent of the site
and the nature of structures coming on it.
For a compact building site
covering an area of about 0.4 hectare, one bore hole or trial pit in each
corner and one in the centre should be adequate.
For smaller and less
important buildings even one bore hole or trial pit in the centre will suffice.
For very large areas covering industrial and residential colonies, the geolo-
gical nature of the terrain will help in deciding the number of bore holes or
trial pits.
Cone penetration tests may be performed at every 50 m by divid-
ing the area in a grid pattern and number of bore holes or trial pits decided
by examining the variation in the penetration curves.
The cone penetration
tests may not be possible at sites having gravelly or boulderous strata.
In
such cases geophysical methods may be useful.
2.3.2  Depth of Exploration -  The depth of exploration required depends
on the type of proposed structure, its total weight, the size, shape and
disposition of the loaded areas, soil profile, and the physical properties of
the soil that constitutes each individual stratum.
Normally, it should be
one and a half times the width of the footing below foundation level.
In
certain cases, it may be necessary to take at least one bore hole or cone test
or both to twice the width of the foundation.
If a number of loaded areas
are in close proximity the effect of each is additive.
In such cases, the
whole of the area may be considered as loaded and exploration should
be carried out up to one and a half times the lower dimension.
In weak
soils, the exploration should be continued to a depth at which the loads
can be carried by .the stratum in question without undesirable qettlement
and shear failure.
In any case, the depth to which seasonal variations
affect the soil should be regarded as the minimum depth for the exploration
of sites.
But where industrial processes affect the soil characteristics this
depth may be more.
The presence of fast growing and water seeking trees
also contributes to the weathering processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Examples
of fast growing
and water
seeking
trees
are
Banyan
(  Fkus
ben&nsis
),  Pipal (  Ficus religiosa )  and Necm (  Azadirachta  indica ).
2.3.2.1 An estimate of the variation with depth of the vertical normal
stress in the soil arising from foundation loads may be made on the basis of
elastic theory.
The net loading intensity at any level below a foundation
may be obtained approximately by assuming a spread of load of two vertical
to one horizontal from all sides of the foundations,
due allowance being
made for the overlapping effects of load from closely spaced footings.
The
depth of exploration at the start of the work may be decided as given in
Table 1, which may be modified as exploration-proceeds,
if required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>wet weather, it is desirable to determine the fluctuation
of the water table
in order to ascertain the directions of the natural drainage, and to obtai.n
a clue to the design of intercepting drains to prevent the influx of ground
water on to the site from higher ground.
The seasonal variation in the
.  level of water table should also be noted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.2 If in the earlier stages of investigations, dewatering problems are
anticipated a detailed study should be carried out to ascertain the rate of
flow and seepage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.3 For deep excavation, the location of water-bearing strata should be
determined and the water pressure observed in each, so that necessary pre-
cautions may be taken during excavation, for example, artesian water in
deep strata may give rise to considerable difficulties unless precautions are
taken.
An idea of the steady level of water should be obtained.
Bore
holes, which have been driven, may be used for this purpose, but since water
levels in bore holes may not reach equilibrium for some time after boring,
these should be measured 12 to 24 h after boring and compared with water
levels in wells that may be available in the area.
It is seldom necessary
to make detailed
ground-water
observations in each one of a group of
closely spaced bore holes but sufficient observations should be made to
establish the general shape of the ground-water table; however, observations
should always be made in the first boring of the group.
The minimum
and maximum
ground-water
levels should be obtained from local sources
and wells in the area would also give useful information in this regard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.4 In making ground-water observations, it should be remembered that
in some localities there may be one or more isolated bodies of water or
perched ground-water
tables above the main ground-water
table.
The
formation
of perched ground-water
tables is caused by impervious
strata
which prevent the water from seeping down to the main body of ground
water.
The difference
in water levels in bore holes spaced reasonably
close to one another would indicate a perched water table.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Corrosive Soils, Waters and EfiIuents -
In certain localities, ground
water and soil may contain
constituents
in amounts
sufficient to cause
damage to foundations
of structures.
Cement concrete
is liable to be
attacked
by water containing
sulphates.
Some soils have a corrosive
action on metals, particularly
on cast iron, due to either chemical or
bacterial agency, and enquiry should be made in the locality to find if such
corrosion has previously occurred.
In  such cases a chemical analysis of the
soil should be made to assess the necessity of special precautions. Ground
water may be tested for its salt content, alkalinity or acidity, etc, for its
effect on foundations.
For the purpose of chemical analysis about 5 litres
of water should be collected from as near the bottom of the bore hole or
trial pit as possible and not from the top.
Water in the bore hole should be
pumped out completely and after 24 h the water which is collected in the
bore hole should again be pumped out and sample of water obtained as
near to the bottom as possible.
This will prevent erroneous collection of
water utilised in wash boring which is not the natural ground water.
The
water samples should be collected in plastic jerry cans filled up to the brim
and should be air tight for the purpose of chemical analysis in laboratory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6.1 In industrial areas, corrosive action may arise from industrial waste
products that have been dumped on the site.
Samples of such individual
waste products should be collected and chemically analysed in the labo-
ratory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6 Soil and Rocks - As the engineering
classification deals mainly with
soil as a material of construction, soil may be defined as that which com-
prises accumulations of solid particles, loose or cohesive deposits, such as
gravel, sand, silt, clay or any combination
thereof which is loose enough
to be removed with a spade or shovel in a dry or saturated state.
Their
depths may vary from deep lying geological deposits to agricultural surface
soils.
Correspondingly,
the term  ‘  rock  ’  may be applied to materials other
than the above, that is, natural beds or large hard fragments or original
igneous, sedimentary or metamorphic
formations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  Preliminary Exploration -
The scope  of  preliminary exploration is
restricted to the determination
of depths, thickness, extent and composition
of each soil stratum, location of rock and ground water and also to obtain
approximate information regarding strength in compressibility of the various

is not possible it is essential to carry out
preliminary investigation to decide the method of approach of investigation.
During preliminary investigation, geophysical methods and tests with cone
penetrometers and sounding rods are useful guides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2  Detailed Exploration -  Detailed
investigation
follow preliminary
investigation and should be planned on the basis of data obtained during
reconnaissance
and
preliminary
investigations.
This plan may require
review as the investigations progress.
The scope of detailed exploration
is
ordinarily restricted to the determination of engineering properties of strata
which are shown by preliminary exploration
to be critical.
The object of
detailed exploration is to determine shear strength and compressibility
of
all types of soils, density, density index, natural
moisture content,
and
permeability.
It may also be necessary to determine the preconsolidation
pressure of the strata from oedometer tests and to determine the consolida-
tion characteristics
beyond preconsolidation
pressure.
Appropriate
shear
tests should also be conducted on samples subjected to ambient pressures
beyond the preconsolidation
range also.
The detailed investigation includes
boring programme
and detailed sampling to determine these properties.
Field tests which may be performed are  in-situ  vane shear tests and plate
load tests.
The field permeability test and the test for the determination
of
dynamic properties of soils may also be conducted where necessary.
More
advanced methods of logging of bore holes by radioactive
methods fall
under the category of detailed investigations.
All  in-situ  tests are to be
supplemented by laboratory investigations.
The various phases of currently
used methods of exploration and their mode of application are indicated in
Appendix A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Geophysical
Investigations - Geophysical
surveys
make use  of
differences in the physical properties like electrical conductivity and elastic
moduli, density and magnetic susceptibility of geological formations in the
area to investigate the subsurface.
These methods may be employed to get
preliminary information
on stratigraphy or complement a reduced boring
programme
by correlation
of stratigraphy
between widely spaced bore
holes.
Of the four methods of geophysical surveys, namely seismic, elect&
cnl, magnetic and gravity surveys, only seismic refraction
and electrical
resistivity surveys are widely used.
Magnetic methods are occasionally
used for detecting buried channels, dykes, ridges, and intrusions in the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>hole.
Disturbed soil of the deposits with all the constituent parts should
be recovered at regular intervals or whenever there is a change of strata.
These samples are suitable for conducting various identification tests in the
laboratory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.3  Percussion Boring ( see  Fig. 2 ) - This method consists of breaking
up of the formation
by repeated blows from a bit or a chisel.
Water
should be added to the hole at the time of boring, and the debris baled out
at intervals.
The bit may be suspended by a cable or rods from a walking
beam or spudding device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the boring is in soil or into soft rocks and provided that a
sampler can be driven into them, cores may be obtained at intervals using
suitable tools; but in soils, the material tends to become disturbed by the
action of this method of boring and for this reason, the sample may not be
as reliable as by the shell and auger method.
As these machines are devised
for rapid drilling by pulverizing the material, they are not suitable for
careful investigation.
However, this is the only method suitable for drilling
bore holes in boulderous and gravelly strata.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.4  Wash Boring ( see  Fig. 3 ) - In this method, water is forced under
pressure through an inner tube which may be rotated or moved up and
down inside a casing pipe. The lower end of the tube, fixed with sharp edge
or a tool, cuts the soil which will be floated up through the casing pipe
around the tube.
The slurry flowing out gives an indication of the soil
type.
In this method heavier particles of different soil layers remain under
suspension in the casing pipe and get mixed up, and hence this method is
not suitable for obtaining samples for classification.
Whenever a change in
strata is indicated by the slurry flowing out, washing should be stopped and
a tube sampler should be attached to the end of the drill rod or the inner
tube.
Samples of the soil should be obtained by driving the sampler into
the soil by hammering or jacking.
Jacking or pulley method
should be
u& when undisturbed samples are required.
Initially fish-tail bit or pistol
bits are used for drilling bore hole up to weathered material.
These bits
should be replaced by tungsten carbide or diamond bits.
Double tube-
core barrels are recommended for drilling in weathered rock stratum, with
seaming shells and core catcher as required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6.5  Rotary Boring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.5.1 Mud-rotary drilling (see  Fig. 4 ) -In
this system, boring is
effected by the cutting action of a rotating bit which should be kept in firm
contact with the bottom of the hole. The bit is carried at the end of hollow,
jointed drill rods which are rotated by a suitable chuck.
A mud-laden
fiuid or grout is pumped continuously down the hollow drill rods and the
fluid returns to the surface in the annular space between the rods and the
side of the hole, and so the protective casing may not be generally necessary.
In this method cores may be obtained by the use of coring tools.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>’ 3~M2 Simplijed mud-boring method -  In  this method the boring  is
advanced by a cutter fixed to drill rods which am rotating by means of .pipe
wrench.
Bentonite
is pushed simultaneously by a double piston pump.
The slurry flowing out of cutter bottom, mixes up with the cut soil and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>flowS
to
the  bore hole surface, settling tank and back to the slurry tank.
The process is continuous and the same slurry can be used several times.
The drilling tool is lowered slowly with the help of manually operated winch
fixed on a tripod.
After the boring is advanced up to the desired depth,
Pumping of the slurry should be continued for 10 to 15 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case gravel and kankar are encountered, a gravel trap fitted with
Stays around the drill rod, a little above the cutter, may be used.
The trap
consists of 80 to 100 cm long hollow cylinder having a conical shape at
bottom.
Holes of 3 mm diameter are also drilled in the drill rod within the
trap as well as in the conical portion of the trap.
During boring, gravel
and kankar rise a little and then settle into the trap.
With the provision of
holes, no finer materials settle in the trap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The small silt-sand stone or hard beds may be broken using conical
or chisel-ended bits connected
with drill rod
The broken pieces can
subsequently be removed by means of the gravel trap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.5.3 Core  drilling-core
drills shall be so designed that in sound
‘rock, continuous recovery of core is achieved.
Water is circulated down the
hollow rods, which returns outside them, carrying the rock cuttings to the
surface as sludge.
These shall be retained as samples in traversing friable
rock where cores cannot be recovered.
It is important to ensure that
boulders, or layers of cemented soils are not mistaken for bed rock.
This
necessitates core drilling to a depth of at least 3 m  in  bed rock in areas
where boulders are known to occur.
For shear strength determination, a
core with diameter to height ratio of 1  :  1 is required.
Rock pieces may be
used for determination of specific gravity and classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.5.4  Shot  drilling -  The system is used in large diameter holes, that
is over 150 mm.
Due to the necessity of maintaining the shots in adequate
contact with the cutting bit and the formation, holes inclined over 5” or 6’
cannot be drilled satisfactorily.
This system is different from other types of
core drilling because the coarser cuttings do not return to the surface but
are accumulated in a chip cup immediately above the bit and here the chilled
shot is used as an abrasive in place of the drilling head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7 Pressure Meter - A pressure meter (see Fig. 5 ) applies a uniform
radial stress to the bore hole at any desired depth and measures consequent
deformation.
The test involves lowering of an inflatable cylindrical probe
to the test depth in a bore hole.
The probe is inflated by applying water
pressure from a reservoir.
Under pressure it presses against the unlined
wall of the bore hole and causes volumetric deformation.

of  Method -  The choice of the method depends on the following
. .
a)  Nature of Ground
1)  Soils -  In clayey soils borings are suitable for deep explora-
tion and pits for shallow exploration.
It is possible to take
representative undisturbed samples in both cases.
In sandy soils, boring is easy but special equipment
such as, Bishop or Osterberg piston samplers, should be used
for takmg undisturbed samples below the water table.
Such
samples can however be readily taken in trial pits provided
that; where necessary, some form of ground water lowering is<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>USed.
2)  Rocks-Borings
are suitable in hard rocks and pits in soft
rocks.
Core borings are suitable for the identification
of
types of rocks but they provide braited data on joints
and
fissures.
NX bore hole camera is useful to photograph the
stratification in drilled bore holes.
b)  Topography -  In hilly country the choice between vertical open-
ings ( for example, borings and trial pits ) and horizontal openings<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>[for
example, exploratory
drifts
(see
IS  :  4453-1980; ) ] may
depend on the topography
and the geological structure.
Steeply
inclined strata and slopes are most efl’ectively explored by drifts or
inclined borings and low dipping strata or gentle slopes by trial
pits or vertical borings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Swamps and areas overlain by water are best explored by bor-
ings which may have to be put down from floating craft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Cost - For deep exploration, borings are usual as deep shafts are
costly.
For shallow exploration in soil, the choice between pits
and borings will depend on the nature of the ground
and the
information required for shallow exploration in rock; the cost of
bringing a core drill to the site will only be justified if several
holes are required; otherwise trial pits will be more economical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9.1
Trial Pits and Shallow Bore Holes -Trial
pits are preferable
to
shallow bore holes, since they enable sand and single strata to be seen in
their undisturbed
state and give a more accurate idea of timbering and
pumping that may be required.
Trial pits in stiff fissured clays also give
fairly accurate idea of the depth of open excavations or vertical cuts that
can be carried out without shoring.
They also give a better picture of the
patchy ground where the soil lies in pockets.
In case of gravels and sandy
soils fines tend to be washed out and the various layers are apt to become
mixed as a result of ‘piping’.
Hence it is difficult in such cases to obtain
representative samples and unless proper precautions are taken a misleading
impression  may  be obtained.
The best procedure is to obtain samples from
trial pits dug after the ground water has been lowered by means of wells or
sumps with suitable filter linings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  SAMPLING TOOLS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.0  General  -To
take undisturbed
samples from bore
holes properly
designed sampling tools are required.
These diier for cohesive and non-
cohesive soils and for rocks.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The fundamental requirement of a sampling tool is that on being forced
into the ground it should cause as little displacement,
remoulding
and
disturbance as possible.
The degree of disturbance is controlled
by the
following three features of its design:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Cutting edge,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Inside wall friction, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  Cutting Edge-
A typical cutting edge is shown in Fig. 7.
It
should embody the following features:
a)  Inside clearance ( CI ) -  The internal diameter ( Da ) of the cutting
edge should be slightly less than that of the sample tube (4) to
give inside clearance.
The inside clearance, calculated as follows,
should be between one percent and 3 percent of the internal
diameter of the sample tube.
This allows for elastic expansion
of the soil as it enters the tube, reduces frictional drag on the
sample from the wall of the tube and helps to retain the core:
n* - D,
c* =
&
where
cr = inside clearance,
DB =  inside diameter of the sampling tube, and
D, =  inside diameter of the cutting edge.
b)  Outside clearance (Co) =  The outside diameter (&) of the cutting
edge should be slightly larger than the outside diameter  (DT  )  of
the tube to give outside clearance.
The outside clearance should
not be much greater than the inside clearance.
This facilitates the
withdrawal
of the
sampler
from
the ground.
The
outside
clearance should be calculated as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C, = Dw DTDT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where
C, = outside clearance,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dw =  outside diameter of the cutting edge, and
DT =  outside diameter of the sampling tube.
c)  Area ratio (Ar) -  The area ratio, calculated as follows, should be
kept as low as possible consistent with the strength requirements
of the sample tube.
Tts value should not be greater than about
20 percent for stiff formations; for soft sensitive clays an area
ratio of 10 percent or less should be preferred
Where it is not
possible to provide sufficient inside clearance, piston sampler
should preferably be used:

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.1 Open tube sampler-
The open tube  sampler is an ordinary
seamless steal tube with its lovvet edge chamfered to make penetration easy.
Subject to the requirements of undisturbed sampling, an open tube  sampler
with a separate cutting shoe may also be used.
The sampler head which
connects the tube to the boring rod is provided with vents to permit water
to escape when sampling under water and check valve to help to retain the
sample whiIe withdrawing the sampler (see IS : 2132-1972* ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.2  Split spoon sampler -  Split spoon sampler is a modified form of
the open tube sampler, in which the sampling tube is split into two halves
held together by the cutting edge and the sampler head. This sampler makes
the removal of the sample easier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The split spoon sampler driven as specified in IS : 2131-1963t, may

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.3  Piston sampler -  A piston sampler consists of two separate
parts, (a) the sample cylinder and
(b)
the piston
system; the latter
which is actuated separately, fits tightly in the sampler cylinder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The single important control in the operation of the piston sampler
is the separate actuation of the piston system.
It may be done by separate
drilling rods, or by a liquid pressure device or by a special lock and wire-
rope system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the driving and till the start of the sampling operation, the
bottom of the piston should be flush with the cutting edge of the sampler.
At the desired sampling elevation, the piston should be lixed in relation to
the ground and the sampler cylinder forced independently into the ground,
thus punching a sample out of the soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The piston prevents water and dirt from entering the tube during the
lowering operation.
It also serves to keep the recovery ratio constant
during the punch.
As the sampler tube slides past the tight fitting piston
during the sampling operation, a negative pressure is developed above the
sample, which holds back the sampIe during withdrawal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Both the sample cvlinder and piston system, shouId be finally with-
drawn with the sample remaining in the sample cylmder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

4aa  Cohesiontess Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.1  In the case of either cohesionless materials such as silts and
sands, or soft soil strata, sampling operations
are confronted
with the
possibility of the sample falling out of the sampler due to lack of cohesion;
this is specially so with increasing diameter of sampling tubes.
Hence some
form of positive control should be incorporated
at the toe and/or bottom
of the  sampling device.
This is affected in the following manner:
a)  Control at the top of the sampler -  A reduction of pressure on the
sample is brought about by providing a ball valve in the sampler
ltie.e or a properly packed free .or stationary piston in the sampling
.
b) ptrol
at the bottom of the sampler -  This control is achieved
. .
1)  incorporating
core retamers in the form of concealed springs,
multiple flap valves, claw-shell valves in the sample shoe or
introducing
core
retainers attached
to an auxiliary
barrel
pushed down the sampler after the drive; this will however
disturb the samples to certain extent; and
2)  maintenance of slight pressure below the sampler by the injec-
tion of compressed air into the space below the sampler formed
by the introduction of an auxiliary core barrel; Bishop sampler
maybeused.
c)  Solidification by the introduction  of  chemicals or emulsions - The
solidification may be done at the bottom of the sampling tube
after driving, or a sufficient volume of the strata to be sampled
may be solid&d before the sampling operation starts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.2  Rocks - Cores  of  rock should be taken by means of rotary drills
tith a coring bit.
Other types of drills,  such as shot drills may also be
used,
All types of rotary drills should be fitted with core barrels and core
catchers  which break off the core and  retain it when the rods are withdrawn.
Double tube core barrels should be used for ensuring better core recovery
and  picking up soft seams  or layers in bed rocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. MJIZHODS  OFSAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>$1 Samples are of two types:
a)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Disturbed Samples - These are taken  by methods  which modify or
destroy the natural structure of the material, though with suitable
precautions the natural moisture content can be preserved.
Undisturbed Samples -
These are taken
by methods
which
preserve the structure and properties  of the material. Such sam-
ples  are easily obtained from most rocks, but undisturbed  samples
of soil can only be obtained by special methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In cohesive

to
procure undisturbed samples which are very satisfactory for examination and
testing purposes.
Undisturbed
sampling of sand below the water table is
not always an easy matter, but special methods have reoently been deve-
loped for this purpose and used satisfactorily.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. PROCEDURE
FOR TAKING SAMPLES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Disturbed Soil Samples - Disturbed samples of soils may be obtained
in the course of excavation and boring.
The taking of disturbed samples
of clay may result in the remoulding
of the material and may render it
unsuitable for shear strength measurements unless it is required for til. Such
ssmples are suitable for mechanical analysis and tests for index properties.
These samples may not be truly representative, specially when taken from
below the ground-water Ievef. This is more so in the case of gravels
containing a portion of fine sand, since the finer fractions tend to be washed
off the sampler by the water.
For procuring true samples, where possible,
the ground-water level may be lowered by means of pumping from filter
wells before procuring-samples, or special type of samplers used ( see 4.2.2 ).
The quantity of sample generally required for testing purposes is given in
Table 2 [ see also IS  :  2720 ( Part I ) - 1972* 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Undisturbed
Soil Samples-
Samples shall be obtained in such a
manner that moisture content and structure do not get altered.
Tha
may
be attained by careful protection and packing and by the use of a correctly
designed sampler.
6.2.1  Clay -  If stiength of soft clay is to be known, the sampling pro-
cedure may be supplemented
by  in-situ  tests like vane shear test (see
1s  :  4434-1978t ) which gives a measure of the shear strength of the soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.1 Chunk  samples -
exposed in excavation.
Chunk samples may be taken where clay is
A block of clay should be carefully removed with
a sharp knife taking care that no water is allowed to come into contact with
the sample and that the sample is protected from exposure to direct sun
and wind. The chunk sample should be coated with molten wax so that the
layer of wax prevents escape of moisture from the sample.
Chunk samples
are not suitable if those are to be transported
to long distances because in
such cases the samples will get -disturbed in transit.
Undisturbed
samples
may also be obtained by means of a sampling tube of 10 cm internal &a-
meter provided with a cutting edge.
In this procedure the soil surrounding
the outside of the tube should be carefully removed while the tube is  being
pushed in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.2 Core  samples -  The sampler should be lightly oiled or greased
inside and outside to reduce friction.
It should then be attached to the
boring rods  and lowered to the bottom of the bore hole or trial  pit.
The
sampler should be pushed into the clay by hand or by jacking.
Where this
is not possible, the sampler may be driven into the clay by blows from a
‘monkey’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The distance to which the sampler is driven should be checked,
because if driven too far, the soil will be compressed in the  sampler.
A
sampling
head with an ‘overdrive’  space will  allow the sample tube to be
completely filled without damaging the sample.
AAer driving thero ds, the
sampler should be rotated to break  off the  core and  the  sampler should be
steadily withdrawn.
In soft clays and silty clays where samples are required
from below the water table, with water standing in the casing pipe, a piston
sampler may be used with advantage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>28<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_30>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.3  For compression test samples, a core of 40 mm diameter and
about 150 to 200 mm long may be sufficient; but for other laboratory
test%
a core of 75 mm to 100 mm diameter and preferably 300 mm long is
necessary.
The upper few mm of both types of sample should be rejected
as the soil at the bottom of the bore hole usually gets disturbed by the
boring tools.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2 Sunn-
Comparatively
undisturbed samples of moist sand above
ground-water level may be taken from natural exposures, excavations or
borings by gently forcing a sampling tube into the soil.
Undisturbed
samples of sand below ground-water table may be obtained by the use of a
compressed air sampler, which enables the sample to be removed from the
ground into an air chamber and then lifted to the surface without contact
with the water in the bore hole.
This may be done by another method
which involves the use of a thin walled piston sampler and bentonite or
other types of drilling mud.
The use of bentonite or other drilling mud
obviates the need for casing pipes with thin wall samplers.
In all methods
it is essential to maintain the water or drilling mud in the boring tube at or
slightly above ground-water level.
This prc-dents any disturbance of the
structure of the sand by the flow of water into the bore hole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Rock  Samples<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1  Disturbed Samples -  The sludge from percussion borings, or from
rotary borings which have failed to yield a core, may be taken as a distur-
bed sample.
It may be recovered from circulating water by settlement in a
trough.
The rock type may be deduced by examining the material of which
the sludge  is  composed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2  Undisturbed SamDIes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2.1 Block samples -  Such samples taken from the rock formation
shall be dressed to a size convenient for packing to about 90 x 75 x 50
mm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2.2  Core samples -  Cores of rock shall be taken by means of rotary
drills fitted with a coring bit with core retainer, if warranted.
Good core
recovery ( see 4.1.4 ) depends upon the correct operation and careful use of
the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2.3  Frequency of sampling -  In intermittent sampling, undisturbed
soil samples are obtained at every change in stratum and at intervals not
exceeding l-5 m within a continuous stratum.
On important investigations
such as the foundations for an earth dam, continuous core sampling in any
soft clay layers may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 Water Samples - If a trial pit has been excavated or a well exists near
about  the  site of exploration,
the collection of water samples does not
present any difficulty.
However, if it is to be collected from a bore hole<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>29<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_31>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I!3:1892-1979<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>made at the site, some difficulty is apprehended
on account of the narrow-
ness of the bore, caving-in of the sides, etc.
In the latter case, therefore, it
should suffice to coIIect the water sample from the bore hole with the help
of a common suction pump having a hose pipe, rubber tubing, etc, which
can be conveniently lowered down into &e bore hole, connected at the
suction end.
The water may then be collected into a clean vessel, allowed
to settle and the supematant liquid poured out into a clean well-rinsed
glass or polythene
bottle.
The water samples may then be sent to the
laboratory for chemical analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5  Records of kings
and Trial Pits<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.1 Borings -  In recording exploratory work in connection with borings
necessary information should be given, preferably on a record sheet of the
type given in Appendix D.
A site plan showing the disposition of the
borings should
be attached
to the records.
Where a deep boring has
deviated from tine, a plan and section should accompany the record.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.a  Trial Pits -  Plans and sections, drawn to the largest convenient

<<HEADING level=3>>7. PROTECTION, HANDLING AND WELLING
OF !WMPLE!!J<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Care  should be taken in protection and handling of samples and in
their full labelling, so that samples can be received in a fit state for examina-
tion and testing and can be correctly recognized as coming from a specified
trial pit or boring.
Suitable methods are given in Appendix E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 l@tru&m of Samples - Undisturbed samples of soil retained in a liner
or seamless tube sampler which arrive in the testing Iaboratory,
sealed
with wax at both ends, have to be taken out of the liners or tubes for
actual testing.
This should be done very carefully without causing any
disturbance to the sampbs themselves.
The wax may be chipped off by
a penknife.
This may also be done by slightly warming the sides of the
tube or liner at the ends when the wax will easily come off.
If the tubes
or liners are oiled inside before use, it is quite possible for samples of
certain moisture range to be pushed out by means of suitably designed
piston extruders.
If the exttuder is horizontal, there should be a support
for the sample as it comes out from the tube so that it may not break. For
screw type extruders, the pushing head must be free from the screw shaft
so that no torque is applied to the soil sample in contact with the pushing
head.
All extruding operations must be in one direction, that is, from
cutting edge to the head of the sample tube.
For soft clay samples push-
ing with an extruder piston may result in shortening or distortion of the
sample.
In such cases the other alternative is to cut the tube by means of
a high speed hacksaw in proper test lengths and fill the testing moulds, by
placing the cut portions directly over the moulds and pushing the sample
in, with a suitable piston.
After the sample is extruded, it should be kept
either in humidity chamber or in a desiccator and taken out only when
actual testing is carried out, to avoid possible loss of moisture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

SEISMIC METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R-l.1  In this method shock waves are created into the soi!, at ground level
or at a certain depth below it, by striking a plate on the so11 with a hammer
or by exploding small charges in the soil.
The radiating shock waves are
picked up by the vibration detector ( geophone),
where the time of travel
gets recorded.
Either a number of geophones are arranged in a line, or the
shock producing device is moved away from the geophone to produce shock
waves at given intervals.
Some of the waves, known as direct or primary
waves, travel directly from the shock point along the ground surface and
are picked up first by  the  geophone.
If the subsoil comprises of two or
more distinct layers, some of the primary waves travel downwards to the
lower layer and get refracted at the surface. If  the  underlying layer is denser,
the refracted waves travel much faster. As the distance from the shock point
and the geophone increases, the refracted waves reach the geophone earlier
than the direct waves. Fig. 8 shows the diagrammatical travel of the primary
and refracted waves.
The results are plotted on a graph as shown in Fig. 9,
between distance
versus
time of travel.
The break in the curve represents
the point of simultaneous
arrival of primary and refracted waves and its
distance is known as critical distance which is a function of the depth and
the velocity ratio of the strata.
This method is effective when the veloci-
ties successively increase with depth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.1 The electrical resistivity method is based on the measurement and
recording of changes in the mean resistivity or apparent specific resistance
of various soils. The resistivity ( p ohm.cm ) is usually defined as the
resistance between opposite phases of a unit cube of the material.
Each
soil has its own resistivity depending upon water content, compaction, and
composition;
for example, the resistivity is low for saturated
silt and
high for loose dry gravel or solid rock.
The test is conducted by driving
four metal spikes to serve as electrodes into the ground along a straight line
at equal distances ( see Fig. 10 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2 DEEP PENETRATION TEISIS
C-21 Penetration Tests in Bore Holes-
These  tests consist of measuring
the resistance to penetration
under static or dynamic loading of different
shaped tools.
\
C-21.1  All the tests are empirical and their value lies in the amount of
experience behind them.
C-21.2  Dynamic penetration tests in bore holes are the more usual and
provide a very simple means of comparing the results of different bore holes
on the same site and for obtaining an indication of the bearing value of
non-cohesive soils which cannot easily be assessed in any other manner.
The standard penetration
test is the most widely used of these tests (see
IS  :  2131-1963* ).
C-Z.2  Sounding Tests-Deep
sounding tests are carried out by means of
apparatus consisting of an outer tube and an inner mandrel, which can be
driven by means of a hammer or caused to penetgate steadily by an increas-
ing dead load or by jacking.
Measurements are made of the resistance to
penetration as the depth of penetration increases and the technique involves
separate measurement of the direct toe resistance and the skin resistance
[see IS  :  4968 ( Part I)-1976t,
IS  :  4968 (Part
II)-1976:
and  IS  :  4968
( Part III )-19768 1.
The method
is used to determine the resistance to the driving of
bearing piles and as a rapid means of preliminary site exploration and to
supplement information obtained from borings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F-3..  VANE .TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-3.1  The vane test has been shown to be a promising
non-empirical
method of measuring the shear strength of soft clay  in-situ,  at all depths
from the surface to at least 30 m.
It is particularly
useful in the measure-
ment of strength in deep beds of soft sensitive clays.
C-3.2 The shear strength of soft clays can be measured  in-situ  by pushing
into the clay a small four-bladed vane, attached to the end of a rod and
then measuring the maximum torque necessary to cause rotation.
To a
close approximation
this torque is equal to the moment developed by the
shear strength of the clay acting over the surface of the cylinder with a
radius and height equal to that of the vanes.
vane test is given in IS  :  4434-19781.

<<HEADING level=3>>HANDLING AND LABELLING OF SAMPLES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>El. HANDLING OF SAMPLES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>El.1 Disturbed Samples of Soii -  Where samples are required for testing,
or where it is desirable to keep them in good condition over long periods,
they should be treated as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Immediately after being taken from the bore hole or trial pit, the
sample should be placed in a cloth bag or tin preferably in a glass
jar of at least 0.5 kg capacity, and it should fill this container with
a minimum of air space.
The container should have an air-tight
cover.
In this way the natural water content of the sample can be
maintained for one or two weeks without appreciable change.
The containers should be numbered and a label as described in E-2
should be placed immediately under the cover in a container.
The containers should be carefully packed in a stout wooden box
(preferably with separate partitions) with saw dust or other suitable
material, to prevent damage during transit.
Where necessary, the samples should be tested for natural water
content immediately on arrival at the laboratory and an accurate
description made of the sample.
In such a case proper precautions
should be taken to preserve the natural water content during
sampling.
During the interval while the samples are awaiting
transport, they should be stored if possible in a cool room.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>El.2 Undisturbed Samples of Soil -  The following conditions of handling
and protection of undisturbed samples are to be regarded as a minimum
requirement for samples taken by the usual methods;
in special cases it
may be necessary to take more elaborate precautions:
a) Samples which are retained in a liner or which are retained in a
seamless tube sampler should receive the following treatment:
Immediately after being taken from the boring or trial pit,
the ends of the sample should be cut and removed to a depth of
about 2.5 cm ( or more in the top to cover any obviously disturbed
soil). Several layers of molten wax should then be applied to each
end to give a plug about 2.5 cm thick.
If the sample is very
porous, a layer of waxed paper should first be placed over the
ends of the sample.
Any space left between the end of the liner or tube and the
top of the wax should be tightly packed with saw diist or other<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>42<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_44>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:1892-l!I79<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>suitable material; and a close-fitting lid or screwed cap be placed
on each end of the tube or liner.
The lids should, if necessary, be
held in position by adhesive tape.
If the longitudinal joint of the
liner is not air-tight, this should be waxed ano protected
by
adhesive tape in the same way as the lid.
Samples which are not retained in a tube should be wholly covered
with several layers of molten paraffin wax immediately after being
removed from the sampling tool, and then placed in a suitable
metal container, being tightly packed in the container with saw
dust or other suitable material.
The lid of the container should
be held in position by adhesive tape. If the sample is very porous,
it may be necessary to cover it with waxed paper before applying
the molten wax.
A label bearing the number of the sample, preferably of the type
shown in E-2, should be placed inside the container just under the
lid.
It should be placed at the top of the sample.
In addition,
the number of the sample should be painted on the outside of the
container,
and the top or bottom
of the sample should be
indicated.
The liner or containers should be placed in a stout wooden box,
preferably with separate partitions,
and packed with saw dust,
paper, etc, to prevent damage during transit.
It is desirable to test the undisturbed samples within two weeks of
taking them from the boring or trial pit, and during the interval
while awaiting transport and test, they should be stored, if possible
in a cool room, preferably with a high humidity, say 90 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Samples. of Rock
~-1.3.1  Hock Specimens -  The reference number of the sample should
be recorded on it either by painting directly on the surface of the specimen,
or by attaching to the specimen a small piece of surgical tape on which the
number is written in Indian ink or indelible pencil.
Samples should then be
wrapped in several thicknesses of paper and packed in a wooden box.
It
is advisable to include in the wrapping a label of the type described in E-2.
E-1.3.2  Cores -  In the case of small diameter drill cores, it is usual to
preserve the whole core.
This is best done in core boxes which are usually
1.5 m long and divided longitudinally by light battens to hold 10 rows of
cores.
The box should be of such depth and the compartments of such
width that there can be no movement of the cores when the box is closed.
The lid of the box should be adequately secured ( see IS : 4078-1980* ).
E-1.3.2.1 Great care should be taken, in removing the core from the
core barrel and in placing it in the box, to see that the core is not turned
end for end, but lies in its correct position.

indelible pencil on a small block of wood which is inserted in its correct
position in the box.
The exact depth of any change of strata should be
shown in the same way.
Where there is a failure to recover core, this
should be recorded in the same way.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E-1.3.2.2 Where specimens are required for examination
or analysis,
short lengths of core may be split longitudinally by means of a special tool
known as core splitter.
One-half of the specimen should remain preserved
in the box.
Large diameter drill cores are usually too heavy to be treated
in this way. As a rule, they are laid out in natural sequences for examina-
tion on the ground.
Specimens required for detailed work may be treated
as block specimens ( see E-1.3.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E1.3.2.3 The properties of hard clays and soft rocks depend to some
extent on their moisture content.
Representative samples should therefore
be preserved by coating them completely with a thick layer of wax after
removing the softened skin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E2. LABELLING OF SAMPLES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Ea.1  All samples should be labelled immediately after being taken from the
,.bbre  hole or trial pit.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Records should be kept on a sheet of the type shown as below.
These sheets are serially numbered and bound in book form in duplicate.
Each sheet carries a portion
which may be detached along a line of
perforations and which is used as a label [ see E-1.1( b)  and  E-1.2( c) 1.
On this portion the serial number of the sheet is repeated three times, so
that the chance of its being defaced is diminished.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
