Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a general rule, the sizes of building components should not
be adjusted during or after assembly. The dimensional devia-
tions which are inherent in the components, the dimensional
deviations which occur during manufacture or assembly, and
the deviations which result from movement (for example,
settlement
or thermal movement)
in the building, shall,
therefore, be absorbed in the joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This International Standard is one of a series dealing with
general rules and principles for the jointing of building com-
ponents.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope and field of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This International Standard establishes a classification system
for joints in building based on the ability of joints to acc~m-
modate dimensional deviations during construction.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Given the scope, this International
Standard
takes into
consideration -only the dimensional deviations inherent in the
components when they are assembled and those which occur
during assembly.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Examples of types of joints are given in an annex, as an aid to
the understanding of the principles involved.<<HEADING_END>>

Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The examples in this annex are derived mostly-from  Some notes on Geometry of Join& for Building,  Second Revised Edition, CIB
W 24, where further examples are given.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If joints of types 2 or 3 are chosen, which may result in the accumulation of unacceptably large dimensional deviations, measures
should be taken to limit each dimensional deviation. For this purpose, more stringent requirements for tolerances, or special design
solutions, such-as partial use of joints type 1, may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Joints type 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.t.1
See figure 2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The adjustability of the bolt and the nut combines with the height of the joint to allow absorption of greater dimensional deviations
than those normally occurring with this type of assembly.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The “sliding attachment” is available as a standard solution for an equipment system. The range of adjustability in the horizontal plane
allows for absorption of greater dimensional deviations than those normally occurring. The assembly also functions in case of walls
which are out of plumb.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>As a rule, wooden floor boards are joined together with a tongue and groove joint, part of which is detailed as a butt joint. Dimen-
sional deviations in the width of the floor boards cannot, therefore, be absorbed in the individual joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Kitchen cupboard components are often joined together with butt joints. As the cupboard components are frail and, as a rule, highly
