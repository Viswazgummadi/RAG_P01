<<PARAGRAPH>>NATIONAL FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard which, is identical with IS0 2444  :  1988 ‘Joints in building - Vocabulary’ issued
by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on the recommendations of Building Construction Practices Sectional Committee (CED 13) and approval
of the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wherever the words ‘International
Standards’ appear referring to this standard, they should be read as
‘Indian Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>jointing
material  :  Jointing product having no definite
form before use, for example mortar, sealant, glue.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This International Standard defines terms used to describe
building joints, their constituent parts and their design in
building construction.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>jointing section  :  Jointing product preformed to a definite
section, but of unspecified length.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>jointing
component
:  Jointing product formed as a
distinct unit, having specified sizes in three dimensions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1
joint  :  Construction formed by the adjacent parts of two
or more products, components or building elements, when
these are put together or fixed with or without the use of a
jointing product. 1)

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
The hitherto customary use of the term “joint” instead of
“jointing product” and the other terms defined in 2.2 can lead to
misunderstanding, and is therefore to be avoided.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3
joint reference plane  :  Theoretical reference plane from
which the relative position of the joint profiles of adjacent
building components and/or associated jointing products may
be determined.<<HEADING_END>>

For joints with plane, parallel joint profile Surfaces, joint
clearance is equal to the joint  gap  width.<<HEADING_END>>

or without a jointing product.<<HEADING_END>>

face of a building component and the chosen joint reference
plane.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Amendmentssre
issued to standards as the need arises on the basis of comments. Standards are also reviewed
periodically; a standard along with amendments is reaftirmed when such review indicates that no changes are
needed; if the review indicates that changes are needed, it is taken up for revision. Users of Indian Standards
should ascertain that they are in possession of the latest amendments or edition,by referring to the latest issue
of ‘BIS Handbook’ and ‘Standards  :  Monthly Additions’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
