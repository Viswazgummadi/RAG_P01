which
is produced
by
intergrinding
or intimately
blending
a mixture
of
granulated

is the ammonium

( RIOI -

by classical

This

includes
as AlsOs
the TiOs,

Many
modern

determine
aluminium

aluminium
oxide
directly
without
the minor

included
as in the classical

Consequently,
for consistency
and
to provide

with
historic
data
and
among
various
analytical
methods,
when
calculating
potential

for specification
purposes,
those using

Al or Also,
directly
should
add to the

which
would
precipitate
with
the ammonium

when analyzed
by the classical

and which

of @05

The percentage
( by mass ) of minor

to be added
to Al,O,
by those using
direct
methods
may
be obtained
by
actual
analysis
of those oxides
in the sample
