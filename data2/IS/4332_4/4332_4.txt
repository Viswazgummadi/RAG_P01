FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Part IV ) was adopted by the Indian Stan-
dards Institution
on 5 April 1968, after the draft finalized by the Soil
Engineering
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Soil stabilization
is the permanent
alteration
of any property
of
the soil to improve its engineering
performance.
One of the methods
of stabilization
is to add cement to soil and then compact the mixture
at the required moisture
content.
For evaluating
the improvement
obtained
by stabilization
standard methods of tests are required
and
these are being published in parts.
This
part [ IS  :  4332( Part
IV )]
lays down the method for determining the effect of wetting and drying,
and freezing and thawing on compacted
specimens
of cement stabiliz-
ed soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the, formulation
of this standard due weightage
has been given
to international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices pre-
vailing in different countries
in addition to relating it to the practices
in this field in this country.
This has been met by basing the standard
on the following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASTM D 559-57 ( 1965 ) Standard methods for wetting and drying
tests of compacted
soil-cement
mixtures.
1967 Book of ASTM
Standards,
Part 11.
ASTM D 560-57 ( 1965 ) Standard methods for freezing and thawing
tests of compacted
soil-cement
mixtures.
1967 Book of ASTM
Standards,
Part 11.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting
the result of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be
rounded off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

laid down in 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.  PROCEDURE
FOR
THE
FREEZING
AND THAWING
TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IO.1 At the
end of the storage
in the moist
room,
water
saturated
felts
about
5 mm thick, blotters
or similar
absorptive
material
shall be placed
between
the specimens
and the carriers.
The assembly
shall be placed
in a freezing
cabinet
having
a constant
temperature
not
warmer
than -23°C
for 24 h and removed.
The No. 1 and 2 specimens
shall be
weighed
and measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 The assembly
should
then be placed
in the moist chamber
or suit-
ably
covered
container
having
a temperature
of 25” to
30°C and a
relative
humidity
of 100 percent
for 23 h and
removed.
Free potable
water
shall be made
available
to the absorbent
pads under
the speci-
mens to permit
the specimens
to absorb
water
by capillary
action during
the thawing
period.
The No. 1 and 2 specimens
shall be measured
and
weighed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3  Specimens
No. 3 and 4 shall be given
two firm strokes
on all areas
with
the
wire-scratch
brush.
The
brush
shall
be held
with the long
axis of the brush
parallel
to the
longitudinal
axis of the
specimen
or
parallel
to the
ends
as required
to cover
all areas of the
specimen.

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 4332 (  Part IV ) - 1968<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
strokes
shall be applied
to the full height
and
width of the
speci-
men with
a firm stroke
corresponding
to approximately
1.4 kgf (see
Note under 4.3 ).
Eighteen
to twenty
vertical
brush strokes are requir-
ed to cover the sides of the specimen
twice and four strokes
are requir-
ed on each end.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.4 After
being
brushed,
the specimens
shall
be turned
over
end for
end before
they are placed
on the water saturated
pads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5 The
procedures
described
in  10.1  to  10.4  constitute
one cycle
(48 h ) of freezing
and thawing.
The specimens
shall be placed
in the
freezing
cabinet
and the procedure
continued
for 12 cycle.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Weight
determinations
of specimens
No. 3 and 4 before
and after
brushing are usually made at the end of each cycle when conducting
research and
making special
investigations.
Some Specimens
made of silty
and clayey soils
tend to scale
on sider and ends particularly
after
about the sixth
cycle of test.
This scale shall b:, removed with a  ~hnrp  pointed
iwtrument
since the regular
brlishing may not ha eKectiv0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6  The
No. 1 and 2 specimens
may be discontinued
prior to 12 cycles
should
the measurements
become
inaccurate
due to soil-cement
loss of
the specimen.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.7 After
12 cycles of test,
the
specimens
shall
be dried
to constant
weight at 110°C
and weighed
to determine
the oven-dry
weight
of the
specimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.8 The data collected
will permit calculations
c f volume
ar,d moisture

of specimens
No. 1 and 2 and the soil-cement
losses of speci-
melis No. 3 and 4 afte:. the prescribed
12 cycles of test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.1  The
volume

and
the

of
the specimens
should be calculated
