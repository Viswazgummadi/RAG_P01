FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 15 June
1971, after the draft finahzed by the Storage and Marketing
Structures
for Agricultural
Commodities
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved by the Agricultural
and Food Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Scientific storage of agricultural
commodities
demands proper care of
different commodltres, construction
of appropriate
type of storage structures
suitable for different commodities,
hygienic transport,
receipt,
distribution
and delivery of these commodities,
maintenance
of warehouse inspection
records,
etc.
Standardization
of the requirements
and
procedures
for
storage
management
would help in overcoming
problems of recurring
nature like general and specific care of agricultural
commodities,
calcula-
tion of storage
space for various
commodities,
occupancy
or storage
structures and calculation
of cost of storage and construction.
Such a code
would,
therefore,
lead
to overall
improvement
in storage
at farmer’s,
trade and government
level and ultimately
to overall economy
in the
storage of various agricultural
commodities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Various terms relating to storage are being frequently used by various
agencies
concerned
with storage in the country.
In order
to have
a
uniform terminology and to give an authoritative
definition of these terms
the
Storage
and
Marketing
Structures
for
Agricultural
Commodities
Sectional Committee
decided to formulate this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This code is being formulated
in three parts.
The
other
two parts
will be as follows:
Part
II
General
care
in. handling
and
storage
of agricultural
produce and inputs
Part III
Specific
care
in handling
and
storage
of
agricultural
produce and inputs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.!+I For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated;
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with IS: 2 - 1960*.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that,of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
