<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee, CED 53<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Apart from the requirements regarding the design, materials, processes of manufacture,
dimensions, shape, workmanship and finish, etc, acceptability of pipes is determined by the results
of various tests to evaluate the properties stipulated in the relevant Indian Standard
specifications. This standard lays down the procedures for conducting tests relating to load
bearing, absorption, hydrostatic, permeability and straightness of concrete pipes, both reinforced
concrete and prestressed concrete of pressure and non-pressure types.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the tests specified in this standard, inspection of the process of manufacture, the
quality of the finished pipe and other tests for the quality control of materials during manufacture
shall be carried out as per requirements of relevant Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1966 and subsequently revised in 1985. This revision
incorporates modifications mainly in respect of hydrostatic test and permeability test which was
found necessary in the light of experience gained during the use of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 3.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (March 2003). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with this standard, if the final
value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance with IS 2 : 1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

CONCRETE PIPES — METHODS OF TEST
( Second Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Three-Edge Bearing Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers methods for carrying out
the following tests on concrete pipes, both
reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete
and of pressure and non-pressure types to
evaluate the properties stipulated in the
relevant Indian Standards:
a) Three-edge bearing test,
b) Absorption test,
c) Hydrostatic test,
d) Permeability test, and
e) Straightness test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1   Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1.1   Testing machine<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any mechanical or hand-powered device may
be used in which the head that applies the load
moves at such a speed as to increase the load at
a uniform rate of approximately 20 percent of
the expected crushing load per linear metre per
minute. The loading device shall be calibrated
within an accuracy of ±2 percent. The testing
machine used for the load tests should produce
a uniform deflection throughout the full length
of the pipe and shall be so substantial and rigid
throughout, that the distribution of the test
load along the length of the barrel of the pipe
will not be appreciably affected by the
deformation or yielding of any part of the
machine during the application of the load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 INSPECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality of all materials, process of
manufacture and the finished pipes shall be
subject to inspection and approval by the
purchaser. If the pipe is tested for three-edge
bearing or absorption, inspection of the
reinforcement shall be made on the pipe
sections used for those tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1.2   Lower bearing block<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lower bearing block (  see  Fig. 1 ) shall
consist of two hardwood or hard rubber strips
fastened to a wooden or steel beam or direct to
a concrete base, which shall provide sufficient
rigidity to permit application of maximum load
without appreciable deflection. Wooden or
rubber strips shall be straight, have a
cross-section of not less than 50 mm in width
and not less than 25 mm nor more than 40 mm
in height and shall have the top inside corners
rounded to a radius of approximately 15 mm.
The interior vertical sides of the strips shall be
parallel and spaced apart a distance of not
more than 1/12th of the specimen diameter but
in no case less than 25 mm. The bearing faces
of the bottom strips shall not vary from a
straight line vertically or horizontally by more
than 1 mm in 375 mm of the length under load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 GENERAL PRECAUTIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The test specimens shall not have been
exposed to a temperature below 4°C for 24
hours immediately preceding the test and shall
be free from all visible moisture. The specimens
shall be inspected and any specimen with
visible flaws shall be discarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  If any test specimen fails because of
mechanical reasons, such as failure of testing
equipment or improper specimen preparation,
it shall be discarded and another specimen
taken.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 SELECTION OF TEST SPECIMENS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the requirements specified in this
standard, the number of test specimens and the
method of their selection shall be in accordance
with the specification for the type of pipe being
tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>About 6 mm thick hard rubber or felt should be
placed/fixed at the lower face of the upper
wooden block which shall come in contact with
the surface of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 THREE-EDGE BEARING TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Three-edge bearing test shall be performed by
the method given in  5.2 . The pipe shall be
surface dry when tested. The test specimen
shall be tested in a machine so designed that a
crushing force may be exerted in a true vertical
plane through one diameter and extending the
full length of the barrel of the pipe but
excluding the sockets, if any.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1.3   Upper bearing block<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The upper bearing shall be a rigid hardwood
block or a block with hard rubber facing at least
150 mm × 150 mm in cross-section. The wood
block shall be free of knots and shall be straight
and true from end to end. It shall be

<<PARAGRAPH>>of such dimensions that deflections under
maximum load will not be appreciable. The
bearing face of the upper bearing block shall
not deviate from a straight line by more than
1 mm in 375 mm of length under load.
5.2.1.4  The equipment shall be so designed that
the load will be distributed about the center of
the overall length of the pipe (  see  Fig. 1 ). The
load may be applied either at a single point or
at multiple points dependent on the length of
the pipe being tested and the rigidity of the test
frame.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the pipe tests firmly and with the most uniform
possible bearing on each strip for the full length
of the pipes less the socket portion, if any.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If mutually agreed upon by the manufacturer
and the purchaser prior to the test, a fillet of
plaster of Paris not exceeding 25 mm in
thickness may be cast on the surface of the
upper and lower bearing before the pipe is
placed. The width of the fillet cap, top or bottom,
shall be not more than 25 mm per 300 mm
diameter, but in no case less than 25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2.2  Each end of the pipe at a point mid-way
between the lower bearing strips shall be
marked and then diametrically opposite points
thereof shall be established. The top bearing
block shall be so placed that it contacts the two
ends of the pipe at these marks. After placing
the specimen in the machine on the bottom
strips, the top bearing shall be symmetrically
aligned in the testing machine. Load shall be
applied at the rate indicated in  5.2.1.1  until
either the formation of a 0.25 mm wide crack<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Multiple points of load applicable to the top
bearing will permit use of lighter beams without
appreciable deflection.
5.2.1.5   Crack measuring gauge
The crack measuring gauge shall be made from
0.25 mm thick strip and shall be of a shape as
shown in Fig. 2.
5.2.2   Procedure
5.2.2.1  The specimen shall be placed on the two
bottom bearing strips in such a manner that<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6 ABSORPTION TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Test Specimen<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each specimen selected at random shall have a
square area of 100 cm 2  ± 10 percent of the length
of the pipe as measured on surface of the pipe,
and a thickness equal to the full depth of the pipe
thickness and shall be free from visible cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1   Drying Specimens<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specimens shall be dried in a mechanical
convection oven at a temperature of 105°C to
115°C until two successive weighings at
intervals of not less than 8 h show an
increment of loss not greater than 0.1 percent
of the mass of the specimen. The drying time
shall be not less than 36 h. The dry mass of the
specimen shall be the mass after the final
drying determined at ambient temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2  After drying and weighing as specified
in  6.2.1 , the specimens shall be immersed in
clean water at room temperature for the
specified period. The specimens shall then be
removed from the water and allowed to drain
for not more than one minute. The superficial
water shall then be removed by absorbent cloth
or
paper
and
the
specimens
weighed
immediately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F IG . 2
G AUGE  L EAF   FOR  M EASURING  C RACKS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or ultimate strength load, as may be specified,
has been reached. If both the 0.25 mm crack
and ultimate load are required, the specified
rate of loading need not be maintained after the
load at 0.25 mm crack has been determined.
5.2.2.3  The
0.25 mm
crack
load
is
the
maximum load applied to the pipe before a
crack having a width of 0.25 mm measured at
close intervals, occurs throughout a length of
300 mm or more. The crack shall be considered
0.25 mm in width when the point of the
measuring
gauge
described
in
5.2.1.5
penetrates
1.5 mm
at
close
intervals
throughout the specified distance of 300 mm.
The ultimate load will be reached when the
pipe will sustain no greater load.
5.2.3   Calculation
The crushing strength in Newton per linear
metre of pipe shall be calculated by dividing the
total load on the specimen by the nominal
laying length. Effective length of the pipe shall
be taken as the nominal laying length of the
specimen. In case of spigot and socket ended
pipes, the effective length shall be equal to the
overall length minus the depth of socket (  see
Fig. 3 ) and in case of collar and flush jointed
pipes, the effective length shall be equal to the
overall length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3  The least count/accuracy of the weighing
balance shall be 0.1 g which the test specimen
shall be weighed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.4   Calculation and Report<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The increase in mass of the specimen over its
dry mass shall be taken as the absorption of the
specimen
and
shall
be
expressed
as
a
percentage of the dry mass. The results shall be
reported separately for each specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 HYDROSTATIC TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Test Specimen<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specimens for determination of leakage
under internal hydrostatic pressure shall be
sound and full-size pipe. If the pipes are tested
after storing in adverse weather condition
presoaking shall be permitted. For presoaking
pipes shall be submerged in water or sprayed
with water for a period not less than 6 hours
prior to testing and excess water removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1  The pipe shall be supported in such a way
so that the longitudinal axis is approximately
horizontal and the exterior surface excepting
the supports can be examined readily.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — In most machines the total load will include
the dead weight of the top bearing plus the load applied
by the loading apparatus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.2  The equipment for making the test
shall
be such that the specimen under
test
can

including the portion of socket and rebated
joints, that is, subjected to pressure in the ‘as
laid’ condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>simultaneously, immediately after curing is
completed (  see  Fig. 4 ). In case this is done
later, the pipe shall be kept wet for 48 hours
prior to test. For plain/flush ended precast
pipes, it shall be carried out about 300 mm
away from both ends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.3  The specimen shall be filled with water
and the air expelled. Pressure shall be applied
at a gradual rate until the specified test
pressure is reached, or beads of water on the
pipe surface is seen, whichever occurs first.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.1   Procedure
The dry surface of the pipe shall be scrapped by
wire brush and loose particles, if any, removed.
Sealant shall then be applied to the lower
portion of the cup and cup shall be pressed on
the pipe. After hardening of sealant, water
shall be filled in the cup with wash bottle. The
glass tube with rubber cork shall then be fixed
in the cup as shown in Fig. 4. Water in the tube
shall then be filled using wash bottle and air
shall be allowed to escape during filling.
Precaution shall be taken, so that water does
not leak either from cup ends or from the
rubber stopper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.4  Pressure shall be maintained for 1 min +
30 s for each 10 mm of wall thickness (for
precast concrete pipes wall thickness shall be
full barrel wall thickness, whereas it shall be
core thickness, in case of prestressed concrete
pipe) or for twice that entire period if the
application
of
pressure
resulted
in
the
formation of beads of water on the pipe surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.5  At the end of the holding period, the
pressure shall be released immediately if the
test pressure has been maintained. If the beads
of the water have not grown or run the pressure
shall be increased slowly until the test pressure
is reached or the beads of water grow or run
(whichever occurs first).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2   Initial Absorption
Water shall be filled up to zero mark and
reading shall be taken at every half hour
interval up to two hours. The drop in water
level in the stand pipe at the end of two hours
in the initial absorption.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.6  If the test pressure has been reached
without the beads of water growing or running,
the test pressure shall be maintained constant
for 1 min + 30 s for each 10 mm of wall
thickness (for precast concrete pipes wall
thickness shall be full barrel wall thickness,
whereas it shall be core thickness, in case of
prestressed concrete pipe). At the end of the
holding period the pressure shall be released
immediately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.3   Final Permeability
Fill the water in the stand pipe again up to zero
mark and take the reading at one hour interval
up to 4 h. The absorption in the fourth hour,
that is, difference between fourth and third
hour readings is the final permeability. The
average of tests conducted at three places for
prestressed concrete pipe and two places for
precast concrete pipe shall be expressed in cm 3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>as final permeability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After releasing the pressure, the test pipe shall
be drained completely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Prestressed Concrete Pipes and
Precast Concrete Pipes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This test shall be done on outside surface of the
pipe. No additional treatment of any type shall
be done on the pipe before permeability test is
carried out. For Prestressed Concrete Pipe, the
test shall be conducted at 3 places on coating
and for Precast Concrete Pipe at 2 places<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1  A rigid straight edge, made into a gauge
of the form and dimension shown in Fig. 5 shall
be placed in the bore of the pipe with edge  X  in

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.2  If both ends of the gauge, when so placed
are in contact with the internal surface of the
pipe, the deviation from straightness is
excessive. If this condition occurs at any one of
four
different
positions
of
the
gauge,
approximately equally spaced around the pipe
circumference the pipe does not comply with
the particular requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>internal surface of the pipe at both ends, the
gauge shall be reversed so that edge  Y , placed
as in  9.1.1 , is adjusted to the internal surface of
the pipe. If the two studs in edge  Y  cannot be
made to touch the surface of the pipe
simultaneously,
the
deviation
from
the
straightness is excessive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If this condition occur at any four position of
the gauge the pipe does not conform with this
particular requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
