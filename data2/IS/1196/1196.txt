<<HEADING level=1>>( Second Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 31 January
1978, after the draft finalized by the
Flooring and Plastering Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard was first published in 1958 and subsequently revised in
1968.
The second revision has been based  on  further experience gained
during course of these years in the use of bitumen mastic.
The salient
features of this revision include information to the users regarding resis-
tance of bitumen mastic floor finishes to chemical attack so that the use of
bitumen mastic is fully appreciated
in practice.
Provisions for surface
armouring to increase abrasion resistance for industrial purposes have also
been incorporated.
Information
regarding
provision
of an
isolating
membrane has been suitably elaborated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international co-ordination among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.
This has been met by referring to BS CP 204  :  1965
’ In situ  floor finishes  ’  issued by the British Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3.1 This code of practice represents a standard of good practice and,
therefore, takes the form of recommendation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
4.1 Bitumen mastic is dustless, odourless, jointless and impervious to the
transmission of moisture, either in liquid or vapour form.
The surface is
easily cleaned, noiseless under traffic and resilient. Bitumen mastic is also
durable.
While it may carry heavy loads, application
of concentrated
point load may cause indentation.
In designing the bitumen mastic floor-
ing consideration shall be given to the anticipated
service conditions.
Bitumen mastic is, therefore, suitable for a variety of uses under a wide
range of climatic and service conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1 Limihhbu of Use -The
surface
of bitumen
mastic is liable to
become gradually
softended
by prolonged
contact with greases, fats and
oils.
Contamination
with such materials shall be avoided.<<HEADING_END>>

1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 TLIckrau
-
The total thickness to which bitumen mastic should be
laid depends
upon
the  traffic  conditions
to which
the flooring will be
subjected.
Usually
the bitumen
mastic should be laid in one coat, but
two-coat
work may be used, depending
on the thickness of floor finish.
As a general guide the thicknesses as given in Table 2 are recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Bitumen
mastic
shall
conform
to
the
requirements
given
in
IS  :  1195-1988*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 The bitumen mastic may be delivered to the site either in the form of
blocks weighing about 25 kg or in molten condition
in a mobile mixer or
prepared at the site.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 sarfaee
Armouring
-Special
types of metal armouring
may
be
incorporated
in bitumen mastic flooring for industrial purposes to increase
resistance of abrasion.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  EQUIPMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 The
equipment
shall
consist
of a bitumen
boiler, a mechanically
agitated mixer called mastic cooker and other accessories. The equipment
shall be set up as near the site of work as possible so as to avoid cooling of
the molten material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  The base on which the bitumen
mastic flooring is to be laid shall be
adequately
strong
to receive
the mastic and to carry the anticipated
traffic over it.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  Preparation
of the Base - The base shall have a true, even and
dry surface which has been slightly coarsened by means 0f.a’ stiff broom
or wire brush
and should
be free from ridges and hollows.
A steel
trowelled
finish is not desirable.
The levels of the base should be such
that the specified thickness of bitumen mastic may be applied uniformly.
If the finished tloor is likely to have water or industrial liquors upon it, a
straight fall of not less than 1 in 75 should be provided.
Channels should
be provided as necessary to ensure adequate drainage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS t  1196  -  1978<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Thickness of bitumen mastic exceeding 20 mm on new concrete are usually
laid without an isolating membrane
except in circumstances
described
in
( b ) below.
Isolating membranes
should be laid loose.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) An isolating membrane
is essential:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1) on a timber base;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2)  on a base of porous or open texture, such as no-fines or light-
weight concrete;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3) where the concrete surfaces contains line cracks;<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) on a concrete
base which has received a surface treatment,
such as sodium silicate solution;
5) when concrete has been contaminated by foreign matter from
industrial processes, such as oils, greases, sugar solutions or
chemicals; and
6) when the mastic is to be laid over a thermal insulating
medium, for example, in cold stores.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) An isolating membrane may also be found necessary in circums-
tances arising immediately before or at the time of laying, such
as the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) When the bitumen mastic cools too rapidly to allow it to be
manipulated and properly finished.
Premature cooling may
be caused by the dissipation of heat through the base or by
weather conditions, or both.
It may also occur when it is
necessary to transport the material far from the cauldron  or
mixer.
Under these conditions, an isolating membrane may
act as a thermal insulating medium to assist the retention of
heat for a longer time after laying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) When  (blowing
’  of the mastic asphalt occurs and cannot be
avoided by dusting the base with a suitable powder.
The
reasons for  c  blowing  ’  are obscure,
but it may be due to
extreme dampness or dryness or by the nature of the surface
texture of the concrete.
Where it is known in advance that
these
conditions may arise, those
entrusted
with
laying
bitumen mastic should be notified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5  Placing the Underlay -  The underlay, when required should be laid
loose with lapped joints.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6 Setting  Out -  The setting out of the floor area into bays is normally
decided according to workable requirements. The arrangement of the bays
depends upon the design of the floor and the number of spreaders engaged,
so  that the laying and finishing processes may both be easily controlled by
the operatives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS :  1196 - 1978<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7 Re-melting  at Site -
Re-melting is the term applied to the melting
at the site or in a mobile mixer of the pieces of broken bitumen mastic
blocks.
The blocks shall be broken
to convenient
size not exceeding
60 mm cubes and loaded into the mechanically
agitated mixer or mastic
cooker at the site of work.
The material shall then be carefully remelted.
At this stage any coarse aggregate preferably
preheated
shall be fed
in successive portions until the complete charge is thoroughly incorporated.
After all the coarse aggregate
has been incorporated,
the material
shall
be mixed continuously for a period of not less than one hour before laying
is begun, and mixing shall be continued until laying operation
is com-
pleted, so as to maintain the coarse aggregate
in suspension.
At no stage
during the re-melting
and mixing process, shall the temperature
exceed
205°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8  Laying<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.1  Transgort of Molten Material-When
the material
is sufficiently
molten to be workable, it should be carried in flat mortar pans, to the
point of laying.
To prevent the molten material from sticking to the pans
they may be sprinkled inside with a minimum quantity of inorganic dust,
sudh as limestone dust, cement, ash or oil shall not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.2  @reading-Bitumen
mastic should generally be laid in bays in
one coat.
It should be spread to the specified thickness by means of
suitable hand tools, gauges, straight edges and hand levels being used to
ensure accuracy.
The
bitumen
mastic
should then
be
floated
to a
uniformly level surface by a heavy wooden float and should be free from
roughness and’ imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.2.1
If  ‘blowing
’  occurs, the bubbles should be punctured and
the area affected carefully made good while the mastic is still hot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.2.2
Two-coat work should be treated in a manner similar to that
for single-coat
work, but care should be taken to arrange that the joints
in successive layers are staggered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>7.8.3  Surface Finish  -The
type of surface finish required
should be
specified by the designer.
The following.are
the two types:
a><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Muttfinish -
The surface should be rubbed in with sand during
the final floating operation.
The sand should be clean and free
from foreign matter. All surplus material should be removed after
rubbing is completed, and
Polishedjnish
-
The surface should be finished with a float in a
manner similar to that used for a matt finish but without the use
of an abrasive,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.8.3.1
Immediately
after completion of the laying, the bitumen
mastic should be protected from damage till the material cools to the
surrounding temperature.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7&A  Slijperiness -  Bitumen mastic has reasonable slip-resistance, but
frequent polishing tends to make it slippery.
Where mastic is used as
paving
to stairs a suitable-non-slip
safety nosing or
inset should be
incorporated in the tread.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.9  Juncdons
-
S  pecial care should be taken in effecting proper junctions
between new and previously laid sections of work.
The contact edges of
the previously laid mastic should be cleaned and warmed by additional
applications
of hot mastic.
This procedure should also be adopted at
junctions between the floor finish and skirtings, coves or fillets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.10 skirtisgs
-
Skirtings should be executed in not less than two coats,
particular care being taken to ensure proper adhesion of the first coat to
the base.
Special care should be taken at external angles to ensure the
full thickness of the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.11  Protection
of the
Surface -The
newly laid surface should be
protected from damage due to careless handling of construction
equip-
ment, spillage of oils, paints, chemicals, plying of vehicles, etc.
Concrete
or mortar shall not be mixed directly on the bitumen mastic surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.12  Bringing
into Service -
The mastic flooring should not be subjected
to traffic until the material has cooled throughout to the temperature of
the surrounding atmosphere.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  INSPECTION<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9. MAINTENANCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 The bitumen mastic surface requires relatively
little maintenance,
though attention is necessary to obtain maximum service,
Superficial dirt
may normally
be removed
by washing with warm water and suitable
detergents.
Where there is much dirt on the floor, the additions
of a
small quantity of washing soda to the warm water may be desirable. After
the dirt has been removed the floor should be mopped with clean water.
It is essential that all oils, fats and greases spilled on the floor should be
removed immediately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2  Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.1  When a damaged section has to be removed, it should be done
carefully.
Considerable damage may result from an attempt to cut away
an affected area with the hammer and chisel or to soften it with a blow
lamp.
The correct method is to place hot mastic around and over the
area concerned, and after this has had a sufficient softening effect, the area
shall be carefully cut away and made good, with fresh bitumen mastic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.2
When two-coat work is being restored or made good, the edge
along the perimeter of the area shall be cut back not less than 75 mm to
half the total thickness of the mastic, to form a lapped joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
