the Method of Measurement
of Works of civil Engineering
( Excluding
River
Valley
Projects)
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by
the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies a very important
place in the planning and
execution
of any civil engineering
work from the time of first estimates
to the final completion
and settlement
of payments of project.
Methods
followed for measurement
are not uniform and considerable
differences
exist between practices
followed by different construction
agencies and
also between various Central and State Government
Departments,
and
their
undertakings.
While
it
is recognized
that
each
system
of
measurement
has
to be specifically
related
to administrative
and
financial
organiszations
within a department
responsible
for the work,
a unification
of the various systems at technical levels has been accepted
as very desirable,
specially as it permits a wider range of operation
for
civil
engineering
contractors
and
eliminates
ambiguities
and
misunderstandings
arising out of inadequate
understanding
of various
systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Since different trades are not related to one another,
the Sectional
Committee
decided that for each separate
standards
shall be issued as
different
parts as it would be helpful to users in using the specific
standard.
This
Part
26 covers
method
of
measurement
of
acid
resistant
lining applicable
to buildings
as well as to civil engineering
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Acid resistant lining is required
to be done in so-me of the industrial
buildings.
The method of measurement
of such type of lining varies
from organization
to organization.
The technical committee’responsible
for formulation
of this standard
has, after considering
practices  being
followed by some of the major organizations
decided
to prepare
this
standard
which adopts simplest type of measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  For
the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a measurement,
shall
be
rounded
off in
accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of
significant
places
retained
in the
rounded
off value
should
‘.,e the same
as that of the
specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
