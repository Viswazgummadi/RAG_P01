<<PARAGRAPH>>0.  FOREWORD
0.1 This  Indian Standard ( Part IV ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 29 January 1980, after the draft finalized by the Method of
Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects SectionaI Committee
had
been  approved  by  the Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2 In measurements
of quantities in construction of river valley projects
a large diversity of methods exists at present, according to local practices.
This lack of uniformity creates complication regarding
measurements and
payments.
The estimator is also left in doubt as to the true meaning and
intention of items in the schedule of work.
This standard is intended
to
provide a uniform basis for measuring concrete works in the construction
of river valley projects.
0.2.1
The provisions
contained
in this standard
will generally
have
precedence over the provisions in IS  :  1200 ( Part II )-1974*.
However,
the provisions of both the standards
may be consrdered
complimentary
and supplementary
to each other.
0.3 In reporting the result of measurements
made in accordance
with
this standard,‘if
the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance with IS  : 2-1960t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
( Part IV ) covers the method of measurement of con-
crete works in river valley projects ( dams and appurtenant
structures ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. GENERAL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 The purpose
of measurement of proposed
work is preparation
of
bill of quantities for estimating
and tendering.
The purpose of measure-
ment of executed work is assessment of value of work for payment.
In
either case the method of measurements
should be such that it is  fairly
quick, reasonably accurate and amenable to check at any time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS  :  9401 ( Part IV )-1980<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 In caseof measurement of proposed work, the dimensions
are scaled
or read from drawings and then worked up, that is, reduced to length, area,
or volume in recognized units of measurements
for the particular
item.
In case of assessment of executed work, the dimensions
are measured
in
the field. Calculations of length, area, volume, weight, etc, are made on
the basis of these dimensions and payments are made acoordiogly.
Where
measurement of a number of units are the same it is the usual practice to
take measurements of one u&it and multiply
the calculated length,
area
or volume by the number of units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Measurements
shall be
taken
to nearest centimetre
including
of
levels.
Fractions
less than half shall be disregarded
and fractions half
and above are to be regarded
as unity.
Areas shall be worked
out to
nearest O’Olma and cubic contents shall be worked out to nearest 0’01 ma.
However, in measurement
of repetitive
nature,
this
practice
shall be
applied to the total of the item and not to individual unit.
It is essential
that measurements shall be as accurate as possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Measurements
are closely linked with detailed drawings, description
of items and specifications
of the work.
These should, therefore,
be
very clear and properly
worded and the order of precedence
shall be
sanctioned
drawings, approved
specifications
and specified description
of items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. MEASUREMENT
OF IRREGULAR
AREAS AND VOLUMES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The irregular
area shall be divided
into a number
of figures of
known area, say, triangles, rectangles, etc.
The remaining
part ( which
cannot
be formed
into a triangle or a regular figure ) may be evaluated
by taking out average height drawn
on a common
base by  Simpsons
Rule.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 In case of an irregular
vohime,
the volume shall be determined by
the  Prismoidal formula.<<HEADING_END>>
