<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 October
1982, after the draft finalized by the Limes
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Lime-pozzolana
concrete blocks in addition to precast cement concrete
blocks, stone tiles and burnt clay bricks can also be used in the construc-
tion of footpaths,
pavements,
passenger
waiting sheds at bus stops and
other places.
These blocks are normally
manufactured
by using lime
and pozzolana or lime-pozzolana
mixture as binder. The Indian Standard
specification
laying down the dimensions
and strength
requirements
for
lime-pozzolana
concrete
blocks for paving
has been covered separately.
This code, which is an essential
adjunct
to the above
specification,
is
intended to provide guidance with respect to the manufacture
and use of
such blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the preparation
of this standard, considerable
assistance
has been
rendered by the Central Road Research
Institute, New Delhi.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether  a  particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accord-
ance with IS : 2-1960*.
The number of significant
places
retained
in
the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of manufacture
