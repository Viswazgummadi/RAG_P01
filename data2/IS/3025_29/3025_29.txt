<<PARAGRAPH>>1.  Scope
-
Prescribes
two
methods
for the determination
of total
and dissolved
sulphides
in
waters
and wastewaters
by titrimetric
iodine
method
or methylene
blue method.
lodometric
method
is suitable
for measurement
of sulphide
in concentration
above
1 mg/l if interferences
are absent
and loss of hydrogen
sulphide
is avoided,
The methylene
blue method
is applicable
to
sulphide
concentration
up to 20 mg/l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  lodometric
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Principle
and
Theory -
Sulphides
are stripped
from
the acidified
sample
with
an inert
gas
and collected
in zinc acetate solution.
Excess iodine
solution
added
to the zinc
sulphide
suspen-
sion reacts with the sulphide
under acidic
condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thiosulphate
is used to measure
unreacted
iodine
to indicate
the quantity
of iodine
consu-
med by sulphide.
The reaction
may be given as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) s+/a=s*+2/<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) /a ( excess ) + 2 &OS = &OS + 2  i
2.2  Interferences<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1
Reduced
sulphur
compounds,
such
as sulphite,
thiosulphate
and
hydrosulphite,
which
decompose
in acid, may yield
erractic
results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2
Volatile
iodine
consuming
substances
will give high results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3 Eliminate
interferences
due to  sulphite,
thiosulphate,
iodide
and many other soluble
subs-
tances,
but not ferro-cyanide,
by first
precipitating
zinc
sulphide,
removing
the supernatant,
and
replacing
it with distilled
water.
Use the same procedure,
even when
not needed
for
removal
of
interferences,
to concentrate
sulphide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3.1  Procedure
-
Put required
quantity
of 2 N zinc acetate solution
into 500 ml glass bottle,
file with
sample
and add required
quantity
of 6 N sodium
hydroxide
solution.
Stopper
with
no
airbubbles
under
stopper
and mix
by
rotating
back and
forth
vigorously
about
a transverse
axis.
Addition
of reagents
may be varied
in volume
so that the resulting
precipitate
is not exces-
sively
bulky and settles
rapidly.
Add enough
sodium
hydroxide
to produce
a pH
above
9. Let the
precipitate
settle
for 30 minutes.
Filter
the precipitate
through
glass
fibre
filter
paper
and carry
out titration
immediately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3  Sampling
and Storage<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1  Sampling

Part 1 Sampling
(  firsf
revision
1’.  Samples
must be taken with a minimum
of aeration
and preserved
at low temperature
( sulphide
may be volatilized
by aeration
and any oxygen
is advertently
added
to the sample
may
convert
the sulphide
to an unmeasurable
form ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.2 Preserve
the sample
with addition
of 2 ml/l
of zinc

Samples
not preserved
must

Blue Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Principle
and Theory -
The
methylene
blue
method
is
based
on  the
reaction
of
sul-
phide,
ferric
chloride
and dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine
to produce
methylene

Ammonium
phosphate
is added
after colour
development
to remove ferric

The
method
is
applicable
at sulphide
concentrations
up  to 20 mg/l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

water and make up to 1 litre.
Standardize
this against

to 1’0 mg of

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  Procedure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1 Co/our development
-
Transfer
7’5 ml of sampI
to each of two
matched
test tubes,
using
a special
wide-tip
pipette or  filling
to marks on test tubes.
Add to tube A 0’5 ml of amine-sulphuric
acid
reagent
and 0’15 ml of ferric
chloride
solution.
Mix immediately
by inverting
slowly,
only
once ( excessive
mixing
causes
low results
by loss of hydrogen
sulphide
as a gas before
it has had
time to react ). To tube B add 0.5 ml of 1 : 1 sulphuric
acid and
O-15 ml of ferric
chloride
solution
and mix. The presence
of sulphide
will
be indicated
by the appearanceof
blue
colour
in tube A.
Colour
development
is generally
complete
in’about
1 minute,
but a longer
time often
is required
for fading
out of the initial
pink colour.
Wait 3 to 5 minutes
and add 1.6 ml of diammonium
hydro-
gen phosphate
solution
to each tube.
Wait for 3 to 15 minutes
and
make
colour
comparisons.
lf
zi,nc acetate
was u.sed, wait at least 10 minutes
before
making a visual
colour
comparison,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2  Co/our determination<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2.1 Visual co/our estimation

<<PARAGRAPH>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sulphide
is often present
in ground
water,
especially
in hot springs.
Its common
presence
in
waste waters comes partly
from the decomposition
of organic
matter,
sametimes
from
industrial
wastes,
but mostly
from the bacterial
reduction
of sulphates.
Hydrogen
sulphide
gas escaping
into
air
from
sulphide-containing
waste waters
cause odour
nuisance.
Hydrogen
sulphipe
is a toxic
gas. It attacks metals
directly
or indirectly.
From analytical
point
of view,
three
categories
of
sulphides
in water and waste water are distinguished,
namely,
total sulphides,
dissolved
sulphides
and unionized
hydrogen
sulphide.
This method supersedes,
