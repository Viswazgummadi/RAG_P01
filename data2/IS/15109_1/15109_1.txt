<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian

of the

<<PARAGRAPH>>In the adopted

certain

Attention

<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Wherever
the words
‘international

appear
referring
to this standard,
they
should
be
read
as ‘Indian

Comma

METHOD FOR THE MEASUREMENT
OF INHIBITION
OF ROOT GROWTH<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3
Principle<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1
Scope<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Growth
of
pregerminated
seeds
under
controlled
conditions
for a set period depending
on the test plant
being used. The two
control
media are sand and soil.
After
the
growth
period,
measurement
of
the
root
lengths
from
both
of the
controls
and the
unknown
soil
or substance
under
test.
Statistically
significant
differences
in the root lengths
of seedlings
grown
in
any test
medium
compared
to the controls
is indica-
tive of an effect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 11269 describes
a preliminary
test for
the
rapid estimation
of soil quality
by comparing
the
(ate
of
growth
of
roots
of
a specified
plant
under
standard
conditions
with
that in a test soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method
is applicable
to all soils, soil forming
ma-
terials,
waste
residues
or chemicals
which
may
be
applied to soil, except where
the contaminant
is highly
volatile
or only affects
photosynthesis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is applicable
to the measurement
of the effects
of
substances
deliberately
added
to the soil and to the
comparison
of soils of known
and unknown
quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
Shoot length is also a useful parameter, and this
can be measured in conjunction with root length to provide
additional or corroborative data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method
is not intended
for use as a measure
of
the
ability
of
the
soil
to
support
sustained
plant
growth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>test of root elongation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Results of interlaboratory<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The results
of root lengths
for each set of results
have
been
tabulated
in
a
standard
format
from
which
means,
standard
errors
and
significant
differences
according
to Dunnett’s
test
have been calculated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The methodology
for the test to validate the proposed
standard
method
was
circulated
to all standards
or-
ganizations
of participating
member
countries
or the
member
of the working
group representing
a member
country,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Standard
errors,
calculated
as shown
in C.2 and sig-
nificant
differences,
expressed
as root length
in milli-
metres,
have been tabulated
for each set of results
in
table E.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Results
were
obtained
from only three
countries:
UK,
Germany
and France who
completed
four,
three
and
one
test(s)
respectively.
Not all eight
of the
labora-
tories
conducted
the
test
correctly
or supplied
suf-
ficient
raw data.
However
six laboratories
completed
all aspects
of the test as envisaged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The significant
differences
in themselves
are only an
indication
of the accuracy
of the test,
but when
com-
pared to the
main
root
length
of the control
the
sig-
nificant
difference
usually equates
to 10  ‘%0  of the root
length.
Thus,
any
chemical
in the
soil
producing
a
15  ‘Y.  reduction
in root
length
almost
certainly
has a
significant
effect
on root growth.
Therefore,
this sim-
ple root test
can be used to rapidly
assess
the pres-
ence of factors
in the soil which
inhibit
maximum
crop
growth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
