<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part X ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 22 March
1973, after the draft finalized by the Building
Limes Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Hitherto,
methods of tests for assessing qualitative
requirements of
building limes were included in IS  :  712-1964.
For facilitating the use of
these tests it has been decided to print these tests as different parts of a
separate Indian Standard.
This part covers determination
of popping and
pitting of building limes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting the results of a test or analysis made in accordance with
this standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off,
it shall be done in accordance with IS : 2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard ( Part X ) covers the method of test for determination of

<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  TEST FOR POPPING
AND PITTING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Gauging Plaster -
The gauging plaster used for popping and  pitting
test when gauged with 50 percent of its own mass  of  distilled  water and tested
by the Vicat needle in accordance
with IS  :  4031-1968t
shall have an initial
setting time of not less than 15 minutes.
from pops and pits.
The gauging plaster shall be free
Fresh, fine, white and good quality
plaster of Paris
which shows no pops or pits when tested without lime may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1  Four
test specimens
shall be separately
prepared
in the manner
described
under 3.2.1.1
to 3.2.1.8.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.1
Mix
thoroughly
70 g of the hydrated
lime under
te;t with
70 ml of clean water at a temperature
27 f
3 “C and allow to soak for 2 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.2
At the expiration
of 2 hours, the lime putty thus obtained shall
be thoroughly
mixed and  ‘  knocked
up  ’  with a trowel, if necessary,
with a
small additional
amount
of clean water,
so as to obtain
a plastic mass; it
shall then be spread out on a non-porous
surface,
10 g of approved grade
plaster
of Paris
shall
then be added,
the plaster
being scattered
evenly
over the putty, and the whole shall be mixed with the trowel rapidly and
thoroughly
for 2 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.3
A flat pat shall then be formed by pressing the gauged material
into a ring mould
10.0 cm in diameter
and 0.5 cm deep, greased
inside
and resting, on a well-greased
non-porous
plate.
One gram of petroleum
jelly per pat is suitable for greasing when renewed each time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.4
The gauged putty shall be pressed in small quantities
at a time,
with the aid of a broad palette knife or spatula, in such a man,ler as to avoid
air bubbles.
It shall then be smoothed off in level with the top edge of the
ring with  not more than 12 strokes of the knife, any excess material
being
removed in this process.
The total time shall not exceed 5 minutes from the
time of adding the plaster of Paris to the last stroke of the knife for any
one pat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.5
The 4 pats thus formed
shall be left to set for half an hour.
They
shall then be transferred
on their base-plates with or without their ring
mould to a well ventilated
drying-oven
maintained
at a temperature
between
35 and 45°C to be well dried.
A period
or periods amounting
to a total
of 16 hours should be ample for this purpose
but a minimum
of 4 hours
suffices in many cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1.6  The pats
may be left in the oven either before drying or
between the periods of drying.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.7 Any test pats which show shrinkage cracks before steaming
shall be rejected and replaced by fresh pats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1.8 The 4 pats, still on their base-plates, shall be placed horizontally
in a suitable steam boiler in which the water is already boiling, and subjected
to the action of saturated steam at atmospheric pressure for a period of 3
hours.
The steaming vessel shall be so arranged that condensed water
cannot drip back on to the face of the pats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2 The pats shall then be examined in a good light for disintegration,
popping or pitting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
