<<HEADING level=3>>METHOD OF TEST FOR
ABRASION RESISTANCE OF WNCRETE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 October
1979,
after
the ~draft finalized
by the Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Abrasion
resistance
of
concrete
can
be one
of the measures
of its
durability.
Deterioration
of concrete
surface
may occur due to abrasion
by
sliding,
scraping,
percussion
or action
of abrasive
materials
carried
by water.
Therefore,
it becomes
difficult
to ‘assess the
abrasion
resis-
tance of concrete,
as the mode of abrasive
action
in each case may
vary,
but evaluation
of relative
resistance
of concrete
surfaces
is possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This
standard
describes
the
method
of assessing
the relative
resis-
tance
of concrete
surfaces
by finding
the abrasion
loss of the specimen
subjected
to
an
abrasive
charge.
The
procedure
laid
down
in
this
standard
approximately
simulates
abrasion
under
physical
effects suffered
by concrete
pavements
( roads
and air-fields
), industrial
floors,
railway
platforms,
dock-yards,
footpaths,
~etc.
This applies generally
for normal
weight
concrete
with
a density
of 24-26
kN/ma.
Tentative
suggested
values
of permissible
abrasion
loss for
different
concrete
surfaces
are
given in Appendix
A  for broad
guidance
only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1
The
method
of test
covered
in
this
standard
may
also
be
applied
to assess the abrasion
resistance
of surfaces
made up of materials,
such as stone and cement
mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 .‘The Committee
responsible
for the preparation
of this standard
has
taken
into
consideration
the
practices
followed
in
this
country
in
conducting
test
for determining
abrasion
resistance
of concrete.
Due
weightage
has
also been given to the need for international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
of the
world.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,

final

IS  :  2-1960*.

should
be the same
as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard
covers determination
of abrasion
resistance
characteris-
tics
of
concrete
under
physical
effects
only
by
subjecting
it to
the
impingement
of air-driven
silica-sand
using lo-cm
concrete
cubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. WORKING
PRINCIPLE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The surface
of the concrete
cubes
is subjected
to impingement
of an
abrasive
charge
( see 3.3).
As a result,
abrasion
of the concrete
surface
of the cubes occurs
and resulting
loss in mass of the cubes is taken
as the
abrasion
loss of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 The
weighed,
dry specimen
shall
be placed
on the specimen
carrier
( see 3.2.3)
with the surface
( any one out of the
four
smoother
vertical
surfaces
of the
cube,
that
were
in contact
with the mould ) to be tested
facing
the nozzle
tip.
The
nozzle
tip shall be at the middle
of the half
side of the cube
( that is, 2.5 cm
away
from
the edge
of the specimen
).
The
surface
shall
then
be exposed
to blast
for the
full charge
of sand
( 4 000 g ).
During
the process,
the cradle
shall be moved
slowly between
the two fixed points ( see 3.2.3 ) by the handle
provided
there
for.
The
test shall be repeated
on the same
surface
after
rotating
the sample by
1809 on the horizontal
plane
thus enabling
two impressions
to be made
on the same surface.
After the test is over, the sample
shall be removed,
cleaned
and weighed
to  determine
the loss of
mass
in grams
for one
surface
of the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 This
procedure
shall
be repeated
on the other three vertical
surfaces
( see 6.1)
of the same sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3
Three
cube specimens
( of the same
lot or as received
) shall be tested
to determine
the abrasion
loss of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. CALCULATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  The loss in mass of the
sample
for each surface
shall be calculated
as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>m -
loss in mass in g,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ml = mass of the specimen
before
each test in g, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>m2  = mass of the specimen
after
each
test ( on one surface
with two impressions
) in g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. REPORT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  The
abrasion
loss of concrete
shall
be reported
as the average
of the
results obtained

( that
is 4 surfaces
