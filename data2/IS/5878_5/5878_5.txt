FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part V ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 August 1976, after the draft finalized
by the Water
Conductor Systems Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I).2 This Indian Standard was Rrst published in 1971 and is being revised
with a view to keeping abreast with the technological
developments that
have taken place in the iic!d of tunnel design and construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
construction
of tunnels involves a large number
of problems.
Because of the great extent of variations in the nature of the work many
different kinds of conditions are encountered which for maximum
economy,
consistent with technical
requirements
should be treated differently.
This
standard covers recommendations
which would be generally applicable
to
construction
of tunnels for the assistance
of engineers
engaged
on such
projects.
This standard should, however, be used with caution since due
to the very nature of the subject it is not possible to lay down detailed
specifications to cover each and every possible case and the discretion  of  the
engineer-in-charge
would be required in some cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Lining in tunnels is technically an important
component and generally
constitutes 30 to 40 percent of the total cost of the tunnel.
Therefore
lining operation requires considerable study and carefu! planning.
Tunnels
forming part of ‘water conductor system have to be invariably
lined with
cement concrete
from structural
and hydraulic
considerations
with some
exceptions when the rock is extremely
hard, sound and massive like granite
and/or where the tunnel may be in operation
for short periods in a year,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE
1.1  This standard
( Part V ) lays down specifications and procedures for
placing concrete lining for tunnels conveying water,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.  _  REQUIREMENTS
2.1  The requirements for concrete lining of tunnels shall be carefully drafted
as the conditions for lining tunnels are quite different from those of other
cement concrete works.
Requirements
of lining of tunnels are special on
account
of curvature,
thin sections
and
difficulties
in placement
and
compaction in restricted spaces.
2.1.1
All the requirements for coarse and fine aggregates, cement, water,
and
concrete
grading
and corresponding
strength
in accordance
with
IS  :  456.1964*
shall apply.
On account of curvature, irregularities
in rock
profile, thin sections and placing of concrete generally required to be done
either through a concrete pump or pneumatic
placer, the concrete neces-
sarily requires to be flowy to avoid seggregation and to ensure proper filling
in.
The slump of concrete should not be less than 10 cm and the sand
content shall be more than that specified in IS : 456-1964*.
The cement
content shall also be more than what is indicated
by laboratory
tests alone
( see Note below ).
Where concrete is placed directly, as in inverts and
kerbs, the slump should be reduced to 5 cm.
Use of natural aggregates,
especially sand, either wholly or partly, improves the pumpability of concrete
and is recommended commensurate
with practicability
and economy.
The
maximum size of aggregate shall not exceed  40  mm. This should, however,
be reduced suitably for specific locations and conditions.
NOTE -The
cement
content
in concrete
may
vary
from
350 to 400
kg/ma.
However,  in particular
locations
where
experience
indicates,
the minimum
cement
content
may be reduced
to 325 kg/m3
where
natural
aggregates
are used and  there<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Code  of practice
for plair! and reinforced
concrete
(  second rcoi&n ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:5878(PartV)-D76<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>is no hindrance
of supports
or reinforcement.
Where
crushed
aggregates
are  used
and where  supports or reinforcement
come in the way, the minimum cement content
may be suitably increased to  ensure adequate workability. All the above  mentioned
cement  contents are applicable to concrete placed through a concrete pump or by
pneumatic placer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1.2
It is advisable to use air entraining
agent, to  entrain
up to 4
percent of air for improving workability of concrete.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. CONTROL
OF SEEPAGE WATER<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Seepage  water  shall be suitably controlled and prevented from getting
mixed with green concrete in the lining.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. APPROPRIATE
TIME FOR PLACING CONCRETE LINING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The appropriate time for placing concrete lining will be governed by
the conditions of rock tunnelled through.
In cases where due to tectonic
forces rock dilates, it is advisable to allow sufficient time for such dilations
to reduce to reasonable limits to ensure that concrete lining will not fail by
cracking due to heavy and unequal external forces.
In cases where rock
may not dilate much but may deteriorate
in structure
causing spalling,
placing of a thin layer of concrete between steel ribs to support full surface
of the rock and transfer the forces to the steel supports would be desirable
( in certain conditions, shot-Crete may be resorted to in place of such block-
ing concrete, taking care to ensure that the gap between external flange of
the support and rock is fully filled up ).
Blocking concrete or shot-Crete
has to be placed with minimum possible time lag after excavation.
Shot-
Crete can be applied more quickly than blocking concrete.
In cases where
rock is of better type than referred to above, concrete lining may come
at any time convenient to suit the construction programme
and practical
considerations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  SEQJTENCES OF LINING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 The sequence of concrete placement for tunnel lining depends on the
shape of the tunnel, its size, the nature of the rock strata and the type of
form work and other plant and equipment used and has to be selected
taking into account the construction schedule and progress scheduled to be
achieved for the particular
work.
lining in tunnels are:
The sequences generally adopted for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) placing concrete to form the kerbs first, followed by side walls and
arch and finally the invert;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b) placing concrete to form the invert first followed by sides and arch;
and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>e) placing concrete for the invert, side walls and arch all at one GRW,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 5878 ( Part V ) - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1 The sequence given at  5.1  (a) is suited for horse-shoe, D-shaped
and other flat bottomed and wide tunnels.
The kerb shall be built up to
a section of sufficient width to serve as a base for the errection of forms for
sides and shall be properly anchored and made stable to withstand
the
loads of concrete lining and form work.
After the kerb is constructed, the
lining of the sides and arch follows.
The sides of the kerb against which
the sides and the invert concrete will be laid later should preferably be
radial to their respective curvatures.
This sequence has the advantage that
all operations of concreting
kerb, placing of shutters and forms and lining
of sides and arches can be done with minimum disturbance
to the track
lines on the floor and for movement of other traffic.
Then the track lines
and other service lines are removed and invert concreting is done last.
By
this method
the bottom
concrete
surface
does not
get damaged.
An
additional advantage in this is that it permits of concreting
the sides and
arch simultaneously with excavation with a suitable gap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
The sequence described at 5.1 (b) is suitable when the bottom of
the tunnel is narrow or when the section is circular.
The invert concreting
is done
first
and a regular
base for the erection
of the form work
for sides and. arches
is obtained
making
further vjork easier.
But this
procedure entails the removal of trolley tracks and other service lines laid
on the floor and again laying them over the concreted
invert for lining of
sides and arch.
It has also the disadvantage that the concrete surface of the
invert is likely to get damaged during the operations for laying the overt.
These practical difficuhies increase if transport is by trucks.
5.1.2.1
In tunnels through weak strata, where the tunnel floor tends to
wear out fast or heave up, the above sequence is required to be adopted.
In cases where Iarge horizontal
thrusts are encountered,
the placing
of
invert concrete in advance of lining of sides, serves as strutting between the
sides.
The concrete surface can be protected suitably.
5.1.3
The
sequence
described
at 5.1 (c) is possible only in small and
circular tunnels.
It is difficult to be adopted in ordinary course and may
be resorted to only where concrete
pumping facilities
are available
and
construction
programme
demands it.
It has some advantages in steeply
inclined tunnels.
These present problems in proper alignment
along the
tunnel axes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4
In case of tunnels through soft rock, when it is found that the rock
strata is likely to collapse, it may become necessary to provide a primary
lining
over and between the steel supports  (  if provided ) at the time of
driving the tunnel, or by shot-creting immediately. ( see 4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -

types and methods
of primary
and main

<<HEADING level=3>>6. FORM
WORK<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 General -
Generally
for tunnel lining
steel forms are used in the
interest of speed and economy due to their multiple use.
There are various
types of form work used for tunnel lining, such as rib and plates, rib and
laggings, travelling shutters with or without telescoping.
Timber formwork
has to be resorted to in sharp bends, transitions and junctions.
The use of
a particular type for a job depends on the size, shape and the length
of tunnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1  In a rock tunnel where the concrete is placed mechanically,
forms
may be removed
after 16 to 24 hours from the placing of last batch of
concrete.
The form surface
shall be oiled before
concreting
to avoid
concrete sticking to it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Rib and Plate or Rib and Lagging -
This type of form work may
be used for tunnels of medium size, that is, up to 5 m diameter.
When
concrete is to be hand placed on short tunnels,
this type of form work
is convenient.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1. Ribs made of either channels or T-sections
placed at intervals of
about 1 m according to the thickness of the concrete lining shall be erected
firmly over the invert and either adequately
stiffened steel plates or timber
lagging shall be fixed from the bottom upwards as the concrete rises,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Travelling
Non-telescoping
Form
Work -
In this ‘case the whole
form work is preassembled
and mounted on a travelling frame fixed with
wheels running on a track and screw jacks are provided for collapsing -the
form work, when required.
In all types or travelling forms the sections are
hinged to permit collapsing.
J ac k s are required for bracing
and aligning
the forms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1
This type is easy and economical to move.
For this type of forms
concrete for the sides and arch may be placed in one continuous operation.
The traveller which carries the form structurally
forms a part of the form
work.
The forms arc made in units 6 to 12 m long and can be struck and
reassembled quickly depending on the requirements
of construction traffic
and matching concreting equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4  Travelling
Telescoping
Form Work -
This is so designed that the
back unit can be collapsed
and moved forward through the front unit
without disturbing it.
The side plates are hinged to the arch plate so that
it is pctSsiblc to collapse them.
The traveller
is equipped with jacks and
other accessories for this purpose.
The form work shall be self-supporting
while travclling in the collapsed condition also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

‘l%h type of form work is only suitable for a circular or
near circular tunnel when the lining of full section is done in one operation.
This type of form woi:k may be suitable in steeply inclined tunnelslshafts,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6 Gesseral
lkequ~remdsst of
Forms
—  AH  form
work
should
have
inspection windows about 50  x  30 cm in size and not more than B m apart.
Horizontal
and ver$~cal intervals of spacings will depend
on the size and
shape of tunnel, thi! .kness of lining, method
of placement
and workability
of concrete.
The aim shall be to eusure dense compact concrete.
These
windows are used to place and \“ibrate the concrete.
The shutters to these
should be strung and easily operable and fitting well as not to permit cement
slurry to flow out or to leave projections
in the finished concrete surface.
Flexible shaft intern d type vibrators may be used through these windows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6.1
All forms, ;:xcept where continuous non-stop concreting
is adopted,
require provision of a bulk head shattering at the other end where use of
timber is generally ( onvenient.
The bulk head is necessary to make a neat
construction joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. BATCHING
AND MIXING
PLANT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 In large tunnel lining jobs, it is necessary to use batching
and mixing
plants to manufacture concrete for lining.
Depending
on the size of tunnel
and equipment ava; lable, the concrete may be mixed in a standard batching
and mixing plant outside the tunnel and the mixed concrete taken to site of
placement or the aggregates batched
and mixed dry outside and taken to
site of placement inside the tunnel and mixed with water inside the tunnel.
It is advisible to add cement also inside to avoid its setting as the aggregates
are aften wet or m3ist.
Except
in small or very short tunnels, the concrete
placer or concrete pump shall be inside the tunnel, near the site of lining.
In large tunnels especially long ones, wherever it is possible and convenient,
taking the mixing and batching plants also inside the tunnel is advisable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.  TRANSPORTING
CONCRETE
OR DRY
MIXED
AGGREGATES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 For tunnels of short length and where comparatively
large volumes of
concrete are requi :ed, concrete is generally mixed in a batching plant located
at a suitable site outside the tunnel, and the mixed
concrete
conveyed
as
quickly as possib!c to the site of placement by means of short belt conveyow,
agitator cars, truck mounted mixers, etc, and poured into the hopper of the
concrete pump or placer kept close to the location
of concreting.
This has
a disadvantage that as the ,time of transportation increases, the quality of
concrete tends to get affected through over-mixing
in the case of agitator
cars and truck mounted
mixers and a certain amount of initial set may take
place before actwd
placement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18:5878
(E%sI%V)-1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 For tunnels of comparatively
longer len~hs,
it is advantageous to batch
and mix the concrete in dry Condition outside the tunnel and then convey
the same inside the tunnels to locations
of placement
by means of tipping
wagons or dumpers. The dry mixed aggregates are then-remixed at site adding
the required quantity of cement and water to obtain the specified slump and
water cement ratio. The aggregates should be as dry as possible when mixed
outside.
The mixer for mixing at site of placement has to be so located
that
the dry mixed
aggregates ean be easily dumped
into
the hopper
of
the
mixer and the mixed concrete pouring out of it can fall into the hopper
of
the placer or pump.
Suitable retarders may be used where
ready mixed
concrete
is transported in transit cars.
In case of vertical
shafts used as
construction
adit,
mixed
concrete
can
be
conveyed
through
‘elephant
trunks ‘.
These ‘ trunks ‘ should be made up of short tapered pieces linked
to each other.
The
drop from
the bottom
of the ‘ trunk’
to the concrete
heap below shall not be more than 1 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>90 PLACING
CONCRETE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  If the invert concreting
or kerb concreting
is done
first, the surface of
old concrete shall be covered by 25 mm thick layer of mortar
( of the same
mix as the concrete,
without coarse aggregate ) to get a proper
bond
with
the new concrete.
During concreting
by a pump
or a placer behind
form
work for sides and arch, if the placing
is interrupted
ftw a period
of more
than one hour, a batch ( sufficient to cover the area by a 15 mm layer)
of
mortar as above shall be pumped to cover the cold joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1  Care shall be taken while pouring
through
side doors in forms so
that no hollow
pockets remain.
In the case of monolithic
forms,
as the
concrete will fill the invert first, there may
be a tendency
for the form
to
float, and therefore the form shall be strutted down
rigidly
from
the sides
and the roof of the tunnel as well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.2  The
concrete
may
be
placed
either
by
a
concrete
pump
or
pneumatic
placer.
Concrete
in the
invert
may
be
placed
direct.
The
discharge
end of
the concrete
delivery
pipe may be
ke
tmried
a few
centimetrex inside the freshly placed concrete, as far as practicable, to avoid
segregation.
Pumps and especially
placers are sensitive to the pressure of
the compressed air supply.
In case of long compressed air supply lines, air
chambers of adequate capacity shall be provided
on the pipe
line near the
discharge end to reduce pressure drop.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>necessary to provide reinforcement,
sufficient cover shall be provided.
The
spacing of reinforcement
shall be adequate to permit flow of concrete around
it without any hollows anywhere.
11.  CONSTRUCTION
JOINT
11.1  Two types of construction joints generally
become necessary namely,
(a) bulk head and (b) longitudinal.
11.1.1  Bulk head joints are required to be provided at the end of each
shutter.
11.1.2
Longitudinal joints become necessary at the junction
of the sides
and the invert where the kerb becomes an integral part of either the invert
or the sides.
Where the kerbs are laid separately,
there will be two such
joints at each kerb.
When the sides and arch are laid separately
similar
joints
become
necessary
at
sides and
arch.
No special treatment
is
necessary for such construction joints except general cleaning
and, where
applicable,
a layer of cement sand mortar as specified in 9.1 may be laid on
the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12. CONSOLIDATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1 As far as possible, flexible
shaft immersion
type vibrators
having a
vibrating needle of 50 mm dia and 8 000 vibrationslmin
frequency should
be used for vibration
of concrete
( See IS  :  2505-1968*
).
In addition the
concrete shall be vibrated
by external form vibrators of minimum
0’5 kW
capacity.
The spacing of form vibrators depends on the size of vibrator,
mass of form work, thickness of concrete, etc. The spacing shall be adequate
to ensure satisfactory compaction.
The vibrator spacing shall be closer at
the crown portion.
13.  CURING
13.1 Curing may be generally done by spraying water at short intervals to
maintain a wet surface.
Strong draft of. wind shall be avoided through the
tunnel to reduce chances of sudden drying and %onsequent cracking,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X4. GROUTING
14.1 Concrete lining of underground
works shall be grouted to pack the
hollow space (gaps ) between rock and concrete lining.
Grouting
shall be
done under flow pressure not exceeding 5 kg/cm’ or as required depending
on the circumstances.
The pattern and spacing of the holes shall be decided
in accordance
with IS  :  5878
(Part
VII)-1972t.
Where
grout
intake
indicates gap of more than 10 mm, very fine sand or rock dust should be
added to the grout to fill the gap. In certain locations addition of bentonite
may be helpful to hold cement in suspension for satisfactory grouting.
The
grout pressure should be reduced
adequately
when contact
grouting
in
crown portion is done before invert is laid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
