<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 18) (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Methods of Chemical Analysis of Ferrous Metals Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 228, which was first published in 1952 and subsequently
revised in 1959, covered the chemical analysis of
plain carbon and low alloy steels, along with pig iron and cast iron. It was revised again to make it comprehensive
in respect of steel analysis and to exclude  pig iron and cast iron which were being covered in separate standards.
During its second revision the standard has been split up in several parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part covers the methods for determination
of oxygen.
The other parts of this series are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>In  this revision ‘Instrumental
Method’ for determination
of oxygen in steel has been introduced.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values  (revised)‘.
The
number of significant
places retained in
the rounded off value should be same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

upon
the

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
(Part
18) describes
the method
for
determination
of oxygen
in steel in the range from
0.001 to 0.100 0 percent by available instruments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  SAMPLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Location
and selection
of sample can be as per
requirements
and to get a good representative
sample.
Use only solid samples to minimise
the errors due to
surface oxidation.
Sample size and weight shall be
such so as to suit the crucible in which fusion is being
carried out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Reagents<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.1  Acetone or n-Hexane<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.2 Ascarite<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.3 Inert Gas Helium, Argon of the Required Purity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Sample preparation
technique
is critical to attain
consistent,
reliable and reproducible
oxygen readings.
Cut samples
to the appropriate
size using cut-off
wheels or by machining.
Avoid over heating and other
oxide contaminations
during
preparation.
Typical
sample size of 5-6 mm dia (or 5 mm*) and 50 mm
length is suitable for all types of instruments.
File the
piece with clean, smooth file and abrade the entire
surface to remove all traces of oxidation.
Cut by using
clean hacksaw blade (without paint) to 3-4 mm long
pieces weighing
approx 1 g. Hand file again the cut
faces. With a fine grade silicon carbide paper clean the
surface and drop it in a bottle containing
acetone and
do ultrasonic
cleaning.
While handing the sample use
tweezers.
Do not touch the surface with fingers during
and in the following
stages of cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.4 Magnesium Perchlorate<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.5 Charcoal and Copper Oxide,  in a rare-earth
oxide mixed based (used in some instruments).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1  Prepare and stabilise the instrument.
Change
the chemicals
and filters
as required.
Check
for
leakage and run two or three dummy analysis to check
the operation
and clean the system before taking up
calibration
with standard samples.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2 Since accuracy of analysis mainly depends on
the
standards,
for
calibration
select
highly
homogeneous
samples of identical
base material,
for
which oxygen values have been certified.
In some
instruments,
gas dosing calibration
is available
to set
up the instrument
response, but it is recommended
to
confirm the same with standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 DETERMINATION
OF OXYGEN<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Outline
of the Method<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3 Determine the blank value as per the  instructions
and incorporate
the same
if the instrument
is
automatic-type
or it can be reduced from the oxygen
value later.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sample is melted in a graphite crucible under inert
gas stream, at a temperature
of not less than 2 000°C
to release oxygen, which combines
with carbon from
the crucible
to form carbon monoxide
and which is
carried along with the inert gas to infrared detector.
The detector output is displayed
as oxygen content.
The detector output is calibrated with similar standards
for which certified oxygen values are available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.4 Weigh
accurately
to the nearest
1 mg of
calibration
standard
having
low, medium
and high
oxygen
contents.
Weight
shall
be as per the
instrument’s
capability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Instruments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.5 Follow the calibration
procedures
as laid down
by the operation

of the instrmment
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1  For the instruments
