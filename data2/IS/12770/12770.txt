<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 13 September
1989, after
the Solid Mineral
Fuels Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by
the
Petroleum,
Coal and Related Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
the draft finalized by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Coal being the main source of energy and one of the basic ingredients,
its quality is very important
for cement manufacture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement
plants
all over the country
receive
slack coal, as per the linkage, from heterogeneous
sources with varying ash content ranging from 28 to 30 percent to as high as 42 to 50 percent.
The use of inconsistent
quality of coal results in numerous
operational
problems
such as reduced
coal mill output rates and increased grinding energy, improper and inefficient combustion,
increased
fuel consumption
and need for better
quality, limestones,
deterioration
in clinker
quality
and
inconsistent
production,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Separate standards have been evolved for coal preparation,
methods
of sampling and tests, etc,
which are necessary to evaluate the quality of coal in a given consignment
either
at coal mines or
at user’s end, as agreed to between the supplier and ,he buyer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality
requirement
of coal for cement
industry
have been judiciously
evolved
in this
specification keeping in view the mining
bottlenecks
at the coal reserves
in the country and the
optimum requirement
of cement
industry.
Requirements
have also been stipulated
with the
technical consideration
that coal is used in rotary kilns by cement plants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is envisaged that as far as possible, the coal suppliers as well as cement
industry
would endeav-
our to adhere, as close as possible, to the optimum requirements
of coal stipulated
in the standard.
However, it is obvious that conformity
of a vital raw material like coal to this specification
does
not imply that the quality of cement would be necessarily in accordance
with the relevant specifica-
tion for cement.
Similarly, any shortfall/deviation
also from
this specification
may not be con-
strued as a compromise
on quality of cement. It is stressed that efforts are needed for beneficiation
of coal to make the best use of available resources.
The present
standard
is expected to serve as
a basis to aim for and achieve
desired
quality
of coal in the interest of development
of cement
industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is ccmplied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be ro,unded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical values (  revised)‘.
The
number of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that
of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
