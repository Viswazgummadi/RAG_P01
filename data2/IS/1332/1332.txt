<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard has been prepared with the object of providing guidance
to the manufacturers
and the users in obtaining
precast

The
standard

of which mechanical
compacting
methods such as vibration,
shocking,
spinning,
etc, have
been adopted
and does not include hand compac.ted poles in its scope.

for use for street lighting,
manufactured
by
mechanical
compacting
methods such as vibration,
shocking,
spinning,
etc.
This standard
does not cover
prestressed
or hand
compacted
concrete poles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The poles covered by this standard are not intended
for overhead
wiring purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.3 Concrete fittings
attached to or forming
part of a pole are also
covered by this standard as far as practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ZTERMINOLOGY
2.0  For the purpose of this standard,
the following
definitions
shall:
apply.
2.1 Load Factor -
The ratio of ultimate transverse load
to the trans-
verse load at first crack.
For design, the transverse load at first crack
shall be taken as not less than the value of the working load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Maximum
Working
Load -
The maximum
working
load in the
transverse
direction
that is ever likely to occur
including the wind
pressure on the pole.
This load is assumed to act at a point
600 mm
below the connection
of the bracket to the pole and will create a bending
moment equal to the sum of the bending
moments
caused by the
following loads  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Wind pressure on the pole,
bracket,
luminaire
and any raising
or lowering contact gear;
b) Overhanging
weight of bracket and luminaire; and
c) If raising and lowering gear is provided, the weight of such gear
attached to the bracket plus 50 percent of the weight of the lumi-
naire and the moving part of the gear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Mounting Height -
The mounting
height is the vertical
distance
from
the centre
of the light source
to the road surface or to the hori-
zontal plane through the nearest point of the road where the light source
is not vertically above it.,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The poles
tested as above shall comply with the following requirements:
a) The permanent
set after removal of test load, 60 percent greater
than
the working

When
the maximum working leads are reached, it shall be maintained
for at least 2 minutes and the maximum deflection shall be measured.
8.2.3 The load shall then be reduced to zero and the residual
deflec-
tion shall be measured after 10 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.4 The brackets shall be considered
satisfactory
if the recovery
is
at least 75 percent of the maximum deflection while under load.

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.  SAMPLING AND INSPECTION
9.1 Scale of Sampling
9.1.1  Lot -
In a consignment,
500 poles ( or brackets ) or a part
thereof of the same mounting height, same dimensions and belonging to
the same batch of manufacture,
shall be grouped together to constitutes
.a lot.
9.1.2  For ascertaining
the conformity
of the materials in the lot to the
requirements
of this specification,
samples shall be tested from each lot
separately.
9.1.3 The number of poles or brackets to be selected from the lot shall
,depend on the size of the lot and shall be according to Table 4.
‘9.2 Number of  Tests and  Criteria  for Conformity
9.2.1  All the poles/brackets
selected according to  9.1.3  shall be tested
for overall
lerlgth,
cross-section
and uprightness ( see 3.2 >. A pole/
.bracket failirg to satisfy one
or more of these requirements
shall be
considered
as defective.
All the poles/brackets
in the lot shall be
considered
as conforming
to these requirements
if the number
of
defective poles/brackets
found in the sample is less than or equal to the
corresponding
acceptance number given in co1 3 of Table 4.

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.2 The lot having been found satisfactory
according
to 9.2.1 shall
be further
tested
for transverse
strength ( see 8.1 ) of the poles.
For
this purpose, the number of poles given in co1 4 of Table 4 shall be
tested.
These poles may be selected from those already tested according
to 9.2.1 and found satisfactory.
All these poles tested
for transverse
strength
shall satisfy
the corresponding
specification requirements.
If
one or more poles fail, twice the number of poles originally tested shall
be selected from those a!ready selected
and subjected
to this test.
If
there is no failure among these poles, the lot shall be considered
to have
satisfied the requirements
of this test.
9.2.3 All the brackets selected from the lot according
to 9.1.3 shall be
subjected
to strength
test for
brackets
(see 8.2 ).
All the brackets
tested for strength test shall satisfy the requirements
of this specification.
If one or two brackets fail, twice the number of bracketsoriginally
tested
shall be selected from the lot and subjected
to this test.
If there
is no
failure among these brackets, the lot shall be considered to have satisfied
the requirements
of the specification.
If more than two brackets
fail,
the lot shall be considered
not to have satisfied the requirements
of the
specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
