FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(Second
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 November
1982, after
the
draft
finalized
by
the Soil Engineering
and Rock
Mechanics
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Visual
examination
of the soil exposed
in suitably
located
trial pits at
the site, combined
with the already
established
data  for  different
types of
soils is commonly
used for deciding
on the safe bearing
capacity.
While
this
procedure
may
be adequate
for light
or less important
structures
under
normal
conditions,
relevant
laboratory
tests
or field
tests
are
essential
in the case of unusual
soil types and for all heavy and important
structures.
This
standard
covers plate load test method
for determination
of ultimate
bearing
capacity
of soil in place which assumes that soil strata
is reasonably
uniform.
The load test included
in the
standard
is also
used to find modulus
subgrade
reaction
useful
in the
design
of raft
foundation
-and in the design of pavements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Plate
load
test, though
useful in obtaining
the necessary
information
about
the soil with particular
reference
to design of foundation
has some
limitations.
The
test results
reflect only the character
of the soil located
within
a depth of less than twice the width of the bearing
plate.
Since the
foundations
are generally
larger
than
the test plates,
the settlement
and
shear resistance
will depend
on the properties
of a much thicker
stratum.
Moreover
this method
does not give the ultimate
settlements
particularly
in
case
of
cohesive
soils.
Thus
the results
of the test are likely to be
misleading,
if the character
of the soil changes
at shallow
depths,
which
is not uncommon.
A satisfactory
load
test
should,
therefore,
include
adequate
soil exploration
( see IS  :  1892-1979*
) with ~due attention
being
paid to any weaker stratum
below the level of the footing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
Another~limitationsis
the concerning
of the effect of size of foundation.
For
clayey
soils
the
bearing
capacity
( from shear consideration
) for a
larger
foundation
is almost
the same as that
for
the
smaller
test
plate.

<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS a88 -  1982<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>But
in
dense
sandy
soils the bearing
capacity
increases
with the size of
the foundation.
Thus
tests with smaller
size plate
tend
to give
conser-
vative
values in dense sandy soils.
Tt may, therefore,
be necessary
to test
with
plates
of
at least
three
sizes
and
the
bearing
capacity
results
extrapolated
for the size of the actual
foundation
( minimum
dimensions
in the case of rectangular
footings
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 This
standard
was first published
in lC62
and
subsequently
revised
in 1971. In the present
revision,
the use of apparatus
has been generalized
and also specific
sizes of plates
have
been
mentioned
for
the
different
types of soils, besides
incorporating
zero correction
which
was present
in
1971 version
and
prescribing
log log scale for cohesionless
and partially
cohesive
soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied

the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded

Size
and
Shape
of Plate -
Except
in case of road problems
and
circular
footing;,
square
plates may
be adopted.
For
clayey
and
silty
soils and
for loose to medium
dense sandy
soils with N <
15, a 450 mm
square
plate or concrete
blocks
shall be used.
In the case of dense sandy
or gravelly
soils ( 15 < N < 30 ) three plates of sizes 300 mm to 750 mm
shall
be used depending
upon practical
considerations
of reaction
loading
and maximum
grain
size.
The side of the plate
shall
be
at least
four
times the maximum
size of the soil particles
present
at the test location.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
N is the standard penetration
resistance
value
determined
in accordance
with IS  :  2131-l%l*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Test
Arrangement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1  The
loading
platform
shall be supported
by suitable
means
at
least
2.5
m
from
the test area
with a height of 1 m or more above the
bottom
of the pit to provide
sufficient
working
space.
No
support
of
loading
platform
should
be located
within
a distance
of 3.5 times size of
test plate from
its centre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2
The
test plate shall be placed
over a fine sand layer of maximum
thickness
5 mm, so that the centre
of plate
coincides
with the
centre
of
reaction
girder/beam,
with the help of a plumb
and bob and horizontally
levelled
by a spirit level to avoid eccentric
loading.
The
hydraulic
jack
should
be
centrally
placed
over
the plate
with the loading
column
in
between
the jack
and reaction
beam
so as to transfer
load
to the
plate.
A ball
and
socket
arrangement
shall be inserted
to keep the direction
of
the load vertical
throughout
the test.
A minimum
seating
pressure
of
70 g/cm2 shall be applied
and removed
before
starting
the load test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.3
The
two supports
of the reference
beam or datum
rod
shall
be
placed
over firm ground,
fixed with minimum
two dial gauges resting
at
diametrically
opposite
ends
of
the plates.
The
dial gauges
shall be so
arranged
that settlement
is measured
continuously
without
any resetting
in between.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6
Load
Increments
-
Apply
the
load
to soil in cumulative
equal
increments
up to 1 kg/cm2 or one-fifth
of the estimated
ultimate
bearing
capacity,
whichever
is less.
The
load
is
applied
without
impact,
fluctuation
or eccentricity
and in case of hydraulic
jack
load is measured
over
the pressure
gauge,
attached
to the pumping
unit
kept
over the
pit,  away
from the testing
plate
through
extending
pressure
pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7  Settlement
and Observation
-
Settlements
should.
be
observed
for each increment
of load after
an interval
of 1, 2.25, 4, 6.25,

<<PARAGRAPH>>25
min
and
thereafter
at hourly
intervals
to the nearest
0.02 mm.
In
case of clayey
soils the ‘time
settlement’
curve
shall
be plotted
at
each
load
stage
and
load
shall be increased
to the  next  stage
either when the
curve indicates
that the settlement
has exceeded
70 to 80 percent
of the
probable
ultimate
settlement
at that stage or at the end of 24 hour period.
For soils other than clayey
soils each load increment
shall be kept for not
less
than
one
hour
or
up
to a time
when
the rate of settlement
gets
appreciably
reduced
to a value of 0.02 mm/min.
The
next increment
of
load shall then be applied
and the observations
repeated.
The
test shall
be continued
till,
a settlement
of 25  mm under normal circumstances or
50 mm in special
cases such as dense gravel,
gravel
and sand
mixture,
is
obtained
or till failure
occurs,
whichever
is earlier.
Alternatively
where
settlement
does not reach
25 mm, the test should
be continued
to at least
two times
the estimated
design
pressure.
If needed,
rebound
observa-
tions may be taken
while releasing
the load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Shape of the Load/Settlement
Curve -
A load
settlement
curve
shall be plotted
out to arithmetic
scale.
From
this load settlement
curve
the zero correction
which is given by the inter-section
of the early
straight
lines or the nearly
straightline
part of the curves with zero deadline
shall
be determined
and subtracted
from the settlement
readings
to allow
for
the perfect
seating
of the bearing
plate and other causes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
Four
typical
curves
are shown
in Fig.
5. Curve A is typical
for
loose to medium
cohesionless
soil;
it is a straightline
in the
earlier
stages
but
flattens
out
after
some time,
but there
is no clear point of failure
Curve
B is for cohesive
soil; it may
not be quite
straight
in the early
part
and
leans
towards
settlemCnt
axis as the settlement
increases.
For
partially
cohesive
soils curve C possessing
the characteristics
of both
the
curves
il and B is obtained
while curve  D  is  purely for dense cohesionless
soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 From
the
corre~cted
load
settlement
curves
no difficulty
should be
experienced
in arriving
at the ultimate
bearing
capacity
in case of dense
cohesionless
soils
or
cohesive
soils ( see  Fig. 5, curves  D  and  B )  as the
failure
is well defined.
But in the case of Curves
A and
C where
yield
point
is not
well defined
settlements
shall be plotted
as abcissa
against
corresponding
load intensities
as ordinate,
both to logarithmic
scales
( see
Fig. 6 ), which
give two straightlines,
the inter-section
of which
shall be
considered
as yield value of soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 From

pressure
for medium
and dense sands
could
be read,
