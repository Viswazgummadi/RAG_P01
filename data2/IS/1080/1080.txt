FOkEWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
(  Second Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 November
1985, after the draft
finalized
by
the Foundation
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by
the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.
0.2 A series of Indian
Standards
on various
types
of foundations
have
been formulated
covering
specific
requirements
as well as one
dealing
with the general
structural
requirements.
This Indian
Standard
covers
the specific requirements
of shallow
type foundations
other than raft, ring
and shell foundation
which have been
covered
separately
[ see IS : 2950
( Part  1  )-1981*,
IS  :  11089-1984t
and
IS  :  9456-1980:
respectively
1.
0.2.1 The
design
of shallow
foundations
were
earlier
governed
by
emperical
formulae
and
thumb
rules
worked
out in the course
of long
experience
which used to further
vary
from
department
to department.
Moreover
based on the thumb
rules
it was not possible
to design
such
foundation
in soils having
special
problems.
It was, therefore,
necessary
that a uniform
approach
based on technical
considerations
be formulated
for designing
such type
of foundation
and
so as to cover
these aspects,
this
Indian
Standard
was
formulated
in
1962 and
revised
in
1980.
This
standard
is now being
further
revised
so as to include
only
the
specific
requirements
-applicable
to the shallow
foundation
( other
than
raft,
ring
and
shell foundation
) based
on the latest
technology.
The
principal
modifications
are: (a) transfering
the general
requirements
to
IS  :  1904-19855,
(b) deleting
the provisions
relating
to width which should<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied

value,

or calculated,

the result of a test or analysis,

off in accor-
dance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The
number
of significant

in
the rounded
off value
should

value in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
covers
the
specific
requirements
applicable
to the
design
and construction
of shallow
foundations
in soils ( other than
raft,
ring and shell ).
NOTE -  The general requirement
applicable to all types of foundation
including
shallow foundations are covered in IS  : 1904- 1985t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY
2.1  For the purpose
of this standard,
the
definition
of terms
given
in
IS  :  2809-1972:
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. GENERAL
3.1 The
shallow
foundations
cover
such
type
of foundation
in which
the load transference
is primarily
through
sheer resistance
of the bearing
strata
( the fractional
resistance
of soil above
bearing
strata
is not taken
into consideration
) and are laid normally
up to depth of 3 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1 These
foundations
are of following
types
in
addition
to those
mentioned
in 0.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Pad or Spread -
In such type of foundation,
which is constructed
of masonry
and/or
concrete
( plain or reinforced
) and is isolated,
the loads
of a structure
is transferred
to the ground
in such a
manner
that the safe bearing
pressure
is not exceeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Stt-zYp -- Such type of foundation
provides
continuous
and longi-
tudinal
bearing
for loads
carried
by vertical
elements,
such as
continuous
wall foundation
beams or the like.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.  DESlGN CONSIDERATION
4.1  In such type
of
foundations
wherever
the
resultant
of
the
load
deviates
from the centre line by more than lj6 of its least dimension
at the
base of footing,
it should
be suitably
reinforced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1080 - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  For continuous wall foundations ( plain or reinforced
) adequate
re-
inforcement
should be provided
particularly
at places
where
there
is
abrupt change in magnitude of load or variation in ground support.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 On slopeing sites the foundation
should have a horizontal
bearing
and stepped and lapped at changes of levels for a distance at least equal
to the thickness
of foundation
or twice the height of step whichever
is
greater.
The steps should not be of greater height than thickness
of the
foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4  Ground
Beams
-
The foundation can also have the ground
beam
for transmitting
the load.
The ground beam carrying
a load bearing
wall should be designed to act with the wall forming a composite
beam,
when both are of reinforced
concrete and structurally
connected by rein-
forcement.
The
ground
beam
of
reinforced
concrete
structurally
connected to reinforced
brick work can also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Dimensions
of Foundation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1  The dimensions of the foundation
in plan should be such as to
support loads as given in IS  :  1904-1985*.
The
width
of the footings
shall be such that maximum stress in the concrete
or masonry is within
the permissible
limits.
The width of wall foundation
shall not be less
than that given by:
B = W +  30  cm<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B =  width at base in cm, and
W =  width of supported wall in cm.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6  In the base of foundations for masonry foundation it is preferable
to
have the steps in multiples of thickness of masonry unit.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7 The plan dimensions
af excavation
for foundations should be wide
enough  to ensure  safe and efficient working ( see IS  :  .7764-1966t
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8  Unreinforced
foundation
may be of concrete
or masonry ( stone or
brick ) provided that angular spread of load from the pier or bed plate
to  the outer edge of the ground bearing is not more than 1 vertical to a
horizontal to masonry
or 1 vertical to  I  horizontal
for cement concrete
and 1 vertical to 213 horizontal for lime concrete. The minimum thickness
of the foundation of the edge should not be less than 150 mm.
In
case
the depth to transfer the load to the ground bearing is less than the
per-
missible angle of spread, the foundations should be reinforced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.9 If the bottom
of a pier is to be belled
so as to increase
its load carry-
ing capacity
such bell should
be at least
30 cm thick
at its edge.
The
sides should
be sloped at an angle of not less than 45” with the horizontal.
The least dimension
should
be 60 cm ( circular,
square
or rectangular
).
The design
should
allow for the vertical
tilt of the
pier by
1 percent
of
its height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.10 If the allowable
bearing
capacity
is available
only
at a greater
depth,
the foundation
can be rested
at a higher
level
for economic
con-
siderations
and the difference
in level between
the base of foundation
and
the depth
at which
the allowable
bearing
capacity
occurs
can be filled up
with either:
(a) concrete
of allowable
compressive
strength
not
less than
the allowable
bearing
pressure,
or (b) in compressible
fill material,
for
example,
sand,
gravel,
etc, in which
case the width
of the fill should
be
more
than
the width
of the foundation
by an extent
of dispersion
of
load
from the base of
the foundation
on either
side
at the
rate
of
2 vertical
to 1 horizontal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.11 The
cement
concrete
foundation
( plain
or reinforced
) should
be
designed
in accordance
with IS  :  456-1978’
