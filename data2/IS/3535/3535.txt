FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 2‘4 January
1986, after the draft finalized
by the
Building
Materials
and Components
Sampling
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With the considerable
increase
in production
and
consumption
of
cement
which
is of vital
importance
to the
building
industry,
it is
imperative
that due consideration
is given
to sampling
procedures
which
will help in the proper
and objective
evaluation
of the various
character-
istics of cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.1 Proper
quality
control
during
process ofmanufacture
would
also
substantially
reduce
quality
fluctuations
of the material.
The
sampling
procedures
recommended
in
the
standard,
therefore,
include
the
provisions
for both process and lot inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This
standard
was
first issued
in 1966.
It is being
revised
so that
various
modifications
necessary
in the light
of experience
gained
in
its
use could be incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In this revised
version,
inspection
levels for routine
control
have been
incorporated
for those characteristics
that have been included
in
various
cement
specifications
from
time
to time
by
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee,
BDC
2.
In
order
to provide
a better
quality
assurance
to the consumer,
an upper
limit
to the quantity
of material
in
a lot has been provided.
The frequency
of testing/inspection
in process
inspection
for various
characteristics
has been modified
so as to bring
it
in line with current
practices
in the cement
industry.
Keeping
in
view
the
practical
difficulties
in some cases in taking
the requisite
quantity
of
material
in a single operation
of the sampling
equipment,
provision
for
taking
the material
in two or three operations
has  been  included.
The
quantity
of material
required
for the
laboratory
sample
has, been
increased
so that
sufficient
material
is available
for carrying
out various
tests on laboratory
samples
and the composite
sample.
In order
to obtain<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS t 353s - *966*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the increased
quantity
of laboratory
sample,
the provision
for increasing
the
weight
of
increment
particularly
for
smaller
sub-lots,
has
been
included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 This standard
covers the methods
for sampling
of hydraulic
cements
only.
The
methods
for sampling
of concrete
and cement
products
will
be covered
in separate
standards.
_ .z.
0.6 In reporting
the results of a test or analysis,
if the final value, observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with
IS : 2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 Gross  Sample -
The
gross sample
shall be collected
by taking
a
number
of increments
at regular
intervals
such
that
one
increment
is
taken
for every
10 tonnes
or part thereof
from the material
discharged.
The increment
shall preferably
be taken from the full
cross-section
and
thickness
of the stream and in one operation.
The best possible
way of
taking
the increment
is to collect the material
in a receptacle
which
cuts
across the entire
stream
at the time when the material
is discharged
from
the
conveyor.
If it is not possible
to take the increment
at. the point of
discharge,
it may be taken from the moving
belt
by
means
of a scoop
which
can sweep across the whole cross-section
of the material.
For this
purpose,
if practicable,
the conveyor
may be stopped
while the increment
is taken.
The
weight
of increment
shall not be less than 2 kg.
It shall be
ensured
that the quantity
of sample
so collected
is sufficient
for the
tests
as per 5.7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3 As increments
are
taken
from the sub-lot,
they shal! be placed
directly
in moisture-proof,
air-tight
containers
to avoid
moisture
absorp-
tion
and
aeration
of the sample.
If the increments
are placed
in cans,
the cans shall be completely
filled
and
sealed
immediately.
Moisture-
proof
multiple
wall paper
bags or plastic
bags may be used, if they are
strong
enough
to avoid
breakage
and if they can be sealed
immediately
after
filling
in such
a manner
as to eliminate
excess air in the bag and
avoid
moisture
absorption
and aeration
of the sample.
The
containers
shall carry
suitable
identification
marks
so that they can be related
back
to the particular
sub-lot
from
which the gross sample
has been taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
