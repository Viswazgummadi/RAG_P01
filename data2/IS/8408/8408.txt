<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( First Revision
)  was  adopted
by the
Bureau
of
Indian
Standards,
after the
draft finalized
by the River Training
and Control
Works
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by
the River Valley
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Groynes
( spurs ) are structures
constructed
transverse
to the river  flow  and extend from the bank into
the river. These
are widely used for river training
and bank protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1976 under the title ‘Criteria
for river traming
works for barrages
and weirs in alluvium’.
Now, since different
river training
works
are being
covered
in detail in dlffe-
rent standards,
in this revision only provision
relating
to groynes
( spurs ) are covered
incorporating
the
latest
practices
being
followed
in the
field
of plannmg
and
design
of both permeable
and
impermeable
groynes.
Other
types of training
works such as guide  banks, approach
and aflux
embank-
ments are covered
in separate
standards.
The provisions
in respect
of construction
and
maintenance
ot groynes
are being covered
in a separate
Indian
Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For  highly  capital intensive
protective
works or groynes
located
on the
upstream
cf
important
struc-
tures such as bridges,
barrages,
water intakes,
etc, it  is  desirable
to carry out model studies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the
purpose
of
this
standard,
the
terms
defined in IS 4410
( Part 3 )  :  1988 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1
Impermeable
or solid groynes
are construc-
ted
with
earth
or
rockfill.
Nose
and
adjacent
shank portion
are
protected
by
heavy
materials
like stones, stones or boulders
in crates or cement
concrete
blocks.
The groynes
may be designed
to
attract
or deflect
the
flow and
guide
it along :r
desired course.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4  GENERAL
DESIGN FEATURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Alignment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Groynes
may
be aligned
either
normal
to the
dominant
flow
direction
or at an angle
pointing
upstream
or downstream.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2
In case of deep
and narrow rivers or rivclq
carrying
considerable
suspended
sediment,
per -
meable
groynes
are preferred.
These
groynes
offer
flexibility
in
construction
and
maintenance
and
any
alternation,
if required,
at a later
stage is
possible.
These
groynes
cause partial
obstruction
to flow and promote
deposition
of sediment
as the
flow is retarded.
Common
construction
material
for parmeable
groynes
are ballies, trees, bamboos,
etc.
Following
types
of
permeable
groyncs
are
generally
in use ( see Fig. 2 ):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1
A groyne
pointing upstream
repells the river
flow
away
from
it and
is known
as repelling
groyne.
When
a groyne
of short
length
changes
only
direction
of
flow
without
repelling,
it is
known as deflecting
groyne.
A groyne
pointing
downstream
attracts
the river flow towards it and
is known as attracting
groyne.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
Functions
of Groynes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1
Groynes
serve one or more of the following
functions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Pile groyncs,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Tree groynes,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Training
the river along the desired course
to reduce the concentration
of ilow at the
point of attack,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Porcupine
groynes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4
Groynes
can be used singly or in series.
‘I’h~y
can be used in
combination
with
other
training
measures
also.
If
the
reach
to be
protected
is
long, single groyncs
may not be enough.
In that
case a number
of groynes
may be required.
The
spacing,
orientation
and
length
of
groynes
is
usually decided
by model experiments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

1 TYPES OF GROYNES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally
the effective
length of groyne
should not
exceed
1/5th of width of the
flow
in
the case of
single
channel.
In
case
of wide,
shallow
and
braided
rivers, the protrusion
of the groyne in the
deep
channel
should
not
exceed
115th
of the
width
of the
channel
on which
the
groyne
is
proposed
excluding
the length over the bank.
The
spacing of the groyne
is normally
2 to 2.5 times
its effective
length.
For
site specific
cases
model
studies may be conducted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5  DESIGN
OF GROYNE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  The design discharge
for
the
groyne
should
be equal to that for
which any
structure
in close
proximity
is designed
or 50 year
flood
whichever
is higher.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Length of Groyne<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Length
of groyne
should
be
decided
on the basis
of availability
of land on the bank.
Length
should
not be less than that
required
to keep the
scour
hole formed
at
the
nose
away
from
the
bank.
Thus
assuming
angle
of repose of sand to be 2.5
I-I  :  1V and anticipated
maximum
depth of scour
below
bed
be ‘ds’,
the length
should
be more
than
2.5
ds.
Short
length
may
lead
to
bank
erosion
on
upstream
and
downstream
of
the
groyne due to eddies formed at the nose.
On the
other hand too
long a groyne
may
constrict
the
river
and
may
not
withstand
the
attack
on
account
of heavy
discharge
concentration
at the
nose and too high a differential
head
across
the
groyne.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Top Level of Groyne<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The top level of groyne
will
depend
on the type
namely,
submerged,
partially
submerged
or non.
submerged
and
will
be
best
decided
by model
experiments.
In case of non-submerged
groynes
the top level should
be
above
design
flood level
with adequate
free board.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Top Width<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The top width of groyne
should
be
3 to 6 m as
per requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>CRITERIA
FOR SELECTION
OF FILTER
FABRIC<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>mm. Thus
the
equivalent
opening
size of
fabric should not be smaller than 0,149 mm
and
should
be
equal
to or
less than 85
percent
passing size of bed material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Geotextile
filters may be recommended
because
of
ease in installation
and their proven
effectiveness
as an
integral
part
of protection
works.
The
following
criteria,
depending
on the gradation
of
bed material,
may
be
used to select
the
correct
filter fabric:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) For
bed
material
containing
at
least 50
percent but not more than
85 percent
fines
by weight,
the
equivalent
opening
size of
filter should not be smaller
than
0.149
mm
and should not be larger than 0,211 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For granular
material
containing
50 percent
or less fines by
weight,
the following
ratio
should be satisfied:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>85 percent passing size of bed material
(mm)
Equivalent
opening
size of fabric
(mm)
>
1.0<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C)  For bed material
containing
85 percent
or
more of particles
finer
than
0,074  mm, it
is suggested
that use of non-woven
geofabric
filter
having
opening
size
compatible
to
the
equivalent
values
given
in (a) above
may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to reduce
the chances
of clogging,
no
fabric
should
be
specified
with
an
