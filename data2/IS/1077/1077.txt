<<PARAGRAPH>>Clay Products for Buildings Sectional Committee, CED 30<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Fifth Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Clay Products for Buildings Sectional Committee had been approved
by the
Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The common
building
bricks
is not only one of the oldest
but also the most extensively used
building material in construction
work.  It is essentially a local building
material
and consequently
there exist considerablevariations
in the quality of raw material,
the process
of manufacture
and
the quality of the finished product.
Rapid building activity, to be on rational lines, needs a certain
degree of uniformity
in the construction
materials. Standardization
of the common building brick
with regard
to its quality
and dimensions
would substanitally
help in raising the quality of
construction
work and its speed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Keeping
in view the
advantages
of
modular
co-ordination,
Indian
standards
specify
the
dimensions
of standard bricks in 100 mm module
as the basis of all dimensional
standardiz-
ation
in regard
to building
components.
This
is also
in confirmity
with
the
decision
of
Government
of India to adopt
metric
system in the country.
Considering
the various issues
regarding the manufacturing
and other practices followed in the country,
the Sectional
Committee
responsible for the preparation
of this standard had specified modular size of the brick.
Advantages
that a modular brick has over traditional
brick are many, such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) requires less drying area;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii) saving in space of floor area;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iii) economy in cost of brick masonry;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iv) saving in labour cost;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>v) less losses during handling, etc; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>vi) less consumption
of mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However,
it was brought to the notice of committee that there was sufficient demand for sizes other
than modular sizes and that the manufacturers
were meeting such demands
at present.
This had
led to a situation where bricks satisfying other requirerrents
of the standard, but not the requirements
regarding dimensions were classified as not satisfying  the  requirements
of the standard.
Therefore,
the committee
reviewed
the relevant
clause of Indian Standards and decided to include the non-
modular size of the brick in addition
to the modular
size specified in the standard
at present.
This relaxation
will be for a period of four years from the publication
of this standard and it is
intended that the manufacturers
and consumer
organization
can gradually
switch over with the
period to the modular sizes, which are the preferred sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘.
The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off‘value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
