<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>( Part 3 ) ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after
the Methods ,of Test for Petroleum,
Petrolum Products and Lubricants
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Petroleum,
Coal and Related Products
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
the draft finalized by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sampling of petroleum
and its products are taken for one or more of the following purposes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For securing representative
quantities from a part or from the whole of a quantity
of material
required for visual or laboratory
examination
or for preservation
for records. Examination
may
be required
to be made for determining
physical and chemical
characteristics
in order to
ensure:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) The average quality of the whole material,
and
ii) The extent of variation
of qualities in different
portions
of the whole materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) For determining
the density and temperature
of the material
for the purpose
of calculating
the mass of a known volume of liquid or the volume of known mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It need not be emphasized that the most careful work in the laboratory
or any quantity
measurement
may be rendered useless if the samples, upon which such work is based are not truly representative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order
to implement the detailed
provisions
given
in this sampling
should
have
the necessary
experience
and skill. At all times scrupulous attention
shall be given to detail. The methods covered
in this standard shall be supplemented
by judgement,
skill and experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the results of a test or analysis
made in accordance
with standard,
if the final value,
observed or calculated,
is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for
rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3  Grease Sampling<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1  Application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
method
covers
practices
for obtaining
samples
representative
of production
lots
or
shipments
of
lubricating
greases,
or of soft
waxes or soft
bitumens
similar to grease
in
consistency.
The procedure
is necessarily quite
general to cover the wide variety
of conditions
encountered
and may require
modification
to
meet individual
specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.4.5  Quartering<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carefully mix the sample and reduce it in size
to
a convenient
laboratory
sample
by the
quartering
prccedure
as
given
in
IS
436
( Part 2 )  :  1965. Perform
the quartering
opera-
tion oh a hard,
clean surface, free from cracks,
and protected
from rain, snow, wind and sun.
Avoid contamination
with cinders,
sand,
chips
from the floor,
or any other material.
Protect
the sample from
loss or gain of moisture
or
dust. Mix and spread the sample in a circular
layer,
and divide
it into quadrants
to form a
representative
reduced sample.
If this sample is
still  too large  for laboratory
purposes, repeat<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2  Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the
material
is a lubricating
grease and
inspection
is made at the manufacturing
plant,
take
samples
from
the
finished
shipping
containers
of each production
batch
or lot.
Never take grease samples directly from grease
kettle,
cooling
pans,
tanks,
or
processing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>BS 1447 ( Part 3 )  :  1992<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>equipment.
Do not sample the grease until it
has cooled to temperature
not more than
8*3”C
above that of the air surrounding
the containers
and until it has been in the 6nished
containers
for at least
12 h. When the containers
for a
production
batch of grease are of different
sizes,
treat the grease in each size of container
as a
separate
lot. When
inspection
is made at the
place of delivery,
obtain
a sample
from each
shipment if a shipment
consists
of containers
from
more than
one production
batch ( lot
numbers ), sample each such batch separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.3  Sample Size<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Select

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4.1
Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examine
the opened
containers
to determine
whether the grease nearest the outer surfaces of
the container
with that in the centre, at least
152 mm below the top surface,
for texture
and
consistency.
When more than one container
of
a lot or shipment
is opened, also compare the
grease in the respective
containers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If no marked difference
in the grease is found,
take one portion from the approximately
centre
and
at
sufficient
quantity
to
provide
a
composite
sample of the desired quantity
( see.
Table
2 ).
Withdraw
portions
with
a clean
scoop, large spoon or spatula and place them in
a clean container.
Very soft,
semi-fluid greases
may be sampled by dipping with a 0.4 kg can
or suitable
dipper.
If any marked difference in
the
grease,
two
seperate
samples
of about
O-45 kg each one from the top surface adjacent
to the wall, and the other from the centre of
marked variation
are noted
between
different
containers
of a lot or shipment,
take
separate
samples of about 0.45 kg from each container.
When more
than
one sample
of ‘t? batch
or
shipment is taken because of lack of uniformity,
send them to the laboratory
as separte samples.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If more than one portion
is required to represent
a lot or shipment
of grease
softer than

penetration,
prepare
a composite
sample
by
mixing equal portions
thoroughly.
Use a large
spoon or spatula in a clean
container.
Avoid
vigorous
mixing or
working
of air
into
the
grease.
As grease
samples
become
partially
‘worked’ in being removed from containers,
the
procedure
is not suitable for obtaining samples
of grease softer
than 175 penetration
on which
‘unworked’ penetration
is to be determined.
For
grease having a penetration
less than 175, cut
samples from the container
with a knife in the
form of blocks about 152 x 152 x 51 mm.
If
required,
make unworked
penetration
tests on
blocks as procured,
and other inspection
tests
on grease cut from the blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
