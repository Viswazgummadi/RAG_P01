FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
(Part II) (First Revision) was adopted by the
Indian Standards
Institution on 31 July
1980, after the draft finalized
by the Foundation
Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The installation of heavy machinery
involves careful design of their
foundations taking into consideration
the impact and vibration charac-
teristics of the load and the condition of the soil on which the foundation
rests.
While many of the special features relating to the design and con-
struction of such machine foundations will have to be as advised by the
manufacturers
of these machines, still most of the details will have to be
according
to general principles of design.
This part
(Part
II)
of the
standard lays down the general principles with regard to foundations for
impact
type machines
(hammer
foundations).
This standard
was first
published in 1966:
This revision has been prepared based on experience
gained in the implementation of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3 This standard on machine foundations is published in five parts.
Other
parts are:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part
I Foundations
for reciprocating
type machines.
Part III
Foundations
for rotary
type machines
(medium and high
frequency).
Part LV Foundations for rotary type machines of ‘low frequency.
Part
V Foundations for impact type machines other than hammer
(forging and stamping press, pig breaker, elevator and hoist
towers).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a p&tic&r
requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS  :  Z-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.  DESIGN CRITERIA<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 General Considerations -The
hammer foundation
shall satisfy the
following requirements  :
a) The design of the entire foundation
system shall be such that the
centres of gravity of the anvil and of the foundation block, as well as
the resultants of the forces in the elastic pad and the foundation
support, act as far as practicable so as to coincide with the line of
fall of the hammer tup.
While determining
the centre of gravity
of the foundation block the weight of the frame and of the tup shall
also be considered.
W<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The foundation shall be so designed that the induced vibrations in
the structures nearby are within the safe limits fixed for them.
In case of hammers having continuous ‘impacts, the design shall be
such that the natural frequency of the foundation system will not be
a whole number multiple of the operating frequency of impact.
A
natural frequency of the foundation system of two-and-a-half
times
the frequency
of impact or more may be considered satisfactory.
When the natural frequency is designed to be less than the frequency<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of impact.
For design, the combined natural
frequency
of the
two-mass-spring system shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Permissible
Stresses<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1  The total force acting on the pad and on the foundation support
(see Fig. 1) shall be such that the deformation of the elastic material in them
are within the allowable limits.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2 The load intensity on the soil below the foundation
shall not be
more than 80 percent of the allowable bearing pressure of the soil or material
as the case may be.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Permissible
Amplitudes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1  The permissible
amplitudes
which depend upon the mass of the

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3  Mass -
The mass of the anvil is generally
20 times the mass of
the tup.
The mass of the foundation block (Wb) shall be at least 3 times
that of the anvil.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For foundations
resting on stiff clays or compact
sandy deposits, the
mass of block should be from 4 to 5 times the mass of the anvil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For moderately
firm to soft clays and for medium dense to loose sandy
deposits, the mass of the block should be from 5 to 6 times the mass of
the anvil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  VIBRATION
ANALYSIS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Drop and Forge Hammers -
The machine foundation system shall
be analysed as a 2-mass system, with anvil forming one mass and the founda-
tion block as the second mass.
in Appendix A.
The analysis of a two-mass system is suggested
For analysis the dynamic force is calculated
on ,the basis
of momentum
equation.
In case of stray or random impact hammers
(when the operating
frequency
is less than 150 strokes per minute)
the
natural frequencies need not be calculated.
The deflection of the founda-
tion under a ‘single impact should be calculated.
This deflection
should
be within permissible amplitudes.
In case of high speed hammers (whose
operating
frequency
is more than 150 strokes per minute)
the detailed
analysis will have to be conducted
to determine
the natural
frequencies
as well as the amplitudes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Counter-Blow Hammers -
In these hammers as no dynamic force
is transmitted
to the foundation,
detailed vibration analysis is unnecessary.
Only the natural
frequencies
should be determined
to avoid resonance
of the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The foundation
block should be made of reinforced

to cast the entire foundation

If a construction joint is unavoidable,
the plane of joint shall be horizontal
and measures shall be taken to provide a proper joint.
The following
measures are recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1 Dowels of 12 to 16 mm diameter
at 60 mm centres should be
embedded to a depth of at least 30 cm on both sides of the joint.
Before
placing the new layer of concrete,
the previously laid surface should be
roughened, thoroughly cleaned, washed by a jet of water and then covered<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2
In a hammer foundation the first mass of the model corresponds to
the anvil and the second mass to the foundation block.
The mass of the
frame will have to be added either to that of the anvil or to that of the
foundation
block depending upon whether the frame is attached
to the
anvil or to the block.
The spring k, of the model corresponds to the elastic
pad between the anvil and the block, while spring  k,  corresponds to the
foundation
support.
The
velocity
V, is calculated
on
the basis
of
momentum equation.
