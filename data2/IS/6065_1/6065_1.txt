FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part 1 ) ( First Revision ) was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution
on 16 August 1985, after the draft
finalized
by the Geological
Investigations and Subsurface Exploration
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Geological
surveys
and exploration
for river
valley projects
are
usually
undertaken
in four different stages: ( a > Reconnaissance
stage,
( b ) Preliminary
investigation
stage, ( c ) Detailed
geological
investiga-
tion
stage, and ( d ) Construction
stage.
In some cases, the detailed
geological investigations
may be taken
up just prior
to construction,
when these would also be termed as pre-construction
stage investigations.
In order to meet the requirements
of planning, design and construction
engineers
at ‘various stages of the project, geological surveys are under-
taken on different scales.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard was first published in 1971.
This revision
has been
prepared based on experience gained since then by the use of this standard
and to reflect the current practice in the field.
Important
changes in the
revision include the addition of recommended
scale for surface mapping
of preliminary
investigation
stage and modifications in the recommended
scales/contour
intervals for preparation
of maps concerning
concrete
dams, earth and rockfill dams at preliminary
investigation
stage and for
final foundation
grade mapping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard is being published in two parts as under:

nical maps<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 6065 ( Part 1 ) - 1985<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
coordination
among the standards and practices
prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard (Part
1 > gives the recommendations
for the selection
of scales for geological
maps for river
valley projects
required for
various
stages of investigation,
namely,
reconnaissance,
preliminary
investigation,
detailed geological investigation
and construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. RECONNAISSANCE
STAGE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 In the reconnaissance
stage, the objective of the geological
investi-
gation is to bring out the over-all geological features of the area so as to
act as guide lines for the proper planning of the project.
Therefore,
the
scale of mapping for such work need not be very large and the available
geological maps may be made use of.
In case fresh mapping is required
1  :  50 000 scale may be adopted for all types of projects, namely, multi-
purpose storage dam, hydel projects consisting of tunnels and channels,
etc ( see Table 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Aerial photographic
studies should be done on scales varying
from
1  :  65 000 to 1  :  40 000 depending
on terrain conditions
and availability
of air photos along the tunnel and hydel channel alignments for a choice
of the alignment best suited on geological considerations.
These studies
are also helpful for the selection of dam sites and bringing out the over-
all geological and structural features of the reservoir area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATION
STAGE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The object
of preliminary
geological investigation
stage of the river
valley projects is to collect further detailed information
about the surface
and subsurface
geological
conditions around the probable sites selected
in the reconnaissance
stage. This is gathered by mean of surface mapping
on a scale of 1  :  15 000 and preliminary
subsurface explorations.
The
interpretation
of aerial photographs,
on scales varying from 1  :  40 000 to
1  :  25 000, depending
on terrain
conditions,
availability and ability to
pick out details of geology on photos, would
be useful adjunct
to the
afore-mentioned
mapping and subsurface exploration.
The data obtained
from these is utilized in the preparation
of the preliminary
project report
( see Table 1 >.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 6065 ( Part  1) - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Concrete Dams and Power Houses -
Geological mapping of concrete
dam sites and appurtenant
features should be done in 1: 5 000 or nearest
available
scale topo-maps
having
2 m contour
interval
covering
the
area of the main dam and its appurtenant
structures,
such as coffer dam,
diversion tunnels, spillway, power house and intake
area.
It should
cover
at least an area equal to twice the height of the dam towards
the
upstream and downstream
direction of the area covered by the main dam
foundation.
This mapping
should
be extended up to 100 m above the
top of dam in areas of immature topography
and 25 m above the top
of
,dam in mature topography.
At the dam sites involving special geologi-
cal problems,
such as the problem
of the stability of hill slopes, the
mapping should be extended to cover such areas also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3  Earth and Rock Fill Dam -
For
earth and rock fill dams, the en-
,gineering geology mapping should be done on 1:  5 000  or nearest available
scale topo-maps having contour interval of 4 m. Mapping should extend
from about four times the height of dam in the upstream
to a similar
distance
downstream
of the proposed dam axis along the river.
These
surveys
should
be extended up to 100 m above the top of dam in areas
of immature topography
and 25 m areas of mature
topography
and as
detailed in the case of concrete dams ( see also Table 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  Hydroelectric
Projects -
Geological
mapping
of
hydel
channel
alignments,
tunnel
alignments,
and reservoir
area should be done on
1  :  15 000 scale topo-maps having contour interval of 10 m.
Geological
mapping
of areas of special landslide problems and mineral deposits to
be submerged by the reservoir should be done
on 1  :  5 000 scale topa-
graphic
map having contour interval at 10 m.
The geological mapping
of power house sites, surface as well as underground
including the sites
of appurtenant
structures,
for example, surge tank, penstock tunnel area
and expansion
chamber,
should
be done
on 1  :  1 000 scale topo-maps
having contour interval at 2 m ( see  also  Table 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5  Exploratory
Works and Construction Material Sites -
The logging
of exploratory
drill holes,
pits and trenches should be done on 1  :  100
scale ( see IS  :  4453-1980” ). Geological mapping of construction
material
sites should be done on 1  :  15 000 scale, preceded by the interpretation
of air-photos
on 1: 40 000 to 1  :  25 000 scale, which will help to locate
the types and characteristics
of construction
materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  DETAILED
INVESTIGATION
STAGE ( PRE-CONSTRUCTION
STAGE INVESTIGATIONS )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  In the detailed
design
and estimation
stage, the object
of the
geological investigation
is to provide detailed geological
information
of.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>the appurtenant
structure
sites,
such as spillway,
intake
and power
house sites, tunnel inlet and outlet portals,
for the final design of the
structures
and,
therefore,
these areas
should be surveyed
on 1  :  1 OOOb
topo-maps
having contour interval at 2 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Geological mapping of access roads to various construction
sites and
the mapping of plant sites may be done on 1: 3 000 scale having contour
interval of 5 m.
The quarry sites and borrow areas should be surveyed
on  I :  2 000 scale topo-maps with contour interval at 4 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 The maps prepared during detailed investigation
could be termed as
geotechnical
maps,
because,
besides
showing
the
boundaries
of’
geologically
different
units of overburden
and rock at the dam site and
construction
material sites the legend to the different units should show
the expected variation in soil properties,
such as grain size, penetration
resistance, cohesion and angle of internal
friction
values,
plasticity,
permeability,
etc, as gathered
from tested samples of the overburden.
Wherever
possible
classification
of soils according
to IS  :  149%1971*
with soil properties should be indicated.
This map should
also show
the results
of geophysical studies in different rock and overburden
for-
mational units, like longitudinal
wave velocity, Poisson’s ratio,
Young’s
modulus and electrical resistivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. CONSTRUCTION
STAGE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 The object of geological investigations
during the construction
stage
is to keep a record of geological features exposed during the construction
of the project,
and to apprise
the construction
and design engineers
regarding
any special geological feature revealed in the excavation which
could not be inferred in the pre-construction
stage explorations
so that
the new geological features are taken
care of in the design and con-
struction.
Also such record is helpful if additions or modifications
are.
made to the engineering works later on end in solving post construction
problems.
Therefore,
the final foundation
grade mapping is recommen-
ded to be done on 1  : 100  scale for
concrete
dams,
power
house sites;
1  :  500 scale for earth and rock fill dams, and 1  :  1000 scale for hydel
channel area.
For underground
power house
excavation,
the scale of’
mapping is recommended
to be 1  :  100, where as for three dimensional
logging of tunnels 1  :  200 scale is recommended
( see Table 1 for contour
intervals ).
Surface geological mapping of critical areas in tunnel align-
ment ( for example, depression shown or drainage
crossing ) should be
done locally or at least 1  :  1 000 scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
