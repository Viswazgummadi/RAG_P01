<<PARAGRAPH>>Structural Engineering Sectional Committee, CED 7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Third Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Structural Engineering Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been prepared with a view to establish uniform practices for design, fabrication,
testing and inspection of overhead transmission line towers. Part 1 of the standard covers
requirements in regard to material, types of towers, loading and permissible stresses apart from
other relevant design provisions. Provisions for fabrication, galvanizing, inspection and packing
have been covered in Part 2 whereas provisions for testing of these towers have been covered in
Part 3 of the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 1) was first published in 1967 and subsequently revised in 1973 and 1977. In
this revision, the code has been split in two sections namely Section 1 Materials and loads, and
Section 2 Permissible stresses. Other major modifications effected in this revision (Section 2) are
as under:
a) Permissible stresses in structural members have been given in terms of the yield strength of
the material. With the inclusion of bolts of property class 5.6 of IS 12427 : 1988, permissible
stresses for these bolts have also been included.
b) Critical stress in compression  F cr  has been modified for width/thickness ratio of the angles
exceeding the limiting value for calculating the allowable unit compressive stresses.
c) Effective slenderness ratios (  KL / r  ) for redundant members have been included and
provisions further elaborated.
d) Examples for the determination of slenderness ratios have been extended to include ‘ K ’ and
‘ X ’ bracings with and without secondary members.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Designs provisions or other items not covered in this standard shall generally be in accordance
with IS 800 : 1984 ‘Code of practice for general construction in steel (  second revision  )’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While preparing this standard, practices prevailing in the country in this field have been kept in
view. Assistance has also been derived from the ‘Guide for design of steel transmission line towers’
(second edition) — ASCE Manual No. 52, issued by American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)
New York, 1988.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 4.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (January 1998). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this Code is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number of
significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The values of  KL / r  corresponding to (a) (vi)

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  The net sectional area shall be the least

shall be counted, plus a fraction part  X , of each
succeeding hole cut by the line of holes under
consideration. The value of  X  shall be
determined from the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  In calculating the slenderness ratio of the
members, the length  L  should be the distance
between the intersections of the centre of
