<<PARAGRAPH>>Fewer joints result in considerable
saving
in mortar as compared to norma  1  masonry
construction;
The true plane
surfaces
obtained
obviate
the necessity
of plaster
for unimportant
buildings situated in low rain fall area, and
Because
of uniform
shape and size of the
units, considerably
thinner walls are possi-
ble as compared to random rubble masonry
walls, thus increasing
the effective floor
space and reducing the load on foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the
Bureau of Indian Standards
on 10 August 1988,
after the draft finalized by the Cement and Con-
crete Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Stone
is a potential
building
material
in
those areas where it is available
in abundance.
Presently, stones of irregular
shape and size are
being used in the form of random rubble masonry
for construction
of walls, which not only consume
excessive materials
but are undesirably
massive
also.
Besides, it is time consuming and calls for
skilled labour.
The use of stone spalls in the
form of precast
concrete
blocks ensures consis-
tent quality,
uniform strength,
increase in speed
of construction,
reduction
in materials require-
ment, lower foundation
loads, better
aesthetic
look and performance,
and finally saves the floor
space in a building.
Considering these advan-
tages, the Cement and Concrete
Sectional Com-
mittee decided to bring out a specificatior.
cover-
ing the materials, manufacture
and physical pro-
perties of precast concrete stone masonry blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 It is also possible to have stone texture
exposed
in walls and thus giving an attractive
appearance
readily
adaptable
to
any style of
architecture.
It lends itself to a wide variety Of
surface
finishes for both
exterior
and interior
walls.
These units provide a strong
mechanical
bond, uniting the masonry
units and finish in a
strong permanent bond.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Precast
concrete
stone
masonry
blocks are
used for both load-bearing
and non-load bearing
walls, for partitions and panel walls,
as backing
for other
types of facing
material,
for prers,
pilasters
and columns,
for retaining
walls and
garden walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Precast
concrete
stone masonry
blocks,
already extensively used in building
construction
in areas where stone is locally
available,
are
likely to make considerable headway
throughout
the country
because
of the many
advantages,
such as strength,
structural
stability,
thin walls,
better aesthetic
look, light foundation
load, etc.
Precast concrete stone masonry
block construc-
tion is also economical
because
of
following
aspects:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Precast
concrete
stone masonry
blocks are
made with normal weight aggregates.
One block
of 300  x  200 x 150 mm size will weigh about 18
kilograms.
0.6 For the purpose of deciding whether
a parti-
cular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or
calculated
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be
rounded
off in accordance
with IS  :  2 - 1960*.
The number
of significant places retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
