<<PARAGRAPH>>Dams ( Overflow and Non-overflow
) Sectional Committee,
RVD 9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This lndian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after
the draft
finalized by
Dams
( Overflow
and Non-overflow
) Sectional
Committee
had been approved by River Valley
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a dam is constructed,
the area around it is required to be developed
by providing
certain
amenities and facilities.
The required facilities depend upon the importance
and size of dam and
potential
of the lake formed,~being
used as a tourist
place.
The facilities
like lighting,
water
supply and sanitary arrangements,
tourist spot, gardens, transport
system,
medical
facilities
and
safety agent outside army attack are covered in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provisions
regarding
lighting
and facilities
inside
dams have been covered
in IS 9297  :  1979
‘Recommendations
for lighting, ventilation
and other facilities inside dams’.
Provisions
regarding
drainage system for dams have been covered
in IS 9429  :  1980 ‘Code of practice for drainage
system for earth and rockfill dams’ and IS 10135  :  1985 ‘Code of practice
for drainage
system for
gravity dams, their foundations
and abutments (  first
revision ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provision
of check-posts
and watchmen’s cabins, kiosks etc, on roads
leading to dam approaches,
adit entrances and other vulnerable
points be also made in addition to the above facilities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>IS 13144 : 1991
Indian Standard<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR PROVISION OF
FACILITIES OUTSIDE THE DAMS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Suitable control valves,
if required
outside the
dam, should be properly
installed
for safe and
convenient
operation
of the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers
the recommendations
for
provision
of facilities
outside
the
major
and
medium dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Raw Water Supply<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Suitable pumps with stand-by capacity according
to actual requirements
should
be installed
for
supply
and
distribution
of raw water for fire
fighting,
gardens,
sanitary
blocks
etc.
Raw
water supply should also be provided
near
the
entrance of the grouting
and drainage galleries
so that necessary maintenance
operation
can be
carried
out.
Arrangements
should
also cover
other
areas in the abutments
where
drainage
holes or grouting
and other
protection
works
are needed.
The pipe line should
provide for
required valves and suitable
hose connections
spaced
at required
interval
based
on
overall
planning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 LIGHTING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Sufficient and proper lighting is a necessity
outside the dam.
Lighting
installations
should
provide
satisfactory
illumination,
for
proper
vigilance,
and
monitoring
of
the
dam
and
appurtenant
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Lighting System<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.1 The lighting
system
on
approach
and
service roads, top of dam and surrounding
areas
should
generally
consist
of flourescent
light
tubes or high pressure
mercury
vapour
lamps.
In areas where dense
fog is expected,
sodium
vapour lamps should be provided
in operation
areas.
The spillway,
irrigation
sluice,
power
outlets, downstream
face of dams, abutments etc.
should
be flood
lit by
properly
located flood
lighting units.
The spacing of poles for tube-
lights may be about 30 m c/c.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Drinking Water Supply<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To cater for the requirements
of drinking water,
suitable raw water tanks,
treatment
plant
and
pure water sumps or elevated
services reservoir,
with valves and distribution
system should be
provided.
Drinking water
facilities
should
be
made
around
the
dam
complex
at suitable
locations including the approach road.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.2 Special lighting
arrangements
for
earth
dam for vigilance
at night,
after gorge filling
would be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Sanitary Arrangements<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.3 All wiring joints
should
be made in the
junction
boxes provided for the purpose through
procelain
connectors.
Precaution
to
prevent
entry of rain water, flood
water, leakage
water,
etc, in the electrical installation
should be taken.
Additional
plug points of adequate capacity may
be provided
at suitable
locations.
The design
and layout of generator,
transformer,
electrical
circuits,
conduits
and
cables,
switches,
etc,
should be properly
coordinated
with the layout
and design of the main components
of the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Toilet
facilities
including
wash
basins
and
urinals should be provided at suitable
locations
to serve project staff and tourists.
At least one
toilet on each bank
is recommended.
Sewage
and waste water
should
be disposed through
drainage system and septic tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 TOURIST
SPOT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Irrigation
projects
have
aroused
public
interest resulting in increasing
seasonal
visitors
both during and after construction.
Large lakes
created by the project are points of interest and
potential
tourist
areas,
Various
facilities
as
under
may be considered
and provided where
required for tourists and visitors to the project:
a) Tourist bunglows and dormitories
b) Parking areas
c) View points
d) Information
centre
e) Telephone
f) Model room
g) Fishing,
Boating,
Water
Sports
such as
skiing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2.4 Since, in the projects
areas,
heavy
mist
is likely Tao hamper visibility, a series of sodium
vapour lamps may also be installed
at vulner-
able points.
This will additionally
add to the
beauty of the area when such locations
become
popular
tourist spots.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 WATER SUPPLY AND SANITARY
ARRANGEMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Water
supply
is
required
for
drinking
purposes, sanitary blocks,
fire fighting, gardens
etc.
In some projects provision of water supply
to nearby-town
is also made.
The location
and
diameter of water supply pipe should be selected
to meet individual
requirement
of the project.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
