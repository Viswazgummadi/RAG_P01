<<PARAGRAPH>>Structural Engineering Sectional Committee, SMBDC 7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 1) (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 20 April 1989, after the draft finalized by the Structural Engineering Sectional Committee had
been approved by the Structural and Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1971. On suggestions by practising engineers and
representatives of various organizations in the country, the Sectional Committee decided to
bifurcate the standard in two parts, separating structural aspects from the mechanical aspects as
follows:
Part 1 Mechanical aspects, and
Part 2 Structural aspects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The present practice of design of steel chimney recognizes the influence of aerodynamic shadow on
the height of chimney and this aspect has been taken into account in this revision in addition to
the consideration of regulations on atmospheric pollution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design and construction of chimneys has become specialized field with scope for the further
research and modifications. Therefore, attempt has been made in this standard (Part 1) to cover
only the basic requirements. The designer should use his discretion in the use of research data
available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Appendix G of the earlier version of the standard had dealt with the calculation of dispersion in
atmosphere of emission of dust and sulphur dioxide from power and steam generating chimneys
only. In this standard (Part 1) a more generalized approach for the determination of height of
chimneys in relation to concentration of pollutants has been included keeping in view an
acceptable air quality standard at the ground level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, considerable assistance has been derived from BS 4076 : 1978
‘Specification for steel chimneys’, covered by the British Standards Institution, UK.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (October 1997). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>It is the distance between the centre line of the
incoming flue stream to the top of the chimney.
However the height of chimney for atmospheric

distance between the ground level and the
chimney’s top.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Classification of Chimneys<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On the basis of types of construction of the
shaft, the chimneys are classified into two
types, namely, self-supporting and guyed. The
chimney may be lined either over the entire or
part height depending upon the temperature
and/or aggressiveness of the flue gases. The
inlet for the flue gases may be below or above
the ground level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.11 Horizontal Top Plate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A Horizontal cast iron plate fitted to the top of
the structural shell covering the area between
it and the liners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.12 Induced Draft<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Selection of Chimney<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>System which maintains the products of
combustion, when flown to or through it, at a
progressively
increasing
sub-atmospheric
pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1  In the selection of chimneys, advantages
and disadvantages of steel chimneys  versus
chimneys with other construction material,
such as reinforced cement concrete/masonry
should be considered with reference to overall
economy. Some of the important advantages
and disadvantages of chimneys of different
materials of construction are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.13 Mass Rate of Emission<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Emission of pollutants from a chimney in terms
of mass per unit of time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.14 Natural Draft<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Steel chimneys are ideally suited for
process work where a short heat up period
and low thermal capacity are required
whereas it encourages acid condensation
and
corrosion
hence
smutting
and
reduction in the life of chimney;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Draft created in the boiler unit due to chimney
only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.15 Nominal Chimney Diameter<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal diameter at the topmost opening of the
steel shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Guyed steel chimneys are better suited
where the supporting capability of the soil
is
low
whereas
it
involves
regular
maintenance of guy wires anchor points
and other fittings in addition to difficulty
in finding suitable anchor points of guys
at ground;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.16 Output Efficiency<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ratio of energy equivalent of draft per kg of
gases produced by artificial draft to the energy
equivalent per kg of gases of the additional
heat carried away by the flue gas due to natural
draft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Reinforced cement concrete chimneys are
more expensive than other forms of
construction up to about 45 m height but
above this, they are very competitive.
Above 65 m height, they are more readily
acceptable because of their flexibility of
shape and flue layouts, in addition to the
absence of any limitation on size; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.17 Plume<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The trajectory of the movement of gases
discharged from a chimney.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.18 Refractory Work<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All terms relating to refractory work shall be in
accordance with IS 4041 : 1987.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.19 Sloping Cap Plate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Brick chimneys are suitable in clay
industries for use with intermittent kiln
firing and with very high exhaust gas
temperatures.
They
are
cheaper
for
smaller
heights
but
require
regular
attention and, therefore, involve higher
maintenance cost.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The suction that would be produced at the base
of a chimney with no flue losses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2  Some of the important factors to be
considered in choosing the chimney are as
follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.21 Turn Down Ratio of Boiler<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Characteristics of the equipment for
which the chimney is designed, including<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

account future expansion of units if the
proposed chimney is to cater for these
units also;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Draft required by the plant;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.4  The clear diameter of the chimney is the
nominal diameter of the shell if the chimney is
unlined or partially lined. For fully lined
chimney, the clear diameter of the chimney will
be the clear diameter of the lining at the top.
The fully lined chimneys shall have a minimum
clear diameter of 500 mm. If, for technological
reasons, it is necessary to have a smaller
diameter, the top opening shall be reduced by
constructing the passage locally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

necessitate a taller chimney (  see also   7  ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Draft losses due to sudden change of
sections  d s  in mm of water will depend
upon the degree of sharpness, form of
section and the ratio of area of the section
after and before the change. Also, if the
change in section is gradual, that is, if
enlargement or contraction is gradual, the
loss will depend on the included angle. It
may be calculated as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The draft losses in combustion chamber will
vary depending on the actual design and this
may be worked out based on aerodynamic
calculations. Hence, the draft losses at the exit
flange of the combustion chamber or the boiler
should be provided by the customer, for it will
not be possible to standardize draft losses for
various types of combustion chambers, boiler
capacities, etc. The total loss will be the sum of
the losses at the exit flange of the boiler and the
losses in precipitators and the connecting
ducts, in case of coal fired boilers and the loss
at the exit flange of the boilers plus the losses
in the connection ducts in case of oil and gas
fired boilers. These losses plus the loss in the
chimney shall be considered along with the
draft available on account of forced or induced
draft systems while fixing up the height. The
losses across the precipitators will also have to
be given by the customer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is mixed with high alumina cement. The
concrete can be precast in shapes as required,
cast  in situ  or placed by the ‘gunning’ process.
The thickness of the monolithic lining shall, in

with a suitable mortar. It is recommended that
the top surface of the lining should be suitably
protected from the weather.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This class of lining has a relatively low
coefficient of expansion and would cover

<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8  Other Materials
Other lining materials may be required for use
in special circumstances and these shall be
applied in accordance with the manufacturer’s

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — Brick linings not less than 76 mm thick are
permissible for chimneys not more than 760 mm in
internal diameter, by agreement between the parties
concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Design and Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where supporting rings are used, the first
course of brick above each ring shall project at
least 10 mm, so as to protect the ring and allow
any condensate to fall clear of the lining below.
The steel ring shall extend inward from the
shell so as to reach at least 0.6 times the
thickness of the lining. A typical arrangement
of providing top plate and top stiffener is shown
in Fig. 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.1  General
The interior surface of the steel shell shall be
clean and shall be free from loose rust and
scale,
for
example

wire
brushing,
immediately before applying the lining.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3.2  Thermal Expansion
The thermal expansion of the lining shall be
provided for, in the design. Refractory and acid
resistant linings shall be divided into sections;
a suitable height of section is 6 m. Each section
of the lining shall be supported by an internal
steel ring securely attached to the chimney
shell. A space for expansion shall be left above
the top of each section so that it remains clear
of the ring above. The expansion space shall be
filled with refractory fibre, mineral wool or
other pliable, non-combustible filling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Guniting shall be done commencing from the

the diameter of chimney, the thickness of the
insulation and the materials used, so that

are completed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In chimneys having a conical base section, the
lining should not be less than 229 mm thick, as
far as is practicable; the internal diameter will
normally be equal to that of the lining above.
The space between the lining and the steel shell

<<PARAGRAPH>>It has been found from observation and

grade of insulation selected is suitable to

<<PARAGRAPH>>The velocity of the flue gases shall be as high as
practicable to ensure their rapid passage
through the length of the chimney. Ideally, the
velocity should not fall below 4.5 m/s when
under light load but a lower velocity is some-
times unavoidable. If the velocity of the gases is
too low, they will not completely fill the bore at
the top of the chimney, cold air will enter on the
windward side, descend the chimney for some
distance and thus cool the surface of the
chimney to below acid dew point. This effect is
known as ‘cold air inversion’ and may be over-
come by fitting a top core to the chimney. Gas
velocities above about 35 m/s may create
problems due to acoustic effects but these are
outside the scope of this standard. It should be
noted that, however effective the insulation
may be, if the flue gas entry temperature is too
low, condensation and acidic corrosion will take
place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The claddings shall be made in strakes,
using a number of equal plates per strake.
All
seams
shall
be
connected
by
aluminium alloy rivets at not more than
100 mm centres. Vertical seams of each
strake shall be set at the mid point of the
strake beneath.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The cladding shall be fitted with its
internal face 6 mm away from the external
face of the chimney shell, or as near as
possible to clear rivet heads in the steel
shell, this distance being maintained by
continuous circumferential spacers of
6 mm thick asbestos tape coincident with
the horizontal joints of the aluminium.
The asbestos tape shall be cemented into
position by means of sodium silicate or
other suitable adhesive. The ends of the
horizontal rivets in the aluminium sheets
serve to retain the asbestos tape in
position
after
erection.
The
circumferential asbestos spacers divide
the 6 mm air space between the steel and
the aluminium into sections not more
than
1.5 m
apart,
thus
reducing
convection heat losses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A number of insulation methods may be used
which fall basically into the four types
described in  9.2  to  9.5 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2 Aluminium Cladding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Aluminium cladding (sheet steel or other forms
of cladding may be suitable in some cases) is an
effective form of insulation because of its high
thermal reflectivity, and it shall be applied as
stated below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The cladding shall consist of aluminium
sheet not less than 1.6 mm thick with
symmetrical flange covers made in halves
from aluminium sheets which shall also
be not less than 1.6 mm thick.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Each upper strake of aluminium shall lap
over the lower strake by a minimum of
25 mm. The vertical seams similarly shall
have a minimum lap of 25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4 Double Skin Chimney<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The space between the outer shell and the liner
of a double skin chimney can be filled with
mineral wool, expanded mineral, or other
suitable insulator. Unless a special heat
resisting steel is used for the liner, the
temperature limitation of Table 3 of Part 2 of
the standard applies. It is essential that there
shall be no metal to metal contact between the
liner and the outer shell, otherwise ‘cold spots’
occur on the liner, thus reducing local areas to
below the acid dew point level and facilitating
acidic condensation and corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j) To permit the examination of steel shell of
the
chimney
without
removing
the
cladding,
150 mm
square
openings,
located at carefully selected points and
covered by removable weatherproof panels
approximately 230 mm square, shall be
provided. Suitable positions are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) Diametrically opposite to any inlet, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii) Approximately 1.25 m from the top of
the chimney.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) After erection, the cladding may be
degreased and painted with a clear
lacquer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall be so arranged that insulating filling
cannot subside or settle to cause uninsulated
areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5 Multi-Flue Chimney<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>m) The aluminium cladding may be applied
on site either before or after the chimney
is erected, or at the manufacturer’s works.
If the aluminium is applied at works or on
site before erection, great care shall be
taken not to damage the aluminium
sheets. If a sheet becomes damaged, it
shall be removed and replaced with a new
sheet. Riveting a patch of aluminium over
the damaged area is not acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5.1  The multi-flue chimney is an effective
method of maintaining the velocity of the flue
gases at various operating levels and of
providing adequate insulation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.5.2  The liners in a multi-flue chimney may be
contained in a structural shell of steel, brick, or
reinforced concrete, in a shaft within the
structure of a building or in an open load
bearing frame built from steel sections or
reinforced concrete. Normally, each liner is
connected to one combustion unit so that the
optimum gas velocity can be achieved in all
operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n) Great care shall be taken to ensure that
dissimilar metals do not come into contact
with each other. If it is essential in the
design that two dissimilar metals have to
be connected, a suitable non-conductive
and water impervious film or agent shall
be placed between them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.5.3  The temperature of the inner surface of
the liner can be maintained either by wrapping
the exterior of the liner with a mineral wool
mattress or by filling the space between the
liners and the structural shell with an
expanded mineral, or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3 Mineral Wool Insulation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wrapping the steel shell with a suitable grade
of mineral wool fibre insulation material of
sufficient thickness provides more effective
insulation than aluminium cladding with the
usual 6 mm air gap. Thicknesses of over 50 mm
are applied in two separate layers, the outer
layer being fitted so that the vertical and the
horizontal joints are staggered from the joints
of the inner layer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.5.4  When a granular material is used as an
insulant, it is essential that a gate valve be
provided for its removal and that a notice be
affixed adjacent to the gate valve warning of
the dangers of operation by unauthorized
personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5.5  If liners are supported by an open
structural frame, it is essential that they are
adequately insulated and protected from the
weather. Suitable methods are outlined in  9.2
and  9.3 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the angle joining the flange of the chimney
section projects past the outer face of the
mineral wool, it shall be wrapped with an
additional layer of mineral wool of the same
thickness for at least 75 mm on each side of the
flange joint. As mineral wool has to be
protected from the weather, a convenient way
of doing this is to cover it with an aluminium
cladding as described in  9.2  but omitting the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.1  The height of the chimney shall not be
less than the height of the zone of turbulent air
layers formed due to uneven heights of
buildings near the chimney. For the purpose of
calculation of the minimum height of chimney
for keeping its plume above the turbulent zone,
the following procedure shall be adopted:
a) The
types
of
surrounding
building
structures along the direction of wind may
be divided into two groups:
1)  Narrow Building , where  B   ≤  2.5  H B ;
and
2)  Wide Building , where  B  > 2.5  H B .
where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B  = width in metres of the building in
the downwind direction, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H B  = height in metres of the building.

in
the
downward direction of which there is no
other building or obstruction up to a
distance of 6  H B .
2)  Independent Wide Building  (  Type 2  ) —
A wide building in the downward

building or obstruction up to a distance
of 4  H B .
3)  Narrow

building or obstruction at a distance  X
such that  H B  <  X  < 10  H B .
4)  Wide

Behind
Another
Building or Obstruction  (  Type 4  ) — A
wide
building
in
the
downward
direction of which there is another
building or obstruction at a distance  X
such that  H B  <  X  ≤   8  H B .
where
X  = distance in m at which another
building or obstruction is located.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-2.1  This is the zone downwind of the chimney
in which any release of pollutant may be
entrapped into the eddies. These are illustrated
in Fig. 5.<<HEADING_END>>

obtained as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) For Type 1
H s  = 0.36  B  + 2.5  H B
2) For Type 2
H s  = 0.36  B  + 1.7  H B
3) For Types 3 and 4  H s  = 0.36 (  B  +  X  ) +  H o<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H s  = height in metres of aerodynamic
shadow; and
H o  = height in metres of obstruction or

<<HEADING level=3>>A-3  Design height  H  of chimney shall be
greater than  H s  for all the types calculated
above.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>foundation itself as indicated in Fig. 7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-1.1  In any coal fired boiler, a particular
percentage of ash which escapes along with the
flue gas will be precipitated due to change in
the direction of flue, at the bottom of the
chimney. This will require periodical disposal
depending upon the quantity of ash. For small
boilers, quantity will be very small and this will
not require elaborate arrangements while for
medium and high capacity boilers, the quantity
will be considerable and will require separate
arrangements for disposing the ash.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.2.1  This consists of a hopper with a gate at
the bottom which when a particular weight or
volume of ash is collected, will automatically
open and discharge the ash into the pit at the
bottom. This ash can be disposed of by
mechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic systems,
depending on the system adopted for the
disposal of the ash from the combustion
chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-2.2.2  In the case of the mechanical system, a
conveyor will be provided in the pit so that the
ash can be removed and loaded in the trucks
outside.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-2 ASH DISPOSAL SYSTEMS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.1  In case of bigger boilers where the
quantity is more, a separate arrangement has
to be provided and usually this will be a hopper
at the bottom of the chimney and just below
breach openings left for flue connection. The
typical arrangement of this is indicated in
Fig. 6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-2.2.3  In the pneumatic system, ash will be
removed by ejector or sucking by compressed
air and discharged into the main ash disposal
system.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C-2.2.4  In the case of hydraulic system, enough
quantity of water will flush the ash into the
main ash disposal system.<<HEADING_END>>

changes are needed; if the review indicates that changes are needed, it is taken up for revision. Users of
Indian Standards should ascertain that they are in possession of the latest amendments or edition by
referring to the latest issue of ‘BIS Catalogue’ and ‘Standards : Monthly Additions’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
