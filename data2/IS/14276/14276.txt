<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Wood Products
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement bonded particle board,
which is now being manufactured
in our country,
is made from a
mixture of wood
particles
and
cement. This standard
is now formulated
to
provide necessary
guidance to the manufacturers
and users of this product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard,
considerable
assistance
has been derived from the following
standards:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS0 8335  :  1987 ‘Cement -- bonded
particle
boards -
Boards
of Portland
or equivalent
cement
reinforced
with fibrous
wood particles’,
issued by International
Organization
for
Standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>BS 5669 Part 4  :  1989 <Particle board  :  Part 4 Specification
for cement
bonded particle board’,
issued by British Standards Institute.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The committee
responsible
for the the preparation
of this standard is given at Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied with,
the’final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be
rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
( revised)‘.
The number of significant places
retained in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5 MANUFACTURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wood particles for the manufacture
of particle
boards bonded
with cement shall be produced
by cutting wood into shavings? flakes. splinters
or slivers of sizes up to 15 mm in length, 3 mm in
width
and G.3 mm in thickness
on a suitable
chipping machine.
Particles up to 30 percent by
dry weight shall be blended with requisite quantity
of cement, other chemical
additives
and
water.
The mixture shall then be formed into a board.
Boards thus formed shall be stacked
in a stac-
king device
and then compressed
and clamped
in a hydraulic
press.
Boards after compression
shall be allowed
to set in a curing chamber in
the clamped
condition.
Cured boards
shall be
allowed to mature for a period of 12 days and
then dried in a drying chamber.
Subsequently
boards shall be trimmed to required
size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

particle or fraction
of wood or other
lignocellulosic
material

granule,
shaving splinter and sliver as stated below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Flake<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specially made thin particle,
