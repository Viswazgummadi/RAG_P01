<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen Tar and Their Products Sectional Committee, PCD 6<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the
draft finalized by the Bitumen Tar and Their Products Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Petroleum, Coal and Related Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1950 as ‘Specification for asphaltic bitumen and fluxed native
asphalt for road making purpose’ which was revised in 1961 to change the grades of material and
incorporate the methods of test as per IS 1201 to IS 1220 : 1958 ‘Methods for testing tar and
bitumen’. In this revision, the grades of fluxed native asphalt were deleted and essentially the
paving grades were included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Based on the revised methods of test in IS 1201 to IS 1220 : 1978 ‘Methods for testing tar and
bituminous materials (  first revision  )’ and the additional data that had become available, a
revision was undertaken. Bituminous mixes prepared with binders having high wax content have
tendencies to become brittle in cold weather and to bleed in hot weather. In the present revision,
separate tables of requirements of paving grade bitumens derived from waxy crude and non-waxy
crude have been prepared. Requirements of performance tests like penetration ratio, paraffin wax
content, viscosity at 60°C and 135°C and retained penetration after thin film oven test have been
incorporated. Besides, six grades of bitumen derived from waxy crude have been unified into four
grades, and, in the case of bitumen from non-waxy crude, an additional grade of 50/60 penetration
has been introduced on the basis of the data made available from a study carried out jointly by the
Central Road Research Institute and the Indian Oil Corporation (R & D) Centre, Faridabad.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is one of the series of standards on bitumen. Other specifications so far published in
this series are:
IS 217 : 1989
Cut back bitumen (  second revision  )
IS 454 : 1961
Digboi type cut back bitumen (  under revision  )
IS 702 : 1988
Industrial bitumen (  second revision  )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 3.3 incorporates Amendment No. 2 (May 2002) and Amendment No. 3 (October 2002).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of incorporation of the amendments.
Amendment No. 1 had been incorporated earlier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the results of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off values should be the same as that of the specified
value of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  The source of the material shall be stated
by the manufacturer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers physical and chemical
requirements of paving bitumens for use in
roadways, runways and allied constructions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The material shall be homogeneous and
shall not foam when heated to 175°C.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standards listed in Annex A are
necessary adjuncts to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  Paving bitumen Type 1 shall satisfy the
requirements given in Table 1 and paving
bitumen Type 2 shall satisfy the requirements
given in Table 2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For
the
purpose
of
this
standard,
the
definitions given in IS 334 : 1982 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  For a given lot under each type the
softening
point
for
samples
taken
from
different parts of the lot shall not vary by more
than 8°C from maximum to minimum and shall
not fall outside the range of the test limits
specified in Tables 1 and 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 TYPES AND GRADES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Paving bitumen shall be of the following
two types:
Type 1 Paving
bitumen
from
non-waxy
crude; and
Type 2 Paving bitumen from waxy crude.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1  Tests shall be carried out as described by
methods referred in col 9 of Table 1 and col 7 of
Table 2, for paving bitumen Type 1 and Type 2
respectively.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  Paving bitumen Type 1 shall be classified
into six grades according to their penetration
and each grade shall be given a designation as
given in Table 1 with letter ‘S’ denoting the
type and a numeral representing the mean of
the limits of the penetration specified for the
grade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 PACKING AND MARKING<<HEADING_END>>

to
this
grade
has
low
wax
content
and
has
approximately a penetration value in the range of 30
to 40.
