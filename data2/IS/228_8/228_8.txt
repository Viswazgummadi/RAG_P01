<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Part 8) ( Third Kevision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 24 November
1989, after the draft finalized by the $L!ethods of Chemical
Analysis
of Ferrous
Metals
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Metallurgical
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 228 which was first published in 1952 and subsequently
revised in 1’159, covered
the chemical
analysis of plain carbon
and low alloy steels, alongwith
pig iron and cast iron.
This standard
was again revised to make it CornPrehensive
in respect
of steel analysis
and to exclude
pig iron
and cast iron which are being covered in separate
standard.
covering
only chemical
analysis of steels.
14 parts have already
been issued<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
IS 228 ( Part 8) was published in 1975.
In this revision the limit for determination
of silicon has been modified as 0’05 to 5’00 percent in place of greater
than or equal to 0’1 percent
and the reproducibility
of the method has also been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In reporting
the result of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this standard,
if the final
value,
observed or calculated,
is to be rounded off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values ( reuiscd)‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
(Part

the
gravi-
metric
method
for determmation
of silicon  (0’05
to 5’00  percent
) in plain carbon
and alloy steels
including
high speed steels containing
tungsten.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1 For Plain Carbon Steels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Take 5’0 g of sample containing
up to 0’1 percent
silicon
content,
2’5
g of
sample
for
silicon
content
up 10 J  percent
and 1 g of  sample
fol
silicon
content
up to
5 percent,
in
a 300
ml
porcelain
casserole.
Add
30 ml of mixed  acid
to
dissolve
the
sample.
Heat
until
nitrous
fumes
are
expelled
and
continue
hearing
till
SO,
fumes
are evolved.
Coo\ and
add
50’ml
of dilute
hydrochloric
acid
( 1 : J )  and
heat
again.
Cool, dilute to 100 ml with warm
water
and add filter paper
pulp.
Stir
well and filter
immediately
through
medium
textured
filter
paper.
Wash
the
residue
with
hot
dilute
hydrochloric
acid
( 1  :  20  )  and
then
with
hot
water
till residue
is free from
chloride
(check
the
solution
for
presence
of
chloride
by
0.5
percent
AgNOs
solution
).
Transfer
the
residue
and filter paper
to a platinum
crucible
and dry
at
110°C.
Heat,
char
and
ignite
at
1050°C
for 30
minutes.
Cool
in a desiccator
and weigh.
Add 1-2 drops
of dilute
sulphuric
acid to moisten
the residue
and then add 3-5 ml
of
hydrofluoric
acid.
Evaporate
to
dryness
and ignite
at 1 050°C
to constant
mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>After
dissolution
of the sample,
silicic
acid
is
dehydrated
by fuming
with sulphuric
acid.
The
solution
is filtered,
and silica is ignited,
weighed,
and
then
volatilized
with
hydroflouric
acid.
The residue
is ignited
and
weighed;
the  loss  in
