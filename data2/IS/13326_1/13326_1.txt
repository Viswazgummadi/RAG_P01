Sectional
Committee,
CED 52<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after the draft
finalized
by the Geosynthetics
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Coefficient
of interface
friction
between
a given
soil ( including aggregate and ballast ) and a
geosynthetic
( geotextile/geogrid/geomembrane/geocomposite
) used for reinforcement
purposes
is  a design
parameter
in several
applications
like embankments
on soft foundations,
road
construction,
reinforced
walls and
embankments
for
slope protection.
This
coefficient
is a
function
of the nature of the geosynthetic
surface,
the
soil and the normal stress.
The total
shearing resistance
may be a combination
of sliding and rolling friction
and
interlocking
of the
grains in the geosynthetic.
The method of test does not
distinguish
between
the mechanism.
For comparison
purposes tests shall be performed
using the same soil and in the
same normal
stress range. The tests may be conducted
in dry or wet condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In all these applications
stated above,
the geosynthetic
is required
to carry load, through
the
friction
developed
between the soil and geosynthetic.
This method of test is also applicable
for
assessing the friction
between a geomembrance
and the
natural
or compacted
soil in order to
analyse the stability of the canal/reservoir
linings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At present there are two types
of test methods
for the
determination
of interface
friction
between soil and geosynthetic
that are in use the world over. These are the modified direct shear
test and the pull out test. In the former, the soil is allowed
to slide over the geosynthetic
and
the test is conducted
in a manner similar to that of conventional
direct shear test. In the second
type of test, the geosynthetic
is pulled out after it is embedded
in soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part deals with the modified direct shear test method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard,
assistance
have been derived from the following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) “Geotextile
Engineering
Manual”,
published
by Federal
High Way

and Physical Properties

published

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test
or analysis,
shall be
rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(  revised ).’
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that
of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

excess
for clamping. Enough specimens shall be cut to
provide a new specimen for each test,

particular

specimens are
to be tested wet, they
shall be soaked
for 24
hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The soil to be used for the test can be the

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.9 After
the
completion
of
the
test,
the
apparatus
is dismantled,
the geosynthetic
is
removed and its condition
is observed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  The spacer is fitted into the bottom
half of
the shear box. Then the geosynthetic
test speci-
men is fixed on its top so that
the top face of
the material
is flush with the top
edge of the
lower half of the box.
Geotextile
needs
to be
fixed on two sides whereas geogrid is fixed only
on
one
side
opposite
to
the
direction
of
shearing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.10 The test
is repeated
for
all the
three
normal stress levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 CALCULATIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 The results
of test may
be recorded
as
shown in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 The top
half
of
the
shear
box is then
assembled and the soil is filled to
the required
density and the loading plate
positioned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For each test, the ratio of the peak shear stress
to the corresponding
normal stress is calculated.
The mean of the three
ratios
so obtained
is
reported
as the coefficient
of interface
friction
between the fill and the geosynthetic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 The shear
box is placed in the container
carefully.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 The required
normal load is then
applied.
The test is usually conducted
at normal stresses
of 50, 100 and 200 KPa.
The maximum normal
stress shall be equal to the maximum
vertical
pressure in the fill as obtained
from
the design
calculations.
Flood the container
with water,
if wet test is desired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
