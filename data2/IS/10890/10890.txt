<<HEADING level=3>>0.  FOREWORD
:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on
12 March
1984,
after
the draft finalized by ‘the Cement *and
Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.
0.2 The Indian
Standards
Institution
has already
published a seriis of
standards on different types of cement and methods of tests of cement. It
has been recognized that reproducible
and repeatable test results can be
obtained only with standard testing equipment capable of giving the desired
level of accuracy. The Sectional Committee, therefore, decided to bring out
a series of specifications
covering the requirements
of equipment used for
testing cement
and
concrete,
to
encourage
their
development
and
manufacture in the country.
0.2.1 Accordingly, this standard has been prepared to cover requirements
of planetary mixer used for determination
of compressive
and transverse
strength of plastic mortar, determination of compressive strength of masonry
cement and determination
of lime reactivity of pozzolanic
material with
hydraulic
lime. Use of this mixer is covered
in IS  :  4031-1968* and
IS  :  1727-1967t.
.0.3 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or anaiysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS  :  2-1960:. The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE
13  This standard covers the requirements
of planetary mixer used in the
following tests:
a) Determination
of compressive and transverse
strength of plastic
mortar,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Mixer -  It shall be an electrically
driven mechanicrtl
mixer of the
epicyclic type, which imparts both a planetary and a revolving .motion to
the mixer paddle. The relative motions of axial and planetary
revolutions
of the blade should be opposite toeach
other.
The ,mixer shall haveat
least two speeds, controlled  by  gositive mechanical means. ( Rheostat adjust.
ment of Speed shall not be acceptable). The first or slow speed shall revolve
the paddle at a rate of 140 f 5 rev/m&
with a planetary motion of appro-
ximately 62 rev/min. The second speed shall revolve the paddle at a rate
of 2855 10 rev/min
with a planetary
motion of approximately
125 f 10
rev/min. The mixer shall be capable .of adjustment so that when the bowl
is in the mixing position the clearance between the lower end of the paddle
and the bottom of the bowl shall be;approximately
2’5 mm but not less than
the approximate diameter of a grain of the standard sand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3,2  Paddle - The  paddle shall be readily removable, made of stainless steel
or any other equivalent material not attacked by cement, masonry cement,
cement-pozzolana
mixture or lime-pozzolana
mixture
and of hardness
to
prevent being abraded by silica sand, and shall conform to the basic design
shown in Fig. IA. The dimensions of the paddle shall be such that ~when
it is in the mixing position
the paddle outline  conform  to the contour of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_6>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the bowl used with the mixer, and the clearance
between corresponding
points on the edge of the paddle and the side of the bowl in the.position of
closest approach shall be approximately
4 mm but not less than 0’85 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4. MARKING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The following
information
shall be clearly and indelibly
marked on
each component of the mixer as far as practicable in a way that it does not
interfere with the performance of the mixer:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Name of the manufacturer
or his registered
trade-mark
or both,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Date of manufacture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1 The mixer may also be marked with the IS1 Certification Mark.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -  The use of the IS1  Certification  Mark is governed
by the provisions
of
the Indian Standards
Institution
(Certification
Marks)
Act and theRules
and Regu-
lations, made thereunder.
The IS1 Mark on products
covered by an Indian Standard
conveys the assurance
that they have been produced
to comply
with
the require-
ments of that standard
under a well-defined
system of inspection,
testing and quality
control which
is devisedand
supervised
by ISI and operated
by the producer.
IS1
marked
products
are also continuously
checked
by IS1 for conformity
to that
standard
as a further
safeguard.
Details
of conditions,
under
which a licence
for the use of the ISI Certification
Mark may be granted
to manufacturers
or
processors,
may be obtained
from the Indian Standards
Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
