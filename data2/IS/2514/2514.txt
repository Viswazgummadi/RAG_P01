FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards
Insti-
tution on 15 October
1963, after the draft finalized by the Construction
Plant and Machinery
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the
Building Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With
the
advancement
of concrete
technology,
use of precast
concrete
units has also increased
because of their several advanfages
over the usual cast  ,in situ  units in certain situations of use.
A vdkty
of precast concrete products are already
being manufactured
and used
in this country;
and in the manufacture
of these products,
vibrating
tables are generally used because
of advantages
gained from them in
respect
of uniformity
of treatment
given to the casting.
With their
use, vibration
can start from the moment
concrete
is placed on the
base of the mould, so that the expulsion of air is facilitated and compac-
tion increases steadily with the addition
of each batch
of concrete.
This standard
has been prepared
with a view to providing guidance
both in the manufacture
and purchase
of vibrating
tables capable of
compacting concrete with good mechanical efficiency and rated output.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The Sectional
Committee
responsible for the
preparation
of this
standard has taken into consideration the views of producers, consumers
and technologists and has related
the standard
to the manufacturing
and -trade practices followed in the country in this field.
Due weightage
has also been given to the need for international
co-ordination
among
standards prevailing in different countries of the world.
0.4 This standard is one of a series of Indian Standards covering concrete
vibrators.
Other standard in the series is *IS  :  2505-1963

<<HEADING level=3>>6.  CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The
table top shall be constructed
from steel plate of not less than
10 mm
thickness
or equivalent
material
and
shall be suitably
braced
and stiffened to vibrate
evenly so that
there
is no significant
variation
in the vibration
characteristics
of the table top as measured
at.different
points at its surface in accordance
with 7.4.
The table top shall also be
designed
to be adoptable
for reasonably
simple
clamping
arrangements
for fixation
of the moulds.
The sides of the table shall be designed
to
take suitable
clamps
with which
the moulds
can be fixed and detached
easily and quickly without undue loss of time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The bearings of the mechanical
vibrators
shall conform
to the relevant
Indian
Standards,
and they shall be sufficiently strong to withstand
wide
variations
of the load and the full force required
to accelerate
the table
loaded
to its maximum
capacity
to the. full frequency,
and accelerafisn
of
vibration
within a short time.
The bearings
as well as the driving
motor
shall be fully enclosed so as to be dust-proof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 The stiffness of the springs on which
the vibrating
table is mounted
shall
be designed
either
to make
the natural
frequency
of the spring-
supported
system very low compared
with the frequency
of vibration
or
to
allow
the vibration
of table
at
the
natural
frequency
of spring-
supported system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The
design of mounting
shall permit
effective control and adjustment
of spring tension from time to time, if needed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Where
the vibrating
unit is pulsated
by electromagnetic
action,
the
electromagnet
shall be mounted
below
Uhe table and shall be sufficiently<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>powerful to vibrate the table under full load at the required vibration
characteristics as specified in 7.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Where the amplitude and the frequency of vibration can be varied,
the efficiency of the device
provided for varying
the amplitude
and
frequency shall be such that constantly
uniform performance
of the
machine is assured under the entire range of operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6 Where the driving unit is not directly connected with the eccentric
rotor, the efficiency of the drive shall be such that there is no significant
slippage under full operating
loads.
In case of belt drives, multiple
V-belt drives should preferably be used, which shall conform
to the
requirements of relevant Indian Standards, and the driving unit shall be
so located that the vibrations of the table are not transferred to it thereby
affecting its life and performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7 All exposed parts of the table shall be given protective anti-corrosive
treatment to prevent them from rusting or deterioration.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.8 Greasing nipples or closed type of lubricant points shall be provided
and conspicuously marked.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.9 Unless otherwise necessary, the base of the table shall be provided
with arrangements for fixing it rigidly to the floor.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  VIBRATION
CHARACTERlSTICS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Frequency -
The frequency of vibration for the table operating at its
maximum load capacity shall be between 3 000 to 6 000 cycles per minute.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Acceleration
-
The vibration acceleration
of the table operating at
its maximum load capacity shall not be less than four times the accelera-
tion due to gravity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1 The minimum frequency of the table under the loaded state for
determining
this acceleration
shall be not less than 3 000
cycles per
minute.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 The reduction in the amplitude of the table while operating
from
‘  no load  ’  to  ‘  full load  ’  condition shall not exceed 25 percent.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4  Measurement
of
Vibration
Characteristics -  The
vibration
characteristics shall be observed ( by actual measurements or by calcula-
tions ) at different points of the table top by operating
the table at its
maximum load capacity, and the least of the observed values shall be
taken into account to decide whether the limits specified in 7.1 to 7.3 are
satisfied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.1
The measurements of frequency and amplitude shall be carried
out with the help of a vibrometer
or vibrograph,
