FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
( Part VII ) ( Second Revision ) was adopted
by the  Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 October
1980, after the draft
finalized by the Soil and Rock Mechanics
Engineering
Sectional
Com-
mittee had been approved ~by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establishing
uniform
procedures
for determination
of different
characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating
comparative
studies of the results, the Indian
Standards
Institution
is bringing -out
this Indian Standard methods of test for soils ( IS  :  2720 ) which is being
published in parts.
This part ( Part VII ) ( first published
in 1965 and
revised in 1974 ) deals with the method
of test for the determination
of
water
content-dry
density
relation
of soil using light compaction
( see
Note below ).
The purpose of a laboratory
compaction
test is to deter-
mine the proper amount of mixing water to be used, when compacting
the soil in the field and the resulting
degree of denseness which can be
expected from compaction
at optimum moisture content.
To accomplish
this, a laboratory
test which will give a degree of compaction
comparable
to that obtained by the field method
used is necessary.
This procedure.
is satisfactory for.cohesive
soils but does not lend itself well to the study
of the compaction
characteristics
of clean sands or gravels which displace.
easily when struck with
the rammer.
Some
nearly-cohesionless
soils
compact
satisfactorily
in the standard
test although
in many
cases  : c
water density
curve is not well defined.
Frequently,
too in these
cases
indicated,
maximum
density is not as great as can be achieved
readily in
the  field under available
compaction
methods.
With a knowledge -of the
water density relation as determined
by this test, better control of the field
compaction
of soil fill is possible because
the optimum
moisture
content
and the density which should be obtained
are known
by using this  test
procedure
and these can be checked by field control tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  Soil not Susceptible
to Crushing
During Compaction
( WC
Note 1 ) -
The procedure
is as follows.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
A 5-kg sample
of air dried
soil passing
the 20 mm
IS test sieve
shall be taken
( see Note 2 ). The sample
shall be mixed
thoroughly
with
a suitable
amount
of water
depending
on the soil type
( SCI Notes
3
and 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
The
mould,
with
baseplate
attached,
shall
be weighed
to the
nearest
1 g (  ml ).  The mould
shall be placed
on a solid
base,
such as
a concrete
floor or plinth
and
the
moist
soil shall
be compacted
into
the mould,
with the extension
attached,
in three layers of approximately
equal
mass, each layer being given 25 blows from the 2*6-kg rammer

to 1 g ( ma >.
The mould and soil shall then be weighed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3 The compacted soil specimen shall be removed ~from the mould
and placed on the mixing tray.
The water content of a representative
~3rnn~ of the specimen shall be ~determined as in IS  :  2720  (  Part  11 )-
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4 The remainder of the soil specimen shall be broken up, rubbed
through the 20-mm IS test sieve, and then mixed with the remainder of
the original sample.
Suitable increments of water ( see Note 6 ) shall be
added successively and mixed into the sample, and the above procedure
from operations 5.1.2 to 5.1.4 shall be repeated for each increment
of water added. The total number of determinations
made shall he
at least five, and the range of moisture contents should be such that the
optimum moisture content, at which the maximum dry density occurs,  is
within that range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 SoiI Surceptible
to Crushing
During  Compaction ( see Note 1) -
The procedure is as follows:
a) Five or more 2.5-kg
samples
of air dried soil passing the
20-mm IS test sieve, shall be taken ( see Note 2 ). The samples
shall each be mixed thoroughly with different amounts of water
to give a suitable range of moisture contents (see Notes 3 and 4 ).
The range of moisture content,
at which the maximum dry
density occurs, is within that range ( MC Note 6 ).
b) Each sample shall be treated as in 5.1.2.
c) Each compacted specimen shall be treated as in 5.1.3.
d) The remainder of each soil specimen shall be discarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  Compactionh

MomId -  For compacting soil containing
coarse material up to 40 mm size, the 2 250 ml mould should be wed.  A
ample
weighing about 6 kg and passing the 40-mm IS sieve is used for
the test. Soil is compacted
in three layers, each layer
being given
55 blows of the 2*6-kg rammer.  The rest of the procedure is the  same aa<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The removal
of small
amounts
of stone
( up to 5 percent
) retained
on
a 20-mm
IS Sieve
will
affect
the density
obtainable
only
by amounts
comparabl?
with
the
experimental
error
involved
in measuring
the
maximum
dry
density.
The
exclusion
of a large
proportion
of stone
coarse
than
20 mm
may
have
a major
effect
on the density
obtained
compared
with
that
obtainable
with
the soil
as a
whole,
and
on the
optimum
moisture
content.
There
is at present
no generally
accepted
method
of test
or of calculation
for dealing
with
this diff%Mty
in com-
paring
laboratory
compaction
test results
with
densities
obtained
in the
field.
For
soils
containing
larger
proportions
of gravel,
the use of a bigger
mould
( 2 250 ml >
will avoid
major
errors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  3 -- The
amount
of water
to be mixed
with
air dried
soil at the com-
mencement
of the test will vary
with
the type
of soil under
test.
In general,
with
sandy
and
gravelly
soils
a moisture
content
of 4 percent
to 6 percent
would
be
suitable,
while
with
cohesive
soils a moisture
content
about
8 percent
to 10 percent
below
the plastic
limit
of the soil ( plastic
limit
minus
10 to plastic
limit
minus
8 )
usually
be suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 4 -
It is important
that
the
water
is mixed
thoroughly
and
adequately
with
the soil,
since
inadequate
mixing
gives
rise
to variable
test
results.
This
is particularly
important
with
cohesive
soils when
adding
a substantial
quantity
of
water
to the
air dried
soil.
With
clays
of high
plasticity,
or where
hand
mixing
is
employed,
it may
be difficult
to distribute
the water
uniformly
through
the
air
dried
soil by mixing
alone,
and it may
be necessary
to store the mixed
sample
in a
sealed
container
for a mimmum
period
of about
16 hours
before
continuing
with the
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 5 -
It is necessary
to control
the total
volume
of soil compacted,
since
it
h;s
been
found
that
if the amount
of soil struck
off after
removing
the
extension
is
too  great,
the test results
will be inaccurate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  6 -The
water
added
for each
stage
of the test
should
be such
that
a
range
of moisture
contents
is obtained
which
includes
the
optimum
moisture
In general,
increments
of 1 percent
to 2 percent
are suitable
for sandy
and gravelly
soils and of 2 percent
to 4 percent
for cohesive
soils.
To increase
the
accuracy
of
the test it is often
advisable
to reduce
the
increments
of water
in the
region
of the
optimum
moisture
content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. CALCULATIONS
6.1 Bulk Density - ym  in g/ml, of each compacted

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  The dry densities, ye obtained
in a series of determinations
shall be
plotted against the corresponding
moisture

w. A smooth curve
shall be drawn
through
the resulting

<<PARAGRAPH>>7. REPORTING
OF RESULTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 The experimental
points and the smooth curve drawn through them
showing the relationship
between moisture content and dry density shall
be reported.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 The dry density in g/ml corresponding
to the maximum
point on the
moisture content/dry density curve shall be reported as the maximum dry
density to the nearest
0.01.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 The percentage
moisture content corresponding
to the maximum
dry
density on the moisture content/dry density curve shall be reported as the
optimum moisture content and quoted to the nearest O-2 for values below
5 percent to the nearest O-5 for values from 5 percent to 10 percent, and
to the
nearest
whole
number
for
value
exceeding
10 percent
.( see
Note  7 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 The amount of stone retained
on the 20-mm IS Sieve shall be repor-
ted to the nearest
1 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5 The method of obtaining the result shall be stated,
( 2.6-kg rammer
method  ) ,
The procedure used shall also be stated that is single sample
or separate sample and the size of the mould used,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 7 -
For  some
highly
permeable
soils such
as clean ,gravels,
uniformly
graded
and coarse clean sands the results of the laboratory
compaction
test ( 2*6-kg
rammer
method
) may
provide
only
a poor
guide
for
specificationa
on field
compaction.
The  laboratory
test often indicates
higher values
of optimum
moisture
content
than would
be desirable
for field compaction
and the maximum
dry density
is often much
lower than the state
of compaction
that can readily
be obtained
in
the field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
