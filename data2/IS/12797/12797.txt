<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thus Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 20 September
1989, after
the draft finalized by the Dental Materials Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Medical
Equipment
and Hospital Planning
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
is based on IS0 7489-1986 ‘Dental glass polyalkenoate
cements’, issued by the Inter-
national Organization
for Standardization
( lS0 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The term ‘glass polyalkenoate’
is now preferred
to ‘glass ionomer’ which is deprecated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test, shall be rounded off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised )‘.
The number of
significant places
retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified
value in the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in order to reduce
scatter of results arising from snrface  roughness of
the ends of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.2.5 One hour after start of mixing, remove
the plates
and grind the ends of the speci-

Grinding
and the removal

by drawing the
specimen back and forth on  a glass plate with  a
small amount
of 350 mesh (maximum particle
size 45 pm) silicon carbide powder,
mixed
with
water.
Keep
both
