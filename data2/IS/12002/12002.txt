FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on
30 January
1987,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the Air
Quality
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Chemical
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Protection
and improvement
of air quality
for
present
and
future
generations
should be ensured.
Also for uniform
application
of techno-
logy
and
operating
practices,
a code of practice
containing
the latest
available
information
on
air
pollution
sources,
determination
of
emissions,
control
techniques,
measurement
and monitoring
of emissions
would
be
useful
in the design and operation
of dust control
equipment
in cement
plants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
From
the point of view of pollution
of the atmosphere
and habitation
surrounding
cement
plants,
the large
amount
of dust
emitted
by
these
plants
needs
prime
consideration.
This
standard
has been formulated
in order
to help the industry
to identify
the sources
of pollution
and
to
take suitable
action
for pollution
abatement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
covers:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4  air pollutants,
b)  source of air pollutants,
4  pollution
control
techniques,
4  measurement
of emissions,
4  location
and layout,
and
f >  air pollution
surveys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. AIR POLLUTANTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The
pollution
of the
atmosphere
caused
by
cement
industry
is
substantially
different
in nature
from that caused
by other industries
like<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:12002
- 1987<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>petro-chemicals,
fertilizers,
etc.
The
pollutants
discharged
into
the
atmosphere
by a cement
plant consist mostly
of particulate
matter
with
insignificant
quantities
of compounds
of sulphur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Particulates
-
The
particulate
matter
emitted
contains
mostly
limestone
dust, Portland
cement
and coal dust.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
Sulphur
Compounds
-
These
depend
upon
the
chemical
composition
of
coal.
Normally
Indian
coals have low sulphur
content.
Thus
the sulphur
content
with the emission
can
be
termed
as
insignifi-
cant and thus no control
needs to be exercised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION
DUE TO PARTICULATES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The sources
of air pollution
in a cement
plant are as given below.
,
3.2  Crushers -
Crushers
are used in the cement
industry
mainly
for
crushing
limestone
and
coal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1
Limestone
Crushers -
Crusher
selection
depends
upon
the
characteristics
of the
raw
materials.
In the past the trend was to use
jaw crushers
as primary
crusher
and
swing
hammer
reversible
impact
crushers
as secondary
crushers.
Present
trend in the cement
plants is to
use a single
pass high capacity
swing hammer
mill or impact
crushers
to
crush the limestone
to the required
size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.2
Coal  Crushers -
Impact
or hammer
mill
crusher
or ring granu-
lators
are used for crushing
of coal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Raw Mill<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.1  Grinding Mill ( Cylindrical Type ) for
Wet Process Cement Making -
Since
grinding
is done
in
wet conditions,
there is no pollution
at wet
grinding
installation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.2
Grinding Mills for Dry Process/Semi-dry Process Cement Making<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.2.1
Open circuit conventional ball mill -
These
mills
are existing
at a few of the very old cement
plants of small capacity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2.2
Closed circuit ball mills -
Closed
circuit
grinding
is adopted
to avoid overgrinding
and to control
the particle
size distribution
over a
narrow
range.
The
amount
of gases
to
be
vented through
the mill
system depend
upon the amount
of moisture
to be dried.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2.3
Vertical grinding mills -
Vertical
mills are the latest
addition
to the
grinding
techniques
of limestone/raw
materials.
These
mills are
essentially
of air swept type closed circuit
mills having
an
inbuilt
classi-
fier.
Entire
ground
product
in such mills is carried
away by the air/gases
to the
cyclone
land
then
to the electroetatic
precipitator
or
directly
from the mill to an electrostatic
precipitator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS: 12002-  1987<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
In dry process
cement
plants,
the raw grinding
mills generally
utilize
the
exhaust
gases from
the
kill)
so as to make
use of the available
heat
to dry the raw
materials.
However,
the range
of dust burden
remains
the same as given
in Table
1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4 Coal Mill<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1
Coal Drq’er -- Rotary
dryers are generally
used
for
drying
coal
in the
cement
industry.
Volume
cf
the
exhaust
gases
depends
on
moisture
content
of the coal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2
Coal  Grinding -
Pulverised
coal
required
for
calcining
and
clinkering
of the
raw materia.is
in the kiln is ground
in air swept mills.
These
may be either
ball type air swept mills or vertical
grinding
mills.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3
The
exhaust
gas
volume,
temperature
of
exhaust
and
dust
burden
are given in Table
1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5  Kilns -  The
major
portion
of dust in cement
plants is generated
by
the kiln exhaust
gases.
The
particulate
matter
emitted
contains
mostly
lime-tone
dust.
These
particles
get deposited
in the
surrounding
areas.
Dust
concentration
of exhaust
gases
varies
with
the type
of
process
adopted
for making
cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.1
Kilns
Used for Production
of Clinker -
The various
types of kilns
used for production
of clinker
are given below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Cement
manufacture
has
undergone
rapid
technological
changes.
In
India
we have
cement
plants
using various
types
of kilns mentionrd
below.
However,
all the new cement
plants
coming
up
are
dry
procers
plants
with
precalcination
technology
incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.2
Shaft Kiln -
This
process is used
only
for
mini
cement
plants
having
a capacity
of 20 to 200 tonnes/day.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.3
Wet  Process Long Kiln -
In this process,
wet slurry ( 33-38 percent
moisture
) is fed to a long kiln from one end and coal firing is done at the
other
end.
Capacity
range for such plants in India
is 180 to 750 tonnes/
day.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.4
Wet Process Calciner Kiln -
In this process
the
raw
meal
slurry
first
enters
the calciner
for partial
drying
and then enters a rotary
kiln.
Capacity
range for such plants is 500 to 1 000 tonnes
per day.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.5
Semi-Dry
Process Kiln ( Lepol Grate ) -
In this
process,
raw meal
is fed
on
the
moving
grate
in the form of nodules
( 10 to 12 percent
moisture
).
Flue gases from the kiln enter
the grate
chamber
for drying
and partial
calcination
of raw meal nodules.
Capacity
for such plants is
about
500 tonnes
per day.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_7>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS:12002 - 1987<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.6
Dry Process Suspension Preheater
Kiln -
In this process,
raw material
is fed in the form of
dry powder
from the top
of suspension
preheater
and the hot flue gases from the kiln travel upwards.
Heat
transfer
takes
place while the particles
are in suspension.
The gas temperature
would
be 50-70°C
lower for a S-stage
preheater
as compared
to the
4-stage
preheater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.7
Dry
Process
Suspension
Preheater
Kiln
with
Precalcination
-
Dust
burden
and the quantity
of gas generated
is same
as given
in
3.5.6.
Higher
kiln
capacity
would
result
in lower specific gas volume.
The
exit gas temperature
may be slightly
higher
by
about
20-50°C
than
in
the case of suspension
preheater
kiln.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.8
The
exhaust
gas volume,
temperature
of exhaust
gases and their
dust burden
is also given in Table

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6 Clinker
Cooler
-
Here
the atmospheric
air
is forced
inside the
cooler
to
cool the hot clinker.
During
the process air picks up the fine
particulates.
Dust burden
varies in the range of 5-10 g/m3 and tempe-
rature
of
the
air
is around
150 to 200°C
for clinker
exit temperature
of
approximately
100°C.
The
air  volume
is in the range of 3 to 4 ma/kg of
clinker
cooled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7
Cement
Mills
-
Both open circuit
and
closed
circuit
cylindrical
ball
type
grinding
mills
are used for grinding
the clinker
into cement.
The
temperature
of exit air is about
100°C if
water spray is used
inside
the mill.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.8  Packing
-
Dust generation
in a packing
plant
takes
place
mainly
on
account
of the use of jute  bags  for  packing
the cement.
The other
points of dust generation
are:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) conveying
equipment
from
the
cement
silo
to the
packing
machines,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) packing
machines
where the bags are filled,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) various
transfer
points
of
the
belt
conveyors
conveying
the
cement
bags to the railway
wagons
or trucks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.9  Material
Transfer
Point -
Dust is generated
wherever
there
is a
transfer
of fine
materials
from
one
point to another
especially
in belt
conveyor
systems.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.10
Fugitive
Emissions
-
Fugitive
emissions
can
occur
due
to
improper
operational
practices,
such as material
falling from a height on
to a surface,
leakages
in ducts, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. POLLUTION
CONTROL
TECHNIQU-ES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Control
Methods
-
Control
of
pollutant
emissions
may
be
divided
into two categories:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Control
of
material
present
in
gas
streams
inside
process
equipment,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Control
of
materials
arising
in
open
or
unconfined
areas.
Strategies
for
control
include
basic changes
in procedures
and
materials
which eliminate
or
reduce
emissions
and
the
use of
addon
auxiliary
equipment
to remove
pollutants
prior to release
of the carrier
gas to the atmosphere.
Often,
changes
in hooding,
material
handling
and
good
house-keeping
can
reduce
the
emission
of air pollutants
into the atmosphere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1
Equipment
for the control
of
particulate
emission
includes
dry
inertial
and centrifugal
collectors,
such as cyclones,
low and hish
energy
scrubbers,
electrostatic
precipitators
and
cleanable
fabric
filters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Equipment
selection
may
be
made
only from among
those
which
are
capable
of performing
the required
task with consideration
given to the
cost
of
the
equipment.
The
selection
depends
on
the pollutant
and

Types
of Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1 Cyclone -
Cyclone
is
the
simplest
form
of
pollution
control
equipment
for
suspended
matter
and
separates
suspended
particulate
matter
from the gas carrying
it.
High efficiency
cyclones
are
generally
provided
in clusters.
Collection
efficiency
ranges
from 60 to 85 percent.
Particles
above
20 micron
size can be arrested.
It
is advisable
to use
cyclone
separators
only as primary
dust control
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
Wet  Scrubbers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.1
Venturi scrubbers -
In these scrubbers
the help of
a spray
of
water
is taken to agglomerate
finer dust particles.
Collection
efficiency
ranges from 90-95
percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.2
Submerged type scrubbers --  In these type
of scrubbers
higher
efficiencies
of the range of 95-97
percent
can be achieved
by passing the
entire volume
of gases through
a layer of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2.3
Both the above types present
a problem
of separating
out the
fine
particles
of dust
collected
in the water and  of  recovering
water.
These
can be used in the processing
of limestone
and
coal,
but
not in
the processing
of clinker
and cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3
Bag Type Filter -
This is the most widely used type of pollution
control
equipment
in
the cement
industry.
The efficiency
of the dust
collector
can be over 99.5
percent.
C!eaning
of
bags
by
pulse-jet
of
compressed
air
is generally
preferred.
Present
day bag type filters are
available
for all kintis of applications
including
fine coal
dust.
However,
proper
safety precautions
are required
to be taken
in
the
case
of
coal
grinding
and drying
installations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4
Electrostatic
Precipitator -
This
is the
most
modern
piece
of
equipment
available
for controlling
air pollution.
Collection
efficiency
can
be
over 99’9 percent.
Basically
electrostatic
precipitator
operation
consists
in the action
of unidirectional
electric
field
upon
free
electric
charges
present
in the
field.
High
voltage
( 30-80 KV
) gives rise to
emission
of free electrons
( carona
effect ).
Under
the influence
of elect-
rical
field
the
dust
particles
move to collecting
electrodes
at migration
velocity.
It’s
effective
and
trouble
free
operation
demands
careful
selection,
design,
fabrication,
erection
and handling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>42.5
Gravel Bed Filters -
These
filters are used in many
countries
for
cleaning
the vent gases from the clinker
cooler_.
Though
it has not been
tried out in our country,
this
filter
is suitable
for the
highly
abrasive
clinker
particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Selection
of Air Pollution
Control
Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1  Crusher Jnstallations -
A bag type dust collector
is necessary
for
large crushers
of capacity
150 tonnes per hour and above.
Eor smaller
crushers,
dust pollution
may be reduced
to a large
extent
by providing
water sprays at appropriate
locations
in the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2
Dry Raw Grinding Mills -
In case hot gay is drawn
from the dry
process
kiln,
it is better
to vent the raw mill vent gases directly
into the
kiln exhaust
gas dust control
equipment.
Otherwise,
a pulse-jet
type of
bag
dust
collector
may
be used.
However,
in case moisture
content
of
the
raw
material
is high
an
electrostatic
precipitator
may
also
be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.3
Coal Dryers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.3.1
Coal
dryer exhaust gases -
An
electrostatic
precipitator
or
special
material
bag
type dust collector
can be considered
for cleaning
coal
dryer
exhaust
gases.
Air
pollution
control
installations
should
comply
with all safety regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.3.2
Coal  dryers-For
bigger
installations,
electrostatic
precipitators
may be considered.
In such cases
proper
safety
regulation
~should be
applied.
For
smaller
installations
special material
bag type dust colle-
ctors are also suitable.
In case water is available
in adequate
quantity,
wet
scrubbers
can
also
be
considered
but they pose a problem
in the
disposal
of coal sludge formed
in these scrubbers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4
Kiln -
To
meet
the
pollution
control
requirements,
use of
electrostatic
precipitators
is preferred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4.1
In the case of dry process plants,
exhaust
gases are
required
to be conditioned
in a conditioning
tower before entering
the electrostatic
precipitator.
Spraying
of
water
inside
the conditioning
tower lowers
down the temperature
of gases
to
150X,
and
increases
the dew point
temperature
to about 55”C,
thus providing
the best conditions
for preci-
pitation
in an electrostatic
precipitator.
However,
in the
plants
where
availability
of
water
is a problem,
it is recommended
to use fibre
glass
bag dust collectors
with latest pulse jet type of arrangement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4.2
Selection
of dust
control
equipment
for
semi-dry
process
cement
kilns with grate type preheaters
needs careful
consideration
with
respect
to acid dew point temperature
and analysis
should
be done with
care for the same before installing
electrostatic
precipitators
or bag
type
dust collectors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4.3
In
case
of wet
process
kilns
electrostatic
precipitators
are
ideally
suited.
On the relatively
old wet process
kilns
of small
capa-
cities, wet scrubbers
may also be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.5
Clinker Coolers -
There
is no generation
of dust in the
operation
of planetary
coolers.
In
the
case
of grate
type
clinker
coolers,
dust
generation
is not appreciable
when operating
under stable condition
and
a multicone
dust collector
is adequate
for the control
of dust pollution.
Other
options
available
for this are electrostatic
precipitators
and gravel
bed filters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.6
Cement Mills -
Electrostatic
precipitators
and pulse-jet
type
bag
dust collectors
are good for venting
the exit gases from cement
mills.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.6.1
Coal dryer exchaust gases -
An
electrostatic
precipitator
or
special
material
bag
type dust collector
can be considered
for cleaning
coal
dryer
exhaust
gases.
Air
pollution
control
installations
should
comply
with air safety regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.7
Material
Handling
Operations -
In material
handling
operations,
especially
the transfer
of material
from one conveyor
to other,
hoods are
to be provided
from which the air can be drawn
by means of suction
and
dedusted
in a fabric
filter.
Several
conveyor
transfer
points can thus be
ventilated
through
a dust collector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8
Fugitive Emission Sources -
Fugitive
emissions
can be prevented
by
better
operational
practices.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  SAMPLING
AND
MEASUREMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Sampling
and
measurement
of
particulate
emission
from
stacks
should
be
carried
out
in
accordance
with
the method
prescribed
in
IS  :  11255
( Part
1 )-1985”.
Regular
measurement
of emissions
from
the
various
vent stacks in a cement
plant
is necessary.
This,
however,
requires
specialised
equipment
and considerable
skill.
It is, therefore,
necessary
that adequate
training
is given
to the
concerned
personnel.
Alternatively
such
measurements
may
be
carried
out with the aid of
specialized
agencies
who are equipped
for this work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  -LOCATION
AND LAYOUT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  While
deciding
location
of a new cement plant, the micrometeorologi-
cal factor
prevailing
in the area and the topography
of the area should
be
considered
( see IS  :  8829-19787
).
Areas
with
frequent
record
of
invention
occurrence
and valleys should
not be considered
as prospective

<<PARAGRAPH>>residential
areas should be such that they are located
towards
the cleaner
side of the plant.
There
should
be a green belt of adequate
width around
the plant boundary
to absorb
noise and arrest dust.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The
layout
of the
plant
should
be such that a predominent
wind
direction
is from cleaner
side of plant to pollution
emitting
side of plant.
The
layout
of highly
polluting
sections should be preferably
perpendi-
cular to the predominent
wind direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. AIR
POLLUTIO-N
SURVEY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1
An air-pollution
survey
of,the
localities
around
the
proposed
plant
or proposed
expansion
should be conducted
to determine
the background
pollution
level
already
existing,
due to natural
and other sources.
If
the background
level is found to be excessive,
measures
should
be
taken
to reduce
it by modifying
pollution
control
systems of the existing
sources.
The
new pollution
control
units of the plant should
then be designed
to
contribute
only
the difference
between
acceptable
value of ground
level
concentration
and the background
level already
existing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2
In
each
cement
plant,
independent
pollution
monitoring
facilities
should be provided.
A systematic
record
of emission
inventories
and
ground
level concentrations
in residential
location
at predetermined
grid
points
[ see IS  :  5182 ( Part
14 )-1979*
1 should
be
maintained
by the
pollution
monitoring
group.
It
is preferable
to have a sampling

laboratory
and
trained
personnel
for pollution
monitoring
in
the plant itself.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
