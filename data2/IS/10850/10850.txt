FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 23 February
1984, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Indian Standards Institutionhas
formulated a series of standards
on different types of cement and methods of tests of cement.
As it was
recognized that reliable or reproducible
test results could be obtained only
by using standard types of testing equipment which would give the desired
level of accuracy, the Sectional Committee proposed to bring out a series
of specifications covering the requirements of testing equipment to encour-
age the development
and manufacture
of standard testing equipment for
cement testing in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Accordingly,
this standard has been prepared to cover requirements
of
apparatus
for measurement
of water retentivity of masonry cement.
The
relevant method of test is covered in IS:4031-1968”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In addition to the apparatus described in this standard, the following
are also required for conducting the test for measuring water retentivity of
masonry cement:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Planetary mixer conforming to IS  :  10890-19847.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Flow table and accessories conforming to 18:5512-19835.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Tamping bar ( see 9.3.5 of IS: 4031-1968*).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS :2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Apparatus for the Water Retention Test-The
assembly
of the
apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. The apparatus consists of a water aspirator
or other source of vacuum controlled
by a mercury column relief and
connected by way of a three-way stopcock to a funnel upon which rests a
perforated
dish.
The perforated dish shall be made of metal not attacked<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>by masonry
mortar.
The metal in the base of the dish shall have a
thickness of 1.7 to 1.9 mm and shall conform with the outline shown in
Fig. 1. The bore of the stopcock shall have a 4 mm diameter, and the
connecting glass tubing shall have a minimum inside diameter of 4 mm.
A
mercury manometer indicates the vacuum.
A synthetic rubber gasket shall
be permanently
sealed to the top of the funnel and shall be lightly coated
with petrolatum
or light cup grease during a test to ensure a seal between
the funnel and dish.
Care shall be taken to ensure that none of the holes
in the perforated
dish are clogged from the grease used on the rubber
gasket.
Hardened filter paper of a grade equivalent to Carl Schleicher &
Schuell filter paper No. 576 or to Whatman No. 50 filter paper shall be
used.
It shall be of such diameter that it will lie flat and completely cover
the bottom of the dish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Straightedge -  Steel straightedge should not be less than 200 mm long,
and not less than 1.5 mm nor more than 3 mm in thickness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. MARKING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The following information
shall be clearly and indelibly marked on
each  component
of the apparatus as far as practicable in way that it does
not interfere with the performance
of the apparatus:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Name of the manufacturer
or his registered trade-mark
or both,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Date of manufacture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1 The apparatus
may also be marked with the IS1 Certification
Mark:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -- The use of the ISI Certification
Mark is governed
by the provisions
of the Indtan
Standards
Institution
( Certification
Marks ) Act
and the Rules
and Regulations
made thereunder.
The 1SI Mark on products

conveys the assurance
that they have been produced
to comply
with the requirements
of that standard
under a well defined system of_inspection,
testing
and quality control
which is devised and supervised
by ISI and operated
by the producer.
IS1 marked products
are also continuously
checked by IS1 for
conformity
to that standard
as a further
safeguard.
Details of conditions
under
which
a licence for the use of the IS1 Certification
Mark
may be granted
to
manufacturers
or
processors,
may
be
obtained
from
the
Indian
Standards
