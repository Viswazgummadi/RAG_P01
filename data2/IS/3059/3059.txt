<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Livestock Husbandry Systems and Equipment Sectional Committee had been approved by the Food and
Agriculture Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A large number of monkeys are being transported from one place to another for the purpose of medical research
and vaccine production. The safe transit of these animals is of great importance on humanitarian as well as
economic grounds. In order to achieve this objective, it was felt necessary that a code for the transport of
monkeys be made available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Earlier, there were three standards on code for the transport of monkeys: IS 3059:1981
‘Code for transport of
monkeys by air (fht
revision)’, IS 3699 (Part 1) : 1978 ‘Code for transport of monkeys by land : Part 1
Transport from trapping area to the nearest rail-head @-st  revision)’;
and IS 3699 (Part 2) :1978
‘Code for
transport of monkeys by land : Part 2 Transport from rail-head to the nearest airport (second  revision)’.
While
reviewing these standards, the Committee decided to incorporate the requirements of IS 3699 (Part 1) and IS
3699 (Part 2) in IS 3059. In addition code of transport of monkeys by sea has also been included in this revision
of IS 3059. With the publication of this standard, IS 3699 (Part 1) and IS 3699 (Part 2) shall be withdrawn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation of this standard, due consideration has been given to the  Prevention
of Cruelty
to Animals
Act, 1960  and rules framed thereunder. However, it is subject to the restrictions imposed under this Act wherever
applicable and as amended from time to time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shaii be rounded off in accordance with IS 2:1960
‘Rules
for rounding off numerical values  (revised)’.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value
should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
prescribes
the conditions
for the
transport of monkeys by rail, road, air and sea with a
view to ensuring proper care, immediately before and
during
their

This code also includes
recommendations
in regard to the hygiene of the
animal handlers
and of the aircraft
in which the
animals are carried.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.10 Not more than two cages shall be placed one over
the other. Gunny sacking shall be placed between the
two cages, when placed one over the other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.11 Loading and unloading should be carried out
quickly and efficiently. Cages shall be stowed in such
a manner that ventilation is adequate and the monkeys
are not exposed to draught and direct heat or cold.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  GENERAL
REQUIREMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.12 While unloading the monkeys, care shall be taken
not to throw, drop or mishandle cages in any manner,
which might cause harm to or unnecessarily agitate
the monkeys. Same precautions shall be taken while
transferring
the cages. No other material shall be
carried in the trolley.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The time in transit shall be as short as possible
and factors causing stress to monkeys shall be reduced
as much as possible.<<HEADING_END>>

during the journey.
Animal handlers shall receive
instructions
for emergencies
in flight. The senior
animal handler shall have reasonable access to the
Captain of the freighter aircraft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3  The railway authority shall not permit transport
of other species of animals, such as birds and fish;
and injuriouslpoisonous materials, such as pesticides
and insecticides with monkeys in the same cabin or
compartment of the train.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 The railway authority should ensure that the wagon
transporting the monkeys is adequately ventilated and
it protects animals from exposure to draughts, direct
heat or cold and rain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the monkeys on freighter aircraft shall be decided by
the Government of India.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.1
Ventilation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The air shall be changed not less than 12 times per
hour, and draughts shall be avoided. There shall be
no dead pockets of air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.4
It is desirable
that wherever habitual trans-
shipment of monkeys takes place at intermediary
airports, suitable accommodation should be provided
during transit period.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.2 The optimum temperature is considered to be
24”C, in practice equivalent to 16 changes of air per
hour; the maximum is 27”C, that is, 20 changes of air
per hour and the minimum is 18“C, that is, 12 changes
of air per hour. The variation in temperature shall not
be greater than 0.6°C every 5 minutes, and extremes
of temperature shall be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3 Sickness

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3.1 An  empty cage of the usual dimensions with its
sides covered except 50 mm at the top to allow for
ventilation shall be provided in the freighter aircrafl
for housing the monkeys, which fall sick or injured
during the journey.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.3 The humidity shall be kept as low as possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

300 mm and height 480 mm)
having
airtight
lid with rubber
gasket
and with
fastening arrangements or impervious disposal bags
shall be provided in the aircraft for segregating the
monkeys that die during the journey. About 2.5 kg of
saw dust and 0.25 kg of lysol or other disinfectant
shall also be carried in the aircraft. After putting the
dead animais into the container, a layer of sawdust
shall cover the dead animals and the disinfectant shall
be sprinkled over the sawdust.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

aircraft shall not fly more than 2750 m (9 000 feet)
above sea level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

they shall travel in semi-darkness. This would make
them quieter and less inclined to tight and thus give
them better opportunities of resting.<<HEADING_END>>

arrangements as in 9.3.1 and 9.3.2 shall be made at
the intermediate airports.<<HEADING_END>>
