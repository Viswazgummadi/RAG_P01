<<PARAGRAPH>>Water Sectional Committee,
CHD 013<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
S tandard ( Third Revision ) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the
draft finalized by Water Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Chemical Division Couocil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was first issued in 1957 concerning
water purified by thermal
distillation
only. It
was revised
in 1960 in which water purified by other methods
also were incorporated.
In the light of
work carried out at the international
level, this standard was again revised
in 1977 incorporating
the
requirements
for residue on ignition and specific conductivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Based on the experience
gained over the years, the technical
committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard decided to revise it again to cover different grades of reagent water used for different
purposes
and also to align it with IS0 3696  :  1987 ‘Water for analytical
laboratory
use -
Specification
and test methods’
on this subject.
In this revision, limits for three grades of water depending on their
end use have been specified and the characteristics
have also been suitably modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements
for chlorides,
sulphates, ammonia,
calcium, magnesium and heavy
metals
are more
broadly reflected by the requirement
electrical
conductivity
and therefore
need not be covered separat-
ely for convenience
and simplicity.
The requirement
for silica content has been incorporated
as it is a
significant parameter
for evaluation
of reagent grade water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important
to prepare
in the laboratory
or purchase from outside,
the reagent grade water to be
used for dilution of reagents and blank analysis. Generally reagent grade water means
the distilled
or
de-ionized
water
with no detectable
amount of the compound
or the element to be analysed at the
detection
limit of analytical
procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Distillation
removes water miscible organics and ionizable
inorganic
impurities,
as well as colloidal
solids from
water. The quality of resulting distillate varies wnh the original source of the water, the
materral from which distillation
apparatus
was constructed
and the number of distillations.
Generally
metal stills yield a product inferior to that obtained
from borosilicate
glass or vitreous silica.
Multiple
distillations
from
vitreous/silica
usually
required to obtain high purity water which is also relatively
from organic traces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Distillation,
de-ionization,
reverse osmosis ail can produce reagent
water in suitable
arrangement
to
obtain the desired quality of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the
final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded off in
accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values ( revised)‘.
The number of signi-
ficant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

2 Because of the difficulties
associated
with measurement
of the pH value of high purity water,
and ‘the
doubt-
ful significance
of the value obtained,
limits for the pH of grade 1 and grade 2 water have not been specified.
3 The limit
for
oxidizable
matter
and
residue
after
evaporation
for grade 1 water is not specified
because  of
the difficulty of testing for compliance
at this level of purity,
the quality of grade 1 water is, however,
assured,
by compliance
with the other requirements
and by its method of preparation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
