<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 22 August
1970, after the draft finalized
by the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Precast
reinforced
and unreinforced
concrete
covers are used for cover-
ing cables with a view to give a warning
of the presence
of an underground
electric
cable and also to
rotect cables against blows from excavating
tools.
This
standard
has been
ormulated
to provide
guidance
in the manufac-
F
ture and use of the above cable covers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
The cable eovers have been
classified
based. upon
the description’
and
condition
where
the
above
covers are normally
used.
The
use of
unreinforced
concrete
covers is recommended
mainly
for locations
where
dangers
from pick-axing
are not significant
and in situations
of secondary
importance.
This standard
does not cover the interlocking
cable covers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in
different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in
this country.
This has been met by deriving
assistance from B.S. 2484  :  1961
‘  Specification
for cable covers ( concrete
and earthen
) ‘, published
by the
British Standards
Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS : 2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
.in the rounded
off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

from a height
of  460  mm
measured
vertically
between
the
centre
of the top surface
of the cable
cover being
tested
and
the striking
end of the tup,
the point
of impact
being the centre of the cable
cover for both
blows.
When
tested in this
manner
there shall result
not more
than
one transverse
crack,
that
is a
crack across the full width of the cable cover.

group
of samples
being
tested shall be divided

In the event
of one sample in the

The samples of unreinforced
concrete
cable
covers taken
as described
in 7.2 shall be tested in the manner
described
in
Appendix
B using
an equipment
shown
in Fig. 6.
The averge breaking
load of six covers shall first be taken.
Should the average
breaking
load
of these six covers be equal to  or  greater
than the values given in Table
I,
the consignment
shall be deemed
to conform
to this standard.
Should
the
average
breaking
load of the six covers be less than
the limit
specified
in
Table

on further nine covers which were set
aside.
Should
the average
of the tests on the fifteen covers be equal to or

before testing and shall be
tested wet.
Each cover to be tested shall be evenly supported upon two
self-aligning
steel bearers 50 mm in diameter,
the distance between the
centres of the bearers being 270 mm ( scc Fig. 6 ).
The load shall then be
applied centrally at a uniform rate of 9 OOON/minute f 10 percent through
a third steel bearer also 50 mm in diameter placed midway between the)
supports upon the upper surface of the cover and parallel to the supports.
The length of all the bearers shall be more than the width of the cover to
be tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
