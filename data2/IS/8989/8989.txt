FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 16 November
1978, after the draft finalized
by the Safety in Construc-
tion Sectional
Committee
had heen approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Erection of concrete framed structures is an important
operation in the
construction
industry.
The work involved
is of specialized
and hazardous
nature,
which sometimes
leads to accidents.
It is necessary,
therefore,
that certain rules are laid down for various
phases of work involved
and
that these are meticulously
followed by each member of the crew working
on the job, not only for  his own safety but also for the safety of his fellow
workers
and
onlookers.
This
standard
has, therefore,
been formulated
to
lay
down
safety
requirements
during
erection
of
concrete
framed
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O-3 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
coordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value,
observed
or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS : 2-1960..
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 All
timber
formwork
shall
be
carefully
inspected
before
use
and
members
having
cracks and excessive knots shall be discarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 As timber
centering
usually
takes an initial
set when
vertical
load is
applied,
the design
of this centering
shall make allowance
for this factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 The vertical
supports
shall be adequately
braced
or otherwise
secured
in position
so that
these do not fall when
the load gets released
or the

plumb.
The
centering
frames
shall be tied together
with sufficient
braces
to make a rigid and solid unit.
It shall be ensured
that struts and diagonal
braces are in proper
position
and are secured
so that
frames
develop
full
load carrying
capacity.
As erection
progresses,
all connecting
devices shall

about the loads it can stand, centering shall be designed by a competent
engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.10 Centering layout shall be made by a qualified engineer and shall be
strictly followed.
The bearing capacity of the soil shall be kept in view
for every centering job.
The effect of weather conditions shall also be
taken into consideration
as dry clay may become very plastic after a
rainfall and show marked decrease in its bearing capacity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.11 Sills under the supports shall be set on firm soil or other suitable
material in a p.attern which assures adequate stability for all props.
Care
shall be taken not to disturb the soil under the supports.
Adequate
drainage shall be provided
to drain away water coming due to rains,
washing of forms or during the curing of the concrete to avoid softening of
the supporting soil strata.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.12 All centering shall be finally inspected to ensure that:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) footings or sills under every post of the centering are sound.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) all lower adjustment screws or wedges are snug against the legs of
the panels.
c) all upper adjustment screws or heads of jacks are in full contact
with the formwork.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) panels are plumb in both directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) all cross braces are in place and locking devices are in closed and
secure position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>f) in case of  CHHAJAS
and  balconies, the props shall be adequate
to transfer the load to the supporting point.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.13 During
pouring
of the concrete, the centering shall be constantly
inspected and strengthened, if required, wedges below the vertical supports
tightened and adjustment screws properly adjusted as necessary. Adequate
yzp
af centering shall be ensured from moving vehicles or swinging
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.14 Forms shall not be removed earlier than as laid down in the specifica-
tions and until it is certain that the concrete has developed
sufficient
strength to support itself and all loads that will be imposed on it.
Only
workmen actually engaged in removing the formwork shall be allowed in
the area during these operations.
Those engaged in removing the form-
work shall wear helmets,
gloves and  heavy soled shoes and approved safety
belts if adequate footing is not provided
