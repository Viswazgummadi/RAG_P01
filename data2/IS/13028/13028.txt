<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the River Valley Planning, Project Reports and Progress and Completion Reports Sectional Com-
mittee had been approved by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A basin development is a co-ordinated
programme to develop the use of water and land resources
of a river basin to obtain a greater efficiency of use than would be possible,
if were developed
by
unto-ordinated
multi purpose projects or a series of unto-ordinated
single purpose project.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to international
co-ordination
among the standards and the practices prevailing in different countries in additions to relating it to
the practices in the field of this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The guide for overall planning of the basin has been divided into two sections:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Section 1 Basin characteristics and inventory of resources, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Section 2 Overall planning of the basin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied
with the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off
in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding ofi numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Economic Base<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This shall include information
on the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Economic base projection
for the future
should
extend at least over the useful life of the projects
that are considered, that is, for a period of 50-100
years.
It is obvious
that any extrapolation
of
population
based on past trends, over such a long
future
period
of say 100 years, is of a highly
speculative
character
and would lead to com-
pletely erroneous results.
It should be kept in
mind that the population
growth
is related
to
economic
activity,
which in turn
is related to
resource development.
Due allowance
shall be
made for the likely increase
in the standard
of
living of the backward and poverty stricken
area,
which are under-developed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Changes in the water regime of the river;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Pollution of river water from industry and
watershed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Major intake to check pollution;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Waterlogged
and
saline
affected
areas.
Steps taken such as surface drains,
pro-
viding pumps and tubewells as anti-water-
logging measures be indicated; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Salt water intrusion in the coastal
ground
water resources.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11 Soil Conservation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It may be possible to develop
an ultimate
water
plan by a different approach.
Instead of estima-
ting the size of the future
population
with their
economic base, and then preparing
a resource
development plan to suit their needs, apprise first
all available
resources
in the region and then
estimate how many people
and what economic
activity could be supported by these resources.
If<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A brief description
of the topography
slopes,
rainfall intensity and erosion of soil of the basin
shall be given.
It may be reported, if any of the
following steps are being taken for conservation
of the storage capacities of reservoirs:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Afforestation,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 13028  :  1991<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Water required
for dilution
of municipal
industrial effluent so that adequate sanitary
river conditions are maintained, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>such an approach is successful, it shall be taking
into consideration
not only the available
water
resources, but also the resources
of the region,
including space for living and recreation.
After
having developed a tentative
plan to make the
most effective an& continued
use of
available
resources,
then
roughly
determine
how
many
people
could live
in the area
without
com-
peting with one another for the use of the same
resources.
The last step would be to prepare
a
water development
plan that would meet
the
demands of such a regional development.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Identification
of additional sources of water
supply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It  should be noted that the total domestic
and
industrial
water requirements
are usually small
compared to the available
water supplies in the
drainage
basin. Moreover,
only 5 to 10 percent
of the total intake
is consumptively
used, the
remaining returning to the river system. Although,
the total requirements are relatively small, it shall
be emphasized that they are of the highest priority
and good quality of water is needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2  Agriculture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This shall include information
on the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Associated with the domestic and industrial water
requirements are the waste disposal requirements.
The stream flow requirements to dilute municipal
and industrial effluent so that adequate
sanitary
conditions are maintained.
This requirement
may
be 10 or even 100 times larger than the pure
water intake. The exact amount
depends largely
upon the degree of treatment
that industries
and
municipalities will apply to their wastes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
