<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( Part4 ) ( Second
Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards on 9 November 1987, after the draft
finalized by the Structural Safety Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>committee in consultation with the Indian Meteo-
rological Department.
In addition to this, new
clauses on wind loads for butterfly type structures
were included; wind pressure coefficients for
sheeted roofs, both curved and sloping, were
modified; seismic load provisions were deleted
( separate code having been prepared ) and metric
system of weights and measurements was adopted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A building has to perform many functions
satisfactorily. Amongst these functions are the
utility of the building for the intended use and
occupancy. structural safety, fire safety; and
compliance with hygienic, sanitation, ventilation
and daylight standards.
The design of the build-
ing is dependent upon the minimum requirements
prescribed for each of the above functions.
The
minimum requirements pertaining to the structural
safety of buildings are being covered in this Code
by way of laying down minimum design loads which
have to be assumed for dead loads, imposed loads,
wind loads, snow loads and other external loads,
the structure would be required to bear. Strict
conformity to loading standards recommended in
this Code, it is hoped, will not only ensure the
structural safety of the buildings which are being
designed and constructed in the country and
thereby reduce the hazards to life and property
caused by unsafe structures, but also eliminate the
wastage caused by assuming unnecessarily heavy
loadings. Notwithstanding what is stated regarding
the structural safety of buildings, the application of
the provisions should be carried out by compe-
tent and responsible structural designer who would
satisfy himself that the structure designed in
accordance with this code meets the desired
performance requirements when the same is
carried out according to specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 With the increased adoption of the Code,
a number of comments were received on the pro-
visions on live load values adopted for different
occupancies.
Simultaneously live loads surveys
have been carried out in America, Canada and
other countries to arrive at realistic live loads
based on actual determination of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>loading(  mov-
able and immovable ) in different occupancies.
Keeping this in view and other developments in
the field of wind engineering, the Sectional Com-
mittee responsible for the preparation of this
standard has decided to prepare the second
revision in the following five parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1 Dead Loads<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

which should be considered along with the above
loads.
0.3.2 This part ( Part 4 ) deals with snow loads
on roofs of buildings.
The committee responsible for the prepara-
tion of the code while reviewing the available
snow-fall data, felt the paucity of data on which
to make specific recommendations on the depth
of ground snow load for different regions effected
by snow-fall, In due course the characteristic<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This Code was first published in 1957 for the
guidance of civil engineers, designers and archi-
tects associated with the planning and design of
buildings.
It included the provisions for the
basic design loads ( dead loads, live loads, wind
loads and seismic loads ) to be assumed in the
design of buildings.
In its first revision in 1964,
the wind pressure provisions were modified on
the basis of studies of wind phenomenon and its
effects on structures undertaken by the special<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In most regions, snow falls are accompanied
or followed by winds. The winds will redistribute
the snow and on some roofs, especially multi-
level roofs, the accumulated drift load may reach
a multiple of the ground load.
Roofs which are
sheltered by other buildings, vegetation, etc, may
collect more snow load than the ground level.
The phenomenon is of the same nature as that
illustrated for multilevel roofs in 4.2.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
