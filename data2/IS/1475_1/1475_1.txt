<<PARAGRAPH>>Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Sectional Committee, ME 3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 1) (Third Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Sectional Committee had been approved by the Mechanical
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first issued in 1959 and was revised in 1971 to allow for the use of more readily available
materials as alternative to stainless steel for the constructions of storage tanks of storage type water coolers.
The main modifications made in the second revision were as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It did not specify any particular material for the storage tank but instead stipulated that the materials
used would be corrosion resistant, non-toxic non-absorbent and durable.
The requirement relating to the performance factor was deleted in view of lack of authentic data available
in this regard and the difficulties experienced by the manufacturers to meet this requirement.
The classification of the various types of water coolers had been aligned with the practices prevailing in
other countries.
It specified only 35°C ambient temperature for capacity rating test condition and also included maximum
operating condition of 43°C ambient and the related requirements so as to provide guidance to the consumers
about the performance of these units at adverse ambient conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water coolers with a voltage and a frequency other than specified in this standard may also be manufactured for
the purposes of export.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since the publication of second revision, 7 amendments were issued. The rate of energy consumption for
different cooling capacity rating were specified through amendment in 1989. These were reduced in 1991. In the
third revision all these amendments have been reviewed and incorporated in the standard. In this revision, the
energy consumption has been further reduced by approximately 3 to 11 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In view of the prevailing energy scenario in the country, the Govt of India is laying emphasis on the energy
conservation through various means by emphasizing the use of ene~y efficiency products. Accordingly, Govt
of India is considering introduction of scheme of energy labelling. The drinking water cooler is one such item
which consumes considerable amount of energy and hence is considered as a product which may be covered
under energy Iabelling scheme.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With a view to segregate performance and energy labelling requirements, this standard has been split into two
parts. The other part of this standard shall deal with the energy labelling requirements. The maximum energy
consumption values specified in this standard for various capacity ranges are based on the data generated over
the years. Regular R & D efforts should be employed to improve the energy consumption with the developments
in technology.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under the Montreal Protocol and subsequent London Amendment, India has agreed to phase out the use of
ozone depleting substances according to a schedule. The above protocol grants a 10 year grace period on all
phase out dates and interim reduction deadlines for developing countries whose per capita consumption of
Annex
A chemicals (as identified in Annexures to Montreal Protocol) is less than 0.3 kg/year. Annex
A
chemicals include CFC 11, 12, 113, 114,115 and Halon 1211and HaIon 1301.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS 2:1960
‘Rules
for rounding off numerical values ( revised )’. The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tests shall be 500 V rrns. The test voltage shall be
alternating of approximately sine-wave form, and of
any convenient frequency between 25 and 100 Hz.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.73.6
At an interval of 15 minutes record readings of
the measurements stated in 7.7.3. In the case of bottle
water coolers, measurements of inlet water temperature
may be taken only at the beginning of the test and
when abottle is replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7.3.7
