<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement
of Works of River Valley Projects
Sectional
Committee,
RVD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Part 13 ) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized by the Measurement
of Works of River Valley Projects
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the measurement
of works of river projects
a large diversity
of methods
exist at present
according
to local practices.
This lack of uniformity
creates complications
regarding
measure-
ments and payments.
Keeping
in view the large amount
of financial
outlay involved
in river
valley projects
and also the fact that the authorities
responsible
for completing
these projects,
are of the state level or national
level, it is felt that a suitable methodology
is needed for adopt-
ing uniform practices
towards the measurement
of works so that the scope of complications
and
misinterpretation
of items of work is reduced, as far as possible.
This standard is being formu-
lated in various parts so as to cover
each type of work separately.
This part is intended
to
provide a uniform basis for measuring the work done in respect
of earth and fill dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied with
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The
number of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
