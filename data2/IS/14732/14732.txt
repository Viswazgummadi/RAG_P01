Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Often
the likely
motion
of a planned
structure
has to be
calculated
in order to assess the probable
response,
to the
vibration,
of those who will use the structure.
The probable
motion
of a proposed
structure
can generally
be found
by
structural
dynamics
using the structure
stiffness and mass, the
wind or wind and wave spectra,
the structure
shape, aspect
and roughness,
and the appropriate
topographical
parameters.
Wind tunnel
and wave tank studies
using aerodynamic
and
fluid dynamic
models can also be used to determine
the likely
motion of structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Until this century,
buildings
were seldom
more than a few
storeys
high and the few tall buildings
which
did exist were
usually of a heavy gravity design which did not readily respond
to wind or other forces. Also, tall buildings
constructed
in the
late nineteenth
century and early this century generally had ver-
tical load-bearing
frames with massive granite infills which pro-
vided another generation
of unresponsive
buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This history of unresponsive
building structures
has led people
to expect
buildings
to provide
nearly stationary
accommoda-
tion,
even
under
storm
conditions,
and the occupants
of
buildings
are prepared to accept only extremely
low levels of
motion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some forms of tall building
construction,
poor construction
joints allow inter-storey
drift in the structure
and, when assess-
ing the probable
response
of such structures,
an allowance
should be made for the effects of inter-storey
movements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guidance on satisfactory
magnitudes
of vibration
for specific
situations
is given in the annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In contrast
to these unresponsive
structures,
more modern
buildings
have tended, for reasons of economy
of space, foun-
dation
requirements,
material
outlay,
speed of erection
and
elegance,
to be formed from more slender sections such that
these much lighter buildings
are more responsive
to dynamic
forces
than
their predecessors.
This International
Standard
proposes magnitudes
of low-frequency
horizontal
motion that
should produce only minimum
adverse comment
from people
working
or living in buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope
and field
of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1
This International
Standard
relates to typical
responses
of
people
to
the
horizontal
motion
of
structures
in the
frequency
range
0,063 to 1 Hz. The recommendations
are
categorized
in accordance
with the use of the structuresand,
in
the case of off-shore
fixed structures,
with the nature of work
being carried out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similarly,
off-shore
fixed
structures
were,
until
recently,
generallv of a non-habitable
form or of an unresponsive
design.
Modern
mineral
exploitation
and
production
structures
founded
on the seabed are of such large proportions
and sub-
ject to such extreme
wind and wave action that the dynamic
response of both the overall structures
and their component
parts has become the focus of much attention
from the view-
point of the motion transmitted
to those operating
and living on
the structures.
Also, although
outside the scope of this Inter-
national Standard,
the structural
integrity,
material fatigue and
operation
of off-shore
fixed
structures
in storm
conditions
receive much attention.
This International
Standard
therefore
proposes
magnitudes
of
low-frequency
horizontal
motion
which
should
prove
satisfactory
to
those
living
on
and
operating
off-shore
fixed structures.
Allowances
are made for
the fact that wind-and waves shall be expected to cause motion
of~these structures
which, in addition,
are generally manned by
trained personnel
who are prepared to accept some degree of
motion
so long as it does not present a health hazard or in-
terfere with the efficient
operation
of the installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Injury of occupants
due to structural
vibration
is outside
the
scope of this International
Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2
Whole-body
motion
caused
by
structural
vibrations
induced
by infrequent
external
environmental
forces
is con-
sidered
separately
from
whole-body
motion
resulting
from
structural
vibrations
caused
by
frequently
occurring
force
actions.
Frequently
occurring
force actions may arise from ex-
ternal
sources,
machinery
or
structure
services
such
as
elevators,
fans, air conditioners,
heating
units and plumbing.
Both
perceptible
magnitudes
of
low-frequency
horizontal
motion
of structures
and magnitudes
likely to raise minimum
adverse comment
are included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1
Visual perception of building motion, the influence of torsional
oscillations of structures and the effects of noise may influence the
subjective response to vibrations of structures but no quantitative
assessment is made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>return period should be used. Present shortage of data pre-
vents the definite stipulation of acceleration/frequency
curves
for storms with a return period of less than 5 years. Guidance
on the expected level of adverse comment for such storms is
currently limited to that given in note 3 in 3.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2
Blasting, earthquakes
and similar events are excluded from the
scope of this International Standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3
An off-shore fixed structure is one founded on the sea bed, such as
a gravity platform or a steel jacket with a piled foundation.
Floating
structures, tension leg and articulated platforms are excluded from the
scope of this International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4
For off-shore
fixed structures
where
non-routine
or
skilled manual operations are carried out, the criteria for infre-
quently
induced low-frequency
horizontal
motion of such
structures are related to the performance of those engaged in
the operations (see clause A-2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4
In buildings, the response of people is for a normal adult population
and, although it is known that levels of vibration considered acceptable
vary with age groups and sex, no definite correction factors can be put
forward at present to adjust the acceleration magnitudes for these
influences. On off-shore fixed structures,
the recommendations only
apply to trained personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5
The criteria for regularly occurring horizontal building
motions are related to the perception thresholds of horizontal
motion for average and for sensitive humans, that is to the
average and lower thresholds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
This International Standard applies to horizontal motion of struc-
tures as perceived by human beings in any posture, sitting, standing or
reclining.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6
The criteria for regularly occurring horizontal motion of
structures
at frequencies
greater
than
1 Hz are given in
IS0 2631 and associated documents.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1
The buildings are assumed to be properly clad and acoustically
insulated so that significant sounds caused by the wind and by building
motions are minimized to the occupants. If this were not the case, the
satisfactory magnitudes may be reduced since the effect of noise on
the occupants is to influence the subjective response to the motion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2
People long accustomed
to living in some forms of low rise
buildings, such as two-storey
flexible wooden
frame houses, are
sometimes prepared to accept magnitudes of motion due to regularly
recurring events, such as wind action or the passage of heavy vehicles,
which cause alarm in occasional visitors. Conversely, occupants of
high-rise buildings do not readily adapt to motions which cause them
alarm on the first occurrence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Response
criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1
This international
Standard
considers
three categories

response
to the vibration
of structures
:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) basic  threshold
effects
(see  3.5  and clause  A.3);<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3
For a storm with a one-year
return period which causes the
magnitudes of motion recommended
as satisfactory for a five-year
return period, the adverse comment level from people occupying the
parts of the building where motion is greatest is estimated to be 12 %.
It is tentatively suggested that to obtain a probable adverse comment
level of 2 % for storms with a one-year return period, the suggested
satisfactory acceleration magnitudes would be 0,72 times those for a
five-year return period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

interference
with activities (see 3.4,3.5
and clause A.21.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2
The criterion for infrequently
induced
low-frequency
horizontal building vibrations caused by storms is the alarm ex-
perienced
by the occupants
of the structure
[category bl
above]. The level of adverse comment due to such alarm is
dependent
upon the return period, the shorter the interval
between occurrences the higher the level of adverse comment,
and on the time over which motion of a particular intensity is
sustained for each occurrence.
The perception of motion is
assumed to be sensed through proprioceptive
cues or the
vestibular organs rather than through visual cues. The presence
of even very small torsional vibrations may greatly influence
subjects in their assessment of the acceptability of the vibration
of a structure (see A. 1.3 and note 2 in A.3.21.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4
In general, it may be assumed that the motions of duration less than
10 min associated with wind storms are not sufficiently severe to
impress significantly the memory of individuals. Where the exposure
period is shorter than 10 min. vibration amplitudes which are vividly
remembered are generally a product of seismic activity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5
During the peaks of wind storms, accelerations much in excess of
the suggested satisfactory magnitudes will occur for short periods but
these higher levels, briefly experienced,
are not considered to make
any great contribution to the memory of the storm except where
momentary vibrations are in the extreme category mentioned in note 4.
Short periods of higher acceleration which occur during the worst
10 consecutive minutes of the storm occurrence are accounted for in
the r.m.s. value of the vibration of the structure for the storm peak (see
note 1 in 4.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
In buildings used for general purposes, the criterion is
that probably not more than 2 % of those occupying the parts
of the building where the motion is greatest comment adversely
about the motion caused by the peak 10 min of the worst wind
storm with a return period of 5 years or more. In regions where
wind storm recurrence patterns are not well defined, a longer<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

evaluated with reference to the centre frequency of that band in
the same manner as in  4.2.<<HEADING_END>>

of entry to the human
subject.
Under some conditions,
measurements may have to be made on some surface other
than at the point of entry of the vibration to the human sub-
jects. In such cases, transfer functions need to be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Evaluating the acceleration record of a structure as above, the
extreme magnitudes of motion referred to in note 5 in 3.6 are taken
into account.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
If it is found that vibration occurs simultaneously
at
separate discrete frequencies within the range 0,063 to 1 Hz,
then the r.m.s.
accelerations
at these discrete frequencies
should be found by analysing a continuous record of the struc-
tural motion
during the peak ~of the storm.
The highest
magnitude of horizontal acceleration fr.m.s.1 at each discrete
frequency found for 10 consecutive minutes of the storm peak<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2
For tall buildings, the highest magnitudes of acceleration generally
occur near the tcp of the buildings at the first natural frequency of the
structure, but the possibility should not be overlooked that unaccept-
able accelerations may occur  elsewhere in such buildings in vibration
modes with higher frequencies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>can  then be used to assess the probable response of occupants
to the horizontal structural motion at each discrete frequency
considered. Vibration outside the rangeO,OSS to 1 Hz should be
filtered at not less than 24 d6 per octave.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3
In some cases, infrasound generated by the flow of air in ducts can
induce the sensation of structural motion in the occupants of the struc-
ture. Care should be taken when assessing adverse comments of
occupants that a combination of motion and infrasound effects, acting
simultaneously, have not combined to exaggerate the sensation of
motion (see also A.1.3).
4.3
When vibration occurs at a single discrete frequency,
then the acceleration record at that frequency should be ana-
lysed as in 4.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4
Data measurement
can be made by recording the output from
calibrated systems of accelerometers
and matched amplifiers using
frequency-modulated
tape recorders.
Subsequent
reduction of the
recorded data can be carried out using filters as described in 4.2 and
Fast Fourier Transform
analysis equipment.
To analyse even the
minimum time record of 10 min, continuous averaging of record
segments will probably be necessary and for 95 % confidence of being
within 10 % accuracy at 0.09 Hz, for example, the averaging time for
one-third
octave frequency
analysis should be more than 200 s.
Therefore, record segments in excess of 200 s should be used in the
analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4
When
horizontal
motion
of
a
structure
occurs
simultaneously
in more than one direction,
then the com-
ponents of acceleration,
in orthogonal
directions,
may be
analysed as in 4.2 and the components
added vectorially,
taking account of phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A.3.1
The available data indicate that the lower threshold of
perception of horizontal motion by humans is represented by
curve 1 in figure 2. These magnitudes are appropriate for areas
where an environment is required to be apparently stationary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.l.l
Satisfactory
magnitudes of low-frequency
horizontal
motion during the worst 10 consecutive minutes of a wind
storm with a return period of at least 5 years, for buildings used
for general purposes, are given by curve 1 in figure 1 for the
probable adverse comment levels of clause 3. These values are
for vibration in the horizontal plane of buildings or structures
and
therefore
for any
whole-body
axis depending
upon
whether the human is standing, sitting or reclining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.3.2
The average threshold of perception represents the
mean threshold of perception of horizontal motion for a normal
adult population.
The magnitudes
suggested by curve 2 in
figure 2 are appropriate
for special buildings where routine
precision work is carried out. These magnitudes are four times
those given for the activities covered by curve 1 in figure 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>~NOTES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1  Frequent occurrences refer to events of an everyday nature.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.1.2
The satisfactory magnitudes of r.m.s. acceleration are
for discrete frequencies.
If random narrow-band
vibrations,
vibrations at several discrete frequencies or multi-axis vibra-
tions occur, then assessment should be made in accordance
with 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 or 4.5, whichever is appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2
The perception of motion is assumed to be sensed through pro-
prioceptive cues or vestibular organs rather than through visual cues,
Even very small rotational oscillations about
a vertical axis can
significantly exaggerate the actual magnitude of acceleration acting on
the subject.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.1. .3
If a building is subject to even extremely small oscilla-
tions of rotation about a vertical axis, visual effects would exag-
gerate the sensation of motion and the satisfactory magnitudes
of acceleration would be less than those of curve 1 in figure 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4
Events with duration
less than 10 min<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.4.1
A definite procedure for assessing events of short
duration can be compiled at a later date as more data become
available.
It may be appropriate
to commence
analysis of
acceleration records of short duration events when the r.m.s.
acceleration rises above that given by curve 2 in figure 2 for the
frequency under consideration and to terminate analysis when
the r.m.s. acceleration falls below this magnitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to be performed. This would be the case where a non-routine
