<<PARAGRAPH>>Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee, CED 53<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Cement Matrix Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was published in 1959 and subsequently revised in 1978 to introduce prestressed concrete cylinder
pipes, requirements of fittings, provision of more details on design criteria for the pipes, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard lays down the requirements of prestressed concrete pipes primarily used for the conveyance of
water and sewerage and specials for use with them. Two types of prestressed concrete pipes are covered by this
specification, namely, prestressed concrete cylinder pipes and prestressed concrete non-cylinder pipes,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This second revision incorporates number of modifications, the most significant of them being:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) modifications in design and other aspects,
b) inclusion of typical worked out examples of design,
c) inclusion of detailed inspection procedure, and
d) increase in range of diameters of pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the formulation of this standard, assistance has been derived for EN 642:1994
Prestressed Concrete Pressure
Pipes, Cylinder and Non-Cylinder, European Committee for Standardization (CEN).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the technical committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given at Annex K.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised)’.  The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers the requirements of prestressed
concrete
pipes (including
specials)
with nominal
internal diameter in the range of 200 mm to 2500
mm (see Note under Table 1), in which permanent
internal
stresses
are deliberately
introduced
by
tensioned steel to the desired degree to counteract the
stresses caused in pipe under service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
