<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Gtandard
A
First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 8
ctober 1,974, after the draft finalized by the
Stones Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Building stones are avaIlable in large quantity in various parts of the
country.
To choose and utilize them for their satisfactory performance it is
necessary to know the various strength. properties determined according
to standard procedure.
This
standard has, therefore,
been formulated to
cover the standard method for determining the weathering of various stones.
This standard was first published in 1957 and has been revised based on its
actual use in the past 17 years and the experience gained in testing of building
stones for this property in the various research laboratories of this country.
This test method is prescribed to fmd out the resistance of stone towards
corrosive ground water, wetting and drying, sulphate attack and temperature
variations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In qorting
the results  01. a  test or analysis made in accordance with this
standard, if the final value, observed or calculated,
is to be rounded off, it
&all be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard lays down the procedure for testing weathering of natural
building aumca used for constructional purposes.<<HEADING_END>>

The different kinds of stone and their condition
at various
quarry
sites shall

Separate samples for each class of stone that would be considered
for use in construction
as indicated
by visual
inspection
shall be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 When
perceptible
variations
occur
in the quality
of rock,
as many
samples
as are necessary
for determining
the range
in properties
shall be
selected,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. TEST
PIECES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The test pieces shall be either cyliiers.
50 mm in diameter
and 50 mm
in height, or 50 mm cubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The testpieces
shall be finished
smooth and the edges shall be rounded
to a radius of approximately
3 mm by grinding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 At least three test pieces shall bc used for conducting
the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4 The
test pieces shah
be dried
in a well ventilated
oven
for 24 h at
105 f 5%  and cooled in a desiccator to ruom temperature ( 20 to 30°C  ) .<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The dried and cooled test pieces ( see 3.4 ) shall be weighed to the
nearest 0’0 1 g and the weight of each recorded ( W,  ) ,  The specimens shall
then be submerged in water at  20 to 30°C  for  24  hours. Each specimen shall
be weighed ( MI,  )  whilst totally immersed and freely’ suspended in water
(when weighing test pieces in water, they shall be weighed suspended in such
a position that air is not entrapped in the cavities ).  It  shall then be removed,
the surface water wiped off with a damp cloth and weighed again (  Wa).
The werghing of each specimen shall be completed within three minutes of
its removal from water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Each specimen shall be placed in a flat dish, made of glass, porcelain or
glazed stonework, 9 cm in diameter and 1’5 cm in depth to which shaJl be
added 2 g of powdered gypsum and 25 ml of water.
The dishes together
with specimens shall then be placed in a well ventilated oven and maintained
at a temperature
of 105 f 2°C for at least 5 hours or until the water has
evaporated and the powder becomes dry.
The dishes shall be removed from
the oven and cooled to  25 f
5°C.  This completes the first cycle.
The cycle
shall then be repeated 29 times in the same manner, except that only 25 ml
of water shall be added for each of the subsequent cycles.’<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 At the end of the 30 cycles, the specimens shall be cleaned by brushing
with a stiff-fibre brush to remove any particles of gypsum clinging to the
surface.
Each specimen shall be immersed in water for 24 hours, surface
dried, and weighed first in air (  W, )  and then in water (  W, )  as described
in  5.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  EVALUATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The increase/change in absorption and the increase in volume of each
