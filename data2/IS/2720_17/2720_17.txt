FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( First Revision)
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards Institution
on 30 January 1986, after the draft finalized by the
Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establishing uniform procedures for the determination
of different characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating the comperative
study of the results, Indian Standards Institution
is bringing out Indian
Standard
method of test for soils ( IS: 2720 ) being published in various
parts.
This part ( Part 17  )  deals with the method for the laboratory
determination
of the coefficient of permeability of soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The knowledge of the permeability is essential in the solution of many
engineering problems involving flow of water through soils such as:
a>
Dewatering and drainage of excavations, back fills and subgrades;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Determining yield of water bearing strata;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C>  Assessing seepage through the body of earth dams; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4  Computing losses from canals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition since the soil may be used to inhibit flow of water, the
permeability of soil governs the type of soil to be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This Standard ( Part 17) covers both constant head and falling head
tests as used for most of the soil.
The laboratory
determination
of
permeability
of granular
soil by constant
head method
is covered in
separate part ( Part 36 ).
This part was first published in 1966. Based on
the experience gained in the use of this test in the past 20 years by various
laboratories,
this standard has been revised.
The principal modifications
made are deletion of details of the equipment for testing for which separate<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS:2720 ( Part 17 ) - 1986<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indian Standard has been formulated ( see IS  :  11209-1985* ), giving detailed
procedures
for the record of the observations
as well as calculations for
two types of the test and revising the proforma for the record of tests by
enlarging to cover more details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with IS  :  2-1960t.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard ( Part 17 ) covers the methods for laboratory
determina-
tion of coefficient
of permeability
of soils using falling head and the
constant head methods.
This test is recommended for soils with coefficient

<<HEADING level=3>>4. PREPARATION
OF TEST  SPECIMEN<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Disturbed Soil Sample<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1  A 2*5-kg sample shall be taken from a thoroughly mixed air-dried
or oven-dried
material
which has been obtained
in accordance
with
IS  :  2720 ( Part 1 )-1983”.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2 The moisture content of the 2*5-kg sample shall be determined as
described in IS: 2720 ( Part 2 )-19737.
The sample shall be placed in an
airtight container.
The quantity of water to be added to the stored sample
to give the desired moisture content shall be computed and spread evenly
over the sample, and after thoroughly
mixing, the material shall again be
placed in the storage container.
The moisture content of the sample shall
again be determined
and the entire process repeated
until the actual
moisture content is within 0.5 percent of that desired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.3 The permeameter
mould shall be weighed empty to the nearest
gram.
After greasing lightly the inside of the mould it shall be clamped
between the compaction base plate and the extension collar.
The assembly
shall be kept on a solid base.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.4 The dry density for remoulding of soil samples shall be either the
field density or the value of the maximum dry density estimated by the
compaction
tests [see IS: 2720 (Part 7)-1980: and IS :2720 (Part 8)-19833 ]
or any other density at which the permeability
is desired.
The moisture
content used for compaction
should be the optimum moisture content or
the field moisture as the case may be. The compactive effort may be varied
to simulate field conditions.
Static compaction
may also be used where
necessary.
After completion
of compaction
the collar, if attached, shall
be removed and excess soil trimmed level with the top of the mould.
The
base shall be detached and the mould full of the compacted specimen shall
be weighed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.5  The mould with the specimen inside shall be assembled to the
drainage base and cap having porous
discs.
The porous discs shall be
saturated before assembling the mould.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Undisturbed Soil Sample -  For testing undisturbed
soils, undisturbed
specimen shall be trimmed in the form of a cylinder not larger than about
85 mm in diameter and having a height equal to that of the mould.
The
specimen shall be placed centrally
over the porous disc of the drainage
base fixed to the mould. The annular space between the mould and the
specimen shall be filled with an impervious material such as cement slurry
or a mixture of 10 percent dry powdered bentonite
and 90 percent fine
sand by weight to provide sealing between the soil specimen and the mould
against leakage from the sides.
When using the cement slurry the mould
shall be kept on a flat surface other than the porous discs.
The mixture
shall be compacted
using a small tamping rod.
The drainage cap shall
then be fixed over the top of the mould.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3  Saturation-In
the case of soils of medium to high permeability the
specimen shall be subjected to sufficient head, flow or immersion so as to
obtain full saturation.
Soils of low permeability require flow under a high
head for periods ranging from a day to a week depending
upon the
permeability
and the head.
Alternatively,
in the case of soils of low
permeability
the specimen shall be subjected to a gradually
increasing
vacuum with bottom outlet closed so as to remove to form the soil voids.
The vacuum shall be increased to at least 70 cm of mercury which shall be
maintained
for 15 minutes or more depending upon the soil type.
The
evacuation
shall be followed by a very slow saturation
of the specimen
with de-aired water from the bottom upwards under full vacuum.
When
the specimen is saturated both the top and bottom outlets shall be closed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. CONSTANT
HEAD TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 For a constant head test arrangement, the specimen shall be connected
through the top inlet to the constant head water reservoir.
The bottom
outlet shall be opened and when the steady state of flow has been estab-
lished, the quantity of flow for a convenient time interval shall be collected
and weighed or measured.
Alternatively,
the inlet may be at the bottom
and water may be collected from the outlet at the top.
The collection of
the quantity of flow for the same time interval shall be repeated thrice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The linearity ( of Darcy’s law ) between the hydraulic gradient and the
average velocity of flow for the soil under test should be established by
performing the test over a range of hydraulic gradients.
The hydraulic
gradients in the permeability
test should preferably include the hydraulic
gradient
likely to occur in the field and any deviation
from linearity
observed should be noted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
