by the Bureau of

<<PARAGRAPH>>The text of
IS0 standard
has been
approved
as suitable
for
publication
as Indian
Standard
without
deviations.
Certain conventions
are,
however,
not
identical
to those used in Indian
Standard.
Attention
is particularly
drawn to the
Following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Wherever
the words
‘International
Standard’
appear referring
to this
standard,
they
should
be read as ‘Indian
Standard’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Comma ( , ) has been used as a decimal
marker
while
in
Indian
Standard,
the current
practice
is to use point
( . ) as the decimal
marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ln the adopted
standard,
reference
appears to certain
International
Standard
for which
Indian
Standard
also
exist.
The
corresponding
Indian
Standard
which
is to be substituted
in
its place, ,is listed

Barrier specification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This international
Standard
specifies a uniform

should ensure that results obtained
from different
test
facilities are directly comparable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The barrier shall consist of a block of reinforced
concrete at least 3 m wide, at least 1,5 m high and at least
600 mm thick.<<HEADING_END>>
