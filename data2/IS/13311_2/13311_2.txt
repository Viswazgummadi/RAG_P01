<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Rureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized by the
Cement
and Coacrete
Sectional
Committee
bad b’een approved
bg&+fivil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are occasions
when the
various
perfortiance
characteristics
of concrete
in a structure
are
required to be assessed.
In most of the cases, an estimate
of strength of concrete
in the structure
is
needed, although parameters
like overall
quality, uniformity,
etc, also become important
in others.
The various methods that can be adopted
for  in-situ  assessnhent
of strength
properties
of concrete
depend upon the particular
aspect of strength
in question.
For example, if the load-carrying
capacity
of structural
ensemble is to be assessed, carrying out a full-scale load test 8s per IS 456  :  1978 ‘Code of
practice
for plain and reinforced
concrete
(  third revision )’  or IS 1343’: 1980 ‘Code
of practice
for
prestressed
concrete
(first  revision )’ is the most direct way; on the other hand when the actual
com-
pressive strength of a concrete
in the structure
is to be measured,
core testing
as per IS 516 : 1959
&Method of test for strength of concrete’
is more reliable.
However,
both these methods are relatively
cumbersome
and the
latter
method
may leave the structure
damaged
locally in some cases, Use is,
therefore,
made of suitable non-destructive
tests, which not only provide
an estimate
of the relative
strength and overall quality of concrete
in the structures,
but also help in deciding
whether
more
rigorous tests like load
testing or core drilling at selected locations
are required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There a’re various such non-destructive
testing
methods which can be broadly classified as those which
measure the overall
quality of concrete,
for
example
dynamic
or vibration
methods like resonance
frequency
and ultrasonic
pulse velocity tests; and those which involve measurement
of parameters
like
surface hardness, rebound, penetration,
pull-out strength,
etc, and are believed to be indirectly
related
to the compressive
strength
of concrete.
In addition,
radiographic,
radiometric,
nuclear,
magnetic
and electrical
methods are also available.
Since such non-destructive
tests are at best indirect methods
of monitoring
the particular
characteristic
of concrete
and the measurements
are influenced
by
materials,
mix and environmental
factors, proper
interpretation
of the results
calls for ce1 tain degree
of expertise.
It is more so, when the data on the materials and mix proportions
used in the construc-
tion are not available as is often the case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In view of the limitations
of the method
for predicting
the strength
of concrete
in the structure,
it is
preferable
that both
ultrasonic pulse velocity given in Part 1 of the standard
and rebound hammer
method are used in combination
to alleviate the errors
arising out of influence
of material, mix and
environmental
parameters
on the respective
measurements.
Relationships
between
pulse velocity,
rebound
number
and compressive
strength of concrete
are obtained
by multiple
regression
of the
measured
values on laboratory
test
specimens.
However,
this approach
has the limitation
that the
correlations
are valid only for the materials
and mix proportions
used in the trials. The intrinsic
difference
between the laboratory
test
specimens
and
in-situ  concrete,
for example
surface texture,
moisture condition,
presence of reinforcement,
etc, also affect the accuracy
of results. The correlation
is valid only within the range of values of pulse velocity,
rebound number
and compressive
strength
employed and any extrapolation
beyond
these is open to question.
The rebound hammer
test is not
intended
as a substitute for standard compression
test, but as a method for determining
the uniformity
of concrete
in the structure
and comparing one concrete
with another.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of the above limitations,
the combined
use of these two methods is made in another
way.
In
this, if the quality of concrete
is assessed to be ‘excellent
or good’ by pulse velocity
method, only then
the compressive
strength is assessed from the rebound hammer indices,
and this is taken as indicative
of strength of concrete
in the entire cross-section
of the concrete
member.
When the quality assessed
is ‘medium’, the estimation
of compressive
strength
by rebound indices is extended
to the entire
mass
only on the basis of other colateral measurements,
for example, strength of site concrete
cubes, cement
content
in the concrete
or core testing. When the quality
of concrete
is doubtful, no assessment of
concrete
strength is made from rebound indices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most of the situations,
the records
?f the original materials
or mix proportions
used in the strut_  /
ture are not available.
Therefore,
cqnslderable
improvisation
has to be done
in evolving the  testing
scheme  and use is made of comparafive
measurements
made on adjoining
portions
of the structures
or even other structures
in the vicmlty of the one in question. In doing so, an approach
is taken
t
the same materials
and similar mix proportions
and level of workmanship
were employed
for the t
at

<<PARAGRAPH>>and then
the compressive
strength determined
as per IS 516  :  1959. The fixed load required
is
of the order
of 7 N/mm8 when
the
impact
energy of the hammer
is about
2.2 Nm. The
load should be increased for calibrating
rebound
hammers of greater impact energy and decreas-
ed for calibrating
rebound hammers
of lesser
impact energy.
The test specimens should be as
large a mass as possible
in order to minimise
the size effect on the test result of a full scale
structure.
150 mm cube specimens are preferred
for
calibrating
rebound
hammers
of lower
impact energy
( 2.2 Nm ), whereas for rebound
hammers of higher
impact energy,
for example
30 Nm, the test
cubes should not
be smaller
than 300 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>surfaces
‘are thoroughly
cleaned before taking
any measurement.
Around each point of observa-
tion, six readings of rebound indices are taken
2nd average
of these
readings
after
de!eting
outliers
as
per
IS 8900  :  1978 becomes
the
rebound
index for the point of observation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 INFLUENCE
OF TEST CONDITIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 The
rebound
numbers are influenced
by a
number
of factors
like types
of cement
and
aggregate,
surface condition
and moisture
con-
tent, age of concrete
and extent of carbonation
of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.1  Influence of Type of Cement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concretes
made with high alumina cement
can
give strengths
100 percent higher than that with
ordinary
Portland
cement. Concretes made with
supersulphated
cement
can
give 50 percent
lower strength than that with ordinary Portland
cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the specimens are wet cured,
they should be
removed
from
wet storage
and kept
in the
laboratory
atmosphere
for
about
24 hours
before testing. To obtain a correlation
between
rebound numbers and strength of wet cured and
wet tested
cubes, it is necessary to establish
a
correlation
between the strength of wet tested
cubes and the strength
of dry tested
cubes on
which
rebound
readings
are taken.
A direct
correlation
between
rebound
numbers
on wet
cubes’ and the
strength
of wet cubes is not
recommended.
Only the vertical
faces
of the
cube as cast should be tested. At least nine read-
ings should be taken on each of the two vertical
faces
accessible
in the
compression
testing
machine when using the rebound hammers.
The
points of impact on the specimen
must not be
nearer
an edge than
20 mm and should be not
less than
20 mm from
each other.
The
same
points must not be impacted
more than once.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2  Influence of Type of Aggregate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Different types
of aggregate
used in concrete
give different
correlations
between compressive
strength and rebound numbers.
Normal aggre-
gates such as gravels
and crushed
rock aggre-
gates give similar
correlations,
but concrete
made
with
lightweight
aggregates
require
special calibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.3  Influence of Surface Condition and Moisture
Content of Concrete<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rebound
hammer
method
is suitable
only
for close texture
concrete.
Open texture
con-
crete typical of masonry
blocks,
honeycombed
concrete
or no-fines
concrete
are unsuitable
for this test.
All correlaticns
assume full com-
pactjon,
as the strength of partially
compacted
concrete
bears
no unique
relationship
to the
rebound numbers.
Trowelled
and floated
sur-
faces are harder
than
moulded
surfaces,
and
tend to overestimate
the strength of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 For testing,
smooth,
clean and dry surface
is to be selected.
If loosely
adhering
scale is
present,
this should be rubbed
of with a grind-
ing wheel
or stone.
Rough
surfaces
resulting
from
incomplete
compaction,
loss of grout,
spalled or tooled
surfaces do not give reliable
results and should be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A wet surface will give rise to underestimation
of the
strength
of concrete
calibrated
under
dry conditions.
In structural
concrete,
this can
be about 20 percent lower than in an equivalent
dry concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 The point
of impact
should
be at least
20 mm away from any edge or shape disconti-
nuity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.4  Injuence
of Curing and Age of Concrete<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 For taking
a measurement,
the rebound
hammer should
be held at right
angles to the
surface of the concrete
member.
The test can
-thus be
conducted
horizontally
on
vertical
surfaces or vertically upwards
or downwards on
horizontal
surfaces.
If the
situation
demands,
the rebound hammer can be held at intermediate
angles
also,
but in each
case,
the
rebound
number
will be different for the same concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The relationship
between hardness and strength
varies
as a function
of time.
Variations
in
initial
rate
of hardening,
subsequent
curing
and conditions
of exposure also influence
the
Lelationship.
Separate
calibration
curves
are
required
for different
curing regimes
but the
effect
of
age can generally
be ignored
for
concrete
between 3 days and 3 months old.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4  Rebound

<<PARAGRAPH>>surface
on
the
rebound
number
is
very
significant.
Carbonated
concrete
gives an over-
estimate of strength
which in extreme cases can
be up to 50 percent.
It is possible
to establish
correction
factors by removing
the carbonated
layer and testing the concrete with the rebound
hammer on the uncarbonated
concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is also pointed
out that rebound
indices
are
indicative
of compressive
strength of concrete
to a limited depth
from the surface. If the con-
crete in a particular
member has internal micro-
cracking,
flaws
or heterogeneity
across
the
cross-section,
rebound hammer
indices will not
indicate
the same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>$ INTERPRETATION
OF RESULTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As such, the estimation
of strength of concrete
by rebound hammer
method cannot be held to
be very accurate
and probable
accuracy
of
prediction
of concrete
strength in a structure
is & 25 percent.
If the relationship
between
rebound index and compressive
strength can be
checked by tests on core samples obtained from
the structure
or standard
specimens
made with
the same concrete
materials and mix proportion,
then
the accuracy
of results
and confidence
thereon are greatly increased.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  The rebound hammer
method
provides
a
convenient
and rapid
indication
of the com-
pressive
strength
of
concrete
by
means of
establishing a suitable correlation
between the
rebound index and the compressive
strength of
concrete.
The procedure
of
obtaining
such
correlation
is given
in 5.2. In general,
the
rebound
number
increases
as the
strength
increases but it is also affected by a number of
parameters
as mentioned
in 7.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

any significant
difference  in the ultrasonic
pulse velocity or rebound
indices between them
must be due to some inherent
differences in the overall
quality. If the nominal grades of concrete
or
mix proportions
are known to be different in either case, suitable allowance is made for the same in
interpretation
of results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test results on ultrasonic
pulse velocity and rebound indices are analysed
statistically
and plotted
as histograms
and the lower fractiles of results are taken for assessing the quality or ‘characteristic’
