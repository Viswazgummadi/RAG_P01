<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by

on 21 April
1980,

Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Inorganic
aggregates

commonly
used
in the
manufacture
of
gypsum
plaster.
Most
commonly
used aggregates
are perlite,
sand and

This
standard
lays
down
minimum

for use in manufacture
of gypsum

result
of
a test
or
analysis,
shall
be rounded
