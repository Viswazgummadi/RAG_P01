<<HEADING level=3>>FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
after the draft finalized by the
Fire Safety Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fire is fairly frequent in textile mills because textiles fibres are highly combustible.
Processes preparatory
to spinning have a particularly
high fire frequency on account
of the presence of iibres in loose form and
probability of ignition by rapidly moving machinery. The main causes of fire in textile mills can be attribu-
ted to failure of electrical equipment,
sparks from foreign matter in cotton stock, friction,
faulty bearings,
presence of excessive quantity of fly in the departments,
use of flammable liquids and presence of high
temperatures in the processing sections. This standard has therefore been formulated with a view to provid-
ing reliable and adequate
g&l-
with regard to fire safety of cotton textile mills. This standard was
first published in 1965. The revision has been prepared so as to keep in line with latest TAC
rules besides
updating other requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Additional information for the 6re prevention
in textile mills reference may be made to ‘Prevention
Fires
in Textile Industry’ issued by the Loss Prevention Association of India Limited, Bombay.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Provisions of this code are supplimentary to the relevant
Statutory requirements as laid down in Indian
Factory Act, Petroleum Rules, Gas Cylinder Rules, etc.<<HEADING_END>>
