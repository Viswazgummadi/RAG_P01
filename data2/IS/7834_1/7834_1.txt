<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope -
This standard
( Part 1 ) covers
general
requirements
regarding
materials,
manufacture
methods
of test,
inspection
and
marking
of. all types
of injection
moulded
PVC socket fittings
intended
for
connection,
by using
solvent
cement,
to PVC
pipes
covered
by IS : 4985-1988
[ Specification
for unplasticized
PVC pipes for potable water supplies
( second

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.  Materials
~.-  The
material
from
which
the fitting
is produced
shall
substantially
consist
of
polyvinyl
chloride,
to
which
may
be
added
only
those
additives
that are needed to facilitate
the
manufacture
of sound
pipe of good surface finish,
mechanical
strength
and opacity.
None of those
additives
shall be used separately
or together
in quantities
sufficient
to constitute
a toxic hazard or
materially
to impair the fabrication
or welding
properties
of the pipe
or to impair its chemical
and
physical
properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f
3. Size of Fitting -
The
sizes
of the fittings
shall
be designated
by the diameters
of their sockets
:
The inside diameters
of the sockets
of the fittings
shall correspond
to the outside
diameters
of the
z
pipes given in
IS : 4985-1988.

shall not be less than 3 mm.

5.  Socket Length and Diameter at M.id-Point of Socket Length<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The
minimum
socket
length
of .any fitting
( see Fig. 1 ) shall
be as given by the expression
L = 0’5 D + 6 mm with a minimum
of 12 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>L = socket length,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D = nominal
inside’
diameter
of fitting
( corresponding
to the outside
diameter
of the
pipe covered in IS : 4985-1988 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1  The socket length is applicable
to socket fittings
for
pipes, of any diameter
under pressure.
The
minimum
socket
lengths
based on the formula
in 5..f for socket.diameters
ranging
from 16 to
315 mm are given in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2  The
maximum
and
minimum
dimensions
of mean
inside
diameter
at mid-point
of socket
depth shall comply with those given in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note I -
The mean inside diameter of the socketed
portion
of the fitting
is defined
as being the arithmetical
mean
of two
diameters
measured
at 90” to each
other at the mid-point of socket length using the same cross-
section.
The diameter of the socket
may be decreased
from
mouth to root; for pipe sizes 16 to 75 mm, the total
included angle of taper shall not exceed 0” 40’;
taper shall not exceed O0 30’.
and for pipe sizes
QO mm and above, the total included  angle  of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note 2 -
Only the manufacturer
of injection moulded
fittings is equipped to measure the
socket inside diameter.
Since the socket length is minimum
only ( no tolerance
is given to this dimension
1, it is not practical,
other than
for the manufacturer,
to establish the exact position
of the mid-polnt
of the socket.
He  can, therefore,
tool up to
measure
his own fittings but such equipment
will
not necessarily
give the correct
figures
for a fitting of other
manufacturer.

Requirements<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Stress
Relief
Test -
When tested by the
method
described
in Appendix
A,  none of the speci-
mens tested shall show blisters,
excessive
delamination
or cracking
or signs
of weldline
splitting.
Ttie weldline
or lines may become more pronounced
during
the test but this
shall
not be deemed to
constitute
failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1  Special
care
shall
be taken
in examining
the area around
the point of injection,
where no
cracks or delaminations
shall penetrate
to a depth greater than 20 percent of the wall thickness
at
that point.
The assessment
of the depth of penetration
of cracks
or delaminations
shall be carried
out’ by ‘sectioning
the
specimen
at the point of injection
and measuring
the depth to which
these
defects
penetrate
the wall thickness
of the fitting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Opacify -
When tested  by  the method described
in Appendix
B, the wall of the fitting
shall no!
transmit
more than 0’2 percent of the visible
light falling
on it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Edfect  on  Water --  The
fittings
shall
not
have
any detrimental
effect on the composition
of the
water flowing
through
them.
When
tested
by the method described
in
Appendix
C, the quantities
of lead, dialkyl tin C, and
higher
homologues
( measured
as tin 3, and
any other toxic substances
extracted
from the internal
walls of the fittings
shall
not
exceed
the following

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1 When
so required
by the purchaser,
the manufacturer

disclose
all the toxic substances
present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Pype Tests -
Type
tests are intended
to prove the suitability
and performance
of a new compo-
sition,
a new compounding
or processing,
technique,
or a new
design
or size of joint or fitting.
Such tests,
therefore,
need
be applied
only
when
a change,
if made in polymer
composition
or
method of manufacture,
or when a new size or type of fitting
is to be introduced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1
Type tests for compliance
with
5 and
6.1 shall be carried
out
on three
samples
taken at
randhm from
each
size,
class
and design
of fittings.
Type
tests for compliance
with 6.2 and 6.3
shall be carried
out on three samples taken
at random
from
the smallest
size and lowest class
of
fitting
( that is, on fittings
having the thinnest
wall and greatest surface area : mass ratio ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2  All the fittings
tested shall comply with the requirements
for which they are examined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Produc!ion
Routine
Tests
These
tests
are spot tests carried out during
manufacture
to prove
the quality
of a lot of fittings
and shall be carried
out by the method specif’ied
in 4, 5, 6.1 and 6.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

that the seals do not allow leakage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.1.1 Fill the fittings

<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.1.1.1
The water containing
the
desired
quantity

can conveniently
be  pre-
pared
by saturating
a large
bulk
of water
with
carbon
dioxide
determining
the carbon

content
by a standard
method
such
as that given
in IS : 3025-1964 ‘Methods
of sampling
and test
(  physical
and chemical
) for water used in
industry’
( with
suitable
adjustment
of quantities
) and
then mixing
with the calculated
quantity
of carbon
dioxide
free water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.1.2 Cover
the open
end
of each
specimen.
Maintain
the fittings
and extractant
at room

containers.
Retain these
samples for the determination
of the amount
of lead present
after the first
extraction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C-2.1.3 Refill the fittings

extractant
and maintain
all
at room

Retain
these samples for the
determination
of the

In case
of failure of the joint,
retest can be done taking
another
