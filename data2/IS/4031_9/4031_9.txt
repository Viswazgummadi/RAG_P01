FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>since publication
of tbe original
standard
in 1968
a number
of standards
covering
the requirement,
of different
equipment
used for testing of cement,
a brief
description
of  which was also covered
in
the standard,
had been
published.
In this revi-
sion,
therefore,
reference
is  given
to different
instrument
specifications
deleting
the description
of the instruments,
as it has been recognized
that
reproducible
and repeatable
tests
results can be
obtained
only
with
standard
testing
equipment
capable
of giving desired level of accuracy.
This
part ( Part 9 ) covers
determination
of heat
of
hydration
of cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Part 9 ) ( First Revi-
sion ) was
adopted
by the
Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on
22 April
1988, after
the
draft
finalized
by the Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Standard
methods
of
testing
cement
are
essential
adjunct
to the cement
specifications.
This
standard
in different
parts
lays down the
procedure
for the tests
to evaluate
the physical
properties
of different
types of hydraulic
cements.
The
procedure
for
conducting
chemical
tests of
hydraulic
cement
is covered
in IS  :  4032-1985*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Originally
all the tests to evaluate
the physical
properties
of hydraulic
cements
were covered
in
one standard:
but
for
facilitating
the use of this
standard
and future revisions,
it has been decided
to print the different
tests as different
parts of the
standard
and accordingly,
this
revised
standard
has been brought
out in thirteen
parts.
This
will
also facilitate
updating
of individual
tests. Further,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a parti-
cular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be
rounded
off in
accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the
rounded
off value
should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
