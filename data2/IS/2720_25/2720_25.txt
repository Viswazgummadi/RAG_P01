This
Indian
Standard
( Part XXV
) ( First  Revision
1 was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on
24
December
1982,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the Soil Engineering
and Rock
Mechanics
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establishing
uniform
procedures
for the determination
to different
characteristics
of soils and also for facilitating
a comparative
study of the results,
the Indian
Standards
Institution
is bringing
out the
Indian
Standard
Methods
of test for soils ( IS : 2720 ) which
has been
published
in parts.
This part covers
method
for determination
of silica
sesquioxide
ratio.
The
silica
sesquioxide
ratio
of clay
is one
of the
fundamental
properties
of the
soil.
This
is used
as a guide
in the
mineralogical
classification
of
Soil.
Usually
clay
minerals
of high
exchange
capacity
have
also high
silica sesquioxide
ratio
values
while
those of low exchange
capacity
have a low ratio.
The ratio is determined
on the clay fractibn
( particle
size less than 0.002
mm ) of the soil.
This
standard
was first published
in 1967.
This
revision
covers
improved
method of initial treatment
of the soil specimen
for conducting
this test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is
complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a test
or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off
in
accordance
with IS : 2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Initial
Treatment
of Soil Specimen
-
Ten
grams
of the dried
clay
substance
be separated
by
centrifuging
-
2 micron
fraction.
It
should
then be freed
of
exchangable
cations
by
dialyses
or
with
an
exchange
resin.
Colloidal
impurities
and organic
impurities
be
then
oxidised
with hydrogen
peroxide.
Later
iron oxide
be dissolved
away
with oxalic
acid and clay fraction
washed
free of oxalate
ions and dried.
It should then be used for estimation
of silica and
aluminium
oxide
and
iron oxide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2  Estimation
of
Silica -
About
one
gram
of
the
dried
clay
accurately
weighed
shall
be taken
in a platinum
dish and mixed
with
fusion
mixture
5 to 6 times
the weight
of the
clay.
It
shall then
be
ignited
in the muffle furnace or any suitable
arrangement
(at about 9OO’C)
and cooled.
The
dish shall
then
be placed
in the 800-ml
beaker
filled
with distilled
water.
A few millilitres
of concentrated
hydrochloric
acid
shall be added
and the beaker
covered
with watch
glass.
After
some
time
when
the effervescence
stops,
the platinum
dish shall
be washed
with distilled
water into the beaker
containing
the dish with the ignited
mass.
The
whole
mass shall be evaporated
to dryness
on a sand
bath
till whole of the hydrochloric
acid disappears.
If necessary,
the process,
may be repeated
to ensure complete
baking
or dehydration
of silica.
The
evaporation
shall be continued
for another
hour to remove
the last traces
of hydrochloric
acid.
Two hundred
millilitre
of distilled
water
shall be
added
and
heated
for
at least
another
10 minutes,
filtered
through
Whatman
fiIter paper No. 42 or equivalent
and
washed
free from
acid.
The whole of silica along  with  filter paper shall be placed in a preweighed
crucible.
The crucible
shall be placed
in the muffle
furnace
for some
time till the weight
of crucible
with its contents
becomes
constant,
then
cooled
and ,weighed.
The
weight
of
silica
shall
be
calculated
by
subtracting
the empty weight of the crucible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Estimation
of Alumininm
Oxide and Iron Oxide<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1  The
sesquioxide
( Fe,O,
+ A1203 ) in
the
crucible
shall
be
fused with fusion mixture
and then dissolved in hydrochloric
acid. It shall
be added
to the filtrate
obtained
in 3.2.
About 5 ml of Bromine
water
shall
be added
and the contents
shall
be made
to 250 ml.
Half
of it
shall be taken for estimation
of aluminium
oxide
and iron oxide.
The
other half shall be taken for the estimation
of iron oxide only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
To the first half about four grams of ammonium
chloride
(NHaCl)
and a few drops of rosolic
acid
solution
shall
be added
and heated
to
boiling.
A little paper pulp shall then be added
and the solution
made
very
slightly
ammonical
with
dilute
ammonia
as shown
by a faint
pink colour
of rosolic
acid
and finally
filtered
through
Whatman
filter<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2720 ( Part XXV ) - 1982<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>paper No. 42 or equivalent.
The precipitates
along with filter paper shall
be
placed
in
a weighed
crucible
which
shall
then
be ignited
in the
muffle
furnace
or any other
suitable
arrangement.
The
final weight
shall
be noted.
The
total
weight
of aluminium
oxide
plus iron oxide
shall be obtained
by subtracting
from
the final weight,
the weight of the
empty crucible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3
To
the second
half of the filtrate
obtained
in 3.3.1,
an excess
of concentrated
sodium
hydroxide
shall
be
added
and
boiled.
The
precipitate
of iron hydroxide
so formed
shall be filtered.
The aluminium
hydroxide
dissolves
in sodium
hydroxide.
The
precipitates
shall
be
washed
free
from
alkali
by hot
distilled
water
and
dissolved
in the
minimum
quantity
of hydrochloric
acid.
Ammonium
chloride
( solid )
shall be added and the solution heated
and again allowed
to cool.
Excess
of ammonium
hydroxide
solution
shall then be added
and precipitates
so
formed
filtered,
dried along with the filter paper
and transferred
to the
pre-weighed
crucible.
The crucible
shall be ignited
in the muffle furnace
or any other suitable
arrangement,
cooled,
reweighed
and the weight
of
iron oxide calculated.
The difference
between
the weights of aluminium
oxide plus iron oxide ( AlzO, + Fe,O,
) and iron oxide
gives the weight
of aluminium
oxide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.  CALCULATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The values of silica, iron and alumina
shall be expressed
as percentage
of clay.
Each
value
shall be divided
by its molecular
weight to obtain
the gram
