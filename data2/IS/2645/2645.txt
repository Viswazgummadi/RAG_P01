FO.REWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
St,andards Institution on 25 February
1975, after the draft finalized by the
Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee had been approved by,  the
Civil  Engineering
Division Council.
0.2 A number of proprietary
integral cement
waterproofmg
compounds
exist in the market which, according to the manufacturers’
recommenda-
tions, may be added to cement to render the mortar or concrete watcr-
proof.
However,
recommendations
are normally
not available
to test
these products for their efficacy as waterproofers or their effects on  otlwr
properties of cement.
It was, therefore,
considered necessary to publish
this specification for such compounds.
0.2.1
This standard was first published in 1’964.
The provisions of the
standard
have been under the review ‘of the
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional Committee from time to time and the first revision has been taken
up with a view to modifying
the earlier
rcquiremcnts
in the  li$t
of
experience gained in working to this standard by both manufacturers
and
users.
0.3 The usefulness of the integral waterproofing co&pounds is sought to bc
determined by measuring the permeability
of standard mortar specimens
prepared with and without the addition of such compounds.
The grading
of the sand to be used in preparing these specimens is diKcrcnt
from
that
of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the
standard sand ( s&e IS  :  650-1966*
) used ordinarily in the testing of
Portland cement.
While in cement testing, the requirement of the sand in
regard to  size is  that the sand obtained in three scparatc fractions,
that is,
2 mm to 1 mm, 1 mm to 0.5 mm and below O-5 mm bc blcndcd togcthcr,
the sand specified for permeability
test has a much closer control  of  part&
size and is the  same as that used in RILEM
CEMBUREAU
tests.
‘This is
a graded sand with five point control and ensures increased uniformity ill<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS t 2645 - 1975<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>testing of waterproofing
compound
as  compared to the standard sand
conforming to IS  :  650-1966*
which is of three point control.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 A second variation from the normal:practice
in cement testing is in
regard
to the cement-sand
ratio in the mortar.
Instead
of the usual
1  :  3 ratio, this standard specifies a ratio of 1  :  5 of cement and sand for the
permeability test.
The object in this is to have a mortar less dense than
that used for cement testing ( as in compressive strength tests ) and having
some capillary voids so that the effect of the addition of the waterproofing
compounds may become more apparent.
0.3.2 Water-cement
ratio for the test specimens for permeability
tests is
also different from the water-cement
ratio normally employed for cement
testing.
While in the first specification ( IS  :  2645-1964
), .the water-cement
ratio was maintained
constant
at
0.54,
in
this
revision
a constant
workability
has been specified in terms of flow of mortar.
Instead of
specifying a fixed water-cement
ratio,
it is considered more rational
to
mould specimens at a fixed workability.
This change takes into considera-
tion fineness of cement and improved workability, if any, brought about by
the admixtures.
A flow of 75 f
5 percent has therefore been specified
with the aim of producing mortar having sufficient plasticity
to permit
easy moulding without need for compactioniby
vibration or other means.
6.4 It is necessary that all constituent
materials
in concrete
including
integral cement waterproofing compounds should, as far as possible, be free
from chlorides and sulphates.
Sometimes,
waterproofing
compounds are
likely to contain water soluble chlorides and sulphates which may cause
corrosion pf steel reinforcement
in reinforced
cement concrete and also
produce other harmful effects in concrete.
of chlorides
containing
admixtures,
IS  :  456-19647
prohibits the use
and the possibility
of specifying a
maximum permissible limil of chlorides and sulphates in terms of total
weight of concrete is under consideration in the revision of IS  :  456-lg64t.
Since chlorides and sulphates can enter concrete from various sources, it is
desirable
that the chloride
and sulphate
content
should be as low as
possible in concrete
admixtures,
compounds.
such
as integral cement waterproofing
Pending a decision for the maximum limit of chlorides and
sulphates in the integral cement waterproofing compounds, provisions have
been made in 2.4
requiring
the manufacturer
to declare chloride and
sulphate contents in the integral cement waterproofing
compounds so that
different
samples of waterproofing
compounds
can be compared
and
engineer-in-charge
is in knowledge
of
the
amount
of chlorides
and
sulphates entering
into concrete
through waterproofing
compound.

TESTING EQUIPMENT
A-2.1 Permeability
Unit -
The
permeability
unit shall consist of a
specimen
container
ring
of 100 mm diameter
and 50 mm height held
between a bottom plate and a water cell.
The hydraulic
head for testing
shall be obtained by connecting
the unit to a compressor through a water
pressure
vessel.
A pressure
regulator
and a pressure
gauge
shall
be
included between the compressor and water pressure vessel to ‘indicate
the.
test pressure.
Water percolating
through the’ specimen shall be collected
in a container.
Figures 1 and 2 give details of an individual unit.
A-2.1.1
The water-cell shall be a 100 mm diameter brass cylinder and the
top and bottom plates shall be either of brass or any other non-corroding
metal.
The
connecting
pipe
line
from
the
water-cell
to
the
water
pressure vessel shall also be .of non-corroding
metal or of hard polythene.
This requirement
is necessary since the tests last over a number of days in
which mild steel or allied materials will corrode and the rust formed will
coat the top of the specimen and affect the permeability.
The connection
of the units to the compressor shall be done by means of armoured heavy-
duty rubber hose.
A-2.1.2
The water pressure vessel shall be made of galvanized steel and
capable of withstanding the applied pressure with an adequate
margin of
safety.
A-2.2 Rammer
-
A standard rammer of the type shown in Fig. 3 shall
be used to compact the mortar.
The rammer shall consist of a plunger
weighing 500 f
5 g which shall fall freely through a height of 150 f
1 mm
in a tubular
guide.
The base of the plunger shall have a diameter of
50 Et 1 mm.
A-3. SAND
A-3.1 The
sand to be used in the preparation
of the mortar shall be
natural, rounded siliceous sand with a maximum amount of quartz grains.
The sand should preferably
be the same as standard sand conforming
to

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Wherever possible, mixing with Hobart type mortar  mixer is recommended.
In such cases. it is desirable to take a batch of 300 g cement and 1 500 g regraded sand
since in the Hobart mixer efficiency is better with a 1 800 g-2 000 g batch.
The material
.used for the flow test can be collected back into the bowl, mixed again for 15 seconda
at medium speed and used for casting.
In case where flow test is omitted after comple-
tion  ofmixing, allow the mortar to stand for 90 seconds, remix for 15 seconds at medium
speed and later mould two test specimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-5. PREPARATION
OF SPECIMEN<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.1  The container ring shall be given a thin coating
of neat cement
slurry and the mortar shall be placed in it in two layers.
Each layer shall
be compacted with 10 blows of the standard rammer.
During compaction
the guide of the rammer shall remain
in contact
with the wall of the
container ring.
It shall be moved through a uniform distance after each
blow so as to cover the entire periphery of the container ring after 10 blows.
After compaction
the top of the specimen
shall be levelled off with a
12 mm diameter
rod slowly and firmly
moved
over the surface.

of
27 & 2°C in an atmosphere
of at least 90 percent relative humidity for
24 hours.
At,  the end of that period submerge the specimen in clean fresh
water and keep there for 20 days, and take it out just prior to testing.
The

laitance, surface fines, etc, and washed.
Later each of the specimen shall
be fitted into the permeability cell as shown in Fig. 2.
An initial pressure
of about O-5 kgf/ ems shallbe
applied to the water and from time to time
the collecting container shall be taken out and weighed to determine
the
rate of percolation.
The rate of percolation will be comparatively
high in
the initial
stages and will
then become
stabilized.
At this stage the
pressure shall be increased again by 0.5 kgf/ cm8 and this procedure repeated
until a final pressure of 2 kgf/cm* is reached.

specimens incorporating
the waterproofing compound is less than 50 percent
of the average percolation in the case of the specimens without the water-

Substitute
the following
for the
existing
clause:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘0.4 It
is necessary
that all constituent
materials
in concrete
including
integral
cement waterproofing
compounds
should, as far as possible,
be
free from chlorides and sulphates.
Sometimes,
waterproofing
compounds
are likely to contain water soluble chlorides and sulphates which may cause
corrosion
of steel reinforcement
in reinforced
concrete
and also produce
other harmful effects in concrete.
IS  :  456-1978t
specifies the permissible
limit of chlorides and sulphates in the concrete in terms of percent by mass
of cement,
The
Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee,
while
reviewing the standard felt that the dosage of sulphates in waterproofing
compounds was so small that contribution
of these compounds to the total
soluble sulphates in concrete would be insignificant
when compared to the
limit of sulphates specified in IS : 456-1978t
and that the adverse effects of
chlorides in concrete and its control
through limiting
the chlorides
from
the
concrete
materials
and admixtures
were
more
significant.
The
committee,
therefore,
felt that the chloride content in the waterproofing
compound shall be declared by the manufacturer
so that different samples
of waterproofing compounds can be compared
and engineer-in-charge
is
in knowledge of the amount of chlorides
entering
into concrete
through
waterproofing compound.
The method of determination
of chlorides
in
waterproofing
compounds is covered in IS : 6925-1973x.
