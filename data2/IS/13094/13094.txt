<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the
Bureau
of Indian Standards,
after the draft finalized
by
the
Foundation
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In poor
and weak subsoils,
the design of conventional
shallow foundation
for structures
and
equipment
may present
problems
with respect to both sizing of foundation
as well as control
of foundation
settlements.
Traditionally,
pile
foundations
have
been
employed
often
at
enormous costs.
A more
viable
alternative
in certain
situations,
developed
over the recent
years
is to
improve
the subsoil
itself
to an extent such that the subsoil would develop an
adequate
bearing capacity
and foundations
constructed
after
subsoil
improvement
would
have
resultant
settlements
within acceptable
limits.
The
techniques
for
ground
improvement
has
developed rapidly and has found large scale application
in industrial
projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2.2 This
technique
is applicable
to fine
groundsoils
such as silts and clays.
Subsoils
exhibiting
high
secondary
consolidation
characteristics
may
not
be -amenable
to
required degree of impovement
by the preload-
ing method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>structure,
foundation
design
shall be carried
out including
sizing and settlement
analysis.
Ground
improvement
is indicated
if the net
loading
intens5ty
of the
foundation
exceeds
the
allowable
pressure
computed
as
per
IS 6403  :  1981.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Ground treatment
is also indicated
if even
for relative
low loading
intensities,
the resul-
tant settlement
[ computed
in accordance
with
IS 8009 ( Part 1 )  :  1976 and IS 8009 ( Part 2 )  :
1980 ] exceeds
the acceptable
limits for the
structure
both
from
view point of distortions
induced
in the
structure
and from operation
angle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2.3 Removal of water from pore spaces has
also been carried out by application
of electric
current
to subsoil,
the process
being known
as Electra
Osmosis.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3
Injection and Grouting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3.1
Injection
of chemicals,
lime, cements
etc, into subsoils improve
subsoil by formation
of bonds
between
soil particles.
Mechanical
compression
of subsoil is also achieved under
certain
conditions
provided
grout is pumped
in under high pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Loose
cohesionless
deposits
in
seismic
zones
may
be prone
to liquefaction
during
earthquakes
specially
under high water table
conditions.
In such cases,
analysis should be
carried
out for establishing
liquefaction
pot-
ential of the subsoil.
Ground
improvement
is
called
for if such analysis establishes
that the
subsoil is prone to liquefaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3.2 Available
methods
are
suitable
for
sands as well as fine grained soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.4  Soil Reinforcement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Stability
of soil in slopes can be enhanced
substantially
by use of soil reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.4.1
Reinforcement
introduced
into
the
soil
mass
causes
marked
improvemement
in
stiffness
and
co;?sequently
load carrying cap-
city and stability
of soil mass.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 METHODS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Ground
improvement
is achieved
by the
following methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4.2 Reinforcements
may be in the
form
of dense granular
materials
in the
form
of
stone
columns.
These
are
used
where
the
primary requirement
is increased
in capability
to carry vertical
loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  Soil Densifica tion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.1
By application
of shock and vibration
to the subsoil and thereby
causing rearrange-
ment
of
the
soil
structure
from
a
loose
to medium due to dense state.
This technique
is applicable
only to cohensionless
soils under
high water table conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4.3 Reinforcements
may
also be
in rhe
form
of horizontal
or
vertical
strips
and
membranes.
These reinforcements
serve signi-
ficantly
to increase
the capacity
of soil
to
withstand tensile,
shear and compression
loads
and
contribute
towards
improvement
of
stability
of soil mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.2 Methods
under
this
head
include
vibroflotation,
vibrocompaction,
compaction
piles, blasting and dynamic consolidation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.5  Miscellaneous
Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2  Pre-Consolidation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.5.1
Other methods used successfully inc!ude
replacement
of poor subsoil by competent
fill.
These
methods,
however
have limitations
of
depths of application.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2.1
Expulsion
of
water
from
the pores
causes
consolidation
of
the
soil
thereby
resula tin.g in build
up of shear strength
and
substautlally
reduced
values
of final settle-
ments
of foundations.
This is achieved
by
precompression
of the
subsoil
by subjecting
the
area
to
a preload.
Preload can be of a
soil itself or any suitable material.
Preloading
is generally
carried
out
in
stages to allow
gradual build up of soil strength enabling it to
safely
suppost
further
stages of preload.
For
poorly
draining
soils
such as soft clays, pre-
compression
is accelerated
by
provision
of
vertical
drainage
channels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.5.2 Improvement
of properties
of subsoils
by heating
and drying
and by fusion at high
temperatures
have been employed
with success.
Soft soil have also temporarily
been strengthen-
ed by freezing to improve stiffness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

may be
more suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to include

by measurement
of pore pressure,
soil movements,
