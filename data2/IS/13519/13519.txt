<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by the Offshore Installations
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection
and quality control
is performed
to
ensure adherence
to codes,
specifications
and
to achieve a desired quality and service in the finished
product.
The
most effective
code
of
practice
for
inspection
and quality
control
sha!l be the one which prevents
the defects
or
deviations
rather than identify them after they occure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
OB numerical
values
(  revised ).’
The
number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

dures covering all aspects
for tender/contract
stage to final installation.
This
shall include
detail quality control
procedures
and quality
plans for bought-out
materials/services,
