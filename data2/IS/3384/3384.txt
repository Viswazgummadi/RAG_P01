FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 4 July 1986, after the draft
finalized
by the
Waterproofing
and Damp-proofing
Sectional Committee had been appro-
ved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Bitumen primer is commonly
used for priming concrete and masonry
surfaces
prior to the application
of the first mopping coat of melted
bitumen in laying built-up roofings or membrane
waterproofing,
so as to
promote
the bonding
of the bitumen
with the concrete roof deck or
masonry surface.
This standard
is intended
to cover
the minimum
requirements
for bitumen
primer
for use in waterproofing
and damp-
proofing of buildings.
This standard was first published
in
1965
and
the revision of this standard
has been taken
up to incorporate
further
changes
necessary
in view of the revision of various standards referred
to in this standard.
In this revision, in addition
to carbon
disulphide,
use of carbon
tetrachloride
and trichloroethylene
have been permitted
for the requirements
of primer.
Sampling clause has been modified
to
bring it in line with the other published Indian Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This specification
covers the requirements
for bitumen
primer
for
application
to concrete
and masonry
surfaces
and
to be used with
bitumen in damp-proofing
and waterproofing
below
or above ground
level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  For the purpose of this standard, the definition
given
in IS : 491 l-
