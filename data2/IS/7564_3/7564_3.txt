FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard (Part III) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution
on 4 November
1974, after the draft finalized by the Modular
Co-ordination
Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil Engi-
neering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Since the basic decision to adopt a IO-cm module has been taken, the
work connected with application of this module for different building com-
ponents, such as bricks, walling materials, roofing materials, etc, has been
done by different committees and dimensions have been recommended by
these committees for such components.
0.2.1
However, it has been felt that some thought had to be given to the
need for dimensionally
co-ordinating
a particular
product, specially with
respect to the three dimensions -
length, width, height/thickness.
It was
felt that in some cases such co-ordination of dimensions may or mav not be
necessary, while in other cases it is absolutely imperative.
To identify such
parameters for individual components, it was felt that building as a whole
should be examined from the point of view of various components that go
into it and then decide on the need for dimensional co-ordination
on an
individual basis.
0.2.2
After such a decision had been arrived at, it will then be possible
for the relevant committees to adopt this principle in finally arriving at the
nominal and work sizes for the individual components.
With this end in
view the building has been divided broadly into the following five functional
groups  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Functional group  1  -
Structure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Functional group 2 -
External envelope<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Functional group 3 -
Internal subdivision<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Functional group 4 -
Services and drainage<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Functional group 5 -
Fixtures, furniture and equipment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 7564 (Part III) - 1974<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3  It was indeed
very useful for the Modular
Co-ordination
Sectional
Committee
to have the views of various
architects,
engineers
and users in
arriving at a basic decision regarding
the need for dimensionally
co-ordinating
some of these products
so that the relevant
committees
could exercise
their
mind on such items only.
Based on these decisions,
it may be possible
to
review the existing Indian
Standards
on different subjects
where dimensions
have been already given and arrive at new dimensions
where necessary.
-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1
It may be noted that the words ‘co-ordination
of dimensions’
instead
of ‘modular
co-ordination’
have been used in the title of the standard
with a
view to encouraging
the concept
of establishing
the correlation
of two or
more products
when juxtaposed
together
to perform
a function.
If such a
function
is not ntccssary
or there is no function
to be done, then it appears
there may not be a need for co-ordinating
dimension
in the products placed
together.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
~has been given to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in
this country.
This has been met by deriving
assistance from the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard
(Part III)
lays down recommendations
for co-ordinating
dimensions
of building
components
and assemblies for functional
group 3 -
internal
subdivision,
which
comprises
the
following
elements
of
construction
:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Partitions,
floors, ceilings and staircases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose
of this standard
the following
definitions
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
