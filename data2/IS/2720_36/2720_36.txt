is, when
the flow is steady

the soil
is saturated
and
the rate
of flow
is
proportional
to the

this

experience
gained
in conducting
this test
in the
past
13 years,
the
procedures
have
been

adopted
by

Bureau
of

on
29
October
1987,
after

With
a view
to establish
uniform
procedures
for
determination
of different
characteristics
of
soils
and
also for facilitating
comparative
studies
of the
results,
an Indian
Standard
on
methods
of test for
soils ( IS  : 2i20 )  is  being
published
in various
parts.
‘I’his part
describes
the method
for
determination
of coefficient
of permeability
of granular
soils by a
constant
head
method
and
under
conditions
of
laminar
flow
of water.
The
knowledge
of
this
property
is essential
in
a
solution
of
problems
involving
de-watering,
yield of water
bearing
strata,
seepage
through
earth
dams,
etc.
A reliable
deter-
mination
of permeability
can
be made
only
when
the
conditions
for
the validity
of Darcy
Law
are<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of a

is to be rounded

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.1  PIerequisite
for

through

is that,
water

there
is no movement

of

particles;
moreover,
water
shall
flow
through

in them,

there
shall
be
no

There
are several
methods
of reducing

(b) by
spraying

into a partial

(c) to USC water
having
higher
tem-
perature,
at
least
5°C

water
before

through
a
porous
fine

material
so that the air is rntrapped
in
the interstices
of the material.
Out of all these
lllethods
of
deairing
water:
the last methodof
passing
tap water
through
filter is less expensive
and
more
suitable,
specially
wheu
large
quantities
of deaired

are required
to be used.
It will be essential
that
the
filter
material
should
be of
finer
grade
than
that
of the soil to be tested
otherwise
air
may come out of the solution
in water
while passing
through
the soil mass.
Hut still if preferred,
the deaired

pared

In

this,
special

suggested

For fine
sands,
a
water-pump
grease
should
be applied
to
the

flow of water
between

For coarse

to

satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

With its gasket in place,
press down the top
plate against
the spring and attach
it securely
to the
top of the permearneter
cylinder,
making
an airtight
seal.
This

the
condition
of
no
volume

during tesling for holding

Connect
the inlet tube
of the
top plate
of
the
permeameter
to a vacuum
pump
or
suitable
aspirator
capable
of evacuating
the air content
from
the specimen
and the outlet
tube in the base
plate
to the water container
as shown
in Fig. 2.
Close
the manometer
outlets
[ see 2.1 ( b ) 1 and the outlet
valy,e at the base plate of the permeameter.
Using
a v.lcuum
pump
or
aspirator,
evacuate
the speci-
men
under
500 mmHg,
minimum
for 15 minutes
to remove
air
adhering
to  soil particles
and
from
the voids.
Follow
the evacuation
by a slow satura-
tion of the specimen
from the bottom upward
under
full vacuum
in order to force any remaining
air in
the specimen.
Continued
saturation
of the specimen
can
be maintained
more adequately
by
the use of
deaired
water,
or
water maintained
at an in-flow
temperature
sufficiently
high to cause a decreasing
temperature
gradient
in the specimen
during
the
test.
Native
water or water of low mineral
content
( see Note ) should be
used for the
test, but in any
case
the
fluid should
be
described
on the
report
form ( Appendix
A ).
This satisfies
the conditions
of laminar
flow through
saturated
soil voids.
NOTE -  Native water is water occurring in the rock or
soil  in.situ.
It  should be used if possible,
but it ( as well as
deaired
water ) may
need
a refinement
not
ordinarily
feasible
for large
scale
production
testing
in which case
available
water may be used and so stated in the report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Much
lower
values of hydraulic
gradient

are required
than generally
recognized,
in order to
ensure
laminar
flow conditions.
The following
values are sugges-
ted:
loose
compactness
ratings
h/L
from 0+2 to @3; and
dense compactness
ratings  h/L  from
0.3
to 0.5;
the lower
values of  h/L  apply to coarser soils and the higher values
to
finer soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 At the completion
of the permeability
test, drain
the specimen
and
inspect it to establish
whether
it
was essentially
homogenous
and isotropic  in  character.
Any light and dark

the
length L
between
manometer
outlets and depth  IfI
(  Fig.

and recorded
in Appendix

For the given soil, water
content
is determined
and
recorded.
The
weight

of air dried
soil
used
in
preparing

is also recorded.
The final height
of specimen
after
compression

spring,
HI -

and recorded.
Dry

and

are
calculated.
The
temperature

and recorded,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 During
the
test,
observations
are
made
of
manometer
readings

are
recorded
in columns

Head
h ( = hl -
h2 )  is calculated
to column
( 6  )  and
gradient
i  ( =  h/L )  is calculated
and recorded
in
column

permeability

is calculated
and recorded
in column

After the
specimen
has been
saturated
and
the permeameter
is full of water, close
the bottom
val?ze on the outlet tube  ( .~ee  Fig. 2 ) and disconnect
the
vacuum.
Care
sh~~ultl be
taken
to ensure
that
the permeability
flow system
and the
mano-
meter
system
are
free
of
air
and
are
working
satisfactorily.
Fill the
inlet tube with
water
from
the
constant-head
tank
by
slightly
opening
the
filter tank valve.
Then
connect
the inlet
tube to the
top of the permeameter,
open the inlet valve slightly
and open
the manometer
outlet cocks
slightly,
to
allow
water
to
flow,
thus
freeing
them
of
air.
Connect
the water
manometer
tubes
to the mano-
meter outlets
and fill with water to remove
the air.
Close the
inlet valve and
open the
outlet valve to
allow the
water in the
manometer
tubes
to reach
their stable
water
level under
zero head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
