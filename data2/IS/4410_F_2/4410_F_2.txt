<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( Part
XV/See
2 )
was
adopted
by the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 4 April
1973, after the draft finalized
by the Terminology
Relating
to River
Valley
Projects
Sectional
Com-
mittee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A number of Indian
Standards
has already
been printed
covering
various aspects of river valley projects and a large number of standards
are in the process of formulation.
These
standards
include
technical
terms, the precise definitions
of which are required to avoid ambiguity
in their interpretation.
To achieve this end, the Institution
is bringing
out IS : 4410 Indian
Standard
glossary of terms relating to  river  valley
projctes,
which is being published
in parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Part XV covers theimportant
field of canal structures
and in view
of the vastness
of this subject,
it is proposed to cover it in different
sections.
Other sections in the series will be the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Section 6

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the
standards
and
practices
prevailing
iv different countries in addition to relating it to the practices
in the field in this countrv.
This
has been met by deriving assistance
from the’following
publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

downstream fluctuations have some effect on the upstream water level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.7 Conversion
Loss* - The loss of energy due to change in velocity at
