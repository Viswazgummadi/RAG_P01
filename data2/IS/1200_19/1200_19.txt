FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
( Part XIX
) ( Third
Revision
) was adopted
by  the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 27 February
1981, after the draft
finalized
by the Civil Works Measurement
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
a very
important
place
in the planning
and
execution
of any civil engineering
work, from the time
of first estimates
to the final completion
and settlement
of payments.
The methods
being
followed
for
the
measurement
are
not
uniform,
and
considerable
differences
exist between
the practices
followed
by different
construction
agencies
and also by various
c.:ntral
and state government
departments.
While
it is recognized
that
each
system
of measurement
has to be
specifically
related
to the administrative
and financial
organization
with
the departments
responsible
for the work,
a unification
of the various
systems
at the
technical
level
has
been
accepted
as very
desirable,
specially
as it permits
a wider
circle
of operation
for civil engineering
contractors
and eliminates
ambiguities
and misunderstandings
arising
out
of inadequate
understanding
of the various
systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Among
the various
civil engineering
items,
measurement
of building
had
been
the first to be taken
up for standardization
and this standard
having
provisions
relating
to building
works
was first published
in 1958
and was revised
in 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4’ In
the
course
of usage
of this
standard
by various
construction
agencies
in the country,
several
clarifications
and
suggestions
for modi-
fications
were
received
and as a result
of study,
the technical
committee
responsible
for this standard
decided
that
the
scope
of this
standard
besides
being
applicable
to building
should
be expanded
so as to cover
method
of
measurement
applicable
to civil
engineering
works
like
industrial
and river valley
project
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS I 1200 ( Part XIX
) - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Since
measurement
of one type of trade
is not related
to that
of
another
one, and also to facilitate
the second
revision
of IS  :  1‘200-!954*,
the Sectional
Committee
decided
that
each
type of trade
as given
in
IS  :  1200-1964*
be issued separately
as different
parts.
This will also be
helpful
to the specific users in various
trades
in using the standard.
This
standard
covering
the method
of measurement
of water
supply,
plumb-
ing and
drains
applicable
to buildings
as well as civil engineering
works
was therefore
issued as the second
revision
in 1970.
This
third
revision
has been
prepared
so as to keep the provisions
in line with
method
of
measurement
now followed
by majority
of organizations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accord-
ance with IS  :  2-196O)t.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in
the rounded
off value
should
be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
