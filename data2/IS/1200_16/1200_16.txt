<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part XVI ) ( Third
Revision
) was adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 May 1979, after the draft finalized
by the Civil Works
Measurement
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Measurement
occupies
a very important
place
in the planning
and
execution
of any civil engineering
work, from the time of first estimates
to
the
final
completion
and
settlement
of payments.
The methods
being
followed
for the measurement
are not uniform,
and considerable
differences
exist between
the practices
followed
by different
construction
agencies
and
also between
various
Central
and State Government
Departments.
While
it is recognized
that
each
system
of measurement
has to be specifically
related
to the administrative
and financial
organisation
with the departments
responsible
for
the work,
a unification
of the various
systems
at the
technical
level has been accepted
as very desirable,
specially
as it permits
a
wider circle of operation
for civil engineering
contractors
and eliminates
ambiguities
and misunderstandings
arising
out of inadequate
understanding
of the various
systems followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Among
the various
civil engineering
items,
measurement
of building
had been the first to be taken
up for standardization
and this standard
having
provisions
relating
to building
works,
was first published
in 1958
and was revised in 1964.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in~the country,
several clarifications
and suggestions
for modifications
were
received
and as a result
of study,
the tP:hnical
committee
responsible
for
this standard
decided that scope of this standard
besides being applicable
to
building
should
be expanded
so as to cover
method
of measurement
applicable
to civil engineering
works like industrial
and river valley project
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 sCt&e  measurement
of each type of trade is not related to one another,
and &is&, to facilitate the second revision of IS: 1200-1964*, the Sectional
Committee decided that each type of trade as given in IS  :  1200-1964* be
iWt%l separately as different parts.
This will also be helpful to the specific
~rs
in various trades in using the standard.
This part covering the
method
of measurement
of laying of water and sewer lines including
appurtenant
items applicable to building as well as civil engineering works
was therefore issued as a second revision 1969. The third revision has been
taken up so as to keep the provisions conform to the latest practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of the measurement,
shall be rounded
off in accordance with
IS  :  2-1960t.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1: SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
