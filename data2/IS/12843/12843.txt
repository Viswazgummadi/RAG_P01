<<PARAGRAPH>>FORE!WORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>after the
the Civil<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on 24 October
1989,
draft finalized by the Structural Engineering
Sectional Committee
had been approved
by
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is intended to serve as a guide to engineers/pzrsonnel
engaged in the erection of steel
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depending
upon the importance
and accuracy
of workmanship
re uired
9
in the fabrication
and
erection, steel structures are broadly classified into three groups as fo lows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Group
A -
Steel railway and road bridges and other structures
subjected to dynamic loadings
which require closer tolerances than those specified for Group B and Group C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Group
B -
Steel structures having special characteristics
and structures
subjected to dynamic
loading excluding wind/seismic,
like crane gantry girders, its supporting
structure,
vibratory
screens, crushers and their
supporting
structures,
chimneys, microwave
end transmission
line towers, sub-station
and power
station
structures,
industrial
buildings and bunkers, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Group
C -
Steel structures
not subjected to dynamic loading,
like platform,
galleries, stairs,
etc, and which do not require closer tolerances as required for Group B structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this standard only Group B and Group C are covered.
The tolerances
for the erection of Group
A are not covered in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Erection tolerances
for specific structures,
such as, chimney,
towers, bunkers, etc, reference may be
made to the relevant standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is based on the experience
gathered
and the practice being followed in major steel
construction
in the country.
Erection tolerances
being specified
for major steel constructions
of
steel plants and other industries have also been kept in view.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the results of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded otf value should
be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

REQUIREMENTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Structures damaged during transport,
handl-
ing and storage, etc, shall be segregated at site,
to avoid erection
by oversight.
Such damages
shall be brought to the notice
of the owner. A
joint inspection of the damaged
structure shall
be made to decide whether
to rectify
or reject
the damaged
items.
In the
former
case the
damaged
structure
shall
be
rectified
to the
satisfaction
of the owner
before
erecting
the
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard covers
tolerances
on erection
of steel structures
of Groups B and C categories
as defined in the foreword.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 Subject to the provisions
of 1.3 and unless
otherwise specified
in approved
drawings/speci-
fications, or specified by the owner, the devia-
tions
from
true
position
in the erected steel
structures
shall not
exceed
the
tolerances
specified in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Damage to painted
surfaces
shall be made
good before erections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.3 The tolerances specified
in this standard do
not apply
to steel structures
where the devia-
tions from true positions
are intimately linked
with and
directly
influence
the technological
process.
In such cases the tolerances on erected
steel structures shall be as per recommendations
of process technologists/suppliers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 TOLERANCES
3.1 The tolerances
on deviations
in the erected
steel structures
from
true positions
shall not
exceed the values specified
in Table 1, Table 2
or Table 3 as relevant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
