<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
(  Part I  )  was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 39 November
1976, after the draft finalized
by the Hydraulic
Structures
Instrumentation
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Stress and stability
analysis
of concrete
and masonry
dams
is carried
out by considering
the existence
of uplift
across
every horizontal
plane,
having
uplift
intensity-distribution
in accordance
with the design criterion
in practice.
The effect of the uplift is to induce
instability
on account
of
resulting
buoyancy
in weight of the material
in dam above
the horizontal
section under consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Provision
of arrays
of electric
resistance
type and vibrating
wire type
pore pressure
cells
in concrete
and masonry
at different
elevations,
and
spaced at suitable
distances
from the upstream
face, would provide informa-
tion on the status of pore pressure
at the time of observation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4  Large concrete
and masonry
dams are~provided
with a row or rows of
internal
formed drains.
A record of the pore pressure development
and its
variations
would
indicate
the effectiveness
and adequacy
of these
drains.
At the same time, any sudden
and significant
variations
in the pore pressure
development
may be indicative
of some structural
damage
or deficiency
in
the dam material,
warranting
timely remedial
measures
being undertaken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.5  For measuring
the pore pressures
in the body of concrete
and masonry
dams, the following
device/instruments
are used:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Pressure
pipes; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Electrical
pressure
cells of two types, namely,
electrical
resistance
type pore
pressure
cells, and
vibrating
wire type pore
pressure
cells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5.1 Pressure
pipes
and
vibrating

pore
pressure
cells are
proposed
to be covered
in separate
standards.
This standard
covers the
electrical
resistance
type pore pressure cells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards
and practices
prevailing
in
different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field in
this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test, shall be rounded
of in ackordance
with IS:2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
(  Part I ) covers the details
of installation,
maintenance
and
observation
of resistance
type pore
pressure
measuring
devices
in
concrete and masonry
dams.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. INSTRUMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Electrical Resistance  Type Pore Pressure Cell -Resistance
type of pore
prcssurc cell utilizes the two electrical
principles,
namely,
changes in tension
in elastic wires cause change in electrical
resistance
of the wires and changes
in temperature
of wires cause
changes
in electrical
resistance
of wires.
Details of a typical pore pressure cell are shown in Fig. 1.  This instrument
has H solid  steel diaphragm
which is actuated
by the pressure
of the pore
fluid which filters through
a porous
plug.
The de5ection
of the diaphragm
is measured
by means
of a strain
meter
unit.
The
space
between
the
porous plug and the diaphragm
is filled with petroleum
jelly or water before
use so that the response
is almost
instantaneous.
The readings
are taken
bv test set working
on Wheatstone
bridge
principle
and recorded
on a
s&table data form.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. NUMBER
AND LOCATJON<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Representative
blocks
of the dam shall be selected
for the installation
of these cells.
Generally
the deepest
over5ow
and non-overflow
sections
are selected.
The cells are installed
in two or three levels in rows.
The
bottom
row of pore pressure cells may be located a little above the founda-
tion level (say about
1.5 m ) or as may be required
by the desi_pn. ~The
second row may be installed
at one-third
or half the height
of the dam.
The spacing of the ceils in each  row  may  be 10 to 15 metres along the width
of the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Prior
to the embedment
of pore
pressure
cells in the newly placed
concrete
or masonrjt,
each instrument
should be thoroughly
checked for cell
resistance
as also for the lead resistance
and these should
be entered in the
pro forma  given  in Appendis
A. The resistance
and ‘rcsistancc
ratio before
splicing and after splicin, ‘* should also be recorded
in the pro forma given in
Appendix
A which is meant for recording
pre-embcdmcnt
test results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The pore pressure
cells are usually located near the top of a lift, where
placement
can
be accomplished
after
concreting
in
the area
has been
completed.
A hole just large enough~to
accommodate
the instrument
and
about
300 mm deep should be dug at the desired location.
The cell should
be laid horizontally
in the hole,
normal
to the exterior
surface
of the
concrete
and with the porous plug at the desired distance
from the upstream
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1 Frames
or brackets
to hold the cell in position
during embedment,
should
not
be used,
since they would
possibly
provide
a lenkage
path
directly
to the cell.
Concrete
or mortar
as the case may be, should
be
placed by hand around
the instrument
and tamped
lightly
so as to obtain
contact
between the body of the cell and the surrounding
concrete/masonry.
Excessive tamping
of the concrete/masonry
shall be avoided
as this would
result
in a highly impermeable
zone around
the cell and affect the normal
build-up
of hydro-static
pressure.
After embedment,
a temporary
cover of
boards
laid over the cell locations
will afford protection
until the concrete/
mortar
has hardened.
The ends of cables attached
to the pore pressure
cells which remain uncovered
for a while until these are properly
terminated
in  a terminal
board,
shall be protected
by cable protection
caps,
This
pre-caution
is considered
necessary
with a view to prevent
moisture
and
water entering
the pore pressure cells through
the cable ends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3  Cables and Conduits<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1 The  pore pressure
cells are normally
supplied
with about 750  mm
of three
conductor
rubber
covered
cable
attached
to the instrument.
Enough
additional
three
conductor
cable
is then
added
in the field to
reach from the point where the instrument
is  embedded
to a terminal station
in the gallery.
The additional
length of cableshall
be attached
to the pore
pres$ure
cells
by
means
of
splicing
in accordance
with
the ‘Indian
Standard
Code of practice
for selection,
splicing,
installation,
and providing
protection
to the open ends of the cable used for connecting
resistance
type
measuring
devices in concrete
and masonry
dams’
(.under prepararian
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE-Till  such time the standard
under preparation
is published, the matter
shall be as agreed upon between the concerned
parties.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2 In estimating
the length
of the cable to be added,
a suitable
route
between the point of embedment
of the instrument
and the terminal
station
in the gallery should
be selected by a study of the drawings.
In selecting
the route, due consideration
shall be given to the construction
procedures
involved
in placing
the concrete/masonry
where the instrument
is to be
embedded
and to possible
obstructions
along the chosen route.
After the
selected
route has been verified
the .length
of the cable required
shall be
estimated,
and a small
amount
usually
10 percent
or 2 m, whichever
is
larger.
shall be added
to all,ow for extra
length
required
due to normal
variatiops
from
the seledted
route.
The length
of.the
cable
should
be
limited as far as possible.
In any case it shall not exceed 80 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.3 In general,
cables run horizontally
without
conduit
in the concrete
and
in conduits
in the
masone
and
run
in
downward
and
upward
directions
in conduits
both in the concrete
and the masonry.
The conduit
may
be of any material
which
will not
collapse
in the fresh concrete/
masonry.
The size of the conduit
may be chosen in accordance
with the
procedure
given  in the ‘Indian
Standard
Code of practice
for selection,
splicing,
installation,
and providing
protection
to the open ends of the cable
used for connecting
resistance
type
measuring
devices
in concrete
and
masonry
dams’
( z&er  preparation
) ( see  Note untieer  4.3.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4  If the cable leads are to cross, contraction
joints
in the structure,
a
slack cable recess shall be provided
at the crossing point.
This may consist
of a wooden
box block out, forming
a recess into which the cable is run.
During
placement
of concrete/masonry
in the adjacent
block,
a 300 mm
loop of slack cable shall be left in the unfilled block
out and the remaining
length of cable laid in theusual
manner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.5 Cables should
be threaded
individually
into
the conduit,
so that
each cable will be required
to  support  only its own weight.
At the entrance
of the cables into the conduit
suitable
protection,
such as padding
with
burlap,
should be provided
around
each cable and in the interstices
between
the cables to prevent
sharp bends and to prevent the entrance
of concrete,’
mortar and grout  into the conduit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 8282 ( Part I ) - 1976<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>43.6
Where a group of cables is to be run horizontally
in a concrete
lift,
they may be taped  together
at intervals
and laid on the top of the last abut
one layer -of concrete
in the lift, covered
with
pads
of fresh
concrete/
mortar
at several
points
along
their
length,
and
placement
of the final
concrete
lift layer allowed to proceed
in the normal
manner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>43.7
The layout
should be so planned
that cells and terminal
boards are
in the same block as far as possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.8 In cases where a number
of cables from widely-separated
points are
collected
at one central
point
and run downward
into a conduit,
a very
successful
plan
is to run
the cable
in two steps.
A collecting
box or
concrete
form is erected around
the grouped
conduits
so that the lifr is left
about 450 mm low at the conduits.
During
the placement
of the concrete
in which
the
cells
are
embedded,
the
cables
are
brought
horizon-
tally to the collection
point
and there
coiled
and hung
out of the fresh
concrete.
As soon
as the concrete
has set sufficiently
to bear traffic,
the cable -coils
are
taken
down
the
conduit
to the
terminal
boards.
The advantages
are that it  is much  easier to sort and run cables when they
are  not muddled
with fresh concrete/mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4  Identification of Cables and Cells -
Each cell should
be identified
by a
letter prefix designating
the type of instrument
and numbered
consequently.
The normal
prefix used  for pore pressure cells is  PP.
When the cable lead
is coilnected
to a-cell, -an identification
band  with the instrument
identifica-
tion. number
stamped
or punched
on it is crimped
to the cable about
900 mm from the cell and a similar
band crimped
about
300 mm from the
free end of the cable.
In addition
a few more markers,
consisting
of the
identification
number
marked
on white
tape and covered
with linen
zind
friction tape, should be  placed around
the cable near the reading end.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Terminal Boards<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1  Location
of Terminal Boards -
Permanent
facilities
for
making
readings
are provided
in terminal
recess usually
located
in blockouts
on
walls of galleries
nearest
to the instruments.
The reading
stations
for all
embedded
instruments
in a monolith
should
be located
in that monolith
if
possible,
in order
to avoid
runnin, 0 cable
leads across contraction
joints.
Separate
terminal
recesses
for cable
leads from different
types
of instru-
ments are not required.
Where a gallery or similar semi-protected
locaticn
is  not-available,
a conveniently
accessible
exterior
location
may be selected,
and the facilities
secured against unauthorized
tampering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.2  Lighting -
Normal
gallery
lighting
is usually
not adequate
and a
supplementary
fixture
for lighting
should
be provided
at the terminal
reading
station.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.53
Moisture
Prevention -
To reduce
corrosion
at the cable terminals
and panel board connections,
usually

installed
within
the terminal
recess.
A bulb
provided
in the recess for
lighting may also serve this purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.4  Installing
Terminal
Equipment -
After
all cable
leads
have been
brought
into a terminal
recess the surplus
lengths
of cables should
be cut
off and the end of individual
conductors
prepared
for permanent
connection
to the panel board
or terminal

Proper
care
shall
be taken
for
identification
of the cables and cells ( see 4.4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of
significant pore pressures, the cell will not respond reliably IO negative pressures, and all entries in co1 9 will
represent
pore pressures above the oil pressure  in the  cell chamber which will be approximately
