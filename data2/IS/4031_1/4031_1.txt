<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by Cement and Concrete Sectional Committee had been approved by Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Standard methods of testing cement are essential adjunct to the cement specifications.
This standard in
different parts lays down the procedure for the tests to evaluate physical properties of different types.
of hydraulic cements.
The procedure for conducting chemical tests of hydraulic cement is covered in
IS 4032  :  1985 ‘Methods of chemical analysis of hydraulic cement ( first revision )‘. Originally all the
tests to evaluate the physical properties of hydraulic cement were covered in one standard but for facilitating
the use of this standard and future revisions, the revised standard was brought out in different parts, each
part covering different tests. This part covers determination of fineness of cement by dry sieving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The second revision of this standard has been prepared with a view to align this test method with European
S!andard EN 196 (Part 6) Method of testing cements: Determination of fineness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given at Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised
)‘.
The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and a lid fitting above it shall be provided to avoid
loss of material during sieving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 The samples of the cement  shall  be  taken according
to the requirements of IS 3535:1986 (see 2.1) and
the relevant standard specification for the type of
cement being tested. The representative sample of
the cement selected as above shall be thoroughly mixed
before testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 Procedure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1  Determination
of the Cement Residue<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Agitate the sample of cement to be tested by shaking
for 2 min in a stoppered jar to disperse agglomerates.
Wait 2 min. Stir the resulting powder gently using  a
clean dry rod in order to distribute the fines throughout
the cement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 SIEVING METHOD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Principle<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fineness of cement is measured by sieving it on
standard sieve. The proportion of cement of which
the grain sizes are larger than the specified mesh size
is thus determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fit the tray under the sieve, weigh approximately 10  g
of cement to the nearest 0.01 g and place it on the
sieve, being careful to avoid loss.
Disperse any
agglomerates. Fit the lid over the sieve. Agitate the
sieve by swirling, planetary and linear movement until
no more fine material passes through it. Remove and
weigh the residue. Express its mass as a percentage,
R,, of the quantity first placed in the sieve to the nearest
0.1 percent. Gently brush all the fine material off the
base of the sieve into the tray.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A reference sample having a known proportion of
material coarser than the specified mesh size is used
for checking the specified sieve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS  4031 (Part 1) : 1996<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>repeat determination of residue to yield two values p,
and P, expressed to the nearest 0.1 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to obtain 5. Then calculate the residue of the cement
R as the mean of R, and R, as a percentage, expressed
to the nearest 0.1 percent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The two values of P, and P, for a satisfactory sieve
should differ by not more than 0.3 percent. Their mean
P  characterizes the state of the sieve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the results differ by more than 1 percent
absolute, carry out a third sieving and calculate the
mean of the three values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Given the known residue on the 90 m mesh of the
reference material, R, calculate R/P as the sieve
factor, F, expressed to the nearest 0.0 1. The residue,
R, determined
as in 4.4.1 shall be corrected by
multiplying by F, which may have a value of 1.00 +
0.20<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sieving process is carried out manually by a skilled
and experienced operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - Alternatively a sieving machine may be
used provided that it can be shown to give the same
results as the manual operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Check the sieve after every 100 sievings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.2  Checking
the Sieve<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - Any other checking procedure, such as the optical
methods described in IS 460 ( Part 3 )  :  1985 may be used. All
sieves will wear slowly and consequently their sieve factor, F,
will slowly change.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Agitate the sample of cemem LO be tested by shaking
for 2 min in a stoppered jar to disperse agglomerates.
Wait 2 min. Stir the resulting powder gently using a
clean dry rod in order to distribute the fines throughout

g of the reference material to the nearest 0.01 g and
place it in the sieve, being careful to avoid loss. Carry
out the sieving procedure as in 4.4.1 including the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
