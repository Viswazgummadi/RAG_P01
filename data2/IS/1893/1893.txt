FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard. ( Fourth Revision)
was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 16 November
1981, after the draft finalized by
the Earthquake
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by
the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Himalayan-Nagalushai
region,
Indo-Gangetic
plain, Western
India,
Kutch and Kathiawar
regions are geologically
unstable parts of the coun-
try and some devastating earthquakes
of the world have occurred there. A
major part of the peninsular India has also been visited by strong earth-
quakes, but these were relatively
few in number and had considerably
lesser intensity.
The earthquake resistant design of structures taking into
account seismic data from studies of these Indian
earthquakes has become
very essential,. particularly in view of the heavy construction programme at
present all over the country. It is to serve this purpose that IS  :  1893-1962
‘Recommendations
for earthquake
resistant design of structures’ was pub-
lished and subsequently revised in 1966.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 As a result of additional seismic data collected in India and further
knowledge and experience gained since the publication of the first revision
of this standard, the Sectional Committee felt the need to revise
the stan-
dard again incorporating
many changes, such as revision of maps showing
seismic zones and epicentres, adding a more rational
approach
for design
of buildings and substructure of bridges,
etc. These were covered in the
second revision of IS  :  1893 brought out in 1970.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.2
As a result of the increased
use of the standard,
considerable
amount of suggestions were received for modifying some of the provisions
of the standard and, therefore, third revision of the standard was brought
out in 1975.
The
following
changes
were incorporated
in the
third
revision:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS: 1893 - 1984<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The standard
incorporated
seismic zone factors
( previously
given
as multiplying
factors in the second revision
) on a more rational
basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Importance
factors
were introduced
to account
for the varying
degrees
of importance
for various
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the clauses for design of multi-storeyed
building
the coefficient
of flexibility
was given in the form of a curve
with respect
to
period
of buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>4
e><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A more rational
formula was used to combine
modal shears.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>New clauses were introduced
for determination
of hydrodynamic
pressures
in elevated
tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Clauses on concrete
and masonry
dams were modified,
taking into
account
their dynamic
behaviour
during
earthquakes.
Simplified
formulae
for design
forces
were introduced
based
on results of
extensive
studies carried
out since second revision of the standard
was published.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The fourth revision
has been
prepared
to modify some of the provi-
sions of the standard
as a result of experience
gained
with
the use of this
standard.
In this revision
a number
of Important
basic
modifications
with
respect
to load factors,
field values of N, base shear and modal
analysis
have been introduced.
A new concept
of performance
factor depending
on
the structural
framing
system
and brittleness
or ductility
of construction
has been incorporated.
Figure
2 for average
acceleration
spectra has also
been
modified
and
a
curve
for
zero
percent
damping
has
been
incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 It is not intended
in this standard
to lay down regulations
so that no
structure
shall suffer any damage
during earthquake
of all magnitudes.
It
has been endeavoured
to ensure that, as far as possible,
structures
are able
to respond,
without
structural
damage
to shocks
of moderate
intensities
and without
total collapse to shocks of heavy intensities.
While this
stan-
dard is intended
for earthquake
resistant
design of normal
structures,
it has
to be emphasized
that in the case of special structures detailed investigation
should be undertaken,
unless otherwise
specified
in the relevant
clauses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1
Though
the basis for the design
of different
types of structures
is
covered in this standard,
it is not implied
that detailed
dynamic
analysis
should be made in every case. There
might be cases of less importance
and
relatively
small structures
for which
no analysis
need
be made,
provided
certain
simple
precautions
are taken
in the construction.
For example,
suitably
proportioned
diagonal
bracings
in the vertical panels
of steel and
concrete
structures
add to the resistance
of frames to withstand
earthquake
forces.
Similarly
in
highly
seismic
areas,
construction
of a type which<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1893 - 1984<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>entails
heavy
debris
and
consequent
loss of life and property,
such as
masonry,
particularly
mud masonry
and rubble
masonry,
should be avoi-
ded in preference
to construction
of a type which is known
to withstand
seismic
eflects
better,
such as construction
in light weight materials
and
well braced
timber-framed
structures.
For guidance
on piecautions
to be
observed
in
the
construction
of
buildings,
reference
may
be
made
to IS  :  4326-1976*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Attention
is particularly
drawn
to the fact that the intensity
of shock
due to an earthquake
could greatly vary locally
at any ~given place due to
variation
in the soil conditions.
Earthquake
forces would be affected
by
different
types of foundation
system in addition
to variation
of ground
motion due to various types of soils. Considering
the effects in a gross man-
ner, the standard
gives guidelines
for arriving at design seismic coefficients
based on type of soil and foundation
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 Earthquakes
can cause damage
not only on account
of the shaking
which results from them but also due to other chain effects like landslides,
floods, fires
and disruption
to communication.
It is, therefore,
important
to take necessary
precautions
in the design of structures
so that they are
safe against such secondary
effects also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 It is important
to note that the seismic
coeficient,
used in ihe design
of any structure,
is dependent
on many variable
factors
and it is an extre-
mely dificult
task to determine
the exact seismic
coefficient
in each given
case. Tt is, therefore,
necessary
to indicate
broadly
the seismic
coeficients
that could generally
be adopted in different
parts or zones or the country
though,
of course, a rigorous analysis
considering
all the factors
involved
has got to be made in the case of all important
projects in order
to arrive
at suitable
seismic coefficients
for design. The Sectional
Committee
respon-
sible for the formulation
of this standard
has attempted
to include
a seis-
mic zoning map ( see Fig.
1 ) for this purpose. The object of this map is to
classify the area of the country
into a number
of zones in which one may
reasonably
expect earthquake
shock of more or less same intensity in future.
The
Modified
Mercalli
Intensity
( see 2.7 ) broadly
associated
with the
various zones is V or less, VI, VII,
VIII
and 1X and above
for zones I,
II, III,
IV and V respectively.
The maximum
seismic ground acceleration
in each
zone cannot
be presently
predicted
with accuracy
either
on
a
deterministic
or on a probabilistic
basis.
The
design
value
chosen
for
a
particular
structure is obtained
by multiplying
the basic
horizontal
seismic
coefficient
for that zone, given in Table
2, by an appropriate
Importance
Factor
as suggested in Table
4. Higher
value of importance
factor is usually
adopted for those structures,
consequences
of failure of which,
are serious.
However,
even with an importance
factor of unity,
the probability
is that<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS t 1893 - 1984<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a structure which is properly designed and detailed according to good con-
struction practice, will not suffer serious damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is pointed out that structures will normally experience more severe
ground motion than the one envisaged in the seismic coefficient specified
in this standard. However, in view of the energy absorbing capacity avail-
able
in inelastic range, ductile structures will be able to resist such shocks
without much damage.
It is, therefore,
necessary that ductility must be
built into the structures
since brittle
structures
will be damaged
more
extensively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7.1
The Sectional Committee has appreciated that there cannot be. an
entirely scientific basis for zoning in view of the scanty data available.
Though the magnitudes of different earthquakes
which have occurred in
the past are known to a reasonabIe amount of accuracy,
the intensities
of
the shocks caused by these earthquakes have so far been mostly estimated
by damage surveys and there is little instrumental
evidence to corroborate
the conclusions arrived at. Maximum
intensity
at different places can be
fixed on a scale only on the basis of the observations
made and recorded
after the earthquake
and thus a zoning map which is based on the maxi-
mum intensities arrived at, is likely to lead in some cases to an incorrect
conclusion in the view of (a) incorrectness
in the assessment of intensities,
ib) human error in judgement
during the damage survey, and (c) varia-
tion in quality and design of structures
causing
variation
in type and
extent of damage to the structures for the same intensity
of shock.
The
Sectional Committee has, therefore, considered that a rational
approach to
the problem would be to arrive at a zoning map based on known magni-
tudes and’ the known epicentres (see Appendix A) assuming all other condi-
tions as being average,
and to modify such an average idealized isoseismal
map in the light of tectonics ( see Appendix B ), lithology ( see Appendix C)
and the maximum intensities as recorded from
damage surveys,
etc. The
Committee has also reviewed such a map in the light of past history and
future possibilities and also attempted
to draw the lines demarcating
the
different zones so as to be clear of important
towns, cities and industrial
areas, after making special examination
of such cases, as a little modifica-
tion in the zonal demarcations
may mean considerable
difference
to the
economics of a project in that area. Maps shown in Fig. 1 and Appendices
A, B and C are prepared based on information available up to 1986.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.8 In the formulation of this standard due weightage

PRINCIPLES
AND DESIGN
CRITERIA<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 General
Principles<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1
Earthquakes
cause random
motion
of ground
which can be
resol-
ved in any three mutually
perpendicular
directions.
This motion
causes the
structure
to vibrate.
The
vibration
intensity
of ground
expected
at
any
location
depends upon the magnitude
of earthquake,
the depth of focus,
distance
from the epicentre
and the strata
on which
the structure
stands.
The
predominant
direction
of vibration
is horizontal.
Relevant
combina-
tions of forces
applicable
for design
of a particular
structure
have been
specified
in the relevant
clauses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2
The response of the structure
to the ground vibration
is a function
of the nature
of foundation
soil; materials,
form, size and mode of construc-
tion
of the struture;
and the duration
and the intensity
of ground
motion.
This standard
specifies design seismic coefficient
for structures
standing
on
soils or rocks which
will not settle
or slide due to Ioss of strength
during
vibrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:1893
- 1984<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3
The seismic coefficients recommended
in this standard
are based
on design practice conventionally
followed and performance
of structures
in past earthquakes,
It is well understood
that the forces which structures
would be subjected to in actual earthquakes,
would be very much larger
than specified in this sta.ndard as basic seismic coefficient.
In order to take
care of this gap, for special cases importance factor and performance factor
( where necessary ) are specified in this standard elsewhere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.4
In the case of structures designed for horizontal seismic force only,
it shall be considered to act in any one direction
at a time. Where both
horizontal
and vertical
seismic forces are taken into account,
horizontal
force in any one direction
at a time may be considered simultaneously with
the vertical force as specified in 3.4.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.5
The vertical
seismic coefficient shall be considered in the case of
structures in which stability is a criterion of design or, for overall stability,
analysis of structures except as otherwise stated in the relevant
clauses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.6
Equipment and systems supported at various floor levels of struc-
tures will be subjected
to motions
corresponding
to vibrations at their
support points. In important
cases, it may be necessary
to obtain floor
response spectra for design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>3.2  Assumptions
-
The following assumptions shall be made
in the
earthquake resistant design of structures:
a><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Earthquake
causes impulsive ground motion
which
is complex
and irregular in character,
changing in period and amplitude each
lasting for small duration.
‘Therefore,
resonance
of the type as
visualized under steady state sinusoidal excitations
will not occur
as it would need time to build up such amplitudes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>b)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Earthquake
is not likely to occur simultaneously
with wind or
maximum flood or maximum sea waves.
The value of elastic modulus of materials, wherever required, may
be taken as for static analysis unless a more definite value is avail-
able for use in such condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in
Material
Stresses
-
Whenever
earthquake
forces are considered along with other normal design forces, the permissi-
ble stresses in materials, in the elastic method of design, may be increased
by one-third.
However, for steels having a definite yield stress, the stress
be limited to the yield stress; for steels without a definite yield point, the
will stress will be limited to 80 percent of the ultimate strength or 0.2 per-
cent proof stress whichever
is smaller
and that in prestressed concrete
members,
the tensile
stress in the extreme
fibres of the concrete may be
permitted so as not to exceed 213 of the modulus of rupture of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Load Factors -
Whenever earthquake
forces are considered along
with other normal design forces, the following factors may be adopted:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For ultimate load design of steel structures:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>UL = 1*4(DL+LL+EL)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>DL =  the dead load of the structure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>LL =  the superimposed load on the structure

be as given in the relevant clauses of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE I.--  The members of reinforced

Further,
it should be suitably designed so
that premature

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The
increased
seismic
coefficients specified in 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 are for
designing
the projecting

normal
pro.portions.
In
the case of the elevated structures of unusual
proportions, more detailed studies shall be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Elevated Tower-Supported
Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  For the purpose of this analysis,
elevated tanks shall be regarded
as systems with a single degree of freedom with their mass concentrated
at their centres of gravity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 The damping in the system may be assumed as 2 percent of the
critical

structures
and 5 percent
of the critical

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4
The design shall be worked out both when the tank is full and
when empty. When empty, the weight  W  used in the design ( see 5.2.3 )
shall consist of the dead load of the tank and one-third
the weight of the
staging. When full, the weight of contents is to be added to the weight
under empty condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5
Using the period T as calculated in 5.2.3 and appropriate damp-
ing, the spectral acceleration

of the foundation

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1.2  Efict
of vertical earthquake
acceleration
-
The effect of vertical
earthquake
acceleration
is to change the unit weight of water and concrete
or masonry.
An accrlrration
upwards increases the weight and an accele-
ration downwards decrcascs
the weight. To consider the effect of vertical
earthquake
acceleration,
the vertical
seismic coefficient
would
be
as
follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  For seismic coeficient
method of design -
At the top of the dams it
would be 0’75 times the ah value given in 3.4.2.3
(a) and reducing
linearly to zero at the base.
b)  For response spectrum method of design -
At the top of the dam it
would be 0.75 times the value of c(h given in 7.3.1.1
(b) (2) and
reducing linearly to zero at the base.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1.3
Effect of earthquake
acceleration
on upl;ft forces
-
Effect of earth-
quake acceleration
on uplift forces at any horizontal section is determined
as a function of the hydrostatic pressure of reservoir and tail-water
against
the faces of the dam.
During an earthquake the water pressure  is  changed
by the hydrodynamic effect. However, the change is not considered effec-
tive in producing a corresponding increase or reduction in the uplift force.
The duration of the earthquake
is too short to permit the building up of
pore pressure in the concrete and rock foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1.4
Effect of earthquake
acceleration
on dead silt loads -
It is sufficient
to determine the increase in the silt pressure due to earthquake
by con-
sidering hydrodynamic
forces on the water up to the base of the dam and
ignoring the weight of the silt.
7.3.2
Earthquake
Forces for
Ouerjow
Sections -
The
provisions for the
dam as given in 7.3.1 to 7.3.1.4 will be applicable to over-flow sections as
well. In this case, the height of the dam shall be taken from the base of
the dam to the top of the spillway bridge for computing the period as well
as shears and moments in the body of the dam. However, for the design
of the bridge and the piers, the horizontal
seismic coefficients
in either
direction may be taken as the design seismic coefficient
for the top of the
dam worked out in 7.3.1
and applied uniformly along the height of the
pier.
7.4 Earth
and Rockfill Dams and Embankments
7.4.1  General -
It is recognized
that an earth
dam or embankment
vibrates when subjected to ground motion during an earthquake requiring
thereby a dynamic analysis of the structure for its design. Nevertheless,
currently
accepted design procedure
is based on the assumption that the
portion of the dam above
the rupture surface is rigid.
Therefore,
the
method given in 7.4.2
which assumes additional
horizontal
and vertical
loads on the soil mass within the rupture surface shall be adopted.
It is,
however,
desirable
to carry
out dynamic
analysis
for final
design
of
important
dams in order to estimate deformations in dams in probable
future earthquakes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The procedure
for finding out the seismic coefhcient
which
will depend upon the height
of the dam and the lowest point of the
rupture surface shall be as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Determine
the fundamental
period
of the structure
from the
formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>T = fundamental period of the earth dam in s,
Ht = height of the dam above toe of the slopes,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P  = mass density of the shell material,
and
G = modulus of rigidity of the shell material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  -  The  quantity
+fGT.  p IS  the shear wave
velocity through the mate-
rial of the dam and may be used if known instead of p and G.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Determine
S,/g for this period T and 10 percent damping from
average
acceleration
spectrum curves given in Fig. 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Compute design seismic coefficient ah using 3.4.2.3
(b).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.2.2
For checking
slope failure
with the
lowest point of the
rupture surface at any depth y below top of dam, the value of equivalent
uniform seismic coefficient
shall be taken as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H =  total height of the dam.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.3
Stability of the Upstream Slope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.3.1
The stability of the upstream slope of an earth or rockfill dam
shall be tested with full reservoir level with horizontal
forces due to earth-
quake acting in upstream direction and vertical forces due to earthquake
( taken as one half of horizontal
) acting upwards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.3.2
For preliminary
design, a factor of safety of unity shall be
accepted
as being adequate
for ensuring stability of upstream slope. The
factor of safety need be tested only for failure surface which passes through
the lower half of the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>SPECTRA
OF EARTHQUAKE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F-l. GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-l.1
Spectrum
of an earthquake
is the representation
of the maximum
dynamic
response
of idealized
structures
during an earthquake.
The idea-
lized structure
is a single degree
of freedom
system having a certain period
of vibration
and damping.
The maximum
response
is plotted
against
the
natural
period
of vibration
and can be expressed
in terms of maximum
absolute
acceleration,
maximum
relative
velocity
or maximum
relative
dis-
placement,
For the purpose of design,
acceleration
spectra
are very useful,
as they give the seismic force on a structure
directly
by multiplying
it with
the generalized
or modal mass of the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-2.
AVERAGE
SPECTRA<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-2.1
Prof. G. W. Housner
has proposed
average
spectra
on
the basis of
studies on response
spectra of four strongest
earthquakes
that have occurred
in USA
( see Fig. 2 which shows the average
acceleration
spectra
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-2.2
To
take
into account
the seismicity
of the various
zones, the ordi-
nate of the average
spectra are to be multiplied
by a factor  F,.  This factor
F.  depends
on the magnitude,
duration
and form of the expected
earth-
quake,
distance
of the site from
expected
epicentre,
soil conditions
and
resistance
deformation
characteristics
of the structure,
etc.
For
elastic
design with permissible
increase
in stresses or load
factors
as given in 3.3,
approximate
values of this factor
are given in Table
2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
It may be pointed out that during the expected
maximum
intensity
of
earthquake in the various seismic zones, structures will be subjected to a bigger force.
But the capacity
of the structure
in plastic range will be available
for absorbing the
kinetic energy imparted by the earthquake.
Therefore,
the structural
details are to
be worked out in such a manner that it can undergo sufficient plastic
deformations
before failure [see 1.2 and3.3.2

<<HEADING level=3>>F-3. DAMPING
IN STRUCTURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-3.1  The variety
of damping
displayed
in different
types of structures
has
made
the choice
of a suitable
damping
coefficient
for a given structure
largely
a matter
of judgement.
However,
some values are given below to
indicate
the order of damping
coefficient
in various types of structures:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
It may be mentioned here that in the elastic range, damping displayed
by structures is much lower than that given above.
It may lie between 1 and 4 per-
cent for the above type of structures
at low stresses.
The values given thus presume
some inelastic deformations
or fine cracking to take place when this order of damp-
ing will occur.
However,
for obtaining design seismic coefficient, the values of damp-
ing mentioned
in relevant
clauses shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

METHOD
OF USING
THE
SPECTRA<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-4.1
Let the period
of a structure
be 0.8 second and the damping
5 per-
cent
critical.
Further
let the
soil-foundation
system
give factor,
B =
1.2
and
let
the
structure
have
an importance
factor,
I =
1.5. Referring
to
Fig. 2, the spectral
acceleration,
S, is O-12 g.
If
the
structure
has
mass
M=
12.0 kg sets/cm
and is to be located
in Zone V, the design horizon-
tal seismic coefficient
ah would be [ see 3.4.2.3
