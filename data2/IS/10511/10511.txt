FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution on 25 February
1983, after the draft finalized by the Bitumen
and Tar Products Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council
and the Petroleum,
Coal
and Related
Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A series of Indian Standards have been published on methods of tests
for testing tar and bituminous
materials.
This standard
is one in the
series which covers the method for determination
of asphaltenes content
in bitumen by precipitation
with normal heptane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordinationamong
the standards
and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating
it to the practices
in the
field in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
covers
the
method
of
test

of
asphaltenes content in bitumen by precipitation
with normal heptane.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard, the following definition in addition
to those given in IS  :  334-1982t
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Asphaltene
Content
-
The
asphaltene
content
of bitumen
is the
percentage
by mass of wax
free
material
insoluble
in n-heptane,
but
soluble in hot benzene
or toluene.
The material
is dissolved
in n-heptane
and the insoluble
material
consisting
of asphaltenes
and waxy substances
is separated
by filtration
through
a fine filter paper.
The waxy consti-
tuents are extracted
under
hot reflux with n-heptane,
and the asphaltenes
are isolated
by extraction
with benzene
or toluene.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Extraction
Apparatus
-
Extraction
apparatus
shall
consist
of an
efficient
condenser
that
is, condenser
with a coil or
double
surface,
a
reflux
extractor
of
the
type
illustrated
in Fig.
1, and
a conical
fiask.
Ground
glass joints
are to be preferred
throughout.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Remove the flask and contents from reflux, cool, close with
a ground glass stopper and store in a dark cupboard
for I+ to 24 hours
calculated
from time of removal from the reflux.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2
Without
agitation,
decant
the liquid
through
a filter
paper
such as Number
42 Whatman
filter paper, of fine porosity and of 11’0
or 12.5 cm diameter, folded as illustrated
in Fig. 2 so as to prevent loss of
asphaltenes by creeping.
Transfer the residue in the flask, as completely
as possible, to the filter paper with successive
quantities of hot n-heptane,
using a glass
rod, if necessary.
Give
the flask a final rinse with hot
n-heptane and pour the rinsings through the filter.
Set the flask aside
for use, as described in 5.3.4 without ,washing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.3 Remove the filter paper and contents from the funnel and place
in the extractor.
Using another clean flask, reflux with n-heptane at a
rate of 2-4 drops/set from the end of the condenser
for an extraction
period of not less than one hour, or until a few drops of n-heptane from
the bottom of the extractor
leave no residue on evaporation
on a glass
slide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.4 Replace
the flask with the one set aside as described
in 5.3.2,
add 30-60 ml of benzene or toluene and continue refluxing
until all the
asphaltenes have been dissolved from the paper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  PRECAUTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Since asphaitenes are very susceptible to oxidation, it is recommended
that  the procedure specified in the final drying stage be followed strictly,
regarding temperature
and time.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Benzene is a highly toxic, volatile hydrocarbon
which is absorbed
by
inhaling the vapour or through the skin by contact with the liquid.
Use
under extraction
ventilation,
avoid
skin contact
and wear
approved
protective gloves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

AND REPORTING<<HEADING_END>>
