<<PARAGRAPH>>0.
FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(First
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 June
1972,
after
the draft finalized
by
the
Stones Sectional’
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Natural
building
stones used in steps, floorings and pavements
of build-
ings are subject
to heavy wear and friction.
Their
durability
under
such
circumstances
can be ensured only when
they have adequate
hardness
or
abrasive
resistance.
This standard
gives a laboratory
method for ascertain-
ing abrasive
values
of stones
intended
for such uses.
This standard
was
first published
in 1960 and is being revised to include such abradants
which
are indigenously
available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in thr ‘ield
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is
complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
offin
accord-
ance with IS :.2-1960*.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded
off value
should
be
the
same
as that
of the
specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
lays down the procedure
for determination
of abrasion
resistance
( wear resistance
) of natural
building
stones.<<HEADING_END>>

followed
by finishing
with
grinding
wheels.
The
use of chisel
and hammer
shall
be avoided.
All
the faces of the specimen
shall be made

by sakv cutting
and grinding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2
Not less than two test pieces shall be used for conducting
the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  ABRADANT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  The abradants
for test shall be emery natural
or emery
synthetic,
grit
size 80 and
shall
conform
to
IS  :  3178-1965*.
The
minimum
hardness

<<HEADING level=3>>4.  APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Abrasion
Testing
Machine
-
The
abrasion
of specimens
shall
be
carried
out in a machine
conforming
essentially
to the requirements
des-
cribed
in Appendix
A.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Measuring
Instrument
-
A  suitable
instrument
capable
of measur-
ing to an accuracy
of 0.01 mm shall be used for dctermiuing
the
change
in the thickness
of the specimen
after abrasion.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The a?rangement
for measurement
of thickness
with the instrument
may
be
as given
in Fig. 1.
Shoulders
A  and B are at right
angles
and the baqe C is machined
at top to an accuracy
of 0.01 mm.
The test specimen
shall be placed
on the base with
its wearing
surface
uppermost
and sides in contact
with the shoulders.
The
measuring
instrument
(or  dial
gauge)
shall
be set up firmly so that the contactor
slightly
presses
on the surface
of the specimen
and the reading
of the instrument
taken.
The
position
of the dial gnugc
and the setting
of the contactor
shall
be the same
during
the subse-
quent
measurement
after abrasion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  TEST PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The specimens
shall be dried at 110°C for 24 h and tllen weighed
to
the nearest
0.1 g.
The
specimen
after initial drying and
weighing
shall
be placed
in the thickness measuring
apparatus
( see 4-2 ) with its wearing
surface
uppermost,
and the reading
of the measuring
instrument
taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The grinding
path of the disc of the abrasion
testing
machine
(see
Appendix
A ) shall be evenly
strclvn
with
20 g of the abrasive
powder.
The specimen
shall then bc fixed in the holding
device with the surface
to
be ground

ARRANGEMENT FOR MEASUREMENT OF THICKNESS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>grinding
disc shall then be put in motion
at a speed of 30 rev/min.
After
every 22 revolutions,
the disc shall be stopped,
the abraded
stone
powder
and the remainder
of the abrasive
powder shall be removed
from the~disc
and fresh abrasive
powder in quantities
of 20 g applied
each
time.
After
110
revolutions,
the
specimen
shall
be
turned
about
the vertical
axis
through
an angle of 90” and then the test continued
under the same condi-
tions until 220
revolutions
have been completed
altogether.
The disc, the
abrasive
powder
and
the specimen
shall
be
kept
dry
throughout
the
duration
of the
test.
After
the
abrasion
is over, the specimen
shall be
reweighed
to the nearest 0.1 g.
It shall
then
be placed
in the thickness-
measuring
apparatus
once again in the same manner
and the reading taken
with the same position
and setting of the dial gauge as for the measurement
before abrasion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2
Determination
of Wear -
The
wear shall be determined
from
the
difference
in readings
obtained
by the measuring
instrument
before
and
after
the abrasion
of the specimen.
The value shall be checked
up with
the average
loss in thickness
of the specimen
obtained
by the following
formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t  =I()

device consisting
essentially
of a horizontally
fixed smooth
grinding
disc of about

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2. GRINDING
PATH<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1
Cast
iron
shall
be
used
as material
for the grinding
path.
Its
scaleroscope
hardness
shall lie between
30 and 50.
This hardness
shall be
ascertained
at least 10 times on the rim and at several points in the grind-
ing path by means of a Shore’s
scaleroscope
with diamond
hammer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2
The
grinding
path
shall
be a 200-mm
wide annular
space
on the
grinding
disc between
distances
of 120 and 320 mm from the centre.
The
grinding
path shall be repaired
and restored when it has worn out by more
than 0.5 mm after use or when the furrows formed in it exceed
0.2 mm in
depth.
When
the grinding
path
is restored,
its hardness
shall
be deter-
mined afresh, when irreparable
it shall be changed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.
ROTATION
OF
DISC<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1
The
disc shall be driven at 30 -& 1 rev/ min.
There
shail be auto-
matic
mechanisms
for counting,
indicating
the revolutions
of the disc and
for stopping
the disc after every 22 revolutions.
Such mechanisms
shall be
checked
for reliability
prior to the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.
HOLDING
DEVICE
FOR
TEST
SPECIMEN<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.1
The holding device shall consist of an open square frame made of cast
iron or steel; it shall be of suitable
height,
with its lower edge about
5 mm
above
the surface of the grinding
disc and so positioned
that ‘centrc
of the
specimen
is at a distance
of 220 mm from the centrc
of the disc.
It shall
necessarily,
but loosely, hold the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.
LOADING
DEVICE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.1
The loading
may be applied directly
or through
a lever device.
The
short
arm
of the lever shall be provided
with a counterweight
just
to
balance
the wejght
of the iong arm and of the weighing
disc, so that
the
pressure  stamp Just  touches
the specimen
prior to the loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.2
The
lever shall move freely about the fulcrum
without
appreciable
friction.
During
test, the lever shall remain
nearly parallel
to the upper
surface
of the disc. The connection
of the pressure stamp to the lever shall
be through
a self-aligning
joint
permitting
free relative
movement
but at
the same time ensuring
a central load on the specimen
being tested,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.3
Suitable
loading
weight shall be applied at the end of the long arm
of the lever
SO  that,
as magnified
by the leverage,
a net load of 30 kg is
applied
through
the pressure stamp on to the specimen.
The load shall be
applied
with a permissible
deviation
of one percent.
The accuracy
of the
load shall be verified both by calculation
and by measurement
with suita-
ble instruments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
