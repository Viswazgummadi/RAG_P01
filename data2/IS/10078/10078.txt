FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 28 January 1982, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Indian Standards
Institution
has already published a series of
standards
on
methods
of testing cement and concrete.
It has been
recognized that reproducible and repeatable
test results can be obtained
only with standard testing equipment capable of giving the desired level of
accuracy.
The Sectional Committee,
therefore,
decided to bring  out
a
series of specifications covering the requirements
of equipment
used for
testing cement and concrete, to encourage
their development
and manu-
facture in the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Accordingly, this standard has been prepared to cover requirements
of
jolting apparatus required for moulding of the test specimens for the test
for determination
of transverse
strength of plastic
mortar.
Use of this
apparatus is covered in IS  :  4031-1968*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard, due weightage has been given to
international co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the &field
in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS : 2-1960f.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The table shall be machined and shall have on the under-
side a projecting lug with plane face hardened.
At the end, a cam follower
shall be fixed.

conveys the assurance that they have been produced to comply with the requirements
of that standard
under a well-defined system of inspection,
testing and quality control
which is devised and supervised by IS1 and operated by the producer.
IS1 marked
products are also continuously
checked by ISI for conformity
