<<PARAGRAPH>>O.FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part 6 ) was adopted by the Indian Standards
Institution on 18 April 1983, after the draft finalized by the Safety in
Construction, Operation and Maintenance of River Valley Projects Sectional
Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With large scale increase in construction
activity on river valley pro-
jects involving hazardous construction
jobs, there has been an increase
in the number of accidents, both major and minor ones. Further, increased
construction
activity
in the underground
jobs has created health hazards
for the persons working
under such conditions.
In order to minimize
such accidents and health hazards, it shall be the overall responsibility of
the project authorities
and contractors
to provide necessary measures for
the safety and health protection of all employees working on the projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 It shall be the responsibility of the employer, that is government
or
contractor,
to initiate
and maintain
such programmes
in respect of their
employees working on a project scheme.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Each employer/department,
contractor and employee shall comply with
the different safety regulations in force on a project and shall be alert at
all times to eliminate hazards to himself/herself and/or to others.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

inspected to ensure that footings of
sills under every post of centering are sound, the centering panels are plumb
in both directions and all cross braces are securely in place.
.
8.10 Daring pourmg of concrete, the centering shall be constantly inspected
and strengthened if required, and wedges below the vertical supports shall

Those
engaged in removing
the formwork
shall wear helmets,
gloves and heavy soled shoes, and
