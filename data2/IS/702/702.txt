<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Second Revision ) was
adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards
on
26 August
1988, after the draft finalized
by the
Bitumen, Tar and Their Products Sectional Com-
mittee had been approved
by the
Petroleum,
Coal and Related Products Division Council.
0.2 This standard
was first published
in 1955
and revised in 1961 to
incorporate
the new
grades of 65125, 75/15, 75130 and
105/20 and
also to modify the 95/15 grade to 90/15 to cover
a wider range of softening point in accordance
with methods
of tests published in IS  :  1201 to
IS  :  1220-1958*. The requirements
for ten grades
of bitumen were stipulated on the basis of investi-
gations carried
out and data made available on
the material marketed at that time.
0.3 The Committee
responsible for the prepara-
tion of this standard decided to revise the earlier
version
in accordance with data made available
based on revised methods of tests in IS  :  1202 to
IS : 1220-1978*.
In the present
version,
ten
grades of the material
have been unified into
six grades on the basis of softening point and
penetration
which are currently
available
and
marketed in the country.
0.4 Any single grade or blend of two or more
grades would be used for the following:
a) Manufacture
and fixing
of roofing
and
damp proofing felts:
b) Manufacture
of plastic
bitumen
for leak
stops;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
