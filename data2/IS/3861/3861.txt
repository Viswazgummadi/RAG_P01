<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods
of Measurement
of Works of Civil Engineering
( Excluding
River Valley Projects
) Sectional
Committee, CED 44<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the draft
finalized by the Methods of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering ( Excluding River Valley Projects )
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Different methods for calculating plinth/carpet areas of buildings were being followed by various departments.
This standard was, therefore formulated in 1966 to provide a basis for uniform method of measurement of such
areas of buildings.
First revision of the standard was brought out in 1975 to include rentable
area of the
buiIding on the basis of recommendations
of Central Public Works Department;
also, provisions
relating to
cubical contents were deleted as these are generally not followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This second revision
of the standard has been taken up in light of experience
gained with the use of the
standard and feedback received from time to time.
Following are the principal modifications
incorporated
in
this revision:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the list of the items whose areas can not be clubbed together has been made more exhaustive
by
including additional
items where it was found desirable to measure their areas separately;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the areas to be included in case of verandah, balcony and alcove for measurement of plinth area have
been detailed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
provision for measurement of areas of walls owned jointly by different owners has been added, for the
purpose of measurement of plinth area; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
details on various types of internal shafls/ducts,
for the purpose of inclusion of their areas in the
calculation
of plinth areas has been made exhaustive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard disallows the use of non-standard
terminologies
like super built areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS 2:
1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised
)’.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
