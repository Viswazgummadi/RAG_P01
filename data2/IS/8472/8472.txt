<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian standard (First Revision)
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Pumps Sectional Committee had been approved by the Heavy Mechanical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1977. Since then 2 amendments
were issued in 1980,and 1987 respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The present revision has been taken up to align the method of verification
of guarantee
with the other pump
standard like IS 9079, IS 8034 and IS 6595. Also the requirements
of self miming characteristics
in case of self-
priming and semi-self-priming
pumps have been incorporated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement
of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :
1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values  (revised)‘.
The number of significant
places retained
in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10 FACTORS
AFFECTING
PUMP
PERFORMANCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test procedure shall be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  The degree of compliance
of pump components
and assembly
to the specified requirements
affect the
pump performance
since the dimensional
tolerances
and clearances
required by these pumps are critical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No check or foot valve or any other external means of
priming
shall be installed
in the suction piping. Fill
pump casing with water and start the unit. The priming
time shall be the total elapsed time between starting
the unit and the time required to obtain a continuous
flow through the discharge pipe (Fig. 12).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Under identical suction conditions
with increase
in usage of such pumps
or wear of impeller
and
casings, the self-priming
time increases; and the head
and discharge decrease.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of tests shall be recorded in a
