<<HEADING level=1>>( First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
(First
Revision)
was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 28 February 1978, after the draft finalized by the
Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The vane shear test is most appropriate
for the determination
of the
shear strength of saturated clays, especially of the ‘soft’ to ‘medium’ con-
sistency.
The test is especially
appropriate
for determining
the shear
strength
of
sensitive
disturbances.
soils which
are highly susceptible
to
sampling<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The vane shear test consists of pushing a four-bladed vane in the soil
and rotating it till a cylindrical
surface in the soil fails by shear.
The
torque required to cause this failure is measured and this torque is con-
verted to a unit shearing resistance of the cylindrical
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard was first published in 1967.
In this revision
several
changes
have
been
made
taking
into
consideration
the
experience
gained in conducting
the test.
The essential requirements
of the torque
applicator have been added. Maximum permissible area ratio of the vane
has been related to the vane diameter.
Torque
applicators
of two capa-
cities have been specified; guidance has been given for the selection of the
lesser capacity
torque
applicator
in relation
to the anticipated
shear
strength of the soil to be tested and the overall vane diameter.
Oppor-
tunity has also been taken to give the requirements
and examples in SI
units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different
countries
in addition to relating it to the practices in this
field in this country.
This has been met by basing the standard on the
following publications:

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed for calculated,
expres-
sing the results of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in
the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard  covers  the procedure
of conducting
in-situ  vane shear
test in saturated cohesive deposits for determining
their inplace shearing
resistance.
Two methods of the test,
namely,
testing
from bottom of
a bore-hole and by direct penetration from ground surface, are covered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. APPARATUS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 For Test from Bottom
of Bore-Hole<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1
Vane -
shall consist of
four mutually
perpendicular
blades
as
illustrated in Fig. 1.
The height of the vane shall be twice the overall
diameter.
It is recommended that the overall diameter of the vane should
be 37*5,50,65,75
or 100 mm.
The design of the vane shall be such that it
causes as little remoulding and disturbance
as possible to the soil when
inserted into the ground for a test.
The blades shall be as thin as pos-
sible, consistent with the strength
requirements.
The
vane should not
deform under the maximum torque for which it is designed.
The penet-
rating edge of the vane blades shall be sharpened having an included angle
of 900.
The vane blades shall be welded together suitably either directly
or to a central rod, the maximum diameter of which should preferably not
exceed 12.5 mm.
The area ratio of the vane shall be kept as low as pos-
sible and shall not exceed 18 percent for the 37.5 mm vane and 12 percent
for the 50, 65, 75 and 100 mm diameter
vanes.
The area ratio may be
calculated
using the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

be the largest size suitable for the general soil
conditions at a site.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1.1  The vane rod ( the rod to which the vane blades are fixed)
may be enclosed in a suitably designed sleeve from just above the blades
and throughout the length it penetrates the soil to exclude the soil parti-
cles and the effects of soil adhesion.
This sleeve shall commence above
the blades at a distance equivalent
to about two diameters of the vane
rod.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
The vanes shall be frequently checked for straightness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.13
Torque Ajjlicator -
The torque applicator shall have a clamping
device to rigidly secure it to the anchor casing and shall have an attach-
ment to securely hold the string of rods connecting the vane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2.1
The instrument shall be capable of applying a torque to the
vane through the string of rods and to measure the same.
It should also
have a device to read the angular rotation of the upper end of the cxten-
sion rod.
The torque applicator shall be provided with speed control so
that the rate of rotation may be maintained at O*l”/s. Friction exerted by
the torque applicator should bc of neglible magnitude and shall be checked
periodically.
Depending upon the estimated shear strength of the soil,
the following table
( Table 1) may be used as a guide for the selection
of torque applicator of capacity 60 N.m ( 600 kgf.cm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Rod System -
The string of torque
rods connecting
the vane to the
torque  applicator called the rod system may be of the quick coupling type
or of the threaded type.
The length of the
rods shall preferably be Im
with a few of smaller lengths.
These rods shall have sufficient diameter
such that their elastic limit is not exceeded when the vane is stressed to its
capacity
( see Note ).
The
threaded
rods shall
be so coupled
that
the
shoulders of the male and female ends shall meet to prevent any possibility
of the coupling tightening when the torque is applied during the test.
If
a vane housing is used, the torque rods shall be equipped with well-lubri-
cated bearings where they pass through the housing.
These bearings shall
be provided with seals to prevent soil from entering them.
The torque
rods shall be guided so as to prevent friction from developing  between
the
torque rods and the walls of casing or boring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
If torque UC~SUS
rotation
curve
is to be determined,
it is essential that the
torque rods be calibrated
( prior to the use in the field ).
The amount of rod twist ( if
any ) shall be established
in degree per metre per unit torque.
This correction
becomes
progressively
more important
as the depth
of test increases
the calibration
shall be
made at least to the maximum
depth of testing anticipated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2  Connect the vane of suitable size ( see 2.1.1,  Note ) to the rods  and
lower  it to the bottom
of the bore-hole,
putting
guides at suitable
intervals
but not more than about 5 m as the rods are extended.
Push
the
vane
with a moderate
steady force up to a depth
of five times the diameter
of
the bore-hole
below the bottom
of the bore-hole
or shoe.
Take
precautions
to make sure that no torque is applied to the torque rods during the thrust.
No hammering
shall be permitted.
Fix the torque
applicator
with
frame
to the anchor
plate and connect
the rods to it.
Tighten
the torque
appli-
cator to the frame properly.
A diagrammatic
vane test arrangement
for
test from bottom of bore-hole
is shown in Fig. 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.3
Allow a minimum
period
of five minutes
after insertion
of the
vane. Turn
the gear handle so that the vane is rotated
at the rate of 0.19/s.
Note the maximum
torque reading
attained.
If necessary,
note the torque
indicator
dial gauge readings
at half-minute
intervals
and continue
rota-
ting the vane until the reading
drops appreciably
from the maximum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.4
Just
after the determination
of the maximum
torque,
rotate
the
vane
rapidly
through
a minimum
of
ten revolutions.
The
remoulded
strength
should then
be determined
( see 3.1.3 ) within
one minute
after
completion
of the revolutions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.5
Remove
the vane
testing
assembly,
continue
boring,
and collect
soil sample
from
the level of the vane testing
for laboratory
analysis
to
ascertain
whether
the deposit will behave as a purely cohesive soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.6
In case where a sleeve is not provided
for the vane rod and the soil
is in contact
with the rod, determine
the friction
between
the soil and the
vane rod by conducting
tests at appropriate
depths
using the dummy
rod
corresponding
to that
of the vane used in the test.
The
test should
be
conducted
as wit,h the vane except
that
the vane is replaced
by dummy
rod.
The test should be conducted
in an adjacent
bore-hole
at the same
depth at which the vane
tests were conducted.
The
dummy
rod should
be pushed into the ground
to the same distance
as the vane rod at that
depth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2
Test by Direct Penetration
from Ground
Surface<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1
Lock the vane in-place
inside the protecting
shoe and jack or drive
it to the required
depth.
Care shall be taken to see that the rods remain
tight while the vane is lowered.
Place guides about every 3 m to centralize
and reduce friction
between
the rods and extension
pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2
When
the
vane
and
protecting
shoe
have
penetrated
to the
required
depth,
push the vane steadily,
without
twisting,
a distance
of
5 times the diameter
of the shoe, into the undisturbed
soil below the protec-
ting shoe.
Rotate
the vane till the soil fails as in 3.1.

<<PARAGRAPH>>S = shear strength
in kN/m2 ( kgf./cm2 );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>_W = torque,
to shear the soil in N.m ( kgf. cm ) ( corrected
for
vane rod and torque rod resistance,
if any );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D =  overall
diameter
of vane in mm ( see Note 2 )  ;  and<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H = height of vane in mm ( see Note 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
1 -This
formula
is based on the assumptions
that (a) Shearing
strength
in the horizontal and vertical directions are the same. (b) At the
peak value, shear strength is equally mobilized at the end surface as well as at
the centre and that both the top and the bottom ends of the vane take part in
shearing the soil.
(c) It is assumed that the shear surface is cylindrical and
has a diameter equal to the diameter of the vane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 2 -It
is important
that the dimensions of the vane are checked
periodically to ensure that the vane is not distorted or worn.
Actual values
should be used in the calculation.<<HEADING_END>>
