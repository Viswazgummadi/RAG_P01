<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Second
Revision
) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on
7 February
1989, after the draft
finalized
by the Planning,
Byelaws
and Dimensional
Co-ordination
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bulk of documents
to  be preserved
for their historical,
legal and
administrative
value
is ever
on
the
increase
and government
departments,
universities,
local
bodies
and
many
commercial
firms do need expansion
of existing
archival
facilities
or establishments
of new archives
for this
purpose.
Archives
have to satisfy the basic requirement
that all the records
that
are received
are
housed,
maintained
and preserved
properly.
Further,
archives
also cater
to all’types
of materials
which
vary from one collection
to another
and also in their nature
and sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Archives
of all types are expanding
at an enormous
rat&.
Increasing
literacy
and demand
of old
documents
or records
also necessitates
expansion
of archives.
Since
the completion
of
a new
archives
building
takes several
years,
the stock to be accommodated
on the opening
day, therefore,
is larger
than what was estimated
at the planning
stage.
Unless
the building
for the
archives
is
planned
to meet
the futuristic
requirements,
it may
result
in
an
unscientific
arrangement
of
records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1964 and
revised
in 1977.
The
present
revision
has been
undertaken
with a view to updating
its contents.
In this revision,
building
design
and
construc-
tion aspect has been incorporated
covering
fire safety.
The site location
requirements
have
been
covered
in detail.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result .ofa
test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS 2  :  1960
‘Rules
for
rounding
off
numerical
values
(  revised )‘.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same
as that
of the
specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

concerning
primary

main-
tenance
and preservation
of records
on paper
and parchment,

and likewise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The
Indian
Standards
listed
in Annex A
are necessary adjuncts to this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Archives
enshrine
the
past
history
and
cultural
heritage.
The architectural
design of
the
building
should,
therefore,
reflect
this
character
of the institute..<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  LOCATION
AND
SITE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Preservation
of documents
is an essential
function
of archives.
Environmental
factors
which may adversely affect the preservation,
of
documents,
such as, polluted
atmosphere,
sub-
soil water and termite infestation shall be taken
into consideration
while selecting the site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Design of the building should be modular
to facilitate
addition
and
alterations
to
the
structure
whenever required.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 It shall provide
adequate
safety for stored
materials
against fire, flood, theft or pilferage
and deteriorating
agents, such as, fungus, pests,
dirt, direct
sunlight and extremes
of tempera-
ture and humidity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Convenience
and
requirements
of
major
users of archives
material,
such as, creating
agencies and scholars, is a primary
considera-
tion for determining
the location
of the site.
However, where scholars are the primary users,
proximity
to a good library,
easy availability
of  city  transport and pleasant surroundings
are
advantageous.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 The site shall be large
enough
to ensure
that:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) adequate
passageway
( not less than 6 m
wide ) and clearances
required
for
fire
appliances
to enter
the premises is pro-
vided; the width.of main entrance shall be
not less than 4’5 m; if an arch or covered
gate is .constructcd,
it shall have a clear
head-e
of not-less than 5 m;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Since archival
holdings are ever growing,
the site and plans should provide for future
expansion.
It should preferably cater to future
needs for 20 to 25 years.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE
-
The rate of increase
of permanent
archives
over the past five years will give a basis to know the
future requirements.<<HEADING_END>>

open space is available

the following norms:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a) Adequate
separation
(about
10 m) should
preferably be available between the build-
ing and the other neighbouring
buildings;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a clear passageway of 6 m width is main-
tained
contiguous,

and

the

<<HEADING level=3>>13.2.1  Stack Room<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is the most important
and valuable
feature
of any archive.
It is, therefore,
essential that

to ensure that fire in any com-
partment
cannot spread to other compartments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.2.1.1

Relative
position of each
stack
room,
&-a-z&
other rooms or buildings, shall be such
that
any fire outside
the stack room
cannot
spread
to it.
As far as possible, stack room
should be separated from administrative
room.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.2.1.11
All services,
such as a lighting
and
electrical
fittings,
air-conditioning,
sound
in-
sulation,
etc,
as may
be necessary,
shall. be
considered at the initial stages of design of the

<<PARAGRAPH>>13.2.1.3
Where the stack room has several tiers
of racks, each tier shall be separated
from the
succeeding
one by
a
non-combustible
floor.
The intervening  floor  shall not have any aper-
ture
in’ it.
Any
arrangement
where
the
book racks extend
through. several floor levels
and the stack floors are merely platforms which
provide
a walkway
through
the
stacks
and
result in slot-like openings, between
the stacks
