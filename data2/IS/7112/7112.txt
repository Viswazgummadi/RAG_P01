<<PARAGRAPH>>Canals and Cross Drainage Works Sectional Committee, WRD 13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Canals and Cross Drainage Works Sectional Committee had been approved by the Water Resources
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Among the different types of terrain through which a canal may pass the most common one is the alluvial tract.
The cross-section of the canal in alluvial soil, therefore, needs to be designed on considerations of stable and
regime flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1973 deriving assistance from the following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>India Central Board of Irrigation and Power. Statistical design formulae for alluvial canal system,
1967,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lacey (G). Sediment as factor in the design of unlined irrigation canals. General report on Q. 20 Sixth
Congress on Irrigation and Drainage, New Delhi, 1966. international Commission on Irrigation and
Drainage,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This revision of the standard has been taken up to incorporate the latest technological changes in this field as
well as to account for the experiences gained during the last three decades.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no 1S0 standard on the subject. This standard has been prepared based on indigenous data and taking
into consideration the practices prevalent in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is given in Annex E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated expressing the result of a test or analysis, should be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)’. The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified vaIue in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>The use of such a method which has been applied and proved to<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>on top of bank as this usually requires more materials

of providing
adequate service roads where they are<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>according to Lacey’s equation is given in Annex A.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>needed should always be kept in view.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 Though the Lacey’s equations have been in common use in the<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 The banks should invariably
cover the hydraulic gradient. The<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>country,
it has been long realized
that these equations

<<HEADING level=3>>from dimensions
given by Lacey’s
equation
in existing
stable<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>canals has been found significant
in many cases. In view of the<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Berms
along
earthen
canal
are usually provided to
reduce bank loads which may cause sloughing of earth
into the canal section and to lower the elevation of the
service road for easier maintenance. Berms are to be
provided in all cuttings when the depth of cutting is
more than 3 m. Where a canal i’sconstructed in a deep
through cut requiring waste banks, berms should be
provided between the canal section cut and the waste
bank. Various
other
factors
may be involved
in
determining whether berms should be used and care
should be taken that their use isjustified by the results
obtained.
However,
the
following
practice
is
recommended:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>necessity for evolving
formulae more accurate than Lacey”s but<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>without sacrificing the simplicity of regime equations, type-titted<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>equations were evolved which are given in Annex B. Within the<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>range of data tested, these equations are anticipated to give channel<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>dimensions
which would be nearer to regime
conditions.
The<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>regime type-fitted equations recommended for application are not<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>considered the last word on the subject. It should be fully realized<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>that further
modifications
in the equations
are possible
and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>necessary as and when more field observations of stable sites on<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>the canal systems become available. TIII the useofthese equations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>is recommended
since they are expected to yield more accurate<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>results than Lacey’s and other regime formulae.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Lacey
modified
his equations
so as to include
sediment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>concentration (Xin
parts per million)
and size and density ot’the<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>sediment as detined by its fall velocity
(~, in m/s) as additional<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>parameters affecting the regime dimensions of a stable channel.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the full supply level is above ground
level but the bed is below ground level, that
is, the canal is partly in cutting and partly in
tilling berm may be kept at natural surface
level equal to 2  D  in width (see Fig. 1A)
where  D  is the full supply depth.
When the full supply level and the bed level
are both above the ground level, that is, the
canal is in filling; the berm may be kept at
the full supply level equal to 3  D  in width
(see Fig. lB).
When the full supply level is below ground
level, that is, the canal is completely
in
cutting the berm may be kept at the full supply
level equal to 2  D  in width (see Fig. 1C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>These are given in Annex C.<<HEADING_END>>

OF THE METHOD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.1
According to Lacey, a canal is said to have
attained regime condition when a balance between
silting and scouring and dynamic equilibrium in the
forces generating and maintaining
the canal cross-
section and gradient are obtained.
If a canal runs
indefinitely
with constant discharge
and sediment
charge rates, it will attain a definite stable section
having a definite slope. If a canal is designed with a
section too small for a given discharge and it’s slope
is kept steeper than required, scour will occur till final
regime is obtained. On the other hand, if the section
is too large for the discharge and the slope is flatter
than required,
silting will occur till true regime is
obtained. [n practice true regime conditions do not
develop
because
of variations
in discharge
and
sediment rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D~O=  the average particle size of the boundary
material in mm.
Thus, in case, the conditions on a canal to be designed
are similar to those on an existing stable canal, the
value off may be determined by use of formula (1)
using the observed value of ii and  R  on the existing
stable canal. Alternatively,
the value off
may be
determined by use of formula (2) after determining
the  D~O size of boundary material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Having determined the value of ‘f’the following three
relationships may be used for determining required
slope and canal dimensions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.2
On analysis of data from a large number of
natural drainages and canals running for long, Lacey
developed relations for determining regime slope and
channel dimensions. He postulated, firstly, that the
required slope and channel dimensions are dependent
on the characteristics of the boundary material which
he quantified in terms of the silt factor (j) defined as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The unit tractive

<<PARAGRAPH>>Thus the area of cross-section

<<PARAGRAPH>>The permissible tractive force may be defined as the
maximum tractive force that will not cause serious
erosion of the material forming the canal bed on a
level surface.
The permissible
tractive
force is a
function of average particle size (DJ
of canal bed in
case of canals in sandy soils and void ratio in case of
canals in clayey soils and sediment concentration. The
values of permissible tractive force for straight canal
have been given by some authors on the basis of
laboratory experiments
but the same can better be
determined by analysis of observed data on existing
canals. Once this is done this would provide a rational
approach to the design of secti,on of regime channels,
The values of permissible tractive force for sinuous
canals may be reduced
by 10 percent for slightly
sinuous ones, by 25 percent for moderately sinuous
ones and by 40 percent for very sinuous ones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
