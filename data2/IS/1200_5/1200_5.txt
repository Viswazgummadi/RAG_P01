<<HEADING level=3>>METHOD OF MEASUREMENT OF
BUILDING AND CIVIL ENGINEERING WORKS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>PART V FORMWORK
( Third Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.  FOREWORD
0.1  This Indian Standard (Part V) (Third Revision) was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 25 October 1982, after the draft
finalized by the Method of Measurement of Works of Civil Engineering
(Excluding River Valley Projects) Sectional Committee had been
approved by the Civil Engineering Division Council.
0.2  Measurement occupies a very important place in the planning and
execution of any civil engineering work from the time of first estimates
to the final completion and settlement of payments for a project.
Methods followed for measurement are not uniform and considerable
differences exist between practices followed by different construction
agencies and also between various central and state government
departments. While it is recognized that each system of measurement
has to be specifically related to administrative and financial
organizations within a department responsible for the work, a
unification of various systems at technical level has been accepted as
very desirable, specially as it permits a wider range of operation for
civil engineering contractors and eliminates ambiguities and
misunderstandings of various systems followed.
0.3  Among various civil engineering items, measurement of buildings
was the first to be taken up for standardization and this standard
having provisions relating to building work was first published in 1958
and revised in 1964.
0.4  Since various trades are not related to one another, the Sectional
Committee decided that each type of trade as given in IS : 1200-1964*
be issued separately as different parts, which will be helpful to specific
users in various trades. This part covering formwork was first issued
in 1972 and now revised so as to keep requirements up to date.
0.5  This edition 4.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (February 1989).
Side bar indicates modification of the text as the result of
incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6  For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a measurement, shall be rounded off in
accordance with IS : 2-1960*. The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
