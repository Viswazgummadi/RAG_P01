<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted
bv the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the
Environmental
Protection
Sectional
Committee
had
been
appr~~ved
by the
Chemical
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cadmium
is highly
toxic and has been
implicated
in
some
cases of poisoning
through
food.
Minute
quantities
of cadmium
are suspected
of being responsible
for adverse
changes
in arteries
of human
kidneys.
Cadmium
may enter
water
as a result
of industrial
discharges
or the deterlo-
ration
of galvanized
water supply
pipe.

limit
for
cadmium
in dl-inking
water
i\
0.01
mg/l
beyond
which
the water
becomes
toxic
and no
relaxation
of
this
limit
ir; allowed.
The
test for cadmium
is, therefore,
essential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the preparation
of this standard,
considerable
assistance

from

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
prescribes
the
following
three methods for determination
of cadmium:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Atomic absorption
method
( direct ),
b) Atomic
absorption
method
( chelation
and extraction
), and
c) Differential

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Unless specified otherwise,
pure chemicals
shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE - ‘Pure chemicals’ shall mean chemicals
that do not
contain impurities
which affect tho
results of analysis.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 The choice of the method
depends
upon
the
concentration
range
and
interference
levels.
Determination
using atomic absorption
method
can be
done
either
directly
or by
chelation
and
extraction
prior
to
atomic

Repeat the extraction
twice with 6 to

<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cadmium is deposited
on a hanging
mercury
drop electrode at a negative potential
of  -0.8 V
versus saturated
calomel
electrode.
Then the
cadmium is stripped back into the solution by
applying a positive potential
scan.
The anodic
current peak which is measured is representa-
tive of the
cadmium
concentration
in
the
sample.
For total
dissolved
cadmium
the
sample
is filtered
through
Whatman
No. 40
filter paper prior to acidification
and
analysis.
This method is applicable
in the concentration
range of 0.1-100 agil,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2  Interferences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Selenium
interferes
when
its
concentration
exceeds 50 ~11.
This
can be overcome
by
adding ascorbic
acid which
reduces
selenium

Iron ( III ) interferes
when present at levels
greater than
cadmium.
However, this can be overcome by warming the
