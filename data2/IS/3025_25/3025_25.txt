<<HEADING level=3>>1. scope
-
Prescribes the method of determination
of chlorine
demand.
in  this standard.
Two methods are  prescribed
Method
A is laboratory
method
and Method
B is field method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Terminology
-
The chlorine
demand
of water
is the difference
between
the
amount
of chlorine
applied
and the  amount of free, combined
or tolal available
chlorine
remaining
at the
contact
period
The chlorine
demand
of anv water varies with the  amount
of chlorine
applied,
time  of
Jntact, pH
and
temperature.
As 0’2 mg/l of residual
chlorine
is desirable
at
the
consumers
end,
this
quantity
plus
the actual
demand
WIII give
the chlorine
demand
figures
(for drinking
water analysis).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  Laboratory
Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
Theory and Application
-
This method
is designed
to determine
the so-called
immediate
demand
as well
as other
demands
at longer
contact
period.
Chlorine
demand
is measured
to determine
the
amount of chlorine
that must be applied
to a water
to produce
a specific
free,
combined
or total
chlorine residual after a selected
period
of contact.
If the
amount
of chlorine
applied
to waters
containing
ammonium
or organic nitrogen
compounds
is not sufficient
to reach
what
is termed
the
‘break point’, chloramines
and certain other chloroderivatives
are produced.
When sufticient
chlorine
has been added to reach the breakpoint,
which depends on  PH, ratio of chlorine
to
nitrogenous
com-
pound
present
and other
factors,
subsequent
additions
of chlorine
remarn
in the free  available
state.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2 Addition
of Chlorine
Water -  Add an amount
of chlorine
to the first
portion
that
leaves
no
residual
chlorine
at the end of the contact
period.
Add increasing
amount
of chlorine
to
the
succes-
sive portions
in the series.
Increase
the
oosage
between
portions
in increments
of 0’1
mgll
for
determining
low demands
and up to 1’0 mg/l or more for higher
demands.
Mix
while
adding.
Dose
the portions
of the sample
according
to a staggered
schedule
that
will
permit
the
determination
of
chlorine
residuals
at
the
predetermined
contact
time.
An
approximation
to the
ultimate
chlorine
demand
can be made by dosing
(  minimum
1 mg available
chlorine
per
litre  1 so  that
the
residual
is
one half the dosage.
Confirm
this demand
by doubling
the
dosage;
the
second
demand
should
be
within
10 percent
of the first.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3
Contact Time -
The usual purpose
of a chlorine
demand
test is to determine
the
amount
of
chlorine
required
to oroduce
a specific
free,
combined
or total
available
chlorine
residual
after
a
definite
time interval
that may vary from a few minutes
to many
hours.
Carry
out
the
test
over
the
desired
contact
period
If the objective
of the test is to duplicate
in the
laboratory
the
temperature
and the plant contact
time,
make several
preliminary
chlorine
determination
during
different
reaction
periods,
such as 16, 30 and 60 min in order to determine
the
chlorine
consumption
with
respect
to
trrne information
that can be valuable
in treatment
plant
control.
Record
the
contact
trme.
Protect
the chlorinated
samples
ltom
the strong
day light throughout
the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.4
Examination
of Samples -
At
the
end
of the
contact
period,
determine
the
free
and/or
combined
available
residual
chlorine
by one of the
standard
methods
given
in
IS  :  3025
(  Part 26 I-
1986.
Plot the residual
chlorine
or the amount
consumed
versus the dosage
to aid
in studying
the
results.
If necessary,
remove  samples
for bacteriological
examination
at desired
intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.6
Taste and Odour -
Observe
the
taste
and
odour
of
the
treated
samples
at
ordinary
temperatures
with
or without
dechlorination.
For odour
observation
at
elevated
temperatures,
dechlorinate
the samples
before
heating.
Choose
the
dechlorinating
agent
with
due
regard
to
its
effect
on the odour
in the water
under examination.
Generally,
sodium
sulphite
is satistactory
if only
a slight
stoichiometric
excess
is used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

were
originally
covered
in
various
Indian
Standards
like
IS : 2488
(in parts)
‘Methods
of sampling
and test for industrial
effluents’,
IS : 3025-1964
‘Methods
of sampling
and test (physical

The Committee
responsible
for
the
preparation
of these standards
decided
to revise
these
standards
by amalgamating
into one
comprehensive
standard on methods
of sampling
and test
(physical
and chemical)
for water
and
wastewater.
The amalgamated
revision
will
be published
