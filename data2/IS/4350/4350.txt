<<HEADING level=3>>SPECIFICATION FOR CONCRETE POROUS
PIPES FOR UNDER DRAINAGE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.  FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted hy the Indian Standards Institution
on 20 October
1967, after the draft finalized by the Cement and Concrete
Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Concrete
porous pipes are commonly
used for under drainage work
in infiltration,
galleries,
reclaiming
water-logged
areas and similar other
purposes.
This standard has been prepared with the object of providing
guidance to the manufacturers and users in obtaining porous concrete pipes
capable of giving satisfactory service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 When porous pipes are to be used for under drainage work in injurious
soils they may have to be manufactured
from sulphate-refisting
cement of
high alumina cement, and in such cases the purchaser will have to speci-
fically indicate his requirements
( see 3.1 ) along with other information to
be supplied under Appendix A for guidance of the manufacturers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 This standard contains clauses which permit the purchaser to use his
option for selection to suit his requirements
and also require the purchaser
to supply certain technical information
at the time of placing orders ( see
Appendix A ).
The relevant clauses are 3.1, 4.1.1,4.2,
4.3.1.1
and 8.2.
0.5 In the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.
0.6 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, expressing
the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard lays down the requirements
for porous pipes made of
concrete for use in under drainage.
The requirements
cover pipes ranging
from 80 mm nominal internal diameter to 900 mm nominal internal diameter
with three types ofjoints.
*Rules
for  rounding off numerical values  ( mised ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.  MANUFACTURE
AND FINISH<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  General -
The methods
ofmanufacture
shall be such that the form and
dimensions
of the finished pipe are accurate
within
the limits specified in this
standard.
The edges of the pipe shall be well defined and their ends shall be
square
with the longitudinal
axis.
The portion
of the pipe for a length
of
75 mm from either
end may be strengthened
by grouting
or any
other
suitable
means
to prevent
the breakage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
It is not
always
necessary
to reinforce
the pipes.
Holvevcr,
if
required
to add to the strength
of the pipe for bearing
external
load or to
withstand
handling
dping
transportation,
the pipes may be reinforced
with
the galvanized
steel remforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Non-porous  Inverts

<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Maturing of Porous Pipes -
Unless
otherwise
authorized
by the
purchaser
no pipes shall be supplied
under
this specification
until they
have
been allowed
to mature
under
suitable
conditions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  TESTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Test Specimens -
All pipes for testing
purposes
shall be selected
at
random
in accordance
with the procedure
given
in Appendix
B from the
stock of the manufacturer
and
shall
be such
as would
not otherwise
be
rejected
under
this.specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  The specimens ofpipes selected in accordance with 6.1 shall be subjected
to the following tests:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Load test in accordance
with requirements
of 6.3, and
b) Infiltration
test in accordance
with requirements
of 6.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1
The pipe specimens when tested in accordance
with the require-
ments of 6.3
shall support for at least one minute a minimum
load of
2 000 kg uniformly distributed per metre length of the pipe without showing
any signs of failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2
The rate of infiltration of pipe specimens tested horizontally
under
a constant head of water of 50 mm above the pipe specimen in accordance
with the requirements
of 6.4 shall be not less than the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The rate of infiltration for porous pipes with non-porous inverts
shall be not less than half the values specified in 6.2.2
for porous pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3
The manufacturer
shall regularly
carry out infiltration
tests on
specimens corresponding to the pipe manufactured
and shall provide suffi-
cient proof to the purchaser that the pipes supplied satisfy the porosity test.
However, if the purchaser desires to have porosity test carried out on any
sample, the  cost  of the pipe shall be borne by the purchaser unless otherwise
agreed to between
the purchaser
and the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Load Test -  The pipe to be tested shall be placed centrally between,
and with its longitudinal
axis parallel
to, two hard unyielding
bearers of
150 mm width, with rubber packing 150 mm wide and 25 mm thick between
the bearers and the pipe ( see Fig. 3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1
The load shall be steadily and uniformly applied, starting from zero,
at a rate not exceeding 165 kg/m length of pipe in 10 seconds.
The pipe shall<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>support without any sign of failure for at least one minute a minimum
load specified in 6.2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4  Infiltration Test -
The porous pipe to be tested shall be thoroughly
cleaned before testing to remove dust and dirt particles likely to reduce the
porosity of pipe.
The water used for testing shall be free from suspended
impurities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1
The pipe shall be fixed horizontally in a test tank with each end of
the pipe protruding through $e. tank as shown in Fig. 4.
A water-tight
seal shall be made between the sides of the tank and the pipe with putty,
plasticine or other sealing material.
The tank should have some arrange-
ment of removable ends so that, for testing different diameters of pipe, it can
be dismantled and re-erected with two ends having holes of the right size to
take the pipe to be tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.2
The test tank shall be filled with water completely immersing the
porous pipe.
The head of water in this tank shall be maintained throughout
the test at 50 mm above the pipe. Fig. 4 shows diagrammatically
one method
by which the
water can be made to flow back through an overflow pipe
from the test tank into a reservoir tank when the specified head of water is
reached in the test tank and maintained by adjusting the flow.
The water
flowing from the collecting tank will then be diverted through the two-way
control valve into the measuring tank for the specified time.
The amount
of water in litres per minute filling the measuring
tank divided by the
effective length in metres of that part of the porous pipe through which
water can percolate, shall give the rate of infiltration of the pipe as specified
