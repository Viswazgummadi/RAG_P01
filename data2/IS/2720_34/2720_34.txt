FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
(Part
XXXIV)
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 31 January
1972, after the draft finalized
by the
Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establish
uniform
procedures
for the determination
of
different
characteristics
of soils
and
also
for
facilitating
comparative
studies of the results,
the Indian
Standards
Institution
is bringing
out this
‘Indian
Standard
Methods
of test for soils’
(IS:
2720)
which is being
published
in parts.
This part deals with the procedure
for the determina-
tion of the density
in-place
of compacted
or firmly
bonded
soil using a
rubber-balloon
apparatus.
The
in-place
density
of natural
soil is needed
for the determination
of bearing
capacity
of soils, for the purpose of stability
analysis
of natural
slopes, for the determination
of pressures on underlying
strata
for calculation
of settlement,
etc.
In compacted
soils the in-place
density
is needed
to check
the amount
of compaction
that
the soil has
undergone
forcomparison
with design data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in this field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In reporting
the result of a test or analysis made in accordance
with this
standard,
if the final value, ‘observed or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it
shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  Z-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
(Part
XXXIV
) covers the procedure
for determining
the density
in-place
of compacted
or firmly
bonded
soil using a rubber-
balloon
apparatus.
This
method
is not suitable
for very soft soils which

<<HEADING level=3>>2.  APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Calibrated
Vessel  -designed
to contain
a liquid
with a relatively
thin, flexible elastic membrane
(  rubber-balloon)
for measuring
the volume
of the test hole under
the conditions
of this method
(set Fig. 1 ). The cali-
brated equipment
may also be a graduated
glass cylinder
provided
with a
syitable
guard
and
guard
base
with
provisions
for attachment
of
the
elastic membrane
without
leakage.
The graduations
shall be such that the
volumes can be read accurate
to 5  ml.
The
apparatus
shall
be equipped
so
that
an externally
controlled
pressure
or partial
vacuum
can .be applied
to
the contained
liquid
( see  Note 1 ).
Suitable
provision
shall also be made
for the measurement
of the pressure
applied.
It shall be of such weight
and size that
it will
not
cause
distortion
of  the excavated
test hole and
adjacent
test area during
the performance
of the test.
Provision
may be
made for placing
weights
(  surcharge
) on the apparatus,
if necessary_, when
the weight of the apparatus
itself is not sufficient to hold it down durmg
the
test.
The flexible membranes
shall be of such sizes as to fill the test holes
completely
without
wrinkles
or folds when inflated
within
the test holes,
and their
strength
shall be sufficient
to withstand
such pressures
as are
necessary to ensure
complete
filling of the test holes (see Note 2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
1 --  Any arrangement
for providing
pressure and partial vacuum
which
does
not impair
the portability
of the apparatus
may be used.
A convenient
method
is to
use a pressure actuator
bulb similar
to the one used in the blood-pressure
measuring
apparatus
used by doctors.
By providing
suitable valves and other
arrangementa
the
same actuator
can be used for creating the required vacuum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 - The description
and requirements
given
in 2.1 are intended to be non-
restrictive.
Any apparatus
using a flexible membrane
( rubber ) and liquid that can be
used to measure
the volume
of a test hole in soil under the conditions
of this method
tn an accuracy within
1-O percent is satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2720 ( Part
XXXIV
) - 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>shall be measured
to within 1 *O percent
(see Note).
Containers
of different
volumes shall be used so that the calibration
check of the volume indicator
covers the range of anticipated
test hole sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -The
lOO-mm and GO-mm moulds dexribed
in IS  :  2720 ( Part VII )-1965+
and IS  :  2720 ( Part VIII )-1965t or other
moulds
prepared
to simulate
actual
test
holes
may
be used.
Where
several sets of apparatus
are used, it may be desirable to
cast duolicates
of actual test holes.
These sets should reoresent the ramze of size
and
irregularities
in t”.e walls of test holes that will be enco&tered.
These Lbricated
holes
may be used as standards
for the calibration
check of the volume
indicator.
This may
be accomplished
by forming
plaster of Paris negatives
in the test holes and using
these
as forms
for Portland cement concrete
castings.
After removing
the plaster of Paris
negative
from the concrete
casting,
the inside surface
of the fabricated
holes should
be seated watertight
and their volume
determined
as indicated
in 3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1
Volumes of Containers-
Determine
the
weight
of
water,
in
grams required
to fill one of the containers.
Slide a glass plate carefully
over the top surface of the container
in such a manner as to ensure that the
container
is filled completely
with
water.
Determine
the temperattire
of
the water in the container.
A thin film of cup grease smeared on the top
surface of the container
shall make a watertight
joint
between
the glass
plate and the top of the container.
Calculate
the volrime of the container,
in millilitres,
by multiplying
the weight of water, in grams,
used to fill the
container
by the unit
volume
of water,
in millilitres
per gram,
at the
observed
temperature,
taken from Tabie
1.
Repeat
this procedure
until
three values are secured for the volume of the container
having maximum
range of variation
of 3 ml. Repeat the procedure
for each of the containers
to be used in the calibration
check.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2
Calibration Check Tests -Place
the rubber-balloon
apparatus
filled
with water to the required
level ( see Note 1) on a relatively
smooth hori-
zontal
surface
and
take
an initial
reading
on
the
volume
indicator.
Transfer
the apparatus
to one of the containers
and take the* reading
on
the volume indicator
when the rubber-balloon
completely
fills the contai-
ner ( see Notes 2 and 3 ).
Apply pressure to the liquid in the apparatus
until
there is no further
change
indicated
on the volume indicator.
Note and
record
the pressure.
Where
necessary,
add weight
( surcharge
) to the
apparatus
to prevent it from rising ( see Note 4 ).
Note and record the total
amount
of weights
added.
The difference between
the initial
and final
readings
of the volume indicator
is the indicator
volume
value
for the
container.
The
membrane
may
be withdrawn
from
the
container
by
applying
a partial
vacuum
to the liquid
in the apparatus.
Repeat
the
procedure
for the other
containers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 -If
the calibration container or mould is airtight? it may be necessary to
provide an air escape, since  the  rubber membrane can entrap atr within the container
and cause erroneous volume measurement.
After the volume of the container has
been determined with water and prior to the insertion of the rubber-balloon, rmall air
escape-holes may be provided by placing lengths of small diameter string over the edge
of the container and down the inside wall slightly beyond the bottom cehtre.
This
will permit air leakage during the filling of the container with the membrane.
If such
a procedure is necessary in the laboratory,
it may bg necessary to use a similar
procedure on tightly-bounded soil in the field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTI 3 - Before any measurements are made, it may be necessary to distend the
rubber-balloon and remove air bubbles adhering to the inside of the membrane by
kneading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 4 -  In field tests the additional weights (surcharge) will increase the stress in
the unsupported soil surrounding the test hole and will tend to  cause it to deform.
The stress may be reduced  by  using a base plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  Prepare the surface of the test hole site so that
it is reasonably
plane.
Set the apparatus
on the test hole site and take an initial reading
on the
volume
indicator
of the calibrated
vessel using the same pressure on the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k
liquid in the vessel and the same amount
of surcharge
weight as was used
in  the calibration
check.
After taking this initial reading on the volume
indicator, scribe the outline of the apparatus on the test hole site.
Record
the pressure used, the amount of the surcharge, and the initial volume
reading.
If the apparatus was calibrated with a base plate, the base plate
shall remain in-place throughout the field test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2720 ( Part XXXIV ) - 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2  Remove
the apparatus from the test hole site and dig a hole
centered
within the outline scribed for the apparatus.
Exercise care in digging the
test hole so that soil around
the top edge of the hole is not disturbed.
Place all the soil removed from the test hole  in an airtight container for
weight and moisture content determinations.
The test hole shall be of the
minimum volume given in Table 2.
Larger holes will provide imprdved
accuracy
and shall he used, where practicable.
The dimensions of the
test holes are related to the apparatus design and the pressure used.
In
general, the dimensions shall approximate
those used in the calibration
check procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 After the test hole has been dug, place the apparatus over the test hole
in the same position used for the initial reading and inflate the flexible
membrane.in the hole, allowing air from the hole to escape without gett-
ing entrapped between the inner surface of the test hole and the flexible
membrane
(see Note 2 under 3.1.2  ) .
Apply the same surcharge weight
and pressure on the liquid in the vessel as used during the calibration
check procedure.
Take and record the reading on the volume indicator.
The difference between this reading and the initial reading obtained in 4.1
is the ‘volume of the test hole (see Note).
Note the temperature of the
water used and correct the volume for temperature,
taking into considera-
tion the temperature at which the apparatus was calibrated.
After the
test, pump the water and flexible membrane back into the cylinder by
applying vacuum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
-Attention
i$ called to instances
in weak soils, where the pressure applied to
the liquid in the vessel may deform the test hole to such an extent as to give an errone-
ous
volume.
In
such
instances,
the apparatus
shall
be
re-calibrated
using
less
surcharge
weight and less pressure on the liquid  in the vessel,
or it may be necessary
