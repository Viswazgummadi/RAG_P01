<<HEADING level=3>>0. FadEWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard
( Second Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
lnstitution
on 15 March
i983,
after
the draft
finalized
by
the Fire Fighting
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Water
tenders
type ‘A’ are used in rural
areas.
This
standard
was first published
in 1959 ‘and revised in i970.
At that time mostly
petrol engine driven
chassis was used for this type of vehicle
which
was having payload of 5 tonnes.
Even the diesel trucks were used in the
transition period, and payload
of these chassis increased from 5 tonnes.
Keeping in mind 5 tonnes payload of the chassis, water tank capacity was
pegged
at 2 700 litres and
other
parameters
like
acceleration
were
set accordingly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Keeping in mind the latest trend having the fire engine on diesel
driven chassis which
are having higher payloall,
the capacity
of water
tank is being increased
to 3 6 00 litres in this revision.
But due to the
limited
power
available
from the diesel engine
of the
chassis,
the
acceleration
figures are being revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1 A list of accessories
and equipment
which do not form part of
this appliance
and most of which ark normally
fe~uired
to assist in
operation

is given
in Appendix
A for information
and guidance.
The appliance
shall also conform to statutory
rules in
regard to height clearance
framed by Tfans~off
Authority.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 For the ptir$ode of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
