<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after
the
draft
finalized
by the Construction
Plant and Machinery
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Heavy
Mechanical
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concrete
blocks
are commonly
used in walls, partitions,
roof,
etc.
This standard,
covering
requirements
for size, operation
speed and construction
of concrete
block making machines, has
been prepared
with a view to provide guidance both in the manufacture
and purchase of this type
of machines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with
the final value, observed or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical values ( revised )‘.
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
