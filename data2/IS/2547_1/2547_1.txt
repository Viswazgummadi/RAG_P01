FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
(  Part
I ) (First
Revision
) was adopted
by the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 20 February
1976, after the draft finalized
by the Gypsum
Building
Materials
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard
was first published
in 1963.
It has now been revised
in
two parts: Part I deals with gypsum
plaster
excluding
premixed
lightweight
plaster and Part II deals with premixed
lightweight
plasters.
Gypsum
plaster
has been
reclassified
according
to the latest
method
of classification
and
anhydrous
plaster
which was previously
recommended
as undercoat
plaster
and
finishing
plaster
has
now
been
recommended
for
only
finishing
purposes.
Based on the changes
in classification,
changes
in the require-
ments of plaster
have also been made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Gypsum
building
plasters
are used extensively
in many countries
of the
world
including
Australia,
Canada,
United
Kingdom,
United
States
of
America
and USSR,
for general building
operations
and for the manufacture
of preformed
gypsum
building
products
which have the specific advantages
of lightness
and high fire resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The various
resources
for gypsum
in this country,
when developed,
will
yield in addition
to high grade gypsum,
large quantities
of gypsum
of purity
70 percent
or less.
The latter
according
to present
knowledge,
have also
prospects
of economic
use mainly
as building
materials,
namely,
in the form
of gypsum
plaster,
gypsum
plaster
boards,
and gypsum
blocks
and tiles.
This standard
on gypsum
plaster,
which
is one in the series, covers
the
various
categories
of gypsum
plaster
used in normal
building
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Gypsum
building
plasters
may vary widely
in their properties
partly
because
manufacturing
processes
differ and
partly because
adjustments
are
made to suit users requirements.
Thus the properties
required
of plasters
for undercoat
work differ to some extent
from those required
for finishing
coats; a further
variation
is sometimes
necessary
in the latter
class in order
to control
the hardness
of finish or surfaces
intended
for specific purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2547 ( Part I ) - 1976<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Keeping
these points
in view it has been attempted
in this standard
to
classify
gypsum
plasters
on the basis of partially
dehydrated
gypsum
and
anhydrous
gypsum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should
be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
(Part
I ) covers
the
classification
and
chemical
and
physical
requirements
for gypsum
building
plasters
which posses
?
definite
set due to hydration
of calcium
sulphate,
anhydrous
or hemi
ydrate,
to
form gypsum
and are used in the manufacture
of gypsum
building
products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 Premixed
lightweight
building
plasters
are not included
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 For  the purpose
of this standard,
the definitions
given in IS  :  2469-1976t
shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. CLASSIFICATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Gypsum
plaster shall be classified
as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Finish

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Board finish plaster,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Anhydrous

<<PARAGRAPH>>NATE -
Keene’s plaster
is of the anhydrous
type.
It is characterized
by being
more easily brought to a smooth and clean finish associated with gradual set. In this
standard
Keene’s
plaster is differentiated
from a anhydrous
gypsum plaster by a
higher standard
of purity (CaSO,
not less than 80 percent  )  and hardness.
The
special qualities traditionally
associated
with this type of plaster cannot be dealt with
at present by any convenient
direct test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
