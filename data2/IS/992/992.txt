FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
revised
Indian
Standard
was
adopted
by
the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 29 Jlme
1964, after
the draft
finalized
by
the
Cutlery
Sec-
tional
Committee
had
been approved
by the Consumer
Products
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
This
standard
was
first published
in
1957
and
was one of a series of
Indian
Standard
specifications
on table
cutlerv.
Revision
of the series has
been
taken
up
o<
account
of
necessity
to rnetricize
and
also
to
avoid
such
details
as
will
hinder
the
improvement
of
design.
Pastry
forks
have
also
been included
in this revised
standard.
Other
standards
in the
series
are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Th;
standard
deals
with
the
requirements
for
forks
( table,
fish,
pastry
and
serving
)
made
of
stainless
steel.
Designs
other
than
those
covered
by
this standard
are
also
popular
with
certain
organizations
to
suit
aesthetic
requirements.
In
such
cases,
it is recommended
that
the
forks
may
be made
according
to the
designs
of individual
organizations
but
other
provisions
of this standard’
shall
apply
to guide
the manufac-
ture
and
purchase.
An
important
aspect
of
table
cutlery
is that
the
different
items
in a set mch
as spoons,
forks” and
knives
should
match
in
shape
and
appearance.
This
factor
is to be borne
in mind
by the manu-
facturers
when
supplying
cutlery
in sets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS:99!2-1964<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4  Wherever
a reference
to any Indian Standard appears in this specifi-
cation, it shall be taken as a reference to the latest version of the standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of
this standard is complied with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accord-
ance with IS  :  2-1960 Rules for Rounding Off Numerical Values (  Revtied ).
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should
be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6 This standard is intended chiefly to cover
the technical
provisions
Telating to stainless steel forks ( table, fish, pastry and serving ), and it
does not include all the necessary provisions of a contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
