FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
(Second
Revision)
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 September
1970,
after
the draft
finalized
by
the Cement
and Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard
was first published
in 1952 and subsequently
revised in
1963.
The
present
revision
of the standard
has been taken up to incor-
porate the modification
necessary
in the light of experience
gained
in its
use and also to bring it in line with the latest thinking
on the subject.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2.1
The
requirements
for aggregates
for mass
concrete
have
been
included
and it is proposed
to withdraw
IS: 515-1959*when
this standard
is printed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
limiting
values
for the permissible
deleterious
materials
in the
aggregates,
aggregate
abrasion
value
and
soundness
test for aggregates
have been revised,
Recommendations
have been included
for the size of
aggregates
for mass concrete.
The four grading
zones for fine aggregates
as specified in the earlier version of the standard
have not been changed.
These
four grading
zones become
progressively
finer from Grading
Zone I
to Grading
Zone IV (see Table
4).
The
fine aggregates
within each of
these grading
zones are suitable
for making concrete,
but to make concrete
of high strength
and durability,
the mix
proportions
should
be c!iosen
according
to the grading
characteristics
of the fine aggregates
used; the
ratio
of fine
to coarse
aggregate
being
reduced
as the fine aggregate
becomes
finer from Grading
Zones
I to IV.
In particular,
the correct
design
of the mix becomes
increasingly
important
as the grading
of the
fine aggregate
approaches
the coarse outer limit.of
Grading
Zone I or the
fine outer limit of Grading
Zone
IV,
and the suitability
of a given fine
aggregate
grading
may, in some circumstances,
depend on the grading
and
shape of the coarse aggregate.
It is sometimes
found that a fine aggregate
which
lies in one grading
zone and near the border of another
does not<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Mince  withdrawn
3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>remain
consistently
in one zone but fluctuates
between
the two.
It is
therefore,
desirable
to choose
a suitable ratio of fine to coarse
aggregate
proportions of the concrete
to allow some fluctuations
in the grading
zone
of the Ane aggregate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.31
The four grading
zones indicated
in this standard
are meant to
cover the use of the natural
sands available in the country.
It is, however,
necessary to appreciate
the limitations
in either using a very coarse
sand
or a very fine sand and the need to make suitable
changes
in the mix
design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Investigations
have shown that the bulk density is affected by the size
of the container
used to determine
it.
Secondly
there is an increasing
tendency
to batch concrete
by weight
rather
than by volume.
Hence
as
in 1963 version of the standard,
the provisions regarding
bulk density have
not been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Whilst the requirements
specified in this standard
generally
meet the
normalrequirements
for most of the concrete
works, there might be special
cases where certain
requirements
other than those specified in the stand-
ard might have to be specified;
in such case, such special
requirements,
the test required
and the limits for such
tests may
be specified by the
purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

out as described

Unless otherwise
stated in the enquiry

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1
In the case of all-in-aggregates,
for purposes
of tests to verify its

with the requirements
given in Table

for such other
tests as required
by the purchaser,
the aggregates
shall be
first separated
into two fractions,
one finer than 4*75-mm
IS Sieve and the
other coarser
than 4*75-mm
IS Sieve, and the appropriate
tests shall be
made
on samples
from each
component,
the former being tested as fine
aggregate
and the latter as coarse aggregate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2
If further
confirmation
as to the satisfactory
nature of an aggre-
gate is required,
tests may be made
in accordance
with
2 and
5 of
IS  :  516-1959
with a view to comparing
the properties of the concrete
made
with the aggregate
under consideration
with those of concrete
