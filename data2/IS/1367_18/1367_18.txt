<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard  (  Third Revision ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Bolts. Nuts and Fasteners Accessories Sectional Committee had been approved by the Light Mechanical
Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was originally published in 1961 and subsequently revised in 1967 and 1979. In the present
revision, following major changes have been made:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Marking requirements for bolts, screws, studs and nuts have been deleted from this standard since
these are already covered in IS 1367  (  Part 3 )  :  1991 ‘Technical supply conditions for threaded steel
fasteners  :  Part 3 Mechanical properties and test methods for bolts. screws and studs with full loadability
(  third revision )’  and IS 1367 ( Part 6 )  :  1994 ‘Technical supply conditions for threaded steel fasteners  :
Part 6 Mechanical properties and test methods for nuts with specified~proof loads  (fhird revision)‘,
respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Requirements for mode of delivery that is Packaging have been modified as per 1s 9 14 1  : I  979 ‘Code of
practice for the packaging of fasteners ( firsf  revision )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The packaging function has to fulfil a variety of objectives including the protection of the contents against
transport, handling and storage~hazards. Threaded fasteners, like bolts, nuts, screws and studs have some special
features which must be protected to keep them fit for use at the ultimate destination. Packaging has to be designed
in such a way as to ensure the availability of fasteners in packs to meet the general demand. Packaging has also
to take into consideration the variations in quantity which in turn depends on the type of customer and the
availability of storage facilities at -his end. Some of the Indian
Standards on fasteners to which this standard
applies are listed in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 18) covers technical supply conditions in respect of packaging of threaded steel fasteners.
Other parts covering various aspects of the threaded steel fasteners and their respective degree of equivalence
with International
Standards are as under:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
