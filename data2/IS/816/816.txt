As
a

it has been
decided
to
revise
this
standard
with the following
modifications:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The

to the discretion
of the designer.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
Two
basic
types of construction
and design
assumptions
are permis-
sible
under
the respective
conditions
stated
in this code
and
each
shall
govern
in
specific
manner,
the
sizes
of
members
and
the
types
and
strength
of their
connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1
Type
1, commorly
designated
as ‘ simple
‘ ( unrestrained,
free-
ended
), assumes
that
the ends
of beams
and
girders
are connected
for
shear
only,
and
are free to rotate
under
load.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
Type
2, commonly
designated
as
‘ rigid
frame
‘
( continuous,
restrained
) assumes
that the end connections
of beams,
girders
and
all
other
members
in the frame
have
sufficient
rigidity
to
hold
virtually
unchanged
the  original
angles
between
such
members
and
the
members
to which
they
connect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

metal
arc welding
and

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2
