FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian
Standard
( First
Revision)
was adopted
by the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 26 June
1972,
after
the draft
finalized
by
the
Flooring
and Plastering
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
The
usefulness
of tiles
as flooring
material
consists
mainly
in their
pleasant
appearance
as it eliminates
the possibility
of unsightly
cracks
and
facility for quick installation.
The appearance
and the performance
of the
tiled floor will, however,
depend not only on the quality
of materials
used
but also on the care taken
in bedding,
laying
and finishing
of the
tiles.
This standard
gives necessary
guidance
in
the laying
of cement
concrete
tile flooring
to obtain
good appearance,
durability
and finish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This code of practice
lays
down
procedures
for
the
preparation
of
bedding
and for the fixing
and
polishing
of plain
terrazzo
and
special
types
of cement
concrete
flooring
tiles.
Precautions
necessary
in the
finishing
of skirting,
dado, staircase
treads,
etc, are also dealt with.
The
code includes
the materials
used in fixing, grouting
and
polishing
of tiles,
and in the maintenance
of the tiled
flooring.
This
standard
which
was
first published
in 1959 is now re%sed
taking
into account
the
experience
gained in this work since
then.
The
salient
features,of
this revision
are
given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Preparation
and
use of cement
mortar
and
lime
mortar
for
bedding
concrete
tiles have been separately
described,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>‘o) Details
pertaining
to grinding
and polishing of tiles after laying are
given,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Permissible
tolerance
in laying of tiles has been specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

CONSIDERATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Tile
floe .ng
may
be
laid
on
most
types of reasonably
rigid base,
provided
that the sub-floor
is of sufficient
strength
for the type of  flooring
proposed
and is not liable to settlement
at any time.
Cement
flooring
tiles
are not recommended
for use where they will be exposed
to the action
of
acids and alkalies.
However,
the cement
tile flooring gives suitable service
if it is exposed to sea water,
vegetable
oil or fats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2
The range of tiles for flooring,
dado work, facings,
etc, is wide and the
choice of any particular
type or  colour  involves aesthetic
as well as techni-
cal considerations.
Their
selection
is dependent
on the type of  flooring
required;
the tile manufacturer
should preferably
be consulted
for advice
as to proper selection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2.1
For the purpose of selecting
tiles, floors are generally
classified into
the following
types:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) General
purpose or light duty floors, that is those subject to pedes-
trian
traffic
as in offices, domestic
buildings,
hospitals,
colleges,
b..nks, etc;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  1443 - 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Medium
duty floors, that is those subject
to heavy pedestrian
and
moderately
heavy
wheeled
traffic
from trolleys,
carts,
etc, as in
factories,
pavements,
platforms,
etc; and
railway
stations
and driveways,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Non-slip
floors ( where chequered
tiles are used ), that is footpaths
and pavements,
special factory
floors, platforms,
ramps,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

can be used for preparation
of bed for laying of tiles.
The method
of preparation
and
laying
of each
type
of mortar
shall
be
as given
in 9.1.1,
9.1.2,
9.1.3  and 9.1.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1
Cement Mortar-
Cement
mortar
shall consist of one part of Port-
land
cement
and six parts
of coarse
sand
by volume
thoroughly
mixed
manually
or by a mechanical
mixer.
The
quantity
of water
added
shall
be the minimum
necessary
to give sufficient
plasticity
and workability
for
laying.
A high water-cement
ratio will produce
a screeded
bed with
a
high drying.shrinkage
and should be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.2
Spreading  of  Cement Mortar -
Before spreading
of cement
mortar,
it
is essential
to ensure
that the base is well compacted
and the surface
is
rough to form suitable
key.
The base shall then
be cleaned
of all scum,
laitance
or plaster
droppings
or any other
loose foreign
matter.
It shall
be properly
wetted
without
allowing
any
water
pools
on
the
surface.
The mortar
shall then be evenly spread over the base for two rows of tiles
and about
three
to five metres
in length
with thread
level fixed at both
ends to act as a guide.
The
top of mortar
shall be kept rough
so that
cement
slurry
can
be
absorbed.
The
thickness
of
the
bedding
shall
normally
be not less than
10 mm and not more
than
30 mm in any one
place.
Immediately
after, the laying of tiles shall start as described
in  10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The
ingredients
shall be thoroughly
mixed
by
volume
in
dry
form.
Care
shall
be taken
to ensure
that
there
are
no hard
lumps
present.
Water shall then be added and the ingredients
thoroughly
mixed as in 9.1 .l.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.4
Spreading of Lime Mortar -
Cleaning
and wetting of the base shall
be done in the same manner
as specified in 9.1.2.
Lime mortar
shall then
be evenly
and smoothly
spread over the base and levelled
with
a screed
batten
to a slightly
rough surface for providing
key for the tiles. The thick-
ness of mortar
shall be the same as in the case of cement
mortar,
that is,
10 mm minimum
and 30 mm maximum
at any one place.
Screeds
properly
levelled shall be fixed at the correct height to suit the thickness of the screed-
cd bed.
The area of bedding
should be as much as can be covered
with
tiles during
the following
day.
The
freshly
laid portion
of the
mortar
bedding
shall be protected
from damage
by providing
suitable
barricading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.  LAYING
OF TILES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  Laying
of tiles should commence
in the next morning
by which
time
the bedding
becomes
sufficiently
hard to offer rigid cushion for the tile and
enables
masons
to place wooden
planks and squat on them.
Neat
cement
slurry
of honey-like
consistency
shall be spread over the mortar
bed,
over
such
an area at a time as would accommodate
about
20 tiles.
The
tiles
shall be fixed in this grout one after the other, each tile  being  gently tapped
with a wooden mallet till it is properly
bedded and in level with the adjoin-
ing
tiles.
The
mason
shall keep
the joints
as close as possible
and
in
straight
lines.
The joints
between
the tiles shall normally
be I.5 mm wide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2
After
the tiles have been laid in a room or the day’s
laying
work is
completed,
the surplus
cement
slurry and the joints shall be cleaned
and
washed
fairly
deep with the heIp of a broom stick.
It shah
be seen that
the cement
slurry is cleaned
before it sets hard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3
The
day after
the tiles have been laid, the joints shall be filled with
cement
grout of the same shade as the colour of the matrix
of the tile. The
freshly laid portion
of the tiles shall be prevented
from damage
by provid-
ing suitable
barricading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.4
Tiles
which
are fixed in the floor adjoining
the wall shall go about
10 mm under
the plaster,
skirting
or dado
as may
be required
by the
designer.
For
this purpose,
the wall plaster may be left unfinished
by
about
50 mm above the level of the
proposed
finished
flooring
and
the
unfinished
strip may be plastered
later on after the tiles are fixed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.5
In odd situations
where a full tile cannot
be provided,
tiles shall be
cut to size and then fixed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.6
After fixing,
the flooring
should be kept moist and allowed ‘to mature
undisturbed
for seven
days so that the bedding
and joints
set properly.
After
this,
it may
be used for light
traffic.
Heavy
traffic
shall not
be
allowed  on  the floor for at least 14 days after fixing the tiles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_11>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1443 -  1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.7  Wherever
big areas  of  floor  are to be tiled, the level
of the
central
portion
of the floor shall be kept about 10 mm higher
than the level mark-
ed at the walls unless specified
otherwise.
This is normally
done to avoid
the optical
illusion of a depression
in the central
portion
of the tiled hall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11. GRINDING
AND POLISHING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1  Grinding
and polishing
of the tiles shall be commenced
only after the
floor as well as the joints
have properly
set and in no case earlier
than
14 days of laying.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2
Grinding
should
preferably
be done
using
a machine
except
for
skirting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3
For
grinding
terrazzo
tile flooring,
the first grinding
shall be with
machine
fitted with Carborundum
stones of 48 to 60 grit.
When
the floor is
rubbed
even and chips show uniformity
it shall be cleaned
with water mak-
ing bare all pin holes.
Grouting
in the same shade is then briskly applied<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SO  that
all pin holes are properly
filled in.
The grout shall be kept moist
for a week for proper
setting.
Thereafter,
the second
grinding
operation
with Carborundum
of 120 grit is commenced.
The floor is grouted
again
to fill in fine pin holes.
After curing,
the floor is left with
this protective
film till other works are completed
and all workers
quit.
Before
the final
grinding
the floor is swept clean.
Final grinding
is then done with carbo-
rundum
of 220 to 350 grit using plenty
of water and taking
care
that
any
foreign
matter,
particles
of sand,
etc,
are
prevented.
When
surface
is
rendered
smooth,
it is washed with water.
Afterwards
oxalic
acid powder
is vigorously
applied
with machine
fitted with hessian
bobs
to bring
out
sheen.
Wash
the floor n&an and apply dry linen to suck-in
moisture.
If
desired,
wax polish may finally be applied mechanically
with clean hessian
bobs.
Superfluous
wax is mopped-up
with saw dust to prevent slipperiness.
Saw dust may be allowed to remain
on the surface
till occupation.
This
l
will protect
the surface
and help
to increase
lustre.
When
saw dust is
spread,
water
should
not be spilled as this is likely
to give stains
on the
polished
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.4
When hand grinding
and polishing
has to be adopted the various pro-
cesses in the same sequence
shall be carried
out as described
in 11.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.5
In the case of plain cement
and coloured
tiles the process of polishing
shall be the
same
as described
in 11.3
except
that initial
grinding
with
Carborundum
stone of 48 to 60 grit may not be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.6
Ctrequered
or Grooved
Tiles -
These
tiles normally
do not require
polishing.
But
where
polishing
is required,
the same shall be done as
in 11.5.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.  LAYING
OF ROUGH
TILES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.1  Where
tiles have been
supplied
and fixed in rough
condition
( not
ground
and filled by the manufacturer
), the first grinding
shall be done not<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_12>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1443 - 1972<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>less than
14 days after fixing the tiles.
The initial grinding
shall be done
with carborundum
stones of 36 to 48 grit.
The remaining
process shall be
the same as given in 11.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.  PERMISSIBLE
TOLERANCE
IN LAYING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1  The
permissible
deviation
from datum depends on the area involved;
for large open areas, a deviation
of tip to 15 mm may be tolerated.
Loca-
lized deviations
of 3 mm in any 3 m maq
be accepted
in a nominally
flat
floor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.  SKIRTING,
DAD0
WORK
AND STAIRCASE-TREAD
WORK<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1  Tile skirtings,
where required,
shall be fixed only after laying the tiles
on the floor.
If tiles are to be fixed on walls as dados, the portion
of the
wall to be so tiled shall be left unplastered.
Also, dado work shall be done
only after laying tiles on the floor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.2
Before fixing tiles on brick or concrete
wall, the wall surface shall first
be wetted
with clean water.
Thereafter,
in case of dado the wall surface
shall be evenly and uniformly
covered with about
10 mm thick
backing
of
cement
mortar
( 1 cement  :  4 coarse
sand).
In the case of skirting,
the
tiles shall
be directly
fixed with
cement
mortar
( 1  :  4 ) without
initial
backing.
Before
the cushioning
mortar
has hardened,
the back of each tile
to be fixed shall be covered with a thin layer of neat cement paste and the
tile shall
then
be gently
tapped
against
the wall with a wooden
mallet.
The
fixing
shall be done from the bottom
of the wall upwards.
Each
tile
shall
be fixed as close as possible to the one adjoining,
and any difference
in the thickneises
of the tiles shall be evened out in the cushioning
mortar or
cement paste so that all the tile faces are set in conformity
with one another.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.3
Wherever
possible,
skirtings
and dado shall be ground
and polished
just as for floor work with machine
suitable
for the purpose.
Skirtings
and
dado may also be polished by hand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.4
Precast
treads and risers for staircases
shall be laid and polished
as
for flooring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.5
The
laying
and polishing
of tiles for external
paving
shall
be done
similar
to that of ordinary
flooring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.  APPEARANCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.1  The
finished
floor shall have an even,
smooth
and shining
surface.
Joints
should be in correct
alignment.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  1  -Normally,
all freshly laid tile-floors and  dado work may show efflorescence
even after the tiles are polished.
This may be particularly noticeable in plain-tile floors.
This may not affect the quality of the tiles or of the finished floor; the same may acquire
a natural sheen after two to three months of daily cleaning.
When all the salts from
the concrete have come to the surface and are washed off, there will be no more trouble
from this cause and the floor will require less work for its upkeep.

Minor variations may occur in the shades of cement used in the matrix,
in the colour and shade of the marble chips and in the distribution of the chips over
the tiles.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16. MAINTENANCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.1 Care Immediately
After
the Work<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.1.1
After
laying,
the floor shall be allowed to remain
clean
and free
from
cement,
oil, paint,
distemper,
plaster
droppings
and all
materials
likely
to stain
or spoil the tiles.
If appliances,
such as trestles,
ladders,
steps, etc, have to be used for electrician’s,
plumber’s
and other light work,
it shall be ensured
that parts contact
with the flooring are padded
by the
contractor
doing
such work and no sliding the appliances
on the finished
flooring
is permitted.
The
owner
shall also take care,
when
the floor is
used for subsequent
operations,
that staining,
damaging
or pitting
of the
tile-work
is entirely
prevented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.1.2
Stair
finishes,
particularly
nosings, are liable
to be damaged
by
dragging
or dropping
of articles
up or down
the stairs.
It is, therefore,
necessary
to protect
the stairs against such causes of damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.2
Subsgguent
Maintenance<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.2.1
Polished
tile-floors
shall be regularly
swabbed
with clean
water
followed
by brisk rubbing
with dry linen.
If they are very dirty,
water
and soap may
be used.
Care
shall
be taken
to remove
any soap film
deposited
in washing,
as failure to do so will result
in the floor
becoming
slippery
and dull-looking.
Use of’soda,
acid, etc, shall be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.2.2
Resistance
to staining
is, to a great extent,
dependent
upon
the
degree of maintenance.
Where
bad stains
have occurred,
the advice
of
the manufacturer
of the tiles may perferably
be sought
for their
removal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.3
Proper
maintenance
of the floor, after it has been completed
with the
final
polish,
rests with the owner and the owner should be furnished
with
the necessary
information
and instructions
for such maintenance
by the
tile-laying
contractor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
