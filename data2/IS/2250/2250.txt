FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
(First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 27 February
1981, after the draft finalized by the
Building Construction Practices Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Choice of masonry mortar is governed by several considerations, such
as type of masonry,
situation of use, degree
of exposure
to weather,
strength re*quirements, besides special considerations
like fire resistance,
insulation, rate of setting and hardening, etc.
The ingredients for mortar
have also a wide variety.
Cementitious
ingredients
may be cement or
lime or combinations
of these and with or without addition of pozzolanas,
plasticizers, etc.
The aggregates
may be sand, burnt-clay
aggregate or
cinder.
As many of these ingredients have a wide variation
in charac-
teristics, the proportions in which they are to be mixed depend largely on
practical
experience with local materials. However, with the development
of standard specifications to govern the quality of cement, lime, sand and
other
pozzolanic
materials,
it is possible to apply some of the basic
principles for selection and use of masonry mortars, which have accrued
as a result of research work in this field in the country and abroad.
This
standard is intended to provide such guidance
regarding
properties and
use of masonry mortars.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard,
published in 1965, was intended to bring out a long
felt uniformity
in the variety
of practices
being followed
by various
organizations in the country in the preparation of cement mortars, cement
lime mortars and their
use is masonry
works.
A separate
standard,
namely IS  :  1625, was published
in 1962 and revised
in 197 1 covering
information
regarding
properties and preparation
of lime mortars
and
their use in masonrv works.
The Sectional
Committee
resoonsible
for
the
the
preparation
of ihis standard,
while taking- up this revision, felt that
requirements
for both cement mortars and lime mortars should be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2250 -  1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>brought
together
in one
standard.
Thus,
this
revision
is
prepared
incorporating
the
provision
of
IS:
1625-1971”
and
to
incorporate
improvements
found necessary
in the light of the usage
of the standard,
and
the
suggestions
made
by
various
organizations
implementing
it.
IS  :  1625-1971”
will be withdrawn
with the printing
of this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1
In this revision,
number
of changes
have been incorporated.
The
most significant
being the gradation
of masonry
mortars
only  in
terms
of.
their
minimum
compressive
strength
( at the
age
of 28 days),
since
proportioning
of mortars
by loose volume would not allow adjustment
to
take
care
of variations
in the quality
of the ingredients
(see Table
1).
However,
volumetric
proportioning
( by loose volume ) being
the only
practice
being
followed
in the
country,
mortars
in terms
of different
nominal
mix
proportions
and
which
would
give the
range
of above
compressive
strengths
( at the age of 28 days ) have also been included
in
this
revision
as a guidance
to the
users.
The
technical
committee
responsible
for the preparation
of this revision
feels that where facilities
for determining
the actual
mix proportion
corresponding
to the specified
grade
are not available,
the nominal
mixes
as specified
in this revision
may be used.
The
committee
in this
respect
recognises
the existence
of additional
mixes
other
than
what
has been
included
in this revision,
which
might
provide
greater
flexibility
of choice
to the users,
But it is
f+
that inclusion
of all possible combinations
might not only burden
the
code but
also might not be needed for the construction
of great majority
of masonry.
The
committee
also appreciates
the necessity
o[ reflecting
the expected
increase
in strength
of lime based
mortars
after
28
days,
which
is otherwise
the basis of gradation
of masonry
mortars,
and feels
the
necessity
of including
a provision
for
taking
advantage
of this
expected
increased
strength.
But
in the absence
of definite
technical
data, the concept
of substantial
growth
in strength
of lime based
mortars
after
28 days is being excluded
from the present version.
Investigations
are in progress
and the information
will be added
in the
standard
as
and when
available.
Further,
the method
of mixing
the ingredients
for
various
types of mortars
has been dealt in detail in this revision and the
method
of determining
the
compressive
strength
of mortars
has been
modified.
Only SI units have been used in this revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For the purpose
of deciding
whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or

the
result
of

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Durability<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  The
durability
of masonry
mortars
depends
upon the following
factors:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Volumetric
changes
during
the process of setting, hardening,
and
later
due to temperature
variations
or due to moisture
move-
ments
in the surroundings,
and the extent
to which the mortar
will
internally
accommodate
the
stresses
induced
by
these
volumetric
changes
before
yielding;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The
nature
and
distribution
of the resulting
cracks,
whether
as
fine
cracks
well-distributed
throughout
or
large
localized
cracks;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The
extent
to which
the
bond
between
the mortar
and
the
masonry
units is ruptured
by volumetric
changes
and structural
movements
resulting
not only in reduction
in strength
of masonry
but also in provision
of channels
of seepage for water and other
solution
into the masonry
which
would

to a masonry
mortar
in course of time.
Generally,
the effect
of temperature
fluctuations
is negligible
compared
to that of
moisture
variation.
If there is excessive
volume
change
due to alternate
wetting
and drying,
the bond
between
the mortar
and the masonry
is
liable to be destroyed,
causing
cracks to appear in the hard set mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3.2
Since
lime
mortars
undergo
only negligible
volume
change
after
setting
and initial
shrinkage
and the hardening
of the mortar
is
also a slow process, the mortar
is able to retain its bond with the masonry
unit and be free from cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3.3
Lime
mortars
are also able to take
normal
movements
in
masonry
mortar
caused
by
volume
changes
by
virtue
of internal
accommodation;
in this process it will undergo
elastic or creep deformations
and may recover
fully or partly.
The
extensibility
of masonry mortar,
which
indicates
its capacity
for internal
accommodation,
ranges from 2
to
3 x
10-4.
This
is
generally
larger
than
the
volume
change
( maximum
shrinkage)
that
normally
occurs
in
lime
mortars
on
hardening.
Because
of the accommodation
of the mortar,
the
stresses
that develop due to various
deformations,
such as expansion,
contraction
and
deflection,
will
get distributed
in the mortar
and their intensities
will be low.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4
Resistance
to Sulphate
Attack -
The
sources
of sulphate
giving rise
to this trouble
will be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) in exceptional
circumstances,
sulphate
derived
from
the
brick
constituting
the masonry
unit;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) sulphate
contained
in the sand or fine aggregate
use-l
in the
mortar
where
sulphate
content
in these has to be allowed
high
from economic
consideration;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) sulphate
from soil in the case of masonry
in contact
with soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4.1
The
cement
in the mortar
will
undergo
expansive
reaction
in the presence
of sulphate,
which
will
lead
to cracks in the mortar.
Where
serious
sulphate
attack
is expected,

Other
general
precautions
to be taken against sulphate

as well

workmanship
are
covered
in
IS:
2212-1962*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2  Hardening
of Mortar-A
masonry
mortar
should
harden
at
such
a rate that
it causes
no delay
in the progress
of work,
but at the
same
time
it is able to retain
its plastic properties
for a sufficient
interval
till the initial
shrinkage
of the mortor
is complete.
This
will minimize
the danger
of cracks
and opening
of joints
in masonry.
The
rate
of
hardening
of lime
mortars
is slower
than that of cement
mortars,
but is
satisfactory
for most of the normal
building
works,
except
where
high
strength
is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Strength
Development<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1  Strength
development
is
an,
important
requirement
before
masonry
is loaded
to the full extent,
and the rate of construction
should
synchronize&th
the development
of the strength on masonry,
particularly
in the case of masonry
with weak mortars,
Extra
time shall be allowed
for
hardening
of mortar
when
the
atmospheric
temperature
during
construction
is very low ( minimum
5%
in 24 h ).
The
period
will have
to be increased
by 100 percent
for the time during which the temperature
remains
below
5°C
and by 50 percent
for the time when temperature
is
between
5 and 10°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2
The
strength
of lime
mortars
is dependent
on the class of lime
(see
IS:
712-1973t)
and
other
constituents
used
in
the
mortar
(see Table
1 ).
Incorporation
of cement
and/or pozzolana
in lime mortar
mixes made with Class B and Class E lime will increase
the strength
and
rate
of
hardening
of
the
mortars
without
appreciably
reducing
workability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Qpantity
of Water-The
quantity
of water
to be added
to the
mortar
shall
be such that
the working
consistency
(see 2.1  )  is  obtained.
Excess
water shall be avoided.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.  GRADE
OF MORTAR<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Masonry
mortars
shall
preferably
be specified
by the grade in terms
of their
minimum
compressive
strength
as given
in Table
1.
Masonry
mortars
in terms of mix proportion
which gives the range of compressive
strength
( at the
age
of 28 days  )  values
are also given in Table

<<HEADING level=3>>9. CONSISTENCY
OF MASONRY
MORTARS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  The working
consistency
of the mortar
is usually judged
by the worker
during
application.
The
water
should
be
enough
to
maintain
the
fluidity
of the mortar
during
application,
but at the same
time it shall
not be excessive
leading
to segregation
of aggregates
from the cementi-
tious
material.
‘The
quantity
of
water
needed
for
maintaining
consistency
or fluidity
will also depend
upon the masonry
to which the
mortar
is used;
for example,
thinner
joints
will require
greater
fluidity;
bed joints
subject
to heavy pressure
may require
stiffer mortar.
Also, the
mortar
should
be able to hold the water against
suction by the masonry
unit, particularly
in the case of burnt
clay and concrete
products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.1  The consistency
of mortars
shall be measured
in accordance
with
the procedure
given
in Appendix
B and the following
values of depth of
penetration
are recommended.<<HEADING_END>>

Retentivity
--Measurement
of water
retentivity
may
be
necessary
only in the case where mortar
is to be used with masonry
unit
which
has got high
suction
characteristics.
Water
retentivity
shall
be
determined
as described
in Appendix
C and the flow after suction in the
test shall not be less than 70 percent
of the flow before suction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The
apex of the penetrating
cone shall
be brought
first in contact
with the surface
of the mortar and the cone
clamped
in position.
The
instrument
dial is set to be in contact
with a
cone at this position.
The cone is then released
and allowed
to sink into
the mortar
mix.
After the cone has stopped penetrating
into the mortar,
the
dial
is once
more
set to record
the position
of the cone
and the
difference
between
dial readings
before
and after
penetration
gives the
depth of penetration
of the cone into the mortar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

shall
be
held
by
hand
in
a
