<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Third Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, atler the draft finalized
by the Flooring, Wall Finishing and Roofing Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen-mastic has been considered very suitable for use in the flooring of industrial buildings, warehouses,
grain storage structures
and surfacing of bridge decks, roads, foot-paths,
etc, because of its resiliency,
imperviousness, wearing quality and ease of maintenance. Bitumen-mastic may also be used as a base coat to
receive floor coverings, such as linoleum, flexible PVC sheets and rubber. This standard was first published in
1958 and was revised in 1968. In the second revision a number of changes have been made on account of the
experience gained on the uses of bitumen-mastic since 1968. A number of grades of mastic suitable to various
types of flooring have been incorporated. Recommendations with respect to thicknesses of bitumen-mastic of
various grades to various types of floor covering have also been added for guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this third revision besides updating the referred Indian Standards, the details of materials and the values
given in Table 1 have been modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>[n the formulation
of this standard due weightage has been given to international co-ordination among the
standards and practices prevailing in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field in
this country. This has been met by referring to the following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>BS  598 (Parts 1and 2) :1974 Sampling and examination of bituminous mixtures for roads and buildings.

(limestone

<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for formulation of this standard is given at Annex F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2:1960
‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised)’.
The number of significant places retained in
the rounded off value shou,d be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard covers the requirements for four
grades of bitumen-mastic for buildings, composed of
ground limestone or any other racks, coarse aggregate,
limestone

definitions and those given in IS 334 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 Bitumen-mastic flooring are graded according to
usage as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1  Asphaltic

<<HEADING level=3>>6  MANUFACTURE AND COMPOSITION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3.1 The percentage and size of coarse aggregate
incorporated in the bitumen-mastic will be dependent
primarily upon the thickness of the finished work. The
size shall be within the limits specified in Table 3.
The percentage shall be such that the total percentage
of material retained on a 600-micron
IS Sieve, on
analysis of the bitumen-mastic as laid, including the
material derived from the fine aggregate, shall fall
within the appropriate limits specified in Table 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  The fine aggregate,
as specified
in 4.2.1 and
pigment if required shall be thoroughly incorporated
at a temperature between 175°C and 205°C with the
requisite
proportion
of bitumen.
The requisite
proportion of coarse aggregate shall be incorporated
either during manufacture of the bitumen-mastic
or
during remelting on site of work. Where the total
percentage
of coarse aggregate
does not exceed
35 percent and/or 4.75 mm in size, wherever possible
the whole
of this shall be incorporated
during
manufacture.
In cases where the material
is not
required for immediate use, it shall be cast into blocks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

than 25 mm. While still warm the specimen shall be
loosened from the plate and a representative portion
weighing not less than 10 kg shall be forwarded to
the laboratory for examination with full particulars as
given in 8.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The determination

filter paper shall be dried at 100° to 120”C, placed in
a large weighing bottle or jar, cooled in a desiccator
and weighed. The filter paper shall then be fi~ed into
the gauze cylinder to form a complete lining, The
sample shall be warmed just sufficiently to facilitate
breaking up, and a representative portion, obtained if
possible by quartering, shall be weighed to the nearest
0.05 percent of weight taken and transferred without
loss to the filter paper and placed inside the gauze
cylinder.
Alternatively,
the cylinder and its paper
lining may be placed on the balance and the material
weighed
into it. The gauze cylinder shall then be
placed inside the pot and 800 to 1 500 ml of the
solvent, according to the size of the extractor, shall
be poured over the sample. The cover shall be bolted
on with the dried gasket in position. Atler fixing the
reflux condenser, heat shall be applied to the pot and
so adjusted as to avoid intense local heating, but at
the same time to ensure a steady reflux action of 2 to 5
drops per second falling from the end of the condenser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

HARDNESS NUMBER<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E-1 DEFINITION OF HARDNESS NUMBER<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E-2 APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hardness number is the figure denoting the depth,
in hundredths of a centimetre, to which a flat-ended
indentation pin in the form of a steel rod 6.35 mm in
diameter will penetrate the mastic under a load of
31.7 kg, applied for one minute, the temperature being
maintained at 35 + 0.5°C or 45 + 0.5° C as specified.
The
load
is equivalent
to
100 kg/cm2
and
is
conveniently
applied by means of a lever giving a
suitable mechanical advantage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In  preparing samples for test, the mastic as laid shall

into moulds
which
are not less than

samples, which shall be taken in duplicate shall be
moulded to a thickness of 25 mm. Where it is necessary
to make a test on samples cut from the floor, special
precautions should be taken to ensure .tiat the sample
is of uniform thickness and that the base is level. The
sample should not be remelted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

adjusted lightly but fmly
in contact with the surface
of the sample, the pressure being no greater than is
necessary to prevent lateral movement in the specimen.
The requisite load shall then be applied for exactly
