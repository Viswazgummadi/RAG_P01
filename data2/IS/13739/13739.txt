<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,

had been approved
by the River Valley Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Occurrences
of flood damages is a natural phenomenon
and man had to cope with flood situations
from the very begining.
Floods have ravaged portions of India from time immemorial
even before
the population
of Jndia grew up and economic
activities developed, Earlier, the flood waters spread
over the flood plains, flowed back to the streams/rivers
and emptied
into the sea in course of time
without causing much of problems.
However,
as human settlements started
growing
close to the
river banks and with increased
population
pressure
and greater economic development,
more and
more of the flood plains got occupied leading to adverse
flood effect being felt in an acute manner
by people. Flood hazard is thus a dynamic quantity as it changes in response both to the magnitude
of the flood event and to the nature and scale of the development
on the flood plain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>-1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
lays down
a detailed
scientific
procedure
for collection
of flood damages (other
than
loss of human life ) data
under
various
categories and also methods of translating
them
to monetary terms. It also recommends
methods
by which indirect flood losses could be estimated
in monetary terms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Methodology
of Data Collection<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The standard
methods
of data collection
are
either
through
the
complete
enumeration
or
through
sample surveys. The methodology
based
on sample surveys, is however normally adopted
and followed.
This involves an elaborate
proce-
dure
under
which
the states are divided into
zones on the basis of their exposure
to flood
risk and subsequent
selection of sample villages
large enough to provide
fairly accurate estimate
of crop damages. The field work involves pre-
flood,
past flood,
inter-flood
and
post-flood
enquiry.
The damage data of the selected village
is then to be used to make an estimate of crop
damages
for the district or part of the district
concerned.
Such sampling techniques
be applied
only under expert statistical guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 CONCEPT
OF FLOOD DAMAGES<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flood
damages
may be defined
as all adverse
effects caused
by rising
stage and spilling of
water over the banks of rivers in an area, such
events
occurring
at times and
in magnitudes
that cannot be predicted
accurately,
and as a
consequence
of
which
the serviceability
of
properties
is impaired
or lost and by
which
productive
or service activities and processes are
delayed or interrupted.
These damages may be
caused by rivers, canal breaches and rainstorms,
inundating
the adjacent
areas. The nature
and
quantum of the damage depends upon the season,
frequency,
duration and intensity of the flood.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Field Investigation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The actual
field work to be carried out may be
categorized
into four distinct parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4 DAMAGE TO AGRICULTURAL
CROPS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In India,
agricultural
crop damages
constitute
the major
portion
of the total
flood damage.
Since such damages would obviously be the basis
for the benefit cost analysis of flood protection
measures,
it is important
that
data
on crop
damage is collected on scientific basis. To devise
a scientific method of data collection
and evalu-
ation,
it is necessary to identify
the influencing
factors
and understand
the process
by which
damages are caused.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4  .S Flood Damages
and Hydrological
Factors
Recurring
floods increase the gross flooded areas
and introduce
complications
in the assessment
of damages.
Till the flood season is off, the
possibility
of
reflooding
~of fields
cannot
be
ruled
out.
Some
plots
where
there
is cent
percent damage in the first flood may be re-sown
but again
be exposed
to the risk of subsequent
floods. However,
one can
anticipate
very few
such
cases
if the
interval
(which of course,
cannot be foretold)
between successive floods is
too small to permit
growing of any new crop.
The necessity
of
covering
the
possibility
of
subsequent
flood
risks points
to the
need for
extension of pre-flood
enquiry
to such plots,
where there
can be likely changes of crops after
the attack of the first flood.
In short throughout
the flood season,
it is required
to be watchful
and be ready
to note
down any
change in the
crop position
of plots.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F ‘load damages can be attributed
to two sets of
ii ndependent factors:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Natural
factors
like topography
of
the
plot its proximity
to the river, the water
level in the river discharge, the velocity of
the movement
of water
on the plot, the
rainfall
and a number
of other
climatic
factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Facto:s attributed
to the crops like capa-
city of the plot
to withstand
water ( to
certain
depth
and duration
)~, the height
of the crop at the time of occurrence
of
flood,
and its hold
on the soil etc. It is
evident
that
if the depth
of flooding is
more
than the height
of a plant
for a
certain
duration,
then the plant does not
survive
the depths
of floodirg
and the
duration of stagnation fairly well represent
the combined
effect of the variables like
topography
of the plot, water flow, rain-
fall, water level in the river etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4  Assessment
of Bamages<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assessment of damages is possible only after the
recession of water from
the fields.
Many plots
which appear to have sustained
damage at the
time of floods may later be found to have their
crops reviving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following variables have a bearing upon the
extent of damage:
The normal
yield,
should be published
as by
states as assessed. In the case of partial damage,
the physical
loss is the difference
between the
normal
yield
and
the
realised
yield.
Partial
damage in a plot can
occur
in two
situations
when (i) only a portion of the plot is completely
damaged,
the
other
remaining
more
or less
intact, and (ii) the damage is spread
uniformly
throughout
the plot
not easily discernible but is
later discovered
by a sharp decrease in the actual
yield of the plot.
The former is more
often the
case with plots on the banks of the river; during
floods,
crops in some portion
of such plots are
swept away.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Maximum depth of flood water in plot;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Duration
of flood water; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Age of the crop in days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Duration
of flooding is reckoned
to be the period
between the date of onset of the flood and date
of complete recession from the plot. Depth and
duration
of flood water are generally
indicative
of the plot being low lying or at a higher level.
Greater
depth
and longer duration of flooding
in a plot imply that the plot is at low level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Villages

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.1  When
the
crop
grown
is completely
damaged and the plot is not capable of being re-
sown, the loss to the cultivator
is equal
to the
value of the crops damaged minus the expenses
he has not incurred on Some agricultural
opera-
tions like harvesting,
threshing, etc. If the revival
of the same crop
or sowing some
other crop in
the same season is possible on
the
same plot,
the loss to
the cultivator
is simply the cost he
has so far (up to the time of flood event) incurred
on all inputs and operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If any village is regularly
flooded
due to over-
flowing
of
river
water
and
not
due to the
occurence
of any kind of breach, then it may be
possible to anticipate
some relationship
between
the highest
flood level or maximum water dis-
charge and the damages occurring in the village.
But to establish
any such
relatiocship,
time
series data over a number of years
on water
level readings (nor discharge ) and damages
in
the
village
evaluated
at constant
prices,
is
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Continuous
stagnation
of water may sometimes
result in late sowing of crops
of the current or
the next season.
This means that the survey has
to be carried
through to the next season also to
estimate
the reduction
in yield on account of
late
sowing.
Some
plots
are
permanently
damaged
on account
of river erosion or due to
sand deposits.
Cultivation
of
such
plots
is
possible
only after
effective reclamation.
This
loss can be evaluated
on the basis of factual
data of the cost of reclamation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>From the assessed crop damages

can be prepared.
For
monentary
evaluation,
the

next
harvest season is taken into account.
But
harvest price
is not available at the time of the
initial assessment
of damages.
Hence is sugges-

price prevailing at the time of field
enquiry be deflated on past year’s experience

price of crop may be used for the evaluation of
crop damage.
For monetary
evaluation
of the

damage
to
the
crop
either
at the
district or zonal level,
the
simple
average of
prices
(whether
deflated

harvests) of the crop in the selected villages may
be used. Neither
the
wholesale
price nor the
retail price
but only the price prevailing
at the

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2 These damages
can be assessed
by actual
estimates

The loss is the same as the amount spent
on repairs
or restoration.
But, it should be
ensured
by exercise
of proper
checks
that the
estimates are not exaggerated.

the industrial properties,
can be seen by the same
