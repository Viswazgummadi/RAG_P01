Sectional Committee,

<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau
of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by
the Water-proofing
and Damp-proofing
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen felts may be of different
types depending
upon the raw material
used and their cons-
truction.
IS 1322  :  1993 ‘Specification
for bitumen felts for water
proofing and damp-proofing
(fourth
revision )’  and IS 7193  :  1993 ‘Specification for glass fibre base coal tar pitch and bitumen felts
(first revision )‘,  covers bitumen felts of hessian based and glass fibre base respectively.
The above
standards require amongst other requirements,
detailed testing of these products.
Various methods
of test relating to each product for determination
of physical
properties
have been included
in the
separate standards.
All types of felts have to satisfy some common essential physical rtquirements
for which methods ~of test are same.
A series of standards covering methods of test have therefore
been formulated
to cover the determination
of various
physical
requirements
of bitumen
felt.
This standard covers pressure head test. Other parts of the standard are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1 Breaking strength test
Part 2
Pliability test
Part 3
Storage sticking test
Part 5
Heat resistance test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IL<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 6
Water absorption
test
Part 7
Determination
of binder content<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition
of the technical
committee
responsible
for the formulation
of this standard is
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded off
in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised)‘.
The number
of significant places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified.
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

a m~anner that
when the test piece
is clamped
down, a part of it is always extending
beyond
the clamping plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of the Standard Mark is governed
by the provisions
of the  Bureau of  Indian
Standards Act, 1986  and the Rules and Regulations
made thereunder.
The Standard Mark on
products
covered by an Indian Standard conveys the assurance that they have been produced
to comply with the requirements
of that standard under a well defined system of inspection,
testing and quality control which is devised and supervised by BlS and operated by the pro-
ducer.
Standard marked products are also continuously
checked
by BIS for conformity
to
that standard as a further safeguard.

are needed,
it
is taken
up for
