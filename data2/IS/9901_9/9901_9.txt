<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This
Indian
Standard
( Part 9 ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 9 April
1986, after
the
draft
finalized
by
the
Acoustics
Sectional

had
been
approved
by the Electronics

Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
This method
utilizes a laboratory
space so arranged
that
it simulates
a pair of horizontally
adjacent
typical
offices or rooms sharing
a common
suspended
ceiling
system,
plenum
space and a dividing
wall.
The
divi-
ding
wall
extends
to the underside
of the ceiling
system which at the
junction
is either
continuous
or discontinuous.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The
quantity
being
measured
is
the
ceiling
normalized
level
difference.
Measurements
are
considered
to
be
valid
only when the
sound transmitted
by -paths other than the suspended
ceiling
and common
plenum
space is negligible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 The
method
may
be
extended
to include
the study of composite
ceiling
systems comprising
the
ceiling
material
and
other
components
such as luminaires
and ventilating
systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
The
method
may
also be extended
to the study
of the additional
sound
insulation
that
may
be
achieved
by
auxiliary
systems such as
material
used either
as plenum
barriers,
or as backing
for all of, or
part
of, the ceiling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.  TEST ARRANGEMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Requirements
for the Laboratory<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1  The
laboratory
test facility
is divided
into two rooms of approxi-
mately
equal
volumes
by a wall.
The essential
features
of the test facility
are listed below and are shown schematically
in Fig.
1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1.1
Construction of the test facility
-
The
test
facility
shall
be
rectangular
parallelepiped.
It is recommended
that
a vibration
break
be
provided
in  the  outer walls, floor and roof of the facility
in order to
esnure
that
flanking
sounds
transmitted
by
paths
other
than
the
suspended
ceiling
and common
plenum
space are negligible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
level of the background
noise shall be sufficiently
low to permit
a measurement
of the
sound
transmitted
from the source room taking
into consideration
the power output of the source room and the isolating
properties
of the
specimens
for which the laboratory
is  intended.
The
reverberation
time in each room should be greater
than  1 s  at
all
one-
third
octave
bands
of measurement
with no plenum
lining
and no test
specimen
in place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
For  the purpose of determining
the reverberation
time
of both
rooms,
a
suitable
impervious
plenum
barrier
shouId
be installed
between
the
top
of the
dividing
wall and the roof.

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1.2  Dimensions of the test facility -
The width  of the
test
facility
shall be 4.5 & 0’5 m and the  height from the ground
to the underside
of
the face of the suspended
ceiling shall be 2.8 & @2 m when all dimensions
are mea,sured
internally.
The volume
V of each room should be at least
50 m3
and
the
dividing
wall
should
be
positioned
such that the two
room
volumes
will
differ
by
at least
10 percent
when the ceiling
is in
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NoTE 1 -It
is  realized that existing facilities may have room
volumes less
than  50 m3, as low  as  40 ms.  Such facilities will  be  allowable in accordance with
this standard in cases where diffusing elements are employed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE 2 -
The limitations and room dimensions as stated above are intended to
improve reproducibility between measurements made by different organizations on
similar materials.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1.3
Dividing wall -
This is defined as the ceiling height acoustical
barrier
which
divides the test facility into two rooms.
The
wall
should
be tapered
at
its upper
extremity
so that
its overall
thickness at the
capping
is not greater
than
100 mm.
The tapering
between
the
widest
part
of the wall and the capping
will be achieved
by means
of an angle
not exceeding
30” from the vertical.
The
construction
of the
dividing
wall
shall
be
of such
materials
that its sound insulation
is 10 dB more
than that of any ceiling
which
is likely to be tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
For
checking
the sound insulation
of the facility,
a suitable
plenum
barrier of construction
similar to the dividing wall can be installed between
the top
of the dividing wall and the roof.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1.4  Plenum depth -
The
plenum
depth should be between
650 mm
and 760 mm as measured
from the upper face
of the
suspended
ceiling
to the
underside
of the
roof
of the test facility.
This
dimension
also
applies to the gap between
the top of the dividing
wall and the roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1.5
Plenum lining -
One side
wall
and
both
end
walls
of the
plenum
should
be lined
with suitable
sound absorbing
material.
This
material
is to have such properties
that when tested as a plain absorber
in
accordance
with IS  :  8225-1976*,
it  will have absorption
coefficients
not
less than those shown below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Difusers -
If necessary,
diffuser

may be installed
in
the rooms so as to improve
the diffusion

of the Test Ceiling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1
The detail of joining
the ceiling
to the top of the dividing

is of critical
importance
and care shall be taken
to simulate

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2
The
area
of
a continuous
ceiling
shall
be
equal
to the area
denoted

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3
For a discontinuous
ceiling,
it may be necessary
to add additional
capping
to the top  of the dividing
wall
to complete
the junction.
The
area
of
a discontinuous
ceiling
shall then be equal to the area denoted
by the length
and width of the test facility
less the
area
of the
adapter
cap on the top of the dividing
wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4
The ceiling
components
shall be selected
to  represent
those which
would be used in actual

The ceiling
shall be installed
in accordance
with the recommended
practice
of the
manufacturer
or

OF RESULTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  For the statement
of results,
the
ceiling
normalized
level
difference
of the
test
specimen
should be given at all frequencies
of measurement,
in tabular
form and/or in the form of a curve.
For graphs
with the level
in decibels
plotted
against
frequency
on a logarithmic
scale,
the
length
for
10  :  1 frequency
ratio should
be equal to the length
for 10 dB, 25 dB
or 50 dB on the ordinate
scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>EXAMPLE
OF TEST
PROCEDURE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>An example of a test procedure which will normally be expected
to
give repeatability
as indicated in IS  : 9901 (  Part 2 )-1981”  is  given below.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The dimensions and shape of the test facility are shown in the figure.
The walls, floor and roof of this structure are preferably
constructed from
heavy masonry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The measurement is carried out in both directions with a loudspeaker
installed
in each
room
during the entire test.
The ceiling normalized
level difference is measured separately for each direction of test; the value
reported is the arithmetic
average of the two results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9901 ( Part 9 ) - 1986<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The loudspeaker
is placed facing
one corner
of each
room
and
the
sound
field
in each
room sampled
with six randomly
distributed
micro-
phone
positions.
No
microphone
should
approach
closer
than
0.7 m
to any surface
and microphone
positions should be separated
by a distance
of at least 0.5 m.
Sound pressure level readings
are taken
at each micro-
phone position
using an averaging
time of at least 5 s in
each
frequency
band
at each position.
One-third
octave band filters are used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
equivalent
absorption
area
is determined
from decay curves
measured
using six
microphone
positions
with
one
reverberation
time
analysis
at each position.
The
reverberation
time is evaluated
from the
averaged
slope over a convenient
range
beginning
about one-tenth
second
or
a few decibels
down from the beginning
of the decay,
the range
used
being not less than 20 dB, nor so large that the slope changes
by 20 percent,
nor  SO  that background
noise interferes
with the results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
