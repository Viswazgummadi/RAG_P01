FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1
This Indian
Standard
( Part 26 ) ( Second
Revision
) was adopted
by
the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on 30 *June 1987,
after the draft finalized
by the Soil Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 With a view to establishing
uniform
producers
for the determination
of different
characteristics
of soils and
also for
facilitating
a comparative
study of the results,
the
Bureau
of
Indian
Standards
has
brought
out
Indian
Standard
methods
of test for soils
( IS  :  2720 ) which
have been
published
in parts.
This part
covers the method
for determination
ofpH
value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The acidic or alkaline
characteristics
of a soil
sample
can be quanti-
tatively
expressed
by means
of the
hydrogen
ion-activity
commonly
designated
aipH,
which is conveniently
expressed
by the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>#H =
-
1
log], ( H+ > = log 10 H+<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>wherein,
H+ is the hydrogen
ion-concentration
in moles/litre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In pure water,
at 25’C,
H+ =
1 *OO x 10 --7 and thus PH -
7.00.
This value corresponds
to exact
neutrality.
At
this
temperature,
acidic
solutions have pH values less than 7 ( H+ 10-r ) and alkaline
solutions have
PH values greater
than
7 ( H+ 10-r ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Two methods,
namely,
electrometric
method
( standard
method
) and
calorimetric
method
are commonly
used to determine
$H values of soil-
water
solutions.
The pH is measured
electrometrically
by means
of an
electrode
assembly
consisting
of one
glass
electrode
and
one
calomel
reference
electrode
with a saturated
potassium chloride
solution.
Potassium
chloride
is used for the salt bridge because of the fact that the transference
of the K+ and Cl-
ions takes
place
at the rate
in true solution.
The PH<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  2720 ( Part 26 ) - 1987<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>determination
by this method
is based on the assumption
that the potential
recorded
is totally
due
to
the
potential
difference
across
the
glass
membrane
brought
about
the
difference
in H+
ion
activity,
between
solutions inside and outside
the glass
electrode.
The
outside
solution
is
hydrochloric
acid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5
The calorimetric
method
can be considered
as approximate
but rapid.
A calorimetric
pH
indicator
is an organic
dye,
the colour
of which
is
controlled
by the hydrogen
ion activity
in solution.
This method
is useful
for determination
of soil pH, both in the laboratory
as well as in the field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6
Several
factors
are known
to affect the pH value
of a particular
soil
sample.
Prominent
amongst
these
are soil-water
ratio,
soluble
salts con-
centration,
carbon
dioxide
pressure,
exchangeable
cations
and tempera-
ture.
With the dilution
of soil suspension,
its pH increases.
Increase
in salt
concentration
in general,
decreases
the PH.
A definite
relationship
exists
between
carbon dioxide
pressure
of soil air and @H, for example,
thepH
of
calcareous
soils is reduced
in proportion
to the logarithm
ofcarbon
dioxide
pressure
of soil air.
In
alkaline
soils,
the pH is principally
influenced
by
exchangeable
cations.
With
increase
in temperature,
pH decreases.
The
evaluation
factors
associated
with soil pH shall thus be based
on
the full
consideration
of the soil constituents
and not on pH value alone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.7 The hydrogen-ion
concentration
of soil water
solution
is of interest
in problems
involving
grouting
in weak
rocks,
soil stabilisation
processes
using lime and resinuous
materials,
corrosion
of metals
in contact
with
soils and reclamation
of marine
soils. The pH value also helps in interpret-
ing some of the soil chemical
tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.8 This
standard
was first published
in 1967 and revised in 1973.
In this
revision,
procedures
have been
elaborated
and pro forma for presentation
of result have been added.
The references
in
respect
of equipments
have
been updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.9
In reporting
the result of a test or analysis made
in accordance
with
this standard,
if the final value, observed
or calculated,
is to be rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  : 2-1960*.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The buffer solutions
shall be stored in well stoppered
bottles.
These
solutions are susceptible
to mould growth and hence may deteriorate
in storage,
Hence it is advisable either to use freshly prepared solution
or to add toluene or a
crystal of thymol to the solution prior to storing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

prepared
as in 2.3,
shall he taken in a

75 ml of distilled
water
( see Note )
shall be added to it. The suspension
shall be stirred for a few seconds.
The
beaker
shall then be covered
with a cover

to stand
for
one hour, with occasional
stirring.
It shall
be again
stirred
well immedi-
ately before testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
The distilled water used should be aerated by bubbling air through it
for some time.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4.1  The PH meter shall he calibrated
by means of the standard
buffer
solutions
following
the procedure
recommended
by the manufacturer.
The
electrodes
shall he washed with distilled
water dried
with the help
of an
ordinary
filter paper and
then
immersed
in the
soil suspension.
Two or
three readings
of the PH of the
soil suspension
shall
be
made with brief
stirring
in between
each
reading.
The
reading
should
agree
within
f
O-05 PH units ( the $H readings
of the soil suspension
should
reach
a
constant
value in about one
minute.
No
readings
should
be
taken
until
the @H meter has reached
equilibrium
). The electrodes
shall be removed
from the suspension
immediately
and
washed
with
distilled
water.
The
calibration
of the pH meter shall be again
checked
with one of the stan-
dard buffer solutions.
If the instrument
is out of adjustment
by more than
0.05 #H units, it shall be set to the correct
adjustment
till consistent
read-
ings are obtained
( when not in use, the electrodes
shall
be left standing
in a beaker
of distilled
water ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
