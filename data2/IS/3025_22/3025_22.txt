<<HEADING level=3>>(  First Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope
-
Prescribes
the indicator
and potentiometric
methods for determination
of acidity.
These
methods are applicable
to  the determination
of acidity
in water and waste water.
The applicable
range
is O-5 to 500 mg/l acidity
as CaCO,.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Principle
and  Theory -
Acidity
of water
is its quantitative
capacity
to react with a strong
base
to a designated
pH.
It may be defined
as equivalent
concentration
of hydrogen
ions in mg/l.
The
equation
in its simplest
form is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hf + NaOH = H,O + Na+<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. interferences
-
A  fading
and temporary
end point
characterizes
the
phenolphthalein
acidity
titration
performed
at room temperature
on a sample containing
iron and aluminium
sulphate.
Better
results
are obtained
by titrating
the sample at boiling
temperature.
Acid samples from mine drainage
are subjected
to interferences.
Coloured
or turbid
samples
may interfere
in end point.
Analyse
such
samples by potentiometric
titration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Deionized
water may be used provided
that it
has a conductance
of less than 2 &cm
and a pH more than 6.0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in 100 ml, 1: 1 ( v/v)
alcohol
water
mixture
and add 0.02 N sodium hydroxide
solution
drop by drop till very faint pink colour is observed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 /ndicator  Method
-
Pipette 20 ml or a suitable
aliquot
of sample into a loo-ml beaker.
The sample
size shall be so selected
so that not more than 20 ml of titrant
is needed for the titration.
Determine
the pH of water.
If  pH  is less than 3.7, add two drops of methyl orange indicator
into the first sample
beaker and titrate
with standard
0.02 N sodium
hydroxide
solution
until the colour changes to the faint
orange characteristic
of pH 3.7.
Record the volume of sodium hydroxide
used.
To the second sample
beaker, add 2 to 3 drops of phenolphthalein
indicator
and titrate
with 0.02 N sodium
hydroxide
solution
to the appearance
of faint pink colour characteristics
of pH 8.3.
Record the volume used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Potentiometric

20 ml or a suitable
aliquot
Of  Sat?@3
into
a loo-ml
beaker.
Titrate

<<HEADING level=3>>EXPLANATORY
NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acidity
of water
or waste
water
is its quantitative
capacity
to react with a strong
base to a
designated
pH.
Strong mineral
acids, weak acids like acetic and carbonic
and hydrolyzable
salts like
ferrous
or aluminium
sulphates
may contribute
to the measured
acidity.
Acids contribute
towards
corrosiveness,
influence
chemical
reactions
and biological
processes.
The measurement
also reflects
a change in the quality
of the source water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
