FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Second Revision
) was
adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards
on
29 July
1988,
after
the
draft
finalized
by the
Construction
Plant
and
Machinery
Sectional
Committee

been
approved5
by

Smooth-wheeled
diesel
road
rollers
are
generally
employed
for
compaction
of different
types of soils
under
various
conditions,
initial
rolling
and finish
rolling
of bitumen
macadam,
water-bound
macadam,
hot
and
cold asphalt,
and to improve
the
condition
of subgrade,
sub-
base and the base of pavements.
Their
selection
is governed
by the types
of job
and the charac-
teristics
of
the material
to be compacted.
In
general,
they
are
the
best
type
for use where
crushing
action
is  needed.
This
standard
is
intended
to deal
with
the
essential
features
of
smooth-wheeled
diesel
road
rollers
to serve as
guidance
to both
the
manufacturer
and
the
purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Wind

<<PARAGRAPH>>If specified
by purchaser
the
roller shall be
able to work at a temperature
between
-3O~and
60°C.
In case no test is carried
out for the above
conditions,
the
manufacturer
shall
give
a
warranty
( for a period
of 12 months
from
the
date
of commissioning
or
18 months
from the
date of supply,
whichever
is earlier
) for
per-
formance
of equipment
in the above conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 Fpr the purpose
of deciding
whether
a parti-
cular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or calculated,

the result
of a test,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with IS  :  2-1960”.
The number
of
significant
places
retained
in
rounded
off

be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
