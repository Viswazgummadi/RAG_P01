<<PARAGRAPH>>2. Description
-
For the purpose
of this
standard,
a cabinet
is defined
as a free-standing
and
self-supporting
enclosure
for electronic
equipment
capable
of being used alone or in combination
with
other
cabinets
to form
a suite.
A cabinet
may or may not have a plinth,
feet,
rollers,
castors,
etc, depending
on the load-carrying
and mobility
requirements
of the user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It may be fitted
with
doors
or side
panels
or both
on one
or more
sides
to suit
the
application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A cabinet
will house or incorporate
vertical
members
to
which
can be attached
panels,
etc,
in accordance
with IS : 9606-1980 ‘Dimensions
of panels
and racks ( 482’6 mm system )‘.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A rack is a metallic
structure
without
doors or coverings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

NOTE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This
standard
(Part
1 )  is based, without
any technical
change,
on IEC Pub 297-2 (1982 )
‘Dimensions
of

structures
of
the
482’6

<<PARAGRAPH>>Note
1 -
The  values
for height,
H,  and depth,
D, are overall
cabinet
dimensions
to which
normal
production
tolerances
apply.
The castor
wheel
or pedestal
mounted
racks
may have
height
more than
H  depending
on the
manner
of mounting
the castor
wheels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note 2 -
For height,
an increment
of 200 mm is chosen
(2 x 200 mm = 9 U).
Note
3 -
The pitch,
P, is the theoretical
distance
between
datum
lines
for
mounting
of cabinets
in a row.
The width
W -=I P shall be chosen
and
toleranced
so that
a suite
of cabinets
can be installed
with
the required
pitch;
in special
cases where other
pitch
dimensions
are required,
these shall be in increments
of 100 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note 4 -
For depth, an Increment
of 200 mm is chosen.
The intermediate
size of 450 mm is a recommended
value.
Note
5 -
S designates
the vertical
aperture
for
mounting
of panels
and subracks
and is a typical
dimension
only.
In
order
to facilitate
economy
in manufacturing
racks
of different
heights.
fhe aperture
between
top and
bottom
frames
may be more than
S but
in such cases
the aperture
In excess
of S should
be covered
by dummy
panels,
or
otherwise
by the
manufacturer
of
the cabinets,
U is the vertical
increment
44’45 mm according
to
IS  :  9606-1980.
Note  6 -
For fixing
dimensions,
see  IS  : 9606-1980.
