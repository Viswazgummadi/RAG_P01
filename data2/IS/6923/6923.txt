<<HEADING level=3>>METHOD OF TEST FOR
PERFORMANCE OF SCREED BOARD
CONCRETE VIBRATORS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0. FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 22 March
1973, after the draft finalized by the Construction
Plant
and Machinery
Sectional
Committee
had been approved by the Civil
Engineering Division Council.
0.2 The vibration
characteristics
for screed board concrete
vibrators are
indicated in IS  :  2506-1964*
which also recommends the methods for mea-
suring these characteristics.
While specifying these vibration characteristics,
the committee
had appreciated
that even the requirements
in regard to
amplitude, frequency and acceleration
could considerably vary from case to
case and,therefore,
the attempt in the specification had been to lay down only
the limiting values of the vibration characteristics and the physical dimensions
of vibrators on the basis of available technical literature, experience and the
manufacturing practices in the country.
A mere measurement of amplitude,
frequency and acceleration of vibration may not yield a firm basis for judging
the efficiency of a screed board vibrator and? therefore, a direct measure-
ment of the,amount and uniformity of compaction of concrete achieved with a
vibrator would alone give a more convincing and fairer appreciation
of its
quality.
0.3 In this standard an attempt has been made to arrive at a method of test
for direct measurement of compacting characteristics
of screed board con-
crete vibrators to assess their performance in terms of compaction of concrete.
The requirements
have been suggested on the basis of available
literature
and will be reviewed further with the availability
of more data in the light
of experience gained with the use of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In reporting the result of a test or analysis made in accordance with this
standard, if the final value, observed or calculated, is to be rounded off, it
shall be done in accordance with IS  :  2-1960t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  The vibrator,
when tested in accordance
with the procedure
laid down
in 4 for compaction
of concrete,
shall be capable
of compacting
fully  in one
pass of the screed board, a 180 mm thick cement concrete
slab of mix 1  : 2 : 4
(  cement
: fine aggregates
:  coarse aggregates
by weight,
size of the coarse
aggregate
20 mm and below ) and having
a workability
of compacting
factor
O-78 f
0.01 laid over
75 mm thick stable
base of fully hardened
1  :  3  : 6
concrete
( cement
:  fine aggregates
:  coarse aggregates
by weight, size of the
coarse aggregates
20 mm and below ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 The degree of compaction
of slab shall be observed
by measurement
of
density from top to bottom
of nine 100 mm diameter
cores cut from the com-
pacted slab cured and hardened
for 14 days. The slab shall be considered
to
be fully compacted,
if the density
of concrete
anywhere
on the depth of each
of the core is not less than 93 percent
of the maximum
wet density
of the
mix as calculated
theoretically
( see 4.4 ) or determined
experimentally
(  see4.4.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. MATERIALS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Cement

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Aggregates

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 Concrete

the requirements
of
IS  :  456-1964$.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. METHqD
OF TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 The  base  of 1  :  3 : 6  concrete shall be laid and compacted
to the required
thickness
to suit over all dimensions
of test slab as indicated
in Fig. 1.
The
base slab shall be cured for at least seven days and the test slab shall be laid
on it after another
seven days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 The forms shall be laid on the lean concrete
base to the required
thick-
ness of compacted
test slab and to suit the dimensions
given in Fig. 1.
The
concrete  shall be laid evenly in the forms  SO  that the surcharge
above the top
of the forms is between
25 to 30 mm ( see Note on page 5  ).  The vibrator
shall
be started
and the vibrating
beam shall be moved forward over the concrete
surface at an approximate
speed of 300 mm/min
in steps equal to three fourth
ofthe width of the vibrating
beam and lifted on to the uncompacted
concrete
at each step along the length  of  slab.
The slab shall be compacted

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3  Nine cores of  100 mm dia shall be drilled from the full depth of the
hardened concrete as indicated in Fig. 1 and each core shall be sliced into
sections about 45 mm thick.
These sections shall be dried
to constant
weight to remove internal moisture, cooled in a desiccator and weighed.
To determine the volume each section shall then be placed in molten paraffin
wax and allowed to cool until the wax is in plastic condition.
The excess
wax shall be scraped off, leaving the surface voidsfilled
and the concrete
waterproofed.
The wax-covered section shall then be weighed in air and in
water.
From the weight and volume the average dry density shall be deter-
mined for each slice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 Knowing
the
mix proportions of concrete and the specific gravities
of different constituents, the theoretical maximum wet density of the freshly
mixed concrete shall be determined from the following equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Alternatively maximum wet density may be obtained by filling cube
aor cylinder moulds with the concrete in shallow layers and applying table
vibration for at least one minute to ensure expulsion of all air.
The weight
ofthe compacted concrete divided by the volume will give the maximum wet
