FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This
Indian
Standard
( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 24 December
1981, after the draft finalized by
the Soil Engineering
and Rock Mechanics
Sectional
Committee had been
approved by the Building Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Standard
penetration
test conducted
by means
of the split spoon,
specified
in this standard,
furnishes
data about resistance
of the soils to
penetration
which can be used to evaluate
standard
strength data, such
as .N values (number
of blows per 30 cm of penetration
using standard
split spoon) of the soil.
Methods
of calculation
of bearing
capacity
of
soils based
on N values are covered in IS  :  6403-1981*.
For obtaining
dependable
and reproducable
samples, a standard
procedure is necessary
and this code is intended to furnish necessary guidance to the soil explorer
in this regard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This standard was first published in year 1963 and this revision has
been done so as to include a standardized
split spoon sampler for which a
detailed
specification
has been formulated
separately,
besides including
the details of the correction
factors which are necessary
in calculation
of
bearing capacity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is  complied
with,
the final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the
result
of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off
in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960t.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard
specifies
a standard
procedure
for conducting
the
standard
penetration
test for soils.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>‘Code of practice for determination of bearing capacity of soils (first rmision ).

<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  2131 - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2. EQUIPMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Drilling
Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.1  The equipment used shall provide a clean borehole,
100 to 150 mm
in diameter,
for insertion of the sampler
to ensure that the penetration
test is performed on undisturbed soil and shall permit driving of the split
spoon sampler to obtain penetration record and the sample in accordance
with the procedure specified in 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -The
stiffness of the drill rod used for testing
influences
the N value
obtained by means of the test.
A light rod ‘whips’ under the blows of the hammer.
The drill
rod shall preferably
have a stiffness equal
to A-rod
(41.3
mm outer
diameter).
For depths of exploration
more than 10 m, special precautions shall be
taken to keep the rod vertical by using centering
spacers and/or by using stiffer rods
to minimize the whipping effect.
Spacers may be provided
at every 10 m, or more
frequently~, if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1.2
Casing or Drilling Mud -
It shall be used when drilling in sand, soft
clay or other soils in which the sides of borehole are likely to cave in.
In
sandy
and
other
non-cohesive
soils,
below
water
table
it is often
preferable
to use drilling
mud rather
than a casing.
If drilling
mud
alone is not successful, casing may be used along with the drilling mud.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Split-Spoon
Sampler
-
The split spoon sampler shall conform to
IS  :  9640-1980*.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3  Drive
Weight
Assembly<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.1  The drive weight assembly
shall consist of a driving head and a
63-5 kg weight with 75 cm free fall.
It shall be ensured that the energy
of the falling weight is not reduced by friction between the drive weight
and the guides or between rope and winch drum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3.2
The rods to which the sampler is attached
for driving should be
straight,
tightly
coupled
and straight
in alignment.
For driving
the
casing, a hammer heavier than 63.5 kg may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Lifting
Rail, Tongs,
Rope, Screw jack
etc<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>~3. PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Driving
the Casing -
Where casing is used, it shall not be driven
below the level at which the test is made or soil sample is taken.
In the
case of
cohesionless
soils
which
cannot
stand
without
casing,
the
advancement
of the casing pipe should be such that it does not disturb the
soil to be tested or sampled;
the casing shall preferably
be advanced
by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Specification for split spoon sampler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS :2131-
1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>slowly turning the casing rather than by driving, as the vibration caused
by driving may alter the density of such deposits immediately
below the
bottom of the borehole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Cleaning
the Borehole<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1  In case
wash boring
is adopted
for
cleaning
the borehole,
side-discharge
bits are permissible, but in no case shall a bottom-discharge
bit be permitted.
The process of jotting through
an open tube sampler,
and then testing and sampling
when the desired depth is reached
shall
not be permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2 While boring through soils, such as sands that may be disturbed
by the flow of water into the drill hole, no water shall be added to the
borehole while boring above the water table.
While boring below water
table, the water in the borehole shall be maintained
at least I.5 m above
the level of the water table.
Bentonite
slurry of appropriate
consistency
-may be required
to help the water level to be maintained
above
the
water table.
The raised level of the water in the borehole
should
be
maintained
even if casing is used to stabilize the borehole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.1
While boring through sand using casing to stabilize the sides
of the borehole,
the outer diameter
of the shell shall be at least 25 mm
smaller than the inner diameter of the casing.
The distance between the
end of the casing and the bottom of the borehole should be as close as
possible and in any case not exceed
150 mm, if only water is used to
stabilize the borehole;
in case bentonite
is used, this distance may be up
to 300 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.3
The borehole shall be cleaned up to testing or,sampling elevation,
using suitable tools, such as augers, that will ensure that there is minimum
mixing up of the soil from the bottom of the borehole.
In cohesive soils,
the borehole may be cleaned with bailer
with a f-lap valve.
This should
not be used in sands.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Obtaining
the Samples<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1  Tests shall be made at every change in stratum or at intervals of
not more than l-5 m whichever
is less.
Tests may be made at lesser
intervals if specified or considered necessary.
The intervals be increased
to 3 m if in between vane shear test is performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2 The sampler shall be lowered to the bottomof the borehole.
The
following information
shall be noted and recorded:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Depth of bottom of borehole below ground level,
b) Penetration
of the sampler into the soil under
the combined
weight of sampler and rods (to be noted from readings of the
scale over the drill rod at the top),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 2131 - 1981<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c)  Water level in the borehole or casing, and<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Depth of bottom of casing below ground level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3
The split spoon sampler resting on the bottom of borehole should
be allowed
to sink under its own weight; then the split spoon sampler
shall
be seated
15 cm with the blows of the hammer
falling through
75 cm.
Thereafter,
the split spoon sampler
shall be further
driven by
30 cm or 50 blows (except that driving shall cease before the split spoon
sampler is full).
The number of blows required to effect each
15 cm of
penetration
shall
be recorded.
The
first
15 cm
of
drive
may
be
considered
to be seating drive.
The total blows required
for the second
and third 15 cm of penetration
shall be termed
the penetration-resistance
Jv; if the split spoon sampler
is driven less than 45 cm (total),
then the
penetration
resistance
shall be for the last 30 cm of penetration
(if  less
than 30 cm is penetrated,
the logs should state the number
of blows and
the depth penetrated).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3.1
The entire sampler may sometimes sink under its own weight
when very soft sub-soil stratum is encountered.
Under such conditions,
it may not be necessary  to  give any blow to the split spoon sampler
and
SPT value should be indicated as zero.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.4
If on lowering
the sampler
by means of a string of rods it is
found to rest at a level above the bottom of the casing, the penetration
test and sampling should not be carried out at that stratum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Removal of Sampler and Labelling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1  The sampler shall be raised to the surface and opened.
A typical
sample or samples of soil from the opened split spoon shall be put into
jars without ramming.
The jars shall have a self-sealing
top, or shall be
sealed with wax to prevent evaporation
of the soil moisture.
Jars shall be
of such a size that they can be filled
without
deforming
the sample.
Typical
samples shall be cut to such a size as to fill the jars and thereby
reduce the water loss to the air in the jars.
If packing as specified is not
available,
liner may be used in the sampling
spoon.
In such a case, the
internal
diameter
of the sampling
spoon should be  SO  adjusted that the
total
internal
diameter
after
incorporating
the liner is 35 mm.
The
sample in the liner shall be waxed properly at both the ends to keep up
the natural moisture content during transit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2 Labels
shall be fixed to the jar or notations shall be written on
the covers ( or .both ) with the following information:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Origin of sample,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Length of recovery, and
h) Date of sampling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3 The jars containing samples shall be stored in suitable
containers
for shipment.
Samples shall not be placed in the sun.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5  Field
Observations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.1  Information
with regard
to water table, elevations at which the
drilling water was lost or elevations at which water under excess pressure
was encountered
shall be recorded.on
the field logs.
Water levels before
and after putting the casing, where used, shall be measured.
In sands,
the level shall be determined
as the casing is pulled and then measured
at least 30 min after the casing is pulled;
in silts, at least 24 h after the
casing is pulled; in clays, no accurate water level determination
is possible
unless pervious seams are present.
‘However, the 24 h level
shall
be
recorded for clays.
When drilling
x&d is used and the water level is
desired, casing perforated
at the lower end shall be lowered
into the
borehole
and the borehole
bailed down.
Ground
water levels shall be
determined
after bailing
at time intervals
of 30 min and 24 h until all
traces of drilling mud are removed from inside the casing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6  Corrections<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6.1 Due  to Overburden-The
N value ior cohesionless soil shall be
corrected
