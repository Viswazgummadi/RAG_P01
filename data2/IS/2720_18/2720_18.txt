<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after
the draft finalized
by the Soils
and
Soil
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With a view to establishing
uniform
procedures
~for the
determination
of different
character-
istics of soils and also for facilitating
a comparative
study of the results, an Indian
Standard
Methods
of test for Soils ( IS 2720 ) has been published in 41 parts.
This part
deals with the
method of test for determination
of field moisture equivalent
of soils, which gives an indication
of the percentage
moisture
at which a drop of water placed on
a smooth
surface
of soil pat
will not be immediately
absorbed
but will spread out
over the
surface and give it a shining
appearance.
In fine-grained
soils, the test assists in the determination
of the moisture
content
at which air in the interstices
between
particles
becomes sealed
in by the
moisture
films
around individual
particles so that the capillary
forces
can no longer
draw
moisture
into
the
soil.
In coarse-grained
soils, the test indicates that
all voids in the
material
are
filled
with
water.
A field moisture equivalent
equal to or greater than the
centrifuge
equivalent
indicates
the presence of organic material in deterimental~quantities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first plubished in 1964.
In this first revision
apart
from
general
updation,
the amendment
has been
incorporated
and all quantities/dimensions
have been given in SI
units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied with,
the fina
value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be
rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

( Part 18 ) lays down a method
for determining
the field moisture
equivalent
of soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

5 PREPARATION
OF SAMPLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The soil sample as received
from
the field
shall be exposed to air at room temperature
until
dried thorougly.
The aggregations
shall then
be thoroughly
broken
up in a mortar
with a
rubber-covered
pestle or using a mortar
and
pestle
made
of soft wood.
A representative
sample of the amount required
to perform
the
the desired test shall then
be selected
by the
use of a sampler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 The portion of the air-dried sample selected
for the purpose of tests shall be weighed
and
the mass recorded
as the mass of the total test
sample uncorrected
for hygroscopic
moisture.
The test sam_ple shall be separated
by sieving
with a 2-mm IS Sieve.
That fraction
retained
on the 2-mm IS Sieve shatl
be ground
in a
mortar with a rubber-covered
pestle
until
the
aggregations
of soil particles
are
broken
up
into
the
separate
grains.
The
ground
soil
shall then
be separated
into two fractions
by
sieving
with
a 2-mm IS Sieve.
The remain-
ing portion
of the material
passing the 2-mm
IS Sieve shall then be separated
into two parts
by means
of
a 425 micron
IS Sieve.
The
fraction
retained
on the 425 micron
IS Sieve
shall be discarded.
The fraction
passing 425
micron IS Sieve shall be used for the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
