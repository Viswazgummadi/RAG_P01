<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 1) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Water-Proofing and Damp-Proofing Sectional Committee had been approved by
the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bitumen felts may be of different types depending upon the raw material used and their
construction. IS 1322 : 1993 ‘Specification for bitumen felts for water-proofing and damp-proofing
(  fourth revision  )’, and IS 7193 : I993 ‘Specification for glass fibre base coal tar pitch and bitumen
felts (  first revision  )’, cover bitumen felts of hessian base and glass fibre base respectively. The
above standards require amongst other requirements, detailed testing of each of these products.
Various methods of test relating to each product for determination of physical properties have
been included in the separate standards. All types of felts have to satisfy some common essential
physical requirements for which methods of tests are same. A series of standards covering
methods of test have therefore been formulated to cover the determination of various physical
requirements of bitumen felt. This standard covers breaking strength test. Other parts of the
standard are as follows:
Part 2 Pliability Test
Part 3 Storage Sticking Test
Part 4 Pressure Head Test
Part 5 Heat Resistance Test
Part 6 Water Absorption Test
Part 7 Determination of Binder Content<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Composition of the technical committee responsible for the formulation of this standard is
given in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (August 1999). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )’. The number
of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified
value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>BITUMEN BASED FELT — METHODS
OF TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>PART 1
BREAKING STRENGTH TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and 180 mm long between the grips shall be cut
in both longitudinal and transverse direction
(  see  Fig 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 1) covers method for the
determination of breaking strength of bitumen
based felts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  Conditioning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 REFERENCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test pieces shall be conditioned for 48
hours at 27 ± 2°C and 65 ± 5 percent relative
humidity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standard IS 4911 : 1980 ‘Glossary
of terms relating to bituminous water-proofing
and damp-proofing of building’ is a necessary
adjunct to this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each of the test pieces shall be fixed between
the jaws of the testing machine fixed at a
distance of 180 mm and the breaking point to
be noted from the dial gauge. The force shall be
read from the dial gauge. All the five samples
cut from both the directions shall be tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.0  For the purpose of this standard, following
definition shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Breaking Strength<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Breaking strength is the force which is required
for breaking the test piece.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — The test shall be carried out not earlier than
3 days from the date of manufacture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 APPARATUS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  A standard constant-rate-of transverse type
cloth testing machine having the rate of
transverse of the moving jaw as 450 mm/min.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 REPORTING OF THE RESULT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  Record the breaking strength for each of the
test piece.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Cutting tools for preparation of the samples.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2  The value of breaking strength in warp and
weft shall be average of the five test pieces in
both the directions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Preparation of Test Sample<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>From the sample of felts, 5 test pieces 75 mm wide<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
