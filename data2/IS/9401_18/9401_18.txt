<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee, WRD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Part 18) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized by the
Measurement of Works of River Valley Projects Sectional Committee had been approved by the Water Resource
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In measurement of works relating to river valley projects, a large diversity of methods exist according to local
practices. The lack of conformity creates complications regarding measurements and payments. This standard
is therefore being formulated in different parts, covering each type of work separately. This part is-intended to
provide a uniform basis for measuring the work done in respect of sheet piling works in river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no IS0 Standard on the subject. This standard has been prepared based on indigenous manufacturer’s
data/practices prevalent in the field in India.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose ofdeciding whether a particular requirement of this stand&-d is complied wit%, the final value,
observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2: 1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values  (revised)‘.  The number of significant places retained in the
rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>PART 18 SHEET PtLlNG<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sheet piles shall-be driven true to plumb and along
the line as indicated in relevant drawings.
In case it is
not possible to follow the line, or cut-off, as indicated
in the drawings due to any unavoidable
circumstances,
the sheet pile line may be diverted at right angles,
again turned at 90° and taken parallel to the original
line and then joined at right angles as per the draw-
ings. As the effectiveness
of the cut-off depends upon
the verticality
and consequent
interlocking
of sheet
piles, special care should be taken to drive piles verti-
cally and no deviations
from the true plumb should
be allowed.
In case any pile goes out of plumb the
same has to be pulled out and another pile driven in
its place after making sure that the preceding piles are
not disturbed from their verticality.
No separate meas-
urement
will be made for such withdrawal
and re-
driving of the sheet piles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 18) covers the method of measure-
ment of sheet piling work in river valley projects (dams
and appurtenant
structures).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
