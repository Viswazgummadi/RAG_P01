<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 25 January 1990, after the draft
finalized by the measurement
of works of River Valley Projects Sectional committee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In measurement of quantities, in construction
of river valley projects a large diversity of methcds exists
at present according to local practices.
ments and payments.
This lack of uniformity creates complication regarding measure-
This standard is intended to provide a uniform basis for measurement
of form-
work in the construction
of river valley projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions contained
in this standard shall generally have precedence
over the provisions
in
IS 1200 ( Part 5)  :  1982. However, the provisions of both the standards may be considered complimentary
and supplementary to each other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with the final
value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values ( revised)‘.
The number of significant places
retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
