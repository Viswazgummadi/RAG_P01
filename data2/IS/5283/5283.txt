<<HEADING level=3>>SPECIFICATION FOR
POULTRY WATERERS, PORTABLE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.
FORE-WORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard was adepted by the Indian Standards Institution
on 22 September
1969, after the draft finalized by the Animal Housing and
Equipment Sectional Committee
had been approved by the Agricultural
and Food Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The practice
of keeping poultry
inside a shed at all times on deep
litter, necessitates to keep the watering
system in such a way that water
does not spill into the litter since the spillage of water may create serious
problems
in maintaining
the litter dry which is very important
for the
health and comfort of poultry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 The aim while formulating
this standard has been
to avoid giving
dimensional or other requirements
which would tend -to restrict variation
in design and instead to concentrate
on good performance of the waterers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 While
preparing
this standard,
assistance
has
been derived
from
B.S. 3872  :  1965  ‘  Specification
for poultry watering appliances  ’  issued by
the British Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960*.
The number of significant
places retained in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard specifies the requirements
and the methods of test for
poultry waterers which are self contained
and portable
for flock watering,
but does not deal with waterers for battery
brooders and other similar
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2 This standard covers the waterers fed from storage cisterhs as well as
those from direct mains connection.
