<<HEADING level=3>>0.  FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part I  )  was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 25 February
1972,
after
the draft finalized by the Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by
the
Civil
Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Cement
concrete
is one of the most
versatile
and
extensively
used
building
materials
in all
civil
engineering
constructions.
There
are a
number
of technical
terms connected
with the basic
materials
for concrete
as well as the production
and use of concrete
which
quite
often require
clarification
to give precise
meaning
to the stipulations
in the standard
specifications,
codes
of practices
and other technical
documents.
It has,
therefore,
become
necessary
to standardize
the various
terms and defini-
tions used in cement
and concrete
technology
and
thus
avoid
ambi-
guity
in their
interpretations.
The
Sectional
Committee
has, therefore,
decided
to bring
out a series of glossaries
of terms
relating
to concrete
and concrete
materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
For convenience
of reference,
the Indian
Standard
glossary
of terms
relating
to cement
concrete
has been
grouped
into
the following
twelve
parts:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

In
addition
to the above,
two separate
standards
have been
brought
out concerning
terminology
relating
to hydraulic
cement
and
pozzolanic
materials.
These
standards
are
IS  :  4845-1968*
and
IS  :
4305-1967t.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation of this standard due weightage has been given to
international
co-ordination among the standards and practices
prevailing
in different countries in additidn to relating
it to the practices in the field
in this country.
This
has been met by deriving
assistance
from
the
following publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This standard ( Part I ) covers definitions of terms relating
to aggre-
gates for cement concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  DEFINITIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.0  For
the purpose of this standard, the following definitions shall  apply,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  Absorption --  The process by which a liquid is drawn into and tends
to fill permeable
pores in a porous solid body; also, the increase in weight
of a porous solid body resulting
from the penetration
of a liquid into its
permeable pores.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE - In  the case of concrete
and concrete aggregates,  unless
otherwise
stated,
the
liquid
involved
is water,
the increase
in weight
is that
which
does not include
water
adhering
to the outside
surface,
the increase
in weight
is expressed
as a percentage
of
the dry
weight
of the body
and
the body
is considered
to be  ‘  dry  ’  when it has been
treated
by
an
appropriate
process
to remove
uncombined
water,
such
as drying
to
constant
weight
at a temperature
between
100 and 110°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
