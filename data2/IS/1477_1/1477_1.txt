FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( Part I)
(First
Revision)
was adopted
by the
Indian
Standards
Institution~on
26 March
1971,
after the draft finalized
by
the
Painting,
Varnishing
and Allied
Finishes
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 The Part I covers
the details of pretreatment
to be provided
at factory
and/or at site to the ferrous metals
before they are actually
painted
and
the Part II covers
details of painting
and paint schedules
for ferrous sur-
faces.
These
two parts are intended
to give guidance
for obtaining
good
protection
to
ferrous
surfaces
by
painting
under
general
atmospheric
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 This Standard
(Part
I ) is now being
revised taking
into account
the
experience
gained in this field during
the-past
decade.
The salient features
of the revision
of this part are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Pretreatment
to be provided
to the ferrous
metals
at factory
and/
or at site are covered
in greater
detail,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Details
of sand-blasting
are covered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In the formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been
given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding

of rain water which would cause rusting
of ferrous surfaces.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. SURFACE
PREPARATION
AND PRETREATMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Pretreatment
and priming of ferrous metals under controlled
conditions
of the factory gives the best results
and
it is therefore
advisable
to adopt
this method
whenever
possible.
The object of such treatment
is to preserve
and maintain
the metal surface during
transport,
storage and erection
and
to minimize
the  ‘  on site  ’  preparation
for final painting.
Much will depend
upon the time between
the factory
treatment
and erection,
the care with
which the materials
have been stored and handled
during that period, and
the protective
quality
of the treatment
applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
Application
of a suitable
priming
coat should follow pretreatment
without
delay.
Subsequent
coats of paint may be applied on the site after
cleaning
down any damaged
parts and touching
up with the primer paint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. FACTORY
PRETREATMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l  6.1 Removal
of
Oil,
Grease,
Dirt
and
Scarf-Generally,
the
application
of any coating,
lining material,
adhesive
or paint,
requires
as
its first essential
a perfectly
clean surface
which is of very great importance
while
dealing
with
the
painting
of ferrous
metals.
Steel
is normally
supplied covered
with oil and grease
either
as a protective
layer to pre-
vent
corrosion
or as a left-over
from
machining
and
handling.
The
customary
procedure
of applying
a so-called
‘shop  coat’
of paint
after
fAbrication
which
consists
of wiping
the surface
with
oily cotton
waste
left-over
from other operations,
defeats the purpose of painting
at the start.
Any paint
coat applied
on greasy
or oily steel surfaces
will lack proper
adhesion
and
will lead to the failure
of the paint
film.
It is, therefore,
essential
that even the minute traces of grease and oil are removed
prior to
the application
of any paint.
Grease
removal
shall be carried
out either
with solvent-type
or alkali-type
degreasing
agents.
The material
used is
not so important
as the final result
which
shall
be a thoroughly
clean
surface
without any oil, grease
or  alkali left-over.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*
6.1.1
Solvent
Cleaning-There
are
numerous
proprietary
brands
of
solvent,
alkaline
and emulsion
clea;ers
available;
where these are used the
manufacturer’s
instructions
should be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.1
Petroleum-solvent
cleaning  -These
methods
relate to the use of
petroleum
solvents,
such as kerosene
and mineral turpentine
( white  spirit )
for the  removal
of oil, grease,
dirt and
swarf from
unit parts or simple
assemblies
having
easily accessible
surfaces.

or machinery
which
cannot
be accommodated
in degreasing
equipment.

<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  1477 ( Part I) - 1971<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>solvent
should
not be used for assemblies
containing
fabric,
rubber,
or
other non-metallic
materials,
unless it is known
that no harm will result.
The petroleum
solvent cleaning
shall be carried out in accordance
with the
detailed
procedure
given
in IS: 6005-1970*.
The
following
precautions
should be taken during
petroleum
solvent
cleaning
process:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Handling
precautions-
Articles
should be placed on hooks or racks
or in
suitable
containers
that
permit
adequate
draining.
They
should
not
be handled
with
bare
hands
after
cleaning;
clean
gloves or similar
protection
should
be used and handling
kept to
a minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Safep
precautions-
Petroleum
solvents
should
be used
at
room
temperature
and suitable
exhausts
and fire extinguishers
should
be
provided,
as these
solvents
are
flammable.
Oil-resisting
synthetic
rubber
gloves
should
be worn
when handling
articles
during cleaning,
to protect
the articles
from sweat residues and to
avoid any possible effect of the solvent on the skin.
Care
should
be taken to avoid breathing
the petroleum
solvent
vapour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.2  Trichloroethylene
cleaning-This
method
relates
to
surface
cleaning
with the trichloroethylene
solvent.
Trichloroethylene
degreasing
should not be used on assemblies
containing
fabric,
rubber
or other non-
metallic
materials
unless
it is known
that
no harm
will
result.
The
procedure
to be followed
shall be in accordance
with the details given in
IS:6005-1970*.
The
following
precautions
should
be
taken
during
trichloroethylene
cleaning
process:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Handling
precautions -
During
processing,
the
articles
should
be
placed on hooks or racks or in a suitable container.
They should be
so arranged
that
there
is adequate
opportunity
for the solvent to
drain from holes, crevices and other irregularities.
After cleaning,
articles
should not be handled
with bare
hands;
clean
gloves or
similar protection
should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety
precautions -
Thrichloroethylene
is a toxic
substance
and
therefore,
care should be taken to avoid breathing
the vapour near
degreasing
equipment.
Trichloroethylene
is non-inflammable,
but
flames may cause
decomposition
of the solvent
vapour
with the
production
of harmful
acidic
g&es;
therefore,
they
should
not be
allowed
near degreasing
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2  Alkaline
Cleaning-
Alkaline
solutions
are good degreasing
agents
but as they are usually injurious
to the skin, they should not be used except
in process
tanks,
The
exception
is trisodium
phosphate,
a very mild
alkali
which
is a good cleaning
medium.
This
material
may be used for
-
*Co&  of practice for phosphating of iron and steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1477 j Part I) - 1971<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>degreasing
at site as well as in the workshop.
Caution
is necessary
and
thorough
rinsing
shall
be ensured
when
porous
articles
or parts
and
assemblies
that tend
to trap the solution are cleaned
in alkaline
cleaners.
The
two methods
of alkaline
cleaning,
namely,
the immersion
and the
spray-degreasing
process
shall
be carried
out
in accordance
with
the
detailed
procedure
given
in IS  :  6005-1970*.
Immersion
cleaning
is the
commonly
used method
of degreasing.
Spray treatment
may be adopted
where
the volume
of production
is high
or the surface
contamination
is
predominant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3
Emulsion
Cleaning-These
are neither single
or diphase cleaners
of
oil-water
emulsion
type.
They
contain
very
little
alkali
but
rely
on
powerful emulsifying
agents and hydrocarbons
to remove
grease.
While
they cannot
be compared
to heavy-duty
cleaners
based
on caustic
soda,
they are very satisfactory
for most
cleaning
jobs.
Emulsion
cleaning
is
particularly
preferred
before
phosphadng
as
it
subsequently
leaves
a
fine-textured
phosphate
coating.
Besides,
its
operating
temperature
is
generally
lower
than
that
of heavy-duty
alkaline
cleaners.
Emulsion
cleaners
may be applied both by spray and dip, though the former is more
common.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Emulsion
cleaners
should be correctly
formulated,
otherwise
emulsion
stability
will pose problems.
There
are several
proprietary
products
and
manufacturer’s
instructions
should
be followed
for their operation
to get
best results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3.1
Equipment-Emulsion
cleaners
may
be used in simple
mild
steel tanks for dip applications
or mechanized
power-spray
plants for spray
application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0
6.1.4
Other Methods
of  Cleaning-There
dare other
methods
of cleaning,
such
as electrolytic
cleaning
and
steam
cleaning.
These
methods
are
seldom
used for cleaning
of ferrous
metals
in buildings.
For details of
procedure
for carrying
out these processes,
IS  :  6005-1970*
may be referred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>* 6.1.5
Prevention  of  Contamination
-
After degreasing
has been
completed,
if no derusting
or descaling
is required,
the selected
paint
coat
shall be
applied immediately,
preferably
without
touching
the-surface
with bare
hands which may be slightly
greasy
even
when quite
clean.
This may
not always
be possible;
nevertheless,
care
shall be taken
to prevent
the
surface from getting recontaminated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t  6.2 Removal
of Rust
and Scale-
When steel
leaves the rolling mill,
it
has a firmly-adhering
skin known
as  ‘mill
scale ‘.
The
continuous
fresh
layer of mill scale
is in itself a good protection
against
corrosion
of the
underlying
steel.
However,
on exposure
to the atmosphere,
mill
scale<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Code of practice for phosphating of iron and steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  1477 ( Part I  ) -  1971<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>absorbs
moisture~and
commences
to work itself loose allowing
moisture
to
penetrate
between the scale and the steel and resulting
in rust formation.
Old
steel,
which
has been
kept for a long time
in the open, has heavy
layers of rust formed
on its surface.
If paint
is applied on the layers of
rust or loose mill scale, rusting continues
almost
to the same extent
as if
there was no paint, with the added disadvantage
that over heavy layers of
paint progressive
corrosion is not easily detected.
Derusting
and descaling
are the essential preparations
required
prior to the application
of any type
of coating on iron and steel.
There is considerable
difference between the
condition
of a new steel which requires painting
and old steel which
has
been allowed to weather
and rust,
and the approach
to each problem
is
different.
Generally,
derusting
and descaling
of steel may be carried out
either mechanically
or chemically.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1
Mechanical
Cl.taning-This
may
be  done by scraping,
chipping,
/
wire-brushing,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>rubbing
with
abrasive
paper
or
steel
wool,
by
flame
cleaning
and sand- or shot-blasting.
New steel that is to be painted
has
normally
a surface partly rusted and partly comprising
of firmly adhering
mill scale.
Once the firmly-adhering
mill scale has broken, it is extremely
difficult
to determine
whether
the remaining
mill scale is adhering
firmly
enough
to be left on the surface
or should
be removed.
For
ordinary
working
conditions,
it is practically
impossible
to remove
firmly-adhering
mill scale by any hand
operation.
Any specification,
which
requires the
cleaning
or removing
of mill scale or rust by  ‘  scraping ‘, sand-papering,
chipping,
wire-brushing,
etc, shall, therefore,
be understood
to mean that
firmly adhering
mill scale will not be removed
and that the surface finally
obtained
will not give optimum
protection
against
rust at a later date.
While this refers to reasonably
new steel which has been protected
against
excessive
weathering
in a yard or workshop,
quite
often
very old steel is
used on construction
or in manufacturing
processes
where heavy rust or
scale has formed.
This type of scale consists of numerous
layers of rust or
chemically
broken
down steel and isnot
the same as the thin layer of mill
scale.
The difference
is obvious in appearance;
while mill scale is bluish-
black in colour,
rust scale is rusty-brown
in colour.
Such
rust and scale
can usually be removed
completely
with a scraper
or a chipping
hammer
or both.
If complete
removal
of all types of mill scale is required
( which
is the best
preparation)
the only really
efficient
mechanical
method
of
doing this is by sand-blasting
or shot-blasting
(see  Appendix  A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.1  Hand-scraping/-The
correct
procedure
shall
be
to
scrape
thoroughly
with a hand scraper followed by wire-brushing
(first with coarse
and then
with fine wire-brushes),
and finally
sand-papering
the surface
with coarse sand paper  (No.  3)  steelwood
(No.
2) or emery paper (No. 3 )
or emery cloth.
This will give a reasonable
assurance
that
no loose mill
scale or heavy rust is left on the surface.
For purpose of examination,
the
hand cleaned
surface
shall be wiped finally with mineral
turpentine,
which
also removes
grease and perspiration
left by handmarks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.2 Scrabing with mechanical power tools -Appreciably
better
results
than
by hand
scraping
may be obtained
by employing
power-operated
wire-brushes,
although
it may not be possible
to remove
firmly-adhering
mill scale even
with this type of tool.

Flame Cleaningl
Flame
cleaning
is carried
out with the help of a
special
oxy-acetylene
torch.
The
mill scale is rapidly
heated
while the
underlying
steel remains
comparatively
cold.
Because
of the difference
in expansion
between
the heated mill scale and the bulk of the steel, the
scale will become
loose and will either fall off or be easily removed with a
wire-brush.
As only heating
of the scale without heating
of the steel itself
will
ensure
complete
removal
of any
firmly-adhering
mill
scale,
it is
obvious that this work requires
considerable
skill and is, therefore,
limited
to carefully
trained
labour.
While
flame
cleaning
is restricted
to heavy
steel, as it may lead to buckling
of light gauge material,
it shall always be
ensured that the number
of passes the oxy-acetylene
flame
makes
over a
surface
does not exceed
3.
The
primer
coat
of paint
shall be applied
immediately
after the flame cleaning
has been carried out when the surface
is still warm.
This alone will assure the absence
of any moisture
on the
metal surface and, therefore,
a perfect
adhesion
of the paint to the steel.
Any minor scale, which correct~flame
cleaning
has not removed
after wire-
brushing,
may be left in position
as the potential
corrosive
effect of this
residual
scale is nullified
by its having been completely
dehydrated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The principle
a jet of sharp sand or granulated
steel
( steel grit)
on to the metal surface,
removing
in the process any rust and
scale, including
firmly-adhering
mill scale.
A steel surface properly cleaned
by sand-blasting
may be immediately
recognized
by its silver-grey
surface
and the criterion
for good sand-blasting
or shot-blasting
is the even colour
ofthe
surface so cleaned.
An air compressor
with a displacement
of 4.5 ms
will suffice
for the
work,
but
a compressor
giving
about
5.5 ma of air
would
give
faster
results.
Details
of
sand-blasting
and
shot-blasting
equipment,

Many  of  these  are either readily

Sand-

Suitable
spray
masks shall, therefore,
be worn by workmen
to prevent them from inhaling
silica  sand dust, which may lead to silicosis.
River
sands which are hard

shall be-that
the sand is free from loam
and mud,
and
is sharp
and hard.

The cost of sand-blasting

is fully ,justified
as with
a reasonable

APPLICATION
OF PAINTS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  After
completion
of the
precleaning,
the
ferrous

shall
be
immediately
painted
unless
a rust-proofing
or other
interim
process
is
employed.
In
the latter
case,
the precleaning
shall be followed
imme-
diately by that process.
If, for instance,
a sand-blasted
piece
of steel is
left exposed
in a coastal
area for only 12 hours, slight rust formation
would
be visible and the iron oxide
thus formed
would
readily
absorb
moisture
from the humid atmosphere.
Sand-blasted
steel left exposed for any length
of time
would
thus
have
to be retreated.
In
chemical
cleaning,
after
removal
of excess acids by thorough
washing,
the articles
shall be imme-
diately
dried and painted.
Correct
timing
is essential
in all processes
of
preparation,
when painting

Cleaning
to White
Metal-This

surface
of uniform
appearance
with
complete
removal
of all corrosion
products,
mill scale, paint, etc.
In this method,
the abrasives
are propelled
through
nozzles on to the surface.
In general,
it may be stated that, in this
process,
the sand-blasting
shall
be
complete
but it is not
necessary
to
produce
a surface so uniformly
blasted
as to be free  of  all  shadows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Blast Cleaning-Commercial
surface
finish shall be
free of visible
mill

but may not be free of  ‘  shadows ‘.
It may be produced
at the rate
of 15 to 25 m2/nozzle hour using a 8-mm nozzle at 7 kgf/cm2 pressure
held
approximately
450 mm from the surface.
The
actual rate
of blasting
to
obtain
a commercial
finish is variable
and is mainly dependent
upon surface
conditions
(amount
and degree of adhesion
of mill scale, rust scale, etc ) and
the type of surface
(flat,
curved,
regular,
irregular,
etc).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-1.4  Brush Off Blast Cleaning-This
is a relatively
low-cost method of

as compared
to A-l.2
and is nearly
the same as  ‘commercial
blast
cleaning  ’  except
that the rate of application
is so high that only a limited
amount
of mill
scale
and
rust are removed.
It
is generally
intended
to supplant
hand cleaning
and power-tool
cleaning
methods
where facilities
are available
for blast cleaning.
The remaining
mill scale, rust and paint
shall be tight and the surface
sufficiently
abraded
to provide
satisfactory

Direct
Pressure
Sand-Blasting
( Continuous
Type)
(see
Fig. lB)*-
This contains two storage compartments
for  the abrasive. During
blasting
operation,
the abrasive
is fed from the lower compartment,
and the
upper
compartment
may be filled
with abrasive
as and
when
required
without
disturbing
the operation
of the lower
compartment.
When the
lower
compartment
needs
filling,
pressure
is turned
on to the
upper
compartment,
which releases the valve between
upper and lower compart-
ments and also seals off the upper chamber
from the feeding
hopper above,
and the abrasive
feeds into the lower chamber
from the upper one.
When
the air pressure
is cut off to the upper chamber,
the valve connecting
itito
the lower chamber
is closed and the upper chamber
is opened to the hopper
at the top for feed of abrasive.
The
net result
of this operation
is the
maintenance
of
a continuous
supply
of
abrasive
irrespective
of
the
intermittent
feedings
to the upper chamber,
and also
an
uninterrupted
operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.3
Suction Feed Type
of Blast Equipment-This
equipment
may
be constructed
or used for cleaning
of welds,
or small
areas
of ferrous
surfaces.
The equipment
operates because of a vacuum which is created by
compressed
air passing
through
a small jet in the suction
gun
into
an
indllction
chamber
before passing through a larger nozzle.
The induction
chamber
is connected
by means of a suitable
hose to the source of abrasive.
The amount
of abrasive
that is sucked into the~equipment
depends upon the
vacuum
created,
the lift required,
and the type of abrasive.
Because
of the
limited
amount
of vacuum
that may be created by the jet, the suction lift
is decreased.
Figure
2 illustrates
the principles
of operation
of this type of
equipment.
Compressed
air
passes
through
the
small
jet
and
creates
a vacuum.
The static pressure
in the larger
nozzle is about 75 percent
of
that at the inlet
of the smaller
nozzle.
Secondary
air and abrasive
are
sucked into the feed hose from the inlet end near the hopper.
The position
of the hose at the hopper
is moved
forwards
or backwards
to vary the
abrasive
pickup until the most satisfactory
operating
condition
is reached.
In use, the unit may be operated
by connecting
to a source of air and  dropp-
ing the inlet
end of the hose into a container
of abrasive;
sand is usually
used in such operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.4
Closed
Recirculating
Blast System-This
is similar to direct
pressure
blasting,
but the abrasive
is recollected
by vacuum immediately
wafter blasting.
For this purpose,
the blast nozzle is enclosed
in a  cornpart_
mental
cup which has a brush
seal at the bottom
in order to control
the
abrasive
flow and to prevent
the escape of abrasive.
A second
hose from
the cup leads recollected
abrasive
into the separator
tank
from which the
abrasive
is fed to the suction side of the blower.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.4.1
This
type of blast
cleaning
may
not
require

Distance
-of Nozzle
from
Surface-The
nozzle
shall be held at
the correct
distance
from
the area
being
blasted
and this distance
will
vary with the type of work being done.
The
closer the nozzle
is held to
the surface,
the greater
the impact of the particle
and the more concentra-
ted the blast stream.
As the nozzle is moved
away
from
the surface,
the
blast pattern
widens and a greater
area
is covered.
Trial

will
usually indicate
the optimum
distance
at
which
the nozzle
is held from
the surface for the particular
job and the rate at which it is traversed
over
the surface to obtain
the required
degree of surface
cleanliness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Angle  of the Nozzle
with Regard
to Surface-The
angle of the
nozzle
to the work is also important.
If the nozzle is held perpendicular
to the surface,
the operation
becomes
inefficient
because
of rebounding
abrasives
slowing
down
the
abrasive
emerging
from
the
nozzle.
In
practice,
it is best if the nozzle is held at an angle of approximately
30” to
the vertical
in order to undercut
the material
to be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.4
Special
Operations
with
Nozzle-For
highly-pitted
steel,
the
nozzle shall be rotated
around its own axis in allplanes
and held at various
angles to ensure that the abrasive
cleans out all the pores and interstices
of
the surface being blasted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.5
In
order
to prevent
blocking
of the nozzle
by the abrasive,
the
abrasive
used shall generally
be not larger than
one-third
the diameter
of
the nozzle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.6
Short nozzles ( which are sometimes
referred to as button
or washer-
nozzles ) produce
a wide spreading
of the abrasive
in a large blast pattern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.7
When a number
of blast nozzles
are operated
from one blast tank,
the blast hoses shall be of equal
diameter
and length
to equalize
the flow
of abrasive
and to ensure that the sand-blasted
surfaces are cleaned
to the
same degree.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

ABRASIVES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-5.1
The types of abrasives
that may be used in blasting
operations
shall
be as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Metallic
shot, which is approximately
spherical
in shape obtained
from oxyacetylene~cutting
or other
industrial
operations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Siliceous,
containing
free silica
( sand );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Synthetic,
non-mettallic,
containing
silica; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Agricultural
( such as nut shells, corn husks, etc).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-5.2
Use of Metallic
Shot -
Metallic
shots shall not be used on light
sections,
its use being
limited
to structural
materials
that
can absorb
its
impact.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.2.1
Metallic
grit is obtained
by crushing
shot and
screening
the
grit into various sizes.
Iron filing  or  tool-room
filings may also be used as
abrasives.
The advantage
of metallic-shot
abrasives is that they cut deeper
and faster and are efficient
for the removal
of scale and other hard surface
deposits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.3
Use of Siliceous Abrasives-These
may consist of garnet, quartz,
silica
or
decomposed
rock.
The
most
widely-used
abrasive
in field
operations
is silica sand of maximum
particle
size not larger than 1.00 mm
IS Sieve
(see IS  :  460-1962”
).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.3.1
Loss
of abrasive
adds
considerably
to the cost of operation.
Periodic
analysis
or
examination
of the
abrasive
in use
indicates
a
distribution
of abrasive
particles
down
to the
smaller
sizes.
If these
smaller-sizes
are absent it is an indication
that the abrasive
is being wasted.
In field operations,
the sand should
be swept up, screened
and re-used,
if
the break down rate is small.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.4
Use  of Synthetic
Abrasives
-These
are costlier
than sand and,
therefore,
should preferably
be re-used
more often than sand.
however,
be exercized
to check about the presence
of dust.
Care shall,
The commonly
used synthetic
abrasives
are refractory
slag,
aluminium
oxide
and silicon
carbide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5.5
Use -of Agricultural
Abrasives
-
These
are not expensive,
since
they are usually
waste products.
The
most
common
abrasives
are hard-
wood particles,
nut shells,
coconut
shells,
etc.
These
abrasives
may be
used in cleaning
grease,
oil, or carbon
from
finished
parts and assembled
equipment.
The
absorbing
capacity
of
the
particles
gives
an
effect
similar to wiping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Appearance
of
Surface
in
Relation
to Abrasives
Used-
Colour
is not always
a criterion
for cleanliness.
-When
using
sand,
the
blast-cleaned
surface
may
appear
very
white
and
look
very
clean.
There
are two reasons for this, that is:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the fine sand leaves many facets which reflect light, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) a deposit of white silica may add to the white appearance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
using dark abrasives,
the surface
may have a dark appearance.
It is, therefore,
very essential
to blow off the surface
blasted
with
dry
compressed
air prior to priming
the same with paint or any other material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-6.  USE OF SEPARATORS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-6.1
Separators
~may be used to remove
oil,
water,
etc,from
the com-
pressed
air
supply.
These
may
be installed
either
at the
end
of the
connector,
( connected
to the compressed~air
tank ) or at the bottom
of the
steel hopper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE-The
separator usually consists of rubber or steel baffles with holes drilled
through the plates, and has a water draw-off at the bottom.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-6.2  For bleeding,
there shall be a carefully
filtered
supply of cool air,
which is done generally
by means
of a separate
auxiliary
air compressor
of a small size.
If the compressed
air of the plant
itself is to be supplied
for
bleeding
purposes,
extreme
filtration
to remove
oil and
water
is
necessary.
Water usually condenses
in the line,
and it is important
that
the compressor
lines be properly
installed
with drip legs to remove
water
which condenses
in the line.
The final separator
shall be installed adjacent
to the blasting
stations
to remove the last traces of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-7.
GENERAL
PRECAUTIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-7.1
Suitable
equipment
for protection
from
dust shall be provided
to
those engaged
in blast-cleaning
operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -Blast-cleaning
operations will give rise to a large amount of dust; in exterior
work, if done in the direction of wind, the undersized particles are carried away with
the air-stream.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A safety type of helmet with a force-feed air supply is a suitable protective  equipment.
Filter-type air respiration shall be worn by all others who are not actually engaged in
the blast-cleaning operations
but are exposed to blast-dust environment.
goggles shall be worn by persons near the blasting operations.
Also safety<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>~Generally in blast-cleaning
operations,
there is no hazard from silicosis provided
the normal safety precautions are taken.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-7.2
Proper
precautions
shall
be taken
against
fire explosion
hazards
before starting
the work.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-7.3
Care shall be taken to protect adjacent
machinery,
electrical
equip-
ment,

EFFECTS
OF STATIC
ELECTRICITY
IN SAND-BLASTING
WORK
IN INFLAMMABLE
AREAS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-l. GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-l.1
The
air and abrasive
which
pass through
the hose create a static
charge and, therefore,
while doing sand-blasting
work in inflammable
areas,
such
as tank
farms
in oil terminals
or on the exterior
of tanks full of
petroleum
products,
the nozzle
and
hose shall be grounded
by separate
ground
wires.
All metal parts, between
which sparking
is liable to occur,
shall be bounded
with electric
conductors
to one another and also grounded
to earth.
Effective
bonding
shall be done
between
the tank and sand-
blast nozzles,
sand hopper and, preferably,
the air compressor
also.
The
bonding
between
the
tank,
sand-blast
nozzle and
sand hopper
is most
important,
as it is almost
certain
that,
without
bonding,
sparking
will
occur between
the tank and sand-blast
nozzle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Silica sand will not generally spark under the pressure of 0.6 kgf/cms but
static electricity may be produced at the-point of impact betw’een the nozzle and the
steel plate of the tank.
It is found that the sparks, which are created at the end of the
sand-blasting nozzle, are due to static electricity and not due to the impact of the sand
on the steel; no high temperature is developed unlike, for instance, sparking at a high-
speed grinder.
B-1.2  The
bonding
conductor
shall not be less than
1.5 mm diameter
(see Note
below)
and
shall
be
in continuous
length.
The
electrical
conductor
shall be firmly connected
to the sand-blast
cable,
preferably
by
means of a clamp.
The copper-bonding
wire shall be looped
to the sand
hopper and the air compressor
before being terminated
on the storage tank,
care being taken to see that all connections
made are electrically
sound.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE -
The 16 SWG single strand copper cable ( 1% mm diameter ) will be found
suitable as bonding conductor.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-1.3
From the sand
hopper
to the sand-blast
nozzle, the bonding
cable
shall be clamped
to the hose that feeds the nozzle at about
1.5 m intervals,
and care shall be taken to see that
the cable
is not damaged
during
the
operation.
If armoured
hose is used,
the wire armouring
shall also be
bonded
to the sand-blast
nozzle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

WORK
AT THE ROOF
OF  A  TANK
B-2.1  When
carrying
out sand-blasting
on the roof of a petroleum
storage
tank, all openings
leading
to the inside of thetank
shall be covered
in such
a way as to prevent
the entry
of sand,
but at the same time to permit
venting
of the product
in the tank.
For this purpose,
a clean muslin cloth
may be used to cover the vents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.2
When
sand-blasting
at or near
a vent, the~pressure
and vacuum
valve or hood shall be removed,
and the vent nozzle shall be plugged com-
pletely  with
hession
cloth
(or a wooden
plug in two halves ) and made<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>gas-tight
by using clay or stiff grease;
alternatively,
a blank flange may be
used, wherever
possible.
With this method,
product
vapours do not  escape
from the vent and the danger
of a fire is eliminated.
This
shall be done
only for one vent at a time, keeping
the others
fully operating
during this
phase.
’<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.3
Sand-blasting
of the entire roof shall be carried
out onlv during the
early
morning
or late evening
hours,
when
tank
breathing
is the
least.
Immediately
after
this operation
each
day,
all the vents
shall be made
completely
free of covers or plt~gs mentioned
above,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.4
The roofs of floating-roof
tanks
containing
petroleum
shall not be
sand-blasted;
conventional
methods
of scraping,
chipping
and
painting
shall be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.
WORK
IN RELATION
TO
WIND
DIRECTION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-3.1
When
carrying
out sand-blasting
on the sides or roof of a tank, the
work shall always
be done in such a manner
with respect
to the wind
direction
that  the sand particles
are blown
away
clear of the tank;
when
sand-blasting
the roof, the vents upstream
and
downstream
(with
respect
to wind
direction)
of the area
being
sand-blasted
shall be plugged
or
covered or blank-flanged,
the downstream
one to prevent product
contami-
nation
with sand and the upstream
one to prevent
product
vapours
from
being blown over the area being
sand-blasted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-4.
SUSPENSION
OF
SAND-BLASTING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-4.1
All
sand-blasting
operations
for the
tank
shall
be completely
suspended
when the tank is receiving
cargo
or when
the water
bottom
is
being raiced
This shall include switching
off  of  all concerned
electrical
and motive equipment,
such as air compressors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B-4.1.1  Sand-blasting
operations
shall
not
be permitted
for the
roof
when water or product
is drawn out of the tank,
because
the tank
has  to
breath
in, and full venting
is required.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-5,
REMOVAL
OF
FINE
PARTICLE
DEPOSITS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-5.1
Due to the static electricity,
which
is formed
as the abrasive
passes
through
the hose,
the metal
shot gets
charged
and,
even
after
cutting
through
the mill scale on the surface,
fine particles
of shot adhere
to the
metal due to the static charge
which
they have picked
up.
This
has a
further
disadvantage,
as it is very difficult to blow these fine particles
away
especially
when they become
embedded
in the anchor
pattern
formed by
the blasting
process.
A jeweller’s
brush
with fine  brass bristles
may be
used
to brush
these
out and
more
dry compressed
air passed
over the
surfaces
blasted
to ensure
that
these
line metal
deposits
are  completely
removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
