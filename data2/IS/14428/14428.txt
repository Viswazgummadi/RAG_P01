<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards after the draft finalized by the
Painting, Varnishing and Allied Finishes Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineer-
ing Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is based on the survey conducted on the current practices being followed and is designed
to serve as a guide for the selection of protective coating and application methods. Several type of coatings
and application methods may be recommended for various cases, but each type of environment should be
considered as a separate case and the final choice should depend upon the economics involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main function, of painting in chemical plants is to control corrosion in the capital investments of
equipment, structures, vessels, piping and buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Atmospheric corrosion is that environment which is generated by the presence of the elements of nature,
the air pollution of the general industrial area and the traces of chemicals within the plant itself. Chemical
spillages present unusual problems and are not considered as a part of a corrosive atmosphere.
An
industrial maintenance painting programme is the administration,
specification, application, inspection
and evaluation of protective coating systems. These guidlines, based upon current industrial practices and
experiencs, present an outline of an industrial maintenenace painting programme. The outline includes
all phases of a programme deemed necessary, though emphasis on each phase and manner of accomplish-
ment of individal portions will vary with the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Size of industrial plants,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Type of industrial plants,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Corrosive atmosphere,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Geographical
location,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Economy, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Desires of management.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of instances of inadequate hand tool cleaning, owner in certain areas have resorted to specifying
blast cleaning on all new structures regardless of its feasibility, its environment and type of paint. To avoid
unnecessary failures or unnecessarily stringent specification in mild environments,
it is important
to
follow the good practices outlined in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The composition of the Committee responsible for the preparation of this standard is given at Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1 SCOPE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This standard povides guidelines in the selec-
tion of protective coating for painting of metallic,
concrete and other types of surface of structures

<<PARAGRAPH>>2 TYPES OF ENVIRONMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 A normal rural atmosphere
is comparatively
mild because the only deteriorating
influence is the
weather.
Strong
sunshine
may lead to rapid
degradation of some materials. The rural environ-
ment may be dry or wet and damp.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Field panels -  Exposure of small panels in
the corrosive atmosphere

<<PARAGRAPH>>Larger area test -
Application
of various
materials on steel over an area of more than
2 square metre in the corrosive
atomo-
sphere. This allows simultaneous
evalua-
tion of application characteristics as well as
performance data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 An industrial atmosphere generally is thought
of as that found in urban regions near industrial
plants or industrialized areas. The characteristic of
an industrial atmosphere is the high concentration
of sulfur dioxide. This factor increases corrosion
rates and attack on the protective systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Limited field tests -

<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Environments
near some types of industrial or
chemical plants may be classed as chemical because
of the presence of strong corrosive agents such as
acid fumes, atomized solutions of alkali dust, mist,
solvent vapours or any of the host of deteriorating
substances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 The most important
phase of any evaluation
programme is the proper and accurate correlation
of derived data to actual performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 The severiety of a chemical environment
may
vary from mild exposures, remote from the source
of chemical contamination
to extremely corrosive
situations such as produced by immersion in strong
chemicals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3 The types of material used for protection
will
varywith the service exposure and the life expectan-
cy required, or other economic justifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 The environments
described in 23and 2.4 are
considered
as chemically
aggresive which are
referred hereafter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4 Final evaluation
of the performance
of the
desired systems

<<PARAGRAPH>>3 SELECTION OF COATINGS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 TYPES OF COATINGS AND THEIR
CHARACTERISTICS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.0 The selection~of materials involves the evalua-
tion of the generic type of coatings, the brand or
manufacturer
and the application
characteristics.
Also the evaluation of expendable materials such
as sandblasting abrasives are also to be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.0 General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The descriptions of various types of coatings most
commonly used in the field are given in order to
familiarise the field man with their nomenclature
and give him an idea about their performance<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 An evaluation
programme
may vary widely
depending upon the size of plant, funds available<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 14428  :  1997<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>characteristics.
This at standard cover only those
types of coatings which have been used successfully
over a period of time. It does not cover some of the
newer coatings which are still considered to be in
the experimental stage as far as their in the field is
concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Chlorinated
Rubber<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Chlorinated
rubber resins are made by reacting
chlorine with natural rubber. Coatings made from
chlorinated
rubber have very good resistance to
alkalis, weak acids, and salt water, but should be
modified and stabilized to make them resistant to
sunlight. Their major use is in the coating of off-
shore platforms, fertilizer plants and barges. It is
essential that only chemically inert plasticizers are
incorporated
in the formulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.0.1 Organic coatings are composed of pigments
and vehicles as binders for anticorrosive
primers.
These coatings change from the liquid to a solid
film by several mechanisms such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Evaporation
of solvent,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Catalyzed Epoxy Coatings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Oxidation, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Polymerization,
either by internal reaction
or
reaction
with an added catalyst or
activator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A  small amount of amine or polyamide catalyst or
activator is added to the epoxy coating just prior to
application.
This causes a cross-linking
of the
molecules and curing of the coatings. While these
coatings set to touch in a few hours, several days are
required for them to cure completely and~develop
their ultimate chemical resistance. Catalyzed epoxy
coatings have good acid resistance and very good
alkali resistance,
however,
their
outstanding
property is their excellent resistance to solvents.
They are widely used for coating the interior of
products, storage tanks. In sunlight, they tend to
develop rapidly (within months) a surface chalk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Oil Base or Oleoresinous<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These consist of an oil (usually linseed, tung, soy
bean, or castor), which is capable of being con-
verted to a solid by reaction with oxygen of the air.
Metallic driers are added to accelerate this reac-
tion. The film formed has very little resistance to
chemicals and has higher permeability
to water
vapour and other gases than other types of films.
This permeability makes it a good binder for use in
house paints, which if not somewhat permeable
would blister and peel. An outstanding property of
the drying oils is their ability to wet and adhere to
steel, which accounts for their widespread use in
primers. This property is particularly important in
instances where it is not possible to remove all rust
before painting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The catalyzed coating shall be applied within a few
hours after the addition of catalyst, otherwise it will
set up in the can. Brushes and spray equipment used
to apply these coatings shall be cleaned thoroughly
after use. After the epoxy has cured there is no
known way to remove it from the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The
coating
manufacturer
should always be
consulted
before using an epoxy system for an
equipment which is to be immersed in either fresh
or salt water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Alkyd<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These synthetic resins are made by cooking certain
acids and alcohols along with varying quantities of
drying oils. These drying oils impart flexibility to
the resin  ;  more the oil in the resin, the more flexible
the coating will be. However it also follows that the
more the oil length or content, the more coating
will resemble the oleoresinous
type. Alkyds are
used in environments
mentioned
in 2.1 and very
mild acidic environments. The outstanding proper-
ties of alkyds are their gloss retention and stability
to sunlight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6  Coal Tar Epoxy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These  catalyzed materials combine the excellent
adhesion and water resistance of coal tar with the
thermal stability of catalyzed epoxy coatings. They
have high solids content by volume (65-S percent)
and good stayput, allowing thick coatings to be
applied in a minimum number of coats. Two coats
of S/10 mils each are recommended
for most uses.
The main uses of coal tar-epoxy coatings are for
offshore equipment, mud tanks, equipment to be
exposed to immersion in salt water (particularly
boat bottoms), the exterior of pipe which is to be
used underground
and the interior of crude tanks.
The high degree of impermeability
of gases, par-
ticularly
hydrogen
sulphide,
makes them well
adapted to protecting
the vapour zones of sour
crude tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Phenolic<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Phenolics are formed by reacting phenol with for-
maldehyde.
Air-drying
phenolics
have better
chemical resistance and more water resistant than
alkyds, but they are less resistant to the effect of
ultraviolet light, tending to yellow withage and to
chalk more rapidly. The phenolic based coatings
are suitable for areas which are subjected to sun-
light and mild chemical environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS 14428  :  1997<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4;7 Bituminous<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>aliphatic and aromatic. The aliphatic type has ex-
cellent resistance to weathering and most common-
ly used where colour
and gloss retention
are
important.
The aromatic type polyurethanes
are
sometimes used as tank linings. When properly
formulated,
applied and cured, two component
polyurethane
coatings have outstanding hardness,
abrasion
resistance
with chemical
properties
similar to epoxies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These coatings are made from coal tar or asphalt.
They may be hot-applied cut-back (dissolved in a
solvent), or emulsions (particles dispersed in a non-
solvent).
Their widest use lies in protection
of
buried pipe. The coal tar coating have much better
resistance to moisture penetration, to attack  by  soil
organisms, and to hydrocarbons than do most of the
asphalts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.11 Organic Zinc Primers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8 Vinyl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organic zincprimers
usually contains a high load-
ing of zinc-dust with organic film formers such as
epoxy, phenolics or chlorinated
rubber. This type
of primers have no critical application
require-
ments land are commonly applied to-blast-cleaned
steel at 50-75 microns dry film thickness without
problems of cracking or flaking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vinyl coatings have very good resistance to acids,
alkalites, oils and salt water. Their adherence is
poor unless special vinyl primers are used. For a
vinyl system a bright metal sand blast is necessary
for perfect performance.
Vinyl coatings have the
lowest solid content(and
highest chemical resis-
tance) of any of the commonly used coatings, there-
fore multiple
coats are necessary
to built up
adequate film thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.12 Inorganic Zinc Primers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inorganic zinc primers are usually referred to as
inorganic zinc silicates. All silicate coatings are
essentially based on a combination
of zinc and a
complex silicate solution. Such coatings can pro-
vide outstanding resistance to corrosion in a single
coat. These
coatings
are extremely
hard and
abrasion resistant and the adhesion to metal is of a
chemical nature which is one of the strongest bonds
that can be obtained between two materials. This
types of primers have excellent weathering proper-
ties and solvent resistance and extensively used for
preventing corrosion of tank exteriors, structural
steel, piping off shore platforms, bridges, marine,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.9 Silicone<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Silicone resins, because of their thermal stability
are used to make heat-resistant paints’. These resins
are quite expensive, therefore
silicone coatings
should be used only if other types of coatings are
unsatifactory. Aluminium-pigmented
silicone per-
form well up to about 427°C. They are widely used
on mufflers, heater stacks, and hot surfaces of that
type. A white-metal sand blast is necessary for the
silicones to perform properly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.10 Polyurethane<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Polyurethane
coatitrgs are based on the reaction of
a group of chemicals, the disocyanates, with resins
or a chemicals containing alcohol or amine sub-
stituents in their structures. The diisocyantes have
a high order of toxicity and therefore
chemically
modified to permit their use in protective coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Protective coatings are measures which can be
used in the control of corrosion of producing equip-
ment. If used intelligently and properly, they should
do a satisfactory job of protecting a metal from a
corrosive environment.
No coatings last forever,
and there are no cure-alls. No coating will work just
as well over rust as it will over properly prepared
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are total five types of polyurethane coatings,
namely:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Type 1 Single component
urethane-Modified
oil based system<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Type 2 Single component

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS14428:1997<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For small limited areas such as spot cleaning for
maintenance

even for paints requiring very clean surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Schedule shall be so arranged as to prevent
coating damage. When welding above a

surface,
the surface
should be
covered with sand, dirt, sacks or anything
that will prevent the weld spatter from drop-
ping down and burning holes through the
coating;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>6.3.-l Hand tool cleaning
shall
consist of the
following sequence of operations:
a><<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Oil grease, soluble welding flux residues and
salts shall first be removed by solvent clean-
ing. Other detrimental foreign matter shall
be removed by the following operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The paint should not be overthin. Requisite
quantity of thinner shall be added as per the
manufacturers
recommendations
to get
proper film thickness and flow of paint;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stratified rust (rust-scale) shall be removed
by hand hammering, hand chipping, other
hand impact
tools, or a combination
of
them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As paints have limited shelf life, procure-
ment instalments should be planned as per
requirements;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f-l<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All loose mill scale, and all loose or non-
adherent rust shall be removed by hand wire
brushing, hand sanding, hand scraping, or by
a combination or these methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If difficulties are encountered with applica-
tion, or if a coating does not perform as
expected, the paint manufacturer
may be
consulted.
Manufacturers
should send a
competent technical field representative
to
the job to help out difficulties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fainting should proceed as soon as possible
after the hand cleaning operations.
It is not as
critical, however, as in the case of blast cleaning or
pickling where virgin metal is exposed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 SURFACE PREPARATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.0 For surface
preparation
for painting,
one
should visualize what constitutes
the most ideal
surface condition
for a good paint anchor. For
general work, this anchor would constitute a metal
surface free of soil and chemical products. It would
be a relatively smooth surface free of scale or oxida-
tion products but with a mechanical surface anchor
of a height known to be suitable for the coating
system employed. Mill scale itself is a satisfactory
surface to paint. If kept intact, it will result in long
paint life in mild or only moderately severe environ-
ments. If intact mill scale is painted, long paint life
may be expected, in fact almost as long as for
descaled steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 Blast cleaning is preferable
where areas are
very large to achieve lowest coats (because of dif-
ficulties
in the
reclamation
of abrasives). The
following
factors
influence
blast
cleaning
operations:
a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Type of metal to be cleaned and cleaning
rate (speed).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shape of the part.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 While it appears desirable to produce the best
surface condition before a coating is applied, the
cost of the finished job should be born in mind.
Some service conditions do not require the removal
of all of the mill scale, rust, and contaminants. As
long as the prepared surface is compatible with the
coating applied, it will serve for a period of time
dertemined by the environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Time requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I?><<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the initial set up of the plant all the above
can be controlled in addition to protecting adjacent
property, particularly machinery, electrical equip-
ment, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7 SAFETY AND IIANDLING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 If the deterioration
of a paint film is sufficiently
slow and the underline
metal is not seriously
affected by the eventual loss of the coating, there is
little reason to concentrate
on anything but the
more economical surface preparation methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Aspects of safety and handling during the applica-
tion of all types of paints mentioned
in this
specification,
especially epoxies, polyurethanes,
zinc silicates, etc assume great importance. Diverse
chemical ingredients used in the formulations
as
curing agents, hardners, additives, bases could be
agressive, toxic or hazardous in nature. It is there-
fore mandatory to have full details with complete
procedures
and precautions
for safety and han-
dling of coatings
from the suppliers
and/or
manufacturers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Hand tool cleaning is an acceptable method of
surface preparation
for normal exposures in the
atmosphere, interiors, for much of the maintenance
painting, including paints of good wetting ability.
Hand cleaning will not remove all residue or rust
nor will it remove intact, firmly adhered mill scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
