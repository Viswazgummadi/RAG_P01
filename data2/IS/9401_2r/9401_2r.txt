FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
(Part
II )
was
adopted
by
the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 27 May
1982,
after
the draft
finalized
by the
Measurement
of Works
of River
Valley
Projects
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
In measurement
of quantities
in construction
of river valley
projects
a large diversity
of methods
exist at present according
to local
practices.
This
lack
of uniformity
creates
complication
regarding
measurements
and payments.
This standard
is intended
to provide
a uniform
basis
for measurement
of dewatering
items in the construction
of river
valley
projects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In reporting
the result of measurements
made
in
accordance
with
this
standard.
if the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
is
to
be
rounded
off, it shall be done in accordance
with IS  :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2-1960”.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard
( Part II ) covers
the
method
of
measurement
of
dewatering
works
in
river
valley
projects
( dams
and
appurtenant
structures
).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1  In order to drain water out of the site of work
and
to maintain
the
site of work
in a normally
dry
condition,
where
further
activities
of
work can be taken up during
the entire period
of execution
of  the  work,
adequate
measures
are required
to be taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 9401 (Part
II ) - 1982<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2  There
are
various
methods
of
dewatering
such
as
bailing
out,
electro-osmosis,
freezing,
draining,
pumping
as also
well point system,
constructing
diversion
channels/drains,
coffer
dams,
etc.
The
method
of dewatering
to be adopted
shall
have
the
approval
of Engineer-in-
Charge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3
Dewatering
has
to be
done
with
utmost
care
and caution
so that
there is no bailing,
heaving
up  or  displacement
of materials
below
the
foundation
level
of
structure
to
be
newly
constructed
or
already
constructed.
Lowering
of water
table
by
dewatering
shall
be
clone
gradually.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 The
free water surface
of depressed
water table shall not be less than
150 mm below the deepest subgrade
level of the structure
and 1 000 mm
in case of fill placement
in core trench.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5
Cost of all pumping,
bailing
out or any other works to dewater
the
foundation
area during
the entire
period of execution
of work including
cost of all materials,
labour,
cost of machinery
and equipments
shall be
included
in dewatering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. METHODS
OF
MEASUREMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1
Dewatering
may
be
included
in the
item
of
excavation
or
masonry
or concrete
work in foundation
and in such a case measurement
shall not be made separately
for dewatering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2 Hewatering
by Means
of Manual
Labour<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1
The
unit
of measurement
shall
be in mandays
if the nature
of
work is small.’<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3 Dewatering
by Means
of Pumps<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1
Dewatering
by
means
of pumps
may
be by
any one
of
the
methods
given below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Electrical
pumps,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Diesel pumps;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Pneumatic
pumps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
The unit
of measurement
in
case
of
dewatering
by electrical
pumps shall be kilowatt
hours ( kwh ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3
The unit of measurement
in case of dewatering
by diesel pumps
shall be horsepower
hour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.4
The
unit of measurement
in
case of dewatering
by pneumatic
pumps shall be cubic metre of air per hour ( ms/h ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
