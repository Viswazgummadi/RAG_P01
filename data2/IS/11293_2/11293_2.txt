<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after
the draft finalized by
the Foundation
and Sub-structures
Sectional Committee
had been approved by the River Valley
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grout curtains are established
under the heel of concrete
and masonry
dams to prevent erosion
and loss of water from
the reservoir,
and, in conjunction
with the drainage,
to reduce uplift
pressure.
This is created by drilling and grouting one, or more, lines of drill holes till a barrier
or cut-off of desired impermeability
is created.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design requirements
for grout curtains for earth
and rockfill
dams are covered in Part 1 of the
Standard.
This part covers the design requirements
of grout curtains for Masonry and Concrete
Gravity Dams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value,
observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test
or analysis,
shall be
rounded off in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values (  revised )‘.
The number of significant
places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that
of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

AND

GRAVITY
DAMS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>most common practice
is to driil holes inclined
towards
upstream
at 5 to 10 degrees
with the
vertical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
covers
the guidelines
for the
design of grout curtains
which
are used as a
principal measure of seepage control for masonry
and concrete
dams founded on rock mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4  Spacing of Grout Holes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Single line grout
curtains are generally
used.
The usual practice
is to try a widely spaced
system of primary
holes
at a spacing of 6 m to
8 m, followed by secondary
and tertiary
holes
at a progressively smaller spacing till the desired
results
are obtained.
However,
hole
spacing
less than one meter should be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2  REFERENCE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  The following
Indian Standard
is a neces-
sary adjunct to this standard:<<HEADING_END>>

revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5  Depth ~of the Grout Curtain<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The depth of the grout
curtain
depends upon
the type and conditions
of the rock
mass with
respect
to
its permeability.
The
following
emperical criteria may be used as a guide which
is based on going practice:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3  DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1 Geological Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The data already obtained
from the exploration
of the foundation
should be analysed to assess
the
characteristics
of foundation
rocks
and
the location
and orientation
of faults, seams,
cavities,
joints and bedding
planes and discon-
tinuities.
The permeability
values of foundation
strata at various depths
should
be used for the
design since the stages and spacing of the holes
for grouting should be based on this data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D = 2/3  H+
8
D =  Depth of the grout curtain
in m, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H =  Height of reservoir water in m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4  GROUT PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  The procedure
for grouting as laid down in
IS 6066  :  1984 should be followed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Drilling of Grout Holes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Percussion
drills
can be used for drilling the
grout holes, provided
the foundation
rock is of
a type
that
will produce
granular
cuttings,
rather
than
slimes. In case of rocks having
weaknesses
such
as faults
and
seams it is
recommended
that
at least one hole should be
bored with suitable boring
machines
which are
capable of recovery
of rock
cores and which
will facilitate
inspection
of bore
hole walls.
Diamond core drilling permits
the examination
of cores and the location
of seams by means of
a TV borehole
camera.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Curtain grouting is normally done from the
foundation
cum drainage gallery after masonry/
concrete
is laid up to half of the design height
or
20 m from
the
bottom
of the
gallery,
whichever
is earlier.
However in special cases
an additional
grout curtain can alsobe provided
at the heel of the dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3 Drainage
holes should
be drilled
in
the
foundation
gallery.
Drainage
holes
should,
however?
not
be drilled
in the foundation
gallery 011 curtain grouting is completed
within
30 m from the location
of the drainage holes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Inclination of Grout Holes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4  Efficacy of Grout Curtain<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The holes
may be either
vertical
or inclined.
The orientation,
plan and inclination
of grout
holes depends upon the type of joints and other
discontinuities
in the
foundation
rock.
The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This should be evaluated
by results of permea-
bility tests during drilling of secondary/tertiary
holes as given in IS 6066  :  1984.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
