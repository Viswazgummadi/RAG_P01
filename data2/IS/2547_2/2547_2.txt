FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard ( Part II ) ( llrst Revision) was adopted by the
Indian Standards Institution on 22 December 1976, after the draft finalized
by the Gypsum Building Materials Sectional Committee had been approved
by the Civil Engineering Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 Gypsum is a well known building material.
It has been extensively
used in various countries.
Premixed lightweight plasters essentially consists
of gypsum plaster and lightweight aggregate which are characterized by low
density, high thermal insulation and sound absorption properties and can be
readily used for building purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In the formulation of this standard, due weightage has been given to
international co-ordination
among the standards and practices prevailing
in different countries in addition to relating it to the practices in the field
in this country.
This has been met by basing the standard on BS 1191  :
Part 2  :  1973  ‘  Specification for gypsum building plasters. Part 2 Premixed
lightweight plasters ‘, published by the British Standards Institution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 For the purpose of deciding, whether a particular requirement of this
standard is complied with, the final value, observed or calculated, express-
ing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS  :  2- 1960*.
The number of significant places retained in the rounded off
value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard ( Part II ) specifies requirements for premixed lightweight
plaster consisting essentially of gypsum plaster and lightweight aggregate
used in general building operations.<<HEADING_END>>

the same class and type and from the same batch of manufacture shall be
grouped together to constitute a lot.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1  Samples shall be selected and tested separately from each lot to
determine ,its conformity or otherwise to the requirements of the speci-
fication  .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  The number of packages to be selected for the sample from a lot shall
depend upon the size of the lot and shall be in accordance with co1 I and 2
of Table 2.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1 The packages for the sample shall be selected at random from the
lot and in order to ensure the randomness of selection the procedures given
in IS  :  4905-1968t
may be adopted.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3  Number of Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1 The contents of each package in the sample shall be thoroughly
homogenized by mixing separately and sufficient quantity of gypsum plaster
shall then be drawn from each package separately for carrying out the tests<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Weigh 25 g  of sample into a 4OO-ml beaker atid add 250 ml of wata.
Stir thoroughly and let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Stir
again and filter immediately through a Buchner funnel, which contains
a well-seated retentive filter paper, into a 500-ml filtering flask using slight
vacuum.
Without washing, transfer the insoluble matter and the paper to
thC original beaker and rinse the funnel with 150 ml of water into the beaker
containing the insoluble matter.
Stir thorobghly and let stand 30 min at
room temperature.  Stir  and filter, as above, using a fresh filter papa. Again
return the insoluble matter and the paper to the original beaker.
Wash the
fimnel with 100 ml of water into the beaker containing the insoluble matter.
Stir thoroughly and let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Stir and
filter as above.
Quantitatively
transfer the filtrate to a suitable beaker.
Acidify the filtrate with 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid ( r. d. 1’19 ).
Stir until cloudiness disappears.
Evaporate the solution to about 400 ml.
Cool to room temperature and transfer quantitatively to a 500-ml volumetric
flask. Dilute to 500 ml.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
