<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Part 2 ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards,
after the draft finalized
by
the Hydraulic
Structures
Instrumentation
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the River
Valley
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To minimizecracking,
large straight
gravity and arch gravity dams are made in blocks,
separated
from each
other by transverse
and longitudinal
contraction
joints,
To restore the dam to its monolithic
state for inte-
grated behaviour,
contraction
joints
are grouted
with cement
grout.
Grouting
of joints
is done when the
joints
have opened
to their maximum.
Measurement
of joints
movement
during
grouting
operation
will
indicate
the quantity
of grout to be pumped
into the joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement
of joint movements
subsequent
to the completion
of the grouting
of contraction
joints, provides
information
regarding
the behaviour
of the grouted joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surface measurement
of joint movements
are useful for observing
movement
of joints.
These measurements
can be made with mechanical
strain gauges
However, surface measurements
cannot
be fully relied upon,
as all joints
do not open to the same extent. Internal
joint movements
may, therefore,
also need to be meas-
ured.
Jointmeters
are used for measurements
of internal
movements
of joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
has been prepared
in two parts
:  IS 10434 ( Part 1 )  :  1982 ‘Guidelines
for installation,
maintenance
and observation
of deformation
measuring
devices
in concrete
and masonry
dams
:  Part 1
Resistance
type jointmeters’
covers the resistance
type jointmeters,
and Part 2 covers the vibrating
wire type
jointmeters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with, the final
value, observed or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(  revised )‘.  The number
of significant
places
retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.2 Number, Location and Layout<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard (Part 2 ) covers the details of installation,
maintenance and observations of vibrating wire type
jointmeters of the embedded type for measurement of
joint movements at the surface and in the interior of
concrete and masonry dam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mounting studs should be installed on the surface
at points corresponding to the locations ofjointmeters
inside the dam. These should also be fixe~d inside
galleries across accessible joints at points which
correspond to the jointmeter locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1 Mounting studs should be fixed across cracks
that are considered dangerous to the integrity of
structure.
The behaviour of these cracks should be
observed under imposed loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2 REFERENCE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Indian Standard IS 6524: 1972 ‘Code of practice for
installation
and observation
of instruments
for
temperature measurement inside dams -Resistance
type thermometers’,
is a necessary adjunct to this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2 The arrangement for fixing-the mounting studs
across the joint is shown in Fig. 1. The difference in
the readings derived from the relevant formula gives
the value of increase/decrease in the joint opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.1  Principle and Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Jointmeters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements of joint movements at surface or at the
locations
accessible
from galleries
are made by
detachable gauges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two kinds of jointmeters for internal joint movement
measurements are in use:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Resistance type [see IS 10434 (Part 1)  :  1982 1,
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The vibrating wire type jointmeters can also be used
for mounting on surface by providing suitable mounting
fixtures with the gauge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1  Vibrating Wire Type Jointmeter<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1A.1 Operatingprinciples.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basic principle of Vibrating Wire Type Jointmeter
is that change in natural frequency of a stretched wire
depends on the change of the tension in the wire. In
this instrument one end of the wire is attached to the
moveable head of the jointmeter by a steel spring and
the other end to a fixed point. Any displacement is
thus transforme4l to a variation in tension of the spring
and vibrating wire. The frequency of the wire is a
measure of displacement between joints. A difference
of square of frequencies
is proportional
to the
displacement. The frequency readings are read by the
vibrating wire readout which is comiected to the gauge
by cables.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Jointmeters should also be installed in one of the non-
overllow
blocks or any other block
which is
representative of these blocks. In each of the blocks,
jointmeters should be placed in the centre of the portion,
encirled between the grouting joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Signal  Cable<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>This  cable connects the transducer to the readout unit.
It~should be selected to withstand the environment in
which it is required to be laid.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In normal cases, cables with two core annealed copper
conductors and with copper shield,-heavy PVC coating
should be used. When used in adverse environment,
steel armoured petroleum jelIy-filled and polyethylene-
insulated cables should be used. Heavily armoured
cables with 10,20 or more pairs of conductors should
be used to connect different junction boxes to the
instrument house.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1.2  Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thejointm&erisconstructedintwoparts,themoveable
part and the fixed part.  Normally  both  the parts have
a flange at each end of the instrnment. The moveable
part is attached to a spring  which  in  turn is connected
to the vibrating wire. With the movement of joint the
moveable part of the jointmeter moves thereby changing
the resonant frequency of the vibrating wire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1 The calculated length of cable should be increased
by 10 per cent or 1.5 m, whichever ismore, to allow for
possible variation in the selected route.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1.3  Advantages<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2 Each meter length of cable should be identified
by a letter prefix, The normal prefix for jointmeter is
JM-1, JM-2 etc. After splicing, a copper band duly’
stamped or punched with instrument identification
nmber is crimped to the cable about one metre away
from the free end. In addition a few more labels
consisting ofthe identitication number marked on white
tape should be placed around the cable near the read-
out end.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The vibrating wire type jointmeter
works on the
principle
of observing
frequency
and the main
advantages are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Easy to read by simple instrumem,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Effects of signal cable resistance, contact
resistance, leakage to ground or length of
signal cable are negligible; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.3 Provisions contained in 4.3 of IS 6524  :  1972
should also apply to the jointmeter installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Frequency signal permits data transmission
over long
distance and thus suitable for
centralized
observation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Terminal  Boards<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cables  should be terminated in suitable  terminal boxes.
Jointmeter mnnbers should be indicated in the terminal
boxes also as described in 4.3.2. Ifthe terminal boxes
are to be placed in the inspection gallery, they should
be mounted in niche, preferably on the downstream
side. The terminal boxes should be moisture-proof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2  Number and Location<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1 Number of jointmeters required to be provided
in any dam will depend upon the dimension, block
layout, provision of transverse and longitudinal joints
or transverse joints only, contiguration of the foundation
profile, presence of speciaily-treated foundation featmes
under the dam and the extent to which measurements
ofjoint behaviour would prove adequate in representing
the  joint movements for the entire structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5  Readout/Data Logger<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A simple, portable, battery-operated readout unit with
4-digit LCD display should be used. Calibration data
for each~transdncer should be provided for converting
the frequency readings to relevant engineering units
when a simple readout unit is used to read frequency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.2 In the case of a dam built in V-shaped canyon;
jointmeters should be installed in at least three blocks,
namely, one central block representing the deepest and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 10434 ( Part 2 )  :  1996<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>in the galleries.
To ensure correct and reliable
measurement the identification marks on the leads must
be checked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 CALIRRATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Each transducer should be calibrated separately
on a suitable calibration system in the laboratory prior
to taking-the instrument to field for installation.
It is
very often not possible to recalibrate a sensor after
installation. This means that good long term stability
of the sensor is very important to obtain reliable results.
The sensors should be capable of overloading to 1.5
times the rated capacity. While calibrating the sensors,
the transducers are to be overloaded to 10 percent more
thanthe mtedcapacityfor atleast 10 times for stabilizing
the calibrated readings.
Each transducer should be
provided with a separate calibration certificate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2
The following
reading
schedule
may be
adopted:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Immediately after embedment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Every 3 h for the next 30 h;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Every 12 h for the next four days;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once a day till the concrete temperature rises
toga maximum (usually about two weeks);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bi-weekly for the next month;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Usually the gauge wire and the body of the transducer
are made of materials having similar coefficient of
thermal expansion and the temperature variation,  if  any,
thus will only influence the readings to a very limited
degree. The transducers are to be calibrated at different
temperatures within its working range and the thermal
coefficient should be recorded in calibration certificate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Weekly afterwards until the completion of
contraction, joint grouting, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Fortnightly thereafter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4  Forms of Record<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Observations should be recorded on the field reading
form shown in Annex A. These forms should be got
printed sntliciently in advance and kept ready. Duplicate
copy
of
observations
should
be
prepared
simultaneously. The original should be sent to design
office, or to the office entrusted with the analysis of
the data and the duplicate retained in the field record
office for future reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  Method of Installation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  fibrating
Wire Type Jointmeters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1.1  Prior to embedment ofjointmeter, each ins&ument
should be checked physically alpd also functionally
by moving the movable part of the jointmeter
and
observing the change in the readings on the readout.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Alternatively,  if  a  Central Data Acquisition System is
used, the data is automatically collected and presented
in the formats as required in the method of analysis
used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.1.2
The jointmeter isinstalled in two parts, the
movable part and the fixed part. During the first lift of
concrete, the socket is fixed to the framework with the
installation plug and bolt. When the concrete has cured,
the framework is withdrawn leaving the exposed end
of installed socket ready to accept the main body ( fixed
part ) of the jointmeter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Readings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The readings of resonant frequency change are taken
with the help of readout unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before the second lift of concrete is cast, the jointmeter
is screwed
into the installed
socket,
extended
sufliciently to allow for expected joint movement, tied
‘securely on rebar supports.
When both the lifts of
concrete are complete, the jointmeter is firmly anchored
into each lift to measure opening or closing the joint.
The sensing transducer is usually smaller than the
protective body of the jointmeter. A small degree of
shear motion of the concrete is accommodated by
universal joint of the unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The value of calibration factor  K,  the value of zero
frequencyf,, coefficient of temperature Cand the value
of constant A should be provided by the instrument
manufacturer after calibrating the instruments in the
factory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following
formula
is used to calculate
the
displacement:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
