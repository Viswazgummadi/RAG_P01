FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Second
Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 30 September
1985,
after the draft finalized
by
the
Construction
Plant
and
Machinery
Sectional
Committe~e
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
In order
to guide
the purchaser,
in obtaining
this machinery
with
some
minimum
guaranteed
performance
and
also to lay down working
limits
for
capacity
and
other
features
of
the machine
and to aid in
production
by limiting
the production
of standard
sizes, this standard
has
been formulated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This
standard
was first published
in 1961 and revised in 1968.
The
present
revision
takes
into
account
the
experience
gained
during
the
course of these years.
The revision
incorporates
number
of modifications,
the prominent
among
which are materials
for different
type of mixers
and
deletion
of clause
relating
to terminology.
The
title has been
changed
to general
requirements
as some of the provisions
given in this standard
are not specific.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a test
or analysis,
shall
be
rounded
off
in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960*.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of the specified
value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
lays down
requirements
regarding
the drum,
water
tanks
and fittings,
loaders,
hoppers,
power
units, discharge
height,
road
worthiness,
etc, for the free fall (drum)
batch
type concrete
mixers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>*Rules for rounding off numerical
values ( rcviscd ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 1791- 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2  The continuous
mixer,
forced
action
(pan) type mixer
and truck
mounted mixer are not covered in this standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  For the purpose of this standard,
the definitions
given in Indian
Standard
on Glossary
of terms
relating
to
concrete
mixers
(under
preparation )  shall apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. DESIGNATION
OF SIZE AND TYPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The size of a batch type concerete mixer shall be designated by the
number
representing
its nominal
batch
capacity
in litres together with
the letter
T
to indicate
the tilting
type, the letters
.hV to indicate
non-tilting
type or the letter  R  for reversing type.
Thus a mixer having
a nominal
batch
capacity
of 200 litres will have the designation 200 T if
it is of tilting type, 200 .K’- if it is of the non-tilting
types, or 200  R  if it is
of reversing type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. SIZES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1  Concrete mixers shall be of the following sizes:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)  Tilting Type -
100 T,  140  T and 200 T.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Non-tilting Type-- 200 NT,
280 NT,
375 NT,
500 NT
and
1 000 NT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>c) Reversing Type -
200  R,  280  R,  375 R, 500  R and 1000 R.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1
Margin
of Capacity -
Mixers,
when operating
on level, shall be
capable
of holding and mixing an actual mixing
batch
10 percent
in
excess of the nominal mixed batch capacity laid down in 4.1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2 Sizes other than those specified in 4.1 may be supplied by mutual
agreement
between the purchaser and the supplier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.  DRUM<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1  The size of the drum shall be such that the ratio of the total interior
drum volume (geometric
solid) to the nominal
size of the mixer is not
less than the appropriate
value given in Table
1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2  The quality of material used in the construction of mixing drum and
minimum
thickness of drum for various sizes of concrete mixer shall be<<HEADING_END>>

may also be provided.,
Even
when
a mechanical
device

coarse
aggregate
in a freshly
mixed
batch
of concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19.1.1  The
