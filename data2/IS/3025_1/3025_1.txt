<<PARAGRAPH>>3. Sampling<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Filling the Containers -
Iti  the
case of  samples
for the determination
of physico-chemica
parameters one simple
precaution,
which
is not, however,
adequate
in all cases,
is to fill the  flask!
completely
and stopper
them.in
such a way that there is no air above the sample’.
This
limits
inter
Ftction with the gas phase
and agitation
during
transport
( thus
avoiding
modifications
in carbon
dioxide content,
and hence variations
in ,oH; hydrogencarbonates
are not converted
into precipitablc
:arbonates;
iron has less tendency
to be oxidized,
thus limiting
colour
variations;
etc ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sample containers,
whose
contents
are frozen
as part of their
preservation,
should
not bc
:ompletely
filled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.2 Use  of  Appropriate Containers -
The
choice
and
the
preparation
of a container
can be o
najor importance.
However,
it should
be remembered
that the
container
in which
the
sample
i:
stored and the stopper
should
not:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) be a cause of contamination
( for example,
borosilicate
or soda-lime
glass
containers
ma]
Increase
the content
of silica
or sodium
);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) absorb or adsorb the constituents
to be determined
( for example,
hydrocarbons
may be
absorbed
in a polyethylene
container,
traces of met.als may be adsorbed
on the surface
oi
a glass container
); and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) react with certain
constituents
in the sample ( for example fluorides
reacting
with glass ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should
be remembered
that the use of opaque
containers
or brown
( non-actinic
) glass
:ontainers
can reduce the photosensitive
activities
to a considerable
extent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Blank samples
should
be taken, preserved
and analyzed
as a check on the
suitability
of the
:hoice of container
and cleaning
procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.3  Cleaning of Containers<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3.1 For samples for general chemical analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1.1 For  analysis
of trace
quantities
of
chemical
constituents
of
surface
or
wastewater,
t is usual to clean new containers
thoroughly
in order to minimize
possible
contamination
of the
iample;
the type of cleaners
used and the container
material
vary according
to the
constituents<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>o be analyzed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For  general  purposes,
new glass containers
should
be cleaned
with
water
and
detergents
to
emove dust and packing
material.
They should
then be cleaned
with
chromic
acid-sulphuric
acid
lixture
before
being thoroughly
rinsed

<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 3025 ( Part 1 ) - 1987<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>it may be desired, for environmental
or health
reasons, to avoid the use of chromic
acid.
Alternatively,
proprietary cleaning agents may be used, provided it has been established
that they
do not cause sample contamination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>it should be noted that detergents, possibly containing
phosphates,
cannot be used if phos-
phates or surface-active
agents are to be determined, nor can chromic acid-suiphuric
acid mixture
be used if trace q-uzmtities of suiphate and chromium are to be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Polyethylene containers,
in general, should
be cleaned by filling
with 1 moi/l nitric acid or
hydrochloric
acid, leaving for 1 to 2 days, followed
by thorough rinsing with distilled
or de-ionized
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1.2 For  samples for determination
of pesticides,
herbicides,and
their
residues
-  in general,
brown glass containers should be used because plastics,
except poiytetrafluorethyiene
( PTFE ),
may introduce interferences
which can be significant
if trace analyses are to be performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The containers should becleaned with water and detergent, followed by thorough rinsing with
distilled
water, then oven dried and cooled before being rinsed with hexane or petroleum
ether.
Finally they should be dried with a stream of carefully purified air or nitrogen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A continuous
extraction
with acetone for 12 h, followed
by a hexane rinse and drying as
described above, can also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1.3  For samples
for
microbiological
analysis
-
The containers
shall withstand
a 160°C
sterilization
and shall not produce or release at this temperature any chemicals which would either
inhibit biological activity, induce mortality or encourage growth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When lower sterilization
temperatures
are used, poiycarbonate
and heat resistant
polypropy-
lene containers may be used. Caps or other stoppers shall withstand
the same sterilization
tsm-
peratures as the containers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Glass containers should be cleaned with water and detergent,
followed by thorough
rinsing
with distilled
water. Then they should be rinsed wlth nitric acid ( HNOa ) followed
by thorough
rinsing .with distilled water in order to remove heavy  metals  or  chromate residues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A total of 0’1 ml of a 10 percent (  m/m )  solution of sodium
thiosuiphate
( Na,SIOs ) can be
added, for every 125 ml of container capacity, before sterilization.
This is to eliminate
inhibition
of
bacteria by chlorine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  Sample Volume -
A two-iitre
sample is normally
sufncient
for most physical
and chemical
analysis.
How8ver, the quantity may be varied depending upon the type of analysis,
methods
used
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5  Sample Preservation
-
Waste waters usually decompose rapidly at room temperature, therefore,
certain
tests, namely, dissolved
oxygen, suiphides,
residual chlorine,
nitrite, pH, etc, should be
made or fixed at-site. For certain other tests, preservatives should be added immediately
to indivi-
dual sampi& of the same water or wastewater in different sampling bottles for each test. Summary
of requirements for handling of samples is given in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6  Sampling
Devices -
Glass or polyethylene
bottles
are buoyant therefore, a sufficiently
heavy
bracket or. holder as given in Fig. 1 should be used to overcome buoyancy. The bracket shou\id be
tied with a string and lowered into canal, river or well. TO collect sample from a particular
depth,
a sampler as given in Fig. 2 may be used. The sampler  is  lowered to a desired depth and Its stopper
is  removed by means of a jerk. When the bottle
is full, it cannot be stoppered and should be pui-
led in open condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.1 A sampler as given in Fig. 3 should
be used for sampling from 56 metres or more depth.
The sampler comprises bottles open at both ends. The bottle is lowered to the desired depth in
open position then closed by drop weight or messanger which slides down the supporting cord.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.6.2  Sub-surface
sampler -
it  is a device used to collect fluid samples from a bore hole at a
desired depth. it is very useful in collecting
water samples from geothermal
boreholes and in mak-
ing proper and complete geochemical study of the system underground.
The design of the sampler
is shown
in  Fig. 4. A sample vessel (c) is fitted. at the lower end with a sample
release value (D)
and  an  inward flow non-return valve (B) at the upper end. A mild-steel shim
puncture seal (B2) is
located
above,
and in  series with the non-return
valve. A spring suspended weight fltted at its
lower end with a shim seal spear, comprising
the inertia mechanism (A), is mounted directly above
the shim seal.%<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.7  Types of Samples<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7.1  General -
Analytical
data may be
required
to indicate
the quality
of water by determina-
tion
of such
parameters
as concentrations
of
inorganic
material,
dissolved
minerals
or chemi-
cals, dissolved
gases,
dissolved
organic
material,
matter suspended
in the water or bottom sedi-
ment at a specific
time and location
or over some specific
time and location
or over some specific
time-interval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain
parameters,
such as the concentration
of dissolved
gases, should
be measured
in-silu,
if possible,
to obtain
accurate
results.
It is recommended
that separate
samples
be used for che-
mical and biological
analyses
because
the procedures
and equipment
for collection
and handling
are different.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>FIG. 1 SAMPLE BOTTLE HOLDER<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sampling techniques
will vary according to the specific. situation.
The different
types of
sampling are described
in 3.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7.2  Spot
samples
-
Spot samples are discrete samples generally collected manually, but which
can be collected automatically,
for waters at the surface, at specific
depths
and at the bottom.
Each sample will normally be representative
of the water quatity only at the time and place taken.
Automatic sampling is equivalent to a series of such samples taken on a pre-selected time or flow-
interval basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spot samples are useful if the flow of” the water to be sampled is not uniform, if the values of
the parameters of interest are not constant, and if the use of a composite
sample would obscure
differences between individual
samples due to reaction between them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spot samples may also be required in investigations
of the possible
existence of pollution, or
in surveys to indicate its extent or,, in the case of automatic discrete sample collection,
to determine
the time of day that pollutants
are present. They
may also be taken prior to the establishment of
a more extensive sampling
programme.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The taking of spot samples may be specified for the determination
of certain parameters, such
as the concentration
of dissolved gases, residual chlorine and soluble suiphides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7.3  Periodic
samples
at fixed
time
intervals
-
These samples are taken using a timing mecha-
nism to initiate and terminate thecollection
of water during a specific time-interval. A common proce-
dure is to pump the sample during a fixed period into one or more containers, a set volume being
delivered to each container.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7.4  Periodic
samples.taken
at fixed
flow
intervals
-
These samples are utilized when variations
in water quality criteria and the effluent flow rate are not inter-related.
They are also categorized
as flow-proportioned
samples. An example would be that for each unit volume ( for example, 10,000
iitres ) of liquidflow,
a constant sample size is removed irrespective of time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7.5  Continuous
samples
taken
at
fixed
flow
rates
( time
dependent
or time
average
) -
Samples
taken by this technique
contain all constituents
present during a period of sampling but do not
provide information
about the variation of concentrations
of specific
parameters during the period
of sampling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.7.6 Continuous samples taken at variable flow rates ( flow dependent or proportional )-
The
flow-proportional
samples collected are representative
of the bulk water quality.
If both the flow
and composttion
vary, flow  proportional
samples
can reveal such variations
which may not be
observed by the use of spot samples.
Accordingly,
this is the most precise method of sampling
flowing water, if both the flow rate and the concentration
of pollutants of interest vary significantly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>37.7  Composite samples -  Using one of the preceding techniques, samples may be obtained
manually
or automatically
on either of two basis, that is, individual
samples or composite sam-
ples, where, on either a flow, time, volume dependent or on flow basis, it is desired to mix several
individual
samples and reduce the cost and time for their analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Composite samples provide average compositional
data. Accordingly,
before combining sam-
ples, it should be verified
that such data is desired or that the parameter(s) of interest does not
vary significantly
during the sampling period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.8  Transportation of Samples -  The individual
wastes tend to decompose on keeping, which
results in the change of composition
at room temperature.
The following
measures should
be
adopted when transporting
the samples from the place of sampling to the laboratory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The sample should be collected in leakproof glass or plastic container;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Sample should be transported
in an ice box keeping the temperature around 4°C;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Undue jerking of the samples shouldLbe avoided as this may result in coagulation
of the
suspended matters:

Sampling
Locations<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9.1
Rivers,
stregms
and
canals
-
Samples
should
be collected,
as far as possible,
from
mid-
stream
at mid
depths.
Sampling
too
near
the bank provide
fictitious
results.
Sites
should
be
selected
preferably
where marked quality
changes
occur and ,where there are
important
river
uses
such as confluences,
major river
discharges
or abstractions.
Sampling
locations
can be fixed
by
reference
to significant
features.
In this connection
use of reference
maps may be helpful.
The site
should
be reasonably
accessible
all the year round.
Taking
of samples
from over the bridges
is
appropriate.
Samples
can also be taken from boats wherever
feasible
for rivers and lakes.
Unsafe
banks
should
be avoided.
Wherever
necessary,
sampling
should
be made by a team using
safety
jackets.
Sampling
by wading,
where the
rivers
are shallow,
care being
taken to collect
samples
upstream
of the wader,
who
can disturb
the bottom sediments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When
it is intended
to monitor
the effects
of a discharge,
both upstream
and
downstream
sampling
is nncessary.
Mixing
of discharge
with
receiving
water is important.
A sample
from  100
metres down stream of-the discharge
po.int is considered
representative
in case of small streams.
In rivers
many
kilometres
will
be necessary.
Therefore,
in case of longer
rivers there should
be
three fixed sampling
locations
in a cross-section
( left, middle,
right ), the left and right one should
be far enough from the
bank. Sampling
should
extend to an appropriate
distance
downstream
to
assess effects on the river. Ideally,
sample
should
be taken
from a turbulent
point.
WhEre the flow<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : 3025 ( Part 1 ) - 1997<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>is stream-lined,
turbulence
should
be induced.
( This
does
not apply to collection
of samples
for
determination
of dissolved
gases and volatile
materials.
)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The general
considerations
for rivers and streams
also spply to canals.
Flow and stratification
are important
factors.
The
rate of flow in canals
change
depending
on their
use, Stratification
is
pronounced
under quiescent
conditions.
The water body can be thermally
straitified-and
very signi-
ficant
quality
differences
can
develop
at different
depths
Passage
of
boats
also
have
marked
short-term
effect  on  the quality
especially
on suspended
solids,
oil and grease which may be contri-
buted
as a result of spills
from boats,
etc. Sampling
should
be carried
out at all draw-off
points
and draw-off
depths,
in addition
to the point of inputs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9.2  Ground
water -
Whenever
possible,
sample should
be collected
after
pumping
the well
or bore hole for a period of at least an hour or two. This ensures
drawal
of new water from aquifer.
Depth below ground
level or reference
level at which
the sample
is taken,
should
be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9.3
Drinking
water supply -
The
sampling
point
should
be located
at a place where all the
reactions
of the disinfecting
agent are completed
and also some residual
disinfectant
is present.
The usual sampling
position
is a tap on a pipe connected
directly
to the
pumping
main,
as close
as possible
to thd reservoir.
Many service
reservoirs
fill and empty through
the same main.
Samp-
ling should
be made when reservoir
is being emptied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9.4  Sewage efnuents
-
Samples
may be required
when
sewage enters a treatment
plant,
after
various
stages
of treatment
and the
treated
effluent.
Crude
sewages
samples
are taken aftei
preliminary
treafment
process
( grit removal
and screening
) to exclude
large particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of sewers and narrow
effluent
channels,
samples
should
be drawn from a point which
is at one-third
water
depths
from the top
without
skimming
the top or scrapping
the bottom.
In
any event yelocity
of flow at the sampling
point should
be sufficient
to prevent
deposition
of solids.
Sample should
be drawn
gently
without
causing
aeration
or
liberation
of dissolved
gases.
In most
cases, sewage flows are intermittent
and collection
of sample every hour may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.9.5  Trade efluent
-
Sampling
of
industrial
effluents
must be considered
in relation
tothe
nature
and location
of each individual
effluent.
When effluents
from a variety
of processes
disch-
arge into a common drain,
adequate
mixing
is required.
Sample should
be collected
keepi.ng
this
in mind.
In some cases this may require
construction
of a manhole
chamber
within
the
factory
begore the final outfall.
Samplisshould
be drawn
from the manhole
without
entering
it. Samples
from deep manholes
should
be drawn
with the help of specially
designed
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There
is a possibility
of domestic
sewage getting
mixed
into industrial
waste. Sampling
site
should
be chosen to exclude
such wastes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gene.ral principles
for collection
of sewages
and sewage
effluents
are applicable
in case
of trade effluents
also.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EXPLANATORY
