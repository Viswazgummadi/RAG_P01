FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This
Indian
Standard
( First Revision
) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 4 July
1986,
after
the draft
finalized
by
the
Waterproofing
and
Damp-Proofing
Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2
Bitumen
has
been
extensively
used
for
waterproofing
and damp-
proofing
of buildings.
Considerable
development
has been made in the
efficient
handling
and
application
of bituminous
materials
for water-
proofing
and damp-proofing
purposes.
As there are number
of technical
terms
in
use
in the
field
of bituminous
waterproofing,
it was felt that
standardization
of terminology
would be useful
to engineers,
architects
and
contractors
connected
with
waterproofing
and
damp-proofing
works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3
This
standard
was
first
published
in
1968.
The revision
of this
standard
has been taken up to incorporate
additional
terms and
to keep
it in line with IS  :  334-1982
‘Glossary
of terms relating
to
bitumen
and
tar’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4
In
the
formulation
of this standard
due weightage
has been given
to international
co-ordination
among
the
standards
and
practices
pre-
vailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in
the field in this country.
This
has been met by basing the
standard
on
the following
publications:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>BS
2717  :  1956
Glossary
of
terms
applicable
to roof
