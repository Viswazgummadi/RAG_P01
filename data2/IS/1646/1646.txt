<<PARAGRAPH>>Fire Safety Sectional Committee, CED 36<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Second Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft
finalized by the Fire Safety Sectional Committee had been approved by the Civil Engineering Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was first published in 1961, revised subsequently in 1982. The present revision is based on
the subsequent development and modifications in other regulations such as electrical rules of the Tariff
Advisory Committee, Indian Electricity Rules, etc, and other Indian Standards. Special precautionary
measures for use of aluminium conductors and for use of fluorescent fittings in electrical installations are
included in the revision.
The other changes relate to the developments in wiring methods and other
general aspects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements
of this code are to be treated as supplementary
to the requirements
of the Indian
Electricity Act, 1910 and the Rules of 1956 thereunder and in no case as substitutes. In the preparation
of this code, it has been presumed that the electrical installation work is carried out by qualified
contractors and electricians under the supervision of competent engineers as required by the Indian
Electricity Rules.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For ‘the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with, the
final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test, shall be rounded off in accordance with
IS 2  :  1960 ‘Rules for rounding off numerical values (revised)‘. The number of significant places retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

1 There should be no door or window opening in the sur-
rounding building, if the transformers are within 6 m thereof.
2 If the transformers are within 6 m of doors and window
openings

protected by single fire proof doors and 6 mm thick wired
glass in steel frames respectively.
3 Separating walls shall not be necessary in case of trans-
formers having an aggregate oil capacity exceeding 2 000
litres but individual oil capacity of less than 5 000 litres if the
distance between transformers and other apparatus is more
than 6 m or if the transformers ate protected by an approved
high velocity water spray system.

apply to dty type transformers, or transformers having sul-
phur hexafluoride, non-flammable
coolants and
having
primary voltage not mote than 33 kV.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

housing oil-
filled apparatus containing 2 000 litres or more of
oil shall be provided with oil drains of at least 150
