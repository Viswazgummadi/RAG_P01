FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian
Standard
was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institu-
tion
on 28 January
1982, after
the draft
finalized
by the Cement
and
Concrete
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Civil Engineer-
ing Division
Council.
0.2 The Indian
Standards’
Institution
has already
published
a series of
standards
on methods
of testing
cement
and concrete.
It has been recog-
nized
that reproducible
and repeatable
test results
can be obtained
only
with
standard
testing
equipment
capable
of .giving
the desired
level
of
accuracy.
The Sectional
Committee
has, therefore,
decided
to bring
out
a series of specifications
covering
the requirements
of equipment
used fdr
testing
cement
and concrete,
to encourage
their
development
and
manu-
facture
in the country.
0.3 Accordingly,
this standard
has been
prepared
to cover
requirements
of the machine
used for testing
abrasion
value of coarse aggregates.
The
method
of determining
abrasion
value
of coarse
aggregate
is covered
in
IS  :  2386 ( Part IV )-1963*.
0.4 In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been given
to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.
0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
express-
ing the result
of a test or analysis,
shall be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960t.
The
number
of significant
places
retained
in the
rounded
off value
should
be the same
as that
of the specified
value
in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
