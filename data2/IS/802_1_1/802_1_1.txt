<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian
Standard
( Third
Revision
) was adopted
by the Bureau
of Indian
Standards,
after
the draft finalized
by the Structural
Engineering
Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the
Civil Engineering
Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The standards
under
IS 802 series
have been
prepared
with a view to establish
uniform
practices
for design,
fabrication,
inspection
and testing
of overhead
transmission
line towers.
Part
1 of the
standard
covers
requirements
in
regard
to material,
loads
and
permissible
stresses
apart
from
other
relevant
design
provisions.
Provisions
for fabrication,
galvanizing,
inspection
and packing
have been covered
in Part 2 whereas
provisions
for
testing
of these
towers
have been covered
in Part 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published
in 1967 and
subsequently
revised
in 1973 and
in 1977.
In this
revision,
the standard
has been split in two sections,
namely
Section
1 Materials
and
loads,
and
Section
2 Permissible
stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of the major
modifications
made in this Section
are as under:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concept
of maximum
working
load multiplied
by the factors
of safety
as per IE Rules has
been replaced
by the ultimate
load concept.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For assessing
the
loads
on tower,
concept
of reliability,
security
and
safety
have been
introduced
on the basis
of
IEC 826  : 1991  ‘Technical
report
on
loading
and
strength
of
overhead
transmission
lines’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Basic wind speed
based *on peak
gust velocity,
averaged
over 3 seconds
duration,
as per’
the wind  map of India
grven in IS 875 ( Part 3 )  :  1987 ‘Code
of practice
for design
loads
( other
than
earthquake
) for buildings
and structures
:  Part 3 Wind
loads ( second  revision )’
has been  kept as the basis of calculating
reference
wind speed.
Terrain
and
topography
characteristics
of the ground
have been taken
into consideration
in working
out the design
wind
speeds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cl<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Wind
loads on towers
and conductors
have been revised.
These
are based on the modified
wind map of the country.
Reference
wind
speed
averaged
over
10 minutes
duration
has
been used for the determination
of wind loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provisions
for the ‘Temperature
Effects’
have been modified.
In order
to permit
additional
current
carrying
capacity
in
the
conductor
the
maximum
temperature
in the
ACSR
conductor
has now been permitted
to be 75°C in any
part of the
country.
For aluminium
alloy ( AAAC ) conductor,
the
corresponding
maximum
temperature
has been
permitted
to be 85°C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provisions
for anti
cascading
checks have been included
for angle towers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provisions
for multi
circuit
towers
have been
included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Consequent
to
the
merger
of
IS 226  :  1975
‘Structural
steel
( Standard
quality
)’ in
IS 2062  :  1992 ‘Specification
for weldable
structural
steel (  third revision )’  steels
conforming
to IS 2062  :  1992 and
IS 8500  :  1992 ‘Specification
for
weldable
structural
steel ( medium
and high strength
qualities
)’ have been included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j) With the publication
of IS 12427  :  1988 ‘Transmission
tower
bolts’
these bolts
( property
class 5.6 ) and
bolts
of property
class 8.5 conforming
to
IS 3757  :  1985 ‘High
strength
structural
bolts
(  second revision )’  have been included
in addition
to bolts,
of property
class
4.6 conforming
to IS 6539  :  1972 ‘H:xagon
bJlts
for steel
structures’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As transmission
line
towers
are
comparatively
light
structures
and
also that
the maximum
wind pressure
is the chief criterion
for the design,
the Sectional
Committee
felt that concurrence
of earthquake
and maximum
wind
pressure
is unlikely
to
take place.
However
in earthquake
prone
areas the design
of towers/foundations
shall bs checked
for earthquake
forces
correspond-
ing
to
nil
wind
and
minimum
temperature
in
accordance
with
IS 1893  :  1984 ‘Criteria
for
earthquake

of structures
