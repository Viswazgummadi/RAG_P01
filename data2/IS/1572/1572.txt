ELECTROPLATED
COATINGS OF CADMIUM
ON IRON AND STEEL<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>/ Second Revision )<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0. FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian Standard
( Second Revision ) was adopted
by the Indian
Standards
Institution
on 10 September
1986, after the draft finalized by
the Metallic and Non-metallic
Finishes Sectional
Committee
had
been
approved by the Structural and Metals Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This standard was first published in 1960, revised in 1968 and covered
three grades of cadmium
plating depending
on thickness of the coating.
In the first revision of the standard, thickness requirements had been modi-
fied keeping in view~the utility of the coatings
and the trade
practices
followed in the country.
Efforts have been
made to include many details
left out in the first revision to make the second revision a comprehensive
one. Additional terms have also been included under terminology
and
limitations are referred to regarding
finish and appearance
under coating
requirements.
More details have been incorporated
under information to be
given by the purchaser
and information
regarding materials
and manu-
facture, chromate passivation, test for coating,
handling,
inspection
and
packaging.
A reference to barrel-plated
items has also been made under
Table 1, Note 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 In view of its toxicity, cadmium should
not be used as a coating for
any article used as a food container or cooking
utensil or for any article
likely to come in contact with food or beverages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.1 Cadmium vapours
and cadmium
oxide fumes are highly toxic
when inhaled. Therefore, cadmium plated articles
must
not be welded,
spot-welded,
soldered
or otherwise
strongly heated
without
adequate
ventilation which will efficiently remove all toxic fumes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3.2 Cadmium is subjected
to corrosion
by vapours
which may
be
released by cardboard,
wood, plastics, certain electrical insulating materials,
paints and other organic substances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>JS : 1572 - 1986<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3.3  Attention
is drawn to the fact
that
electroplated
cadmium
is more
readily
soldered
than electroplated
zinc.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 Like zinc, cadmium
also protects
steel
cathodically,
that is, by sacrifi-
cial protection
in most
environments.
It is superior
to zinc
coatings
in
purely
marine
atmospheres.
Chromate
conversion
coatings
on cadmium
provide
additional
protection
against
corrosion
and
should
be applied
un-
less there
is a reason
to the
contrary.
Cadmium-plated
articles
to be
painted
may require
alternative
treatment
such as phosphating
to provide
good adhesion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.1 Cadmuim
dissolves
in most mineral
acids but unlike zinc,
does not
react with alkalis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4.2 Chromate
passivated
cadmium
coatings
contain
hexavalent
chromium
which may irritate
the skin and cause ulcers on the skin.
Cotton,
nylon
or rubber
hand-gloves
may be used to prevent
skin ulceration
while
handling
chromated
cadmium-plated
parts.
This will
also
prevent
finger-
print corrosion
on cadmium
coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose
of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with, the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result of a test or analysis,
shall
be rounded
off in accordance
with
IS  :  2-1960”.
The number
of significant
places retained
in the rounded
off
value should
be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.6  General  Information
-
This specification
includes
the
whole
range of
iron and steel products
as basis
metals.
Designers
are advised,
however,
that all forms of iron and steel are not equally
readily
electroplated.
Many
castings
can be satisfactorily
plated, but are considered
to be more
difficult
than forgings.
Cadmium
is mostly
plated
from
a cyanide
bath.
Suitable
pretreatments
must
be used
to satisfactorily
electrodeposit
cadmium
on
difficult-to-plate
substrates.
Adequate
precautions
must be taken against the
danger
of hydrogen
embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention
is also drawn
to the effects of the
contour
of the article to
be plated.
In general,
the requirements
for minimum
thickness
apply only
to those portions
of the
article
which
may
be described
as significant
surfaces.
It helps to reduce process cost if the designer
of an electroplated
part consults
a plating
specialist
before the
design
is finally
issued
for
production.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1.  SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This
standard
covers
requirements
for
elcctrodeposited
cadmium
coatings applied to iron or steel articles except for coatings
applied to
components having threads of basic major diameter
from 1.25 to 12.5 mm
and coatings applied to sheet or wire in the unfabricated form or to close-
coiled springs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 Requirements are specified for appearance,
thickness,
adhesion,
heat
treatment before or after plating, precleaning
standards
and if the coating
is chromate-passivated,
the corrosion resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.  TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.0  For the purpose of this standard, the following definitions shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.1 Surface - The part of the surface on which the electroplater
has to
work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.2 Significant Surface - Significant surfaces are those surfaces, normally
visible directly or by reflection, which are essential to the appearance or
serviceability of the article when assembled
in normal position, or which
can be the source of corrosion products
that deface visible surfaces on the
assembled article and are subject to wear or corrosion
or both, or surfaces
on which the coating is otherwise functionally necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 -  The significant
surface may be generally defined as that part of the
visible surface
which can be touched
with a ball of diameter 20 mm or a diameter
agreed upon by the manufacturer
and the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 -
The designation
of signilicant
surface
shall
be agreed
upon by the
manufacturer
and the purchaser and may be indicated
in the drawings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.3 Non-significant Surfaces -
Surfaces such as holes, recesses, bases of
angles and similar areas where a controlled
deposit
ordinarily
cannot
be
obtained, are designated as non-significant surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.4 Minimum Local Thickness -
This is defined as the lowest value of the
coating thickness at any point on the significant surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.5 Minimum Average Thickness - This is the average of thicknesses at a
number of points on the significant surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2.6 Iridescent Passivation - When a stable and adherent chromate coating
is formed over cadmium
electrodeposits
by reaction
with
an
acidified
dichromate
solution
under
suitable pH and
duration
of passivation,
producing more than one or two
interference
colours, the passivation is
termed as iridescent passivation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Finish and Appearance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1 Over  the significant surface, the plated article
shall be free from
clearly visible plating
defects such as blisters, pits, roughness,
nodules,
cracks, burning or unplated areas and shall not be stained or discoloured.
On articles, usually where a contact mark is inevitable,
this contact
mark
is excluded for inspection of appearance.
Superficial stains that result from
rinsing or slight discolouration
resulting from drying or heating operation
to relieve hydrogen embrittlement
shall not be the cause for rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  1 -
Unless otherwise specified, the finish shall be bright,
semi-bright
or
dull.
The plated article shall, however, be clean and free from any damage.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 -
Defects on fhe surface of the basis metal, such as scratches, porosity,
pits, inclusions,
cracks, roll marks and die marks may adversely affect the appearance
of coatings
applied thereto,
~despite
the
observance
of the
best
electroplating
practices.
Accordingly,
the electroplater’s
responsibility
for defects
in the coating
resulting from such conditions
shall be waived.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Thickness and Type of Cadmium Coating<<HEADING_END>>

In any particular environment,
the protective
value of a cadmium
coating is directly proportional
to
its mass per unit area.
The marked superiority
shown by cadmium coatings over zinc
coatings
of equal
thickness
in the standard
salt spray test cannot
be taken
as a fact
valid
for all the
environments
(zinc is
superior
in industrial
environments
whereas
cadmium
is superior
in humid/marine
atmospheres).

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Cleaning of Basis Metal -
This standard does not specify requirements
for the surface
of the basis metal prior to electroplating
but proper
preparatory
procedures and thorough cleaning of the basis metal shall be
done in accordance with the procedure
given in IS  :  3194-1980* to ensure
satisfactory adhesion and corrosion resistance performance
of the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Heat treatment shall be performed on certain basis metals to reduce the
risk of damage by-hydrogen embrittlement.
In all cases, the duration
of
heat treatment shall commence from the time at which the whole of each
part attains the specified temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1  Parts made from steels with maximum
specified tensile strengths
of 1 050 MPa or higher (corresponding
hardness values of approximately
34 HRC, 340 HV or 325 HB) and surface-hardened
parts shall require
heat treatment.
It is recommended
thzt unless otherwise
specified,
steels
having tensile strength greater than 1 450 MPa (corresponding
hardness 45
HRC, 440 HV or 415 HB) should not be electroplated
with cadmium
by
cDnventiona1 methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 With the exception
of surface-hardened
parts, the heat treatment
conditions shall be selected on the basis of the specified maximum tensile
strength.
Steels shall be categorized
according
to specified
maximum
tensile strength according to Table 2.
If the steel specification
is only in
terms of minimum
tensile strength,
the corresponding
maximum
tensile
strength shall be determined from Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

ground or cold-
formed, or cold-strengthened,
shall be heat-treated
for stress-relief. As a
guide, they may be heat-treated
at the highest temperature
within the limit
imposed by the tempering temperature
for 30 minutes or maintained at a
temperature
of 190 to 220°C for not less than 1 hour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 -
Some steels which have been carburized,
flame-hardened
or induction-
hardened,
and subsequently

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1  In case the heat-treatment
temperature
would be harmful, for
example, to surface-hardened
steels (except for nitrided steels), it may be
necessary to apply a lower temperature for a longer time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 - The baking should be done
as soon
as possible
after
electroplating
and before any supplementary
chemical treatment
of the plated
surfaces.
The best
time and temperature
in some cases shall be established
by experiment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  2 -
Electroplated
springs and other
parts
subject
to flexure shall not be
flexed before hydrogen embrittlement
relief treatment.
Steel springs shall be treated
in boiling water for not less than 2 hours. The
spring
rating
may
be affected at a
higher temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3 -
Other conditions
of time and temperature
may be specified
and
used
if they have been shown to be effective for the particular
part and are acceptable
to
the purchaser
but parts shall not be heat-treated
above their tempering
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5  Activation Treatment -
Electroplated
surfaces passivated
as a result
of the baking operation shall be reactivated before
receiving~a supplement-
ary treatment.
Surface intended
for supplementary
treatment, namely  A,
B, C  and D types may by activated by immersion in a dilute acid solution.
Surfaces shall be activated as soon as possible following baking and should
be handled carefully to avoid contamination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.  SUPPLEMENTARY
TREATMENTS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Chromate passivation of cadmium
plating should always be applied
unless there is an agreement
to the contrary.
As  it increases the protec-
tive value of cadmium plating, the articles are passivated
after cadmium
plating. If it is to be heat-treated,
this should be done before passivation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1  Chromate Conversion Coating -  Chromate conversion
coating
on
cadmium plating shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  9839-1981”.
If
specified by the purchase
order,
chromate
conversion
coatings
shall be
further protected by organic protective coatings like water soluble lacquer,
nitrocellulose lacquer or paint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.2  Phosphate Conversion Coating -
Phosphate
conversion
coating
shall be done in accordance
with IS  :  3618-1974t.
If specified by the
purchase order, this coating shall also be covered by painting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  Corrosion Resistance of Chromate Coating -
The protective value of a
chromate coating shall be determined by exposing the clean specimen to a
5 percent solution of salt spray and conducting the test in accordance with<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>*Specification
for chromate conversion
coatings on electroplated
zinc and cadmium
coatings.

The white corrosion product which is easily determinable
by eyes: shall not emerge on the chromate coating surface within  48  hours.
7.2.1 Alternatively,
other method,
such as
exposure
to
a humidity
environment shall be used as given in IS  :  8602-1977t.
Break-down
of the
film, or the appearance of white corrosive
products
after 2 cycles of the
test constitute failure to comply with this standard.
7.3 Appearance of Chromate
Coating -
The appearance
of a chromate
film on cadmium-plated
parts may vary from olive drab, olive green shad-
ing to brown or bronze, iridescent yellowish green to practically colourless.
In the case of iridescent passivation, the combination
of colours may vary
according to the process conditions like pH, conditions of the basis metal
and cadmium deposit, temperature,
time of reaction, agitation and compo-
sition of the passivation bath.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 Covering -
A chromate film should be free from
bare patches. The
presence of the film is verified by the test methods,
for colourless
and
bleached passivation as prescribed in IS  :  8602-19777.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5 Adhesion for Chromated Coatings -  A chromate film shall be adherent.
Its adhesion shall be tested by the method prescribed in IS  :  8602-1977t.
Nope 1 -
The cadmium surface is attacted by supplementary
treatments,
thereby
diminishing
the amount of metallic cadmium present.
Therefore, it is recommended
that no supplementary
treatments be applied to cadmium coatings, having a minimum
thickness of less than about 3 micrometres.
NOTE 2 -
Since cadmium
surface
is soft, the
coloured
chromate
films
are
likely to be scratched
when
chromated
cadmmm
plated particles rub each other.
Adequate case is taken to minimize such damages to the passivated film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. SELECTION
OF SAMPLES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  Out  of each lot of similar parts, a number of samples shall be selected
at random.
The size of the lot and the number of samples to be selected
shall be agreed upon between the manufacturer
and the purchaser.
All the
samples selected shall be visually examined for any defects referred to in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. TEST SPECIMENS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 If separate test specimens are used to represent
the coated articles in a
test, the specimens shall be same in nature,
size and number and be
processed as required in the purchaser’s order.
NOTE -
Unless a need can be demonstrated,
separately prepared specimens
shall not
be used in place of production
items for non-destructive
and visual examinations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.1 Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1.1  The local thickness of coating may by determined by the methods
prescribed in IS  :  3203-1982”.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.2 The method as given in Appendix B shall be used for determining
average thickness in the
case of cadmium
coating
on small articles as
prescribed in 4.2.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>NOTE  1 -
Other methods may also be used
if it can be demonstrated
that
the
uncertainty
of the measurement
with these methods
is less than
10 percent.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Norn2-
If the coatings are rough or matt, the microscopical
and profilometric
methods may give unreliable
results,
and magnetic/eddy
current methods may give
measurements
which are somewhat
greater than
those
obtained
on smooth
coatings
of the same mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.3  Thickness
measurements
of cadmium
coatings -may be made
after application of the supplementary
treatments.
When methods as per
IS  :  3203-1982* (BNF jet test method ) are used, remove the supplementary
treatment
prior
to testing. The chromate film may be removed
by using
a very mild abrasive (a paste of levigated
alumina rubbed
on with the
finger). Phosphate
coating is to be treated
with a concentrated
( 28 % )
ammonia
solution to quickly
dissolve the phosphate
coating
without
affecting the underlying cadmium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2 Adhesion -
Adhesion of the coating shall be such that when examin-
ed in accordance with Appendix C, the coating shall not show separation
from the basis metal at the interface.
10.3 Msual

Examine
material
for compliance
with
requirements
of lustre (4.4) and appearance

<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2.1  Accurately
determine the area of the plated part. Degrease it with
an organic solvent, such as trichloroethylene,
dry thoroughly and weigh to
an accuracy of one part in 10 000. Then totally immerse it and turn it over
so that the reagent has free access to all surfaces.
After the effervescence
has eased, remove
the sample, immediately
wash, wipe to remove the
loose coating of antimony and immerse in clean acetone to remove
any
trapped
water.
Then remove the sample, dry by the process previously
used and reweigh.
