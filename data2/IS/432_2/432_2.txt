FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1  This Indian
Standard
( Part II ) ( Third Revision
) was adopted by the
Indian
Standards
Institution
on 14 May 1582, after the draft
finalized
by
the Joint
Sectional
Committee
for
Concrete
Reinforcement
had been
approved
by the Civil
Engineering
Division
Council
and the Structural
and Metals
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 This
standard
was
first
published
in 1953 subsequently
revised
in
1960 and 1966.
The present revision
has been taken
up with a view to
modifying
the earlier
provisions
in light of experience
gained
in working
to this standard
by both manufacturers
and users.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 Apart
from incorporating
an amendment
issued to this standard,
this
standard
adopts SI units in specifying
the various
physical
requirements.
Further,
certain
provisions
of the standard
have been revised based on the
latest Indian
Standards
on physical
and chemical
tests for steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 In the formulation
of this standard,
due weightage
has been
given to
international
co-ordination
among
the standards
and practices
prevailing
in different
countries
in addition
to relating
it to the practices
in the field
in this country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 For the purpose of deciding
whether
a particular
requirement
of this
standard
is complied
with,
the
final
value,
observed
or
calculated,
expressing
the
result
of
a test
or  analysis,
shall
be
rounded
off in
accordance
with IS  :  2-1960’.
The number
of significant
places
retained
in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified value
in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

test piece.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4  Parcel -Any
quantity

steel wire of circular
cross section.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3. MANUFACTURE
AND
CHEMICAL

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  The
wire
shall
be
cold-drawn
from
mild
steel made
by the open
hearth,
electric
duplex,
acid bessemer,
basic oxygen,

these processes.
In case any other process is employed
in the manufacture
of steel, prior approval
of the purchaser
should be obtained.

drawn
to the specified
size and shall
be sound,

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 Re-tests
-
Should
any one of the test pieces first selected
fail to pass
any of the tests specified
in this standard,
two further

Should the test pieces from
both these additional
samples
pass, the material
represented
by the test
samples shall be deemed
to comply
with the requirements
of that parti-
cular test.
Should
the test piece from either
of these
additional
samples
fail, the material
represented
by the test sample
