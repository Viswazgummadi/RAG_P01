<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian
Standards
on 6 November
1989, after
the draft finalized by the Adhesives Sectional
Committee
had been approved
by the Petroleum,
Coal and Related Products Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These types of adhesives
are
used for bonding
PVC tiles to cement
on the floors and walls of
buildings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard contains requirements
for colour ( 3.1 ), consistency
( 3.2 ) and open assembly time
( 3.4 ) which call for agreement between the purchaser and the supplier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether
a particular
requirement
of this standard is complied
with,
the final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded
off in accordance
with IS 2  : 1960  ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(  revised )‘.
The
number of significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the
specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Any suitable motor driven,
tensile strength test-
ing  machine may be used.
The czpacity of the
mzchine shall be such that
any reading taken
during
or on completion
of the test shall fall
within

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3 PREPARATION
OF TEST SPECIMENS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1 Take
strips of asbestos
sheet
of 5 mm
thickness
measuring
150 X 25
mm.
Make
strips of PVC tiles
measuring
150  X  25 mm.
Buff the surface of PVC tiles and asbestos sheet
with an emery
coated
abrasive
paper
No. 50
[ see IS 715 ( Part 2 )  :  1976 ] and
then dust
off with a flat 2’5 cm brush. Over an area mea-
suring 25  X  2’5 mm at one end of surface of
asbestos
sheet and buffed tile, apply sufficient
quantity of adhesive so that a uniform
layer of
adhesive is formed on both
asbestos sheet and
tile surfaces.
Allow to remain in open air for 10
to 15 minutes. At this time when the adhesive film
is dry to a point
and there is still an aggressive
tzckiness
but not sticking
to the finger when
touched,
align the coated
surfaces of asbestos
and tile face to face carefully,
without
entrap-
ping air, in such a way that the free ends of the
strips lie in opposite directions. Press the joint in
a suitable press at a pressure of 8 to 10 kg/cm2.
Allow the bonded
specimen
to dry under pre-
vailing conditions
of temperature
and humidity
for 24 hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-l.2
Roller<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A  steel roller
of 135 & 2 mm diameter
and
90 & 1  mm  width covered
with rubber approxi-
mately 6  mm thick having a hardness
of 80 zt 1
RHD sball be used.
The weight of the roller,
which applies pressure to the specimen shall be
10 kg.  It  shall be so constructed
that the weight
of the  handle is not added to the weight of the
roller during use ( see Fig. 1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4 CONDITIONING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-4.1 Condition the test specimens for 48 hours
at a temperature
of 27 f 2°C and 65 & 5 per-
cent relative humidity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-5 PROCEDURE
A-5.1 Fix the two free ends of the test specimen
in the two jaws of the testing machine which shall
be 125 mm apart.
Use shims ( see Note ) in the
grips so that the test specimen
is properly cen-
tred and is held straight
in the grips and the
applied force is in the plane of the bonded area.
Record the load required
to separate
or break
the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The shims may
be blocks of metal,  wood
or  similar
material.
The thickness
of the shim shall
be  such that the sum of its thickness
and
that of
the free end of the strip shall be equal to the total
thickness
at the sandwich
area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-6 REPORT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-6.1 Report the shear strength
in kg/cm2, cal-
culated from

values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
