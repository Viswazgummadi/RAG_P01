<<PARAGRAPH>>NATIONAL  FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard ( Third  Revision)  which is identical with ISO 6892 : 1998 -Metallic materials -
Tensile testing at  ambient  temperature' issued by the International Organization for Standardization
( ISO ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on the recommendations of the Mechanical
Testing of Metals Sectional Committee and approval of the Metallurgical Engineering Division  Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was originally published in 1960 and subsequently revised in 1972 and  1995.  This
revision of the standard has been taken up to align it with ISO 6892 : 1998 by adoption under dual
numbering system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  text of the ISO Standard has been approved as suitable for publication as an Indian Standard
without deviations.  Certain  terminclogy  and conventions are, however, not identical to those used in
Indian Standard. Attention is particularly drawn to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Wherever  the  words 'International Standard' appear, referring to this standard, they should be
as read as 'Indian Standard'.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Comma  ( , ) has been used as a decimal  marker  while in Indian Standards, the  current  practice
is to use a point ( . ) as the decimal marker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this adopted standard, reference appears to certain International Standards for  which Indian  Standards
also exist.  The  corresponding  Indian Standards which are to be substituted in their places are listed
below along with  their  degree  of equivalence  for  the editions indicated:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Shape  and  dimensions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1  General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  shape  and  dimensions of the test pieces  depend  on the  shape  and  dimensions of the metallic
product  from which the test pieces are taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  test piece is usually obtained by machining a sample from the  product  or a pressed blank or
casting.  However  products of constant cross-section (sections, bars, wires, etc.) and also as-cast test
pieces  (i.e.  cast  irons and non-ferrous alloys)  may  be tested without  being  machined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  cross-section of the test pieces  may  be circular, square, rectangular,  annular  or, in special cases, of
some  other  shape.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Test  pieces, the original  gauge  length of which is related to the original cross-sectional area by the
equation  lJo  = k  ~  are called proportional test pieces. The internationally adopted value for  k  is  5,65.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  original  gauge  length shall be  not  less than 20  mm.  When  the cross-sectional area of the test piece
is  too  small  for this requirement to be  met  with the coefficient  k  value of 5,65, a higher value (preferably
11.3)  or  a non-proportional test piece  may  be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In  the  case  of non-proportional test pieces, the original  gauge  tength  (1.10)  is taken independently of the
original cross-sectional  area  (So).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  dimensional  tolerances of the test pieces shall be in accordance with  the  appropriate  annexes
(see  6.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Determination  of  original  cross-sectional  area  (So)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The original cross-sectional area shall be calculated from the measurements of the appropriate
dimensions. The accuracy of this calculation  depends  on the nature and type of the test piece. It is
indicated in annexes  A to  D  for the different types of test piece.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8
Marking  the  original  gauge length  (L o)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each end  of  the original  gauge  length shall  be. marked by  means  of fine marks or scribed lines, but not
by notches which could result in premature fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For  proportional test pieces, the calculated value of the original gauge length  may  be rounded off to
the nearest multiple of  5  mm,  provided that the difference between the calculated  and  marked gauge
length is less than  10  %  of  L o.  Annex  F  gives a nomogram for determining the original gauge length
corresponding to the dimensions of test pieces of rectangular cross-section. The original gauge length
shall be marked to an accuracy of  ±  1  %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the parallel length  (L c)  is much greater than the original gauge length, as, for instance, with
unmachined test pieces, a series of overlapping gauge lengths  may  be drawn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some cases, it may be helpful to draw, on the surface of the test piece,  a  line parallel to the
longitudinal axis, along which the gauge lengths are drawn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9
Accuracy  of  testing  apparatus<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The testing machine shall be verified in accordance with  ISO 7500-1  and shall be of class  1  or better.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When  an extensometer is used it shall be of class  1  (see  ISO 9513)  for the determination of  upper  and
lower  yield strengths  and  for proof strength (non-proportional extension); for other properties (with
higher extension) a class 2 extensometer (see ISO 9513) can be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.1.2  Lower  yield  strength  (R eL)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If only the lower yield  strength  is being  determined, the rate of  straining  during yield  of  the  parallel  length
of the test  piece shall  be between 0,000 25/5 and 0,002 5/s. The  straining  rate within the parallel length
shall be kept  as constant as possible.  If this  rate cannot  be  regulated directly.  it  shalt  be fixed  by
regulating the rate of stressing just before  yield  begins,  the controls  of the machine not being further
adjusted until completion of yield.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In no case shall the rate of stressing in the elastic range  exceed  the maximum rates given in table 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.1.3  Upper  and  lower  yield  strengths  (R eH  and  R eL)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the two yield strengths are determined during the same test, the conditions for determining the lower
yield  strength  shall be complied with (see 10.1.1.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.1.4  Proof  strength  (non-proportional  extension)  and  proof  strength  (total  extension)
(R p  and  R t)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  rate of stressing shall be within the limits given in  table  3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Within the plastic range and up to the proof strength (non-proportional extension or total extension) the
straining rate shall  not  exceed 0,002 5/s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.1.5  Rate  of  separation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the testing machine is  not  capable of measuring or controlling the strain rate, a cross head separation
speed equivalent to the rate of stressing given in table 3 shall be used until completion of yield.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The test pieces shall be held  by  suitable means such as wedges, screwed grips, shouldered holders,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Every endeavour shall be made to ensure that test pieces are held in such a way that the force is
applied as axially as possible. This is of particular importance when testing brittle materials or when
determining proof stress (non-proportional elongation) or proof stress (total elongation) or yield stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11
Determination  of  percentage elongation after fracture  (A)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  Percentage elongation after fracture shall be determined in accordance with the definition given
in 4.4.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For this purpose, the two broken pieces of the test piece are carefully fitted back together so that their
axes lie in a straight line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Special precautions shall be taken to ensure proper contact between the broken parts of the test piece
when measuring the final gauge length. This is particularly important in the case of test pieces of small
cross-section and test pieces having low elongation values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Elongation after fracture  (L u  -  L o > shall be determined to the nearest 0,25 mm with a measuring device
with 0,1 mm resolution and the value of percentage elongation after fracture shall be rounded to the
nearest 0,5  %.  If the specified minimum percentage elongation is less than 5  %,  it is recommended that
special precautions be taken when determining elongation (see annex E).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This measurement is, in principle, valid only if the distance between the fracture and the nearest gauge
mark is no less than one third of the original gauge length  (/Jo).  However, the measurement is valid,
irrespective of the position of the fracture, if the percentage elongation after fracture is equal to or
greater than the specified value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.2  For machines capable of measuring extension at fracture using an extensometer, it is not
necessary to mark the gauge lengths. The elongation is measured as the total extension at fracture, and
it is therefore necessary to deduct the elastic extension in order to obtain percentage elopgation after
fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In principle, this measurement is only valid if fracture occurs within the extensometer gauge length  (L e).
The measurement is valid regardless of the position of the fracture cross-section  if the percentage
elongation after fracture is equal to or greater than the specified value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  -
If the product standard specifies the determination of percentage elongation after rupture for a given
gauge length, the extensometer gauge length shall be equal to this length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3  If elongation is measured over a given fixed length, it can be converted to proportional gauge
length, using conversion formulae or tables as agreed before the commencement of testing (for example
as in ISO 2566-1 and ISO 2566-2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  -
Comparisons of percentage elongation are possible only when the gauge length or extensometer gauge
length, the shape and area of the cross-section are the same or when the coefficient of proportionality  (k)  is the
same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.4 In order  to avoid having to reject test pieces in which fracture  may  occur outside the limits
specified  in  11.1, the method based on the subdivision of  t.;  into  N  equal parts  may  be used, as
described in  annex G.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12
Determination  of  percentage  total  elongation  at  maximum  force  (A gt)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method consists of determining on the force-extension diagram obtained with an extensometer, the
extension at maximum force  (~Lm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some materials exhibit a flal plateau at maximum force. When this occurs, the percentage total
elongation at maximum force is taken at the mid-point of the flat plateau (see figure 1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  extensometer gauge length shall be recorded in the test report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The percentage total elongation at maximum force is calculated by the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>~4n
A gt  =--  x100
La<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the tensile test is carried out on a computer controHed testing machine having a data acquisition
system, the elongation is directly determined at the maximum force.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1 The proof strength (non-proportional extension) is determined from the force-extension diagram by
drawing a line parallel to the straight po:tion of the curve and at a distance from this equivalent to the
prescribed non-proportional percentage, for example 0,2  0/0.  The point at which this line intersects the
curve gives the force corresponding  te)  the desired proof strength (non-proportional extension). The
latter is obtained  by  dividing this force  by  the original cross-sectional area of the test piece  (~"o)  (see
figure 6).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Accuracy in drawing the force-extension diagram is essential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the straight portion of the force-extension diagram is not clearly defined, thereby preventing drawing
the parallel line with sufficient precision, the following procedure is recommended (see figure 6).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the presumed proof strength has been exceeded, the force is reduced to a value equal to about
10  %
of the force obtained. The force is then increased again until it exceeds the value obtained
originally. To determine the desired proof strength a line is drawn through the hysteresis loop. A line is
then drawn parallel to this line, at a distance from the corrected origin of the curve, measured along the
abscissa, equal to the prescribed non-proportional percentage. The intersection of this parallel line and
the force-extension curve gives the force corresponding to the proof strength. The latter is obtained by
dividing this force  by  the original cross-sectional area of the test piece  (So)  (see figure 6).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
The  correction of the origin of  the  curve can be done  by  various methods.  The  following method is
generally used:  draw  a line parallel to the line defined by the hysteresis loop which crosses the rising elastic part of
the diagram, the slope of which is nearest to that of the loop.  The  point at which this line intersects the abscissa
gives the corrected origin of the curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Determination  of  proof  strength,  total  extension  (R t)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1 The  proof strength (total extension)  is  determined on the force-extension diagram by drawing a
line parallel to the ordinate axis (force axis) and at a distance from this equivalent to  the  prescribed total
percentage extension. The point  at  which this line intersects the curve gives the force corresponding to
the desired proof strength. The latter is obtained by dividing this force by the original cross-sectional
area of the test piece  (So)  (see figure  4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>15
Method  of  verification  of  permanent  set  strength  (R r)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  test piece is subjected to a force for  10  s to  12  s corresponding to the specified stress and it is then
confirmed, after removing the force, that the permanent set extension or elongation is not more than the
percentage specified for the original gauge length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16
Determination  of  percentage  reduction  of  area  (Z)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Percentage reduction of area shall be determined in accordance with the definition given in  4.7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The two. broken pieces of the test piece are carefully fitted back together so that their axes lie in a
straight line. The minimum cross-sectonial area after fracture  (Su)  shall be measured to an accuracy of
±  2
%
(see annexes A to D). The diftere.tce between the area  (Su)  and the original cross-sectional area
(So)  expressed as a percentage of the original area gives the percentage reduction of area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>17
Accuracy  of  the  results<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  accuracy  of  results  is  dependent on various parameters which  may  be separated into two
categories:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>metrological parameters  such  as class of  machine  and extensometer and the accuracy of  specimen
dimensional measurements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>material and testing parameters such as nature of material, test piece geometry and preparation,
testing  rate,  temperature. data acquisition and analysis technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the absence of sufficient data on all  types  of materials it is not possible, at present, to fix values  of
accuracy  for the different properties measured  by  the tensile test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex  J  provides  a  guideline for the determination of uncertainty related to metrological parameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex  K provides values obtained from interlaboratory tests on a group of steels and aluminium alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A.1
Shape  of  the  test  piece<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally  t  the test piece has gripped ends which are wider than the parallel length.  The  parallel length
(L c)  shall be connected to the ends by means of transition curves with a radius of at least  20  mm. The
width of these ends shall be at least  20  mm and not more than  40  mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>By agreement, the test piece  may  also consist of a strip with parallel sides. For products of width equal
to or less than  20  mm, the  width  of the test.piece  may  be the same as that of the product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.2
Dimensions  of  the test  piece<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  parallel length shall not be less than  L o  +  !!... 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of dispute, the length  La  +  2b  shall always be used unless there is insufficient material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In  the case of parallel side test pieces less than  20  mm wide, and unless otherwise specified in .the
product standard, the original gauge length  (La)  shall be equal to  50  mm.  For  this type of test piece, the
free length between the grips shall be equal to  La  +  3b.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There  are two types of non-proportional test pieces,  wit~  dimensions as given in table  A.1  .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When  measuring the dimensions of each test piece, the tolerances on shape given in table A.2 shall
apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In  the case of test pieces where the width is the  same  as that of "the product, the original cross-sectional
area  (So)  shall be calculated on  the  basis of the measured dimensions of the test  piece,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  nominal width of  the  test piece  may  be used, provided that the machining tolerances and tolerances

<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the recommended methods is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to the test a  very  small mark should be made near one of the ends of the parallel length. Using a
pair of needle-pointed dividers set at the gauge length, an arc is scribed with the  mark  as the centre.
After fracture. the broken test piece should be placed in a fixing clamp and axial compressive force
applied, preferably by means of a screw  I  sufficient to hold the pieces firmly together during
measurement. A second arc of the same radius should then be scribed from the original centre, and the
distance between the two scratches measured  by  means of a measuring microscope or other suitable
instrument. In order to render the fine scratches more easily visible, a suitable  dye  film may be applied
to the test piece before testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The measurement of the final gauge length after fracture (L ' U)  is made on the longest broken part of the

<<PARAGRAPH>>An  "Error  Budget"  approach  to  the  estimation  of  the  uncertainty  of  measurement
In tensile  testing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>J.1
Introduction<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An approach for estimating the uncertainty of measurements is outlined based upon the "error budget"
concept using the measurement tolerances specified in the testing and calibration standards. It should
be noted that it is not possible to calculate a single value for the measurement uncertainty for all
materials since different materials exhlbit different response characteristics to some of the specified
control parameters, e.g. straining rate or stressing rate  [3).  The error budget presented here could be
regarded as an upper limit to the measurement uncertainty for a laboratory undertaking testing in
compliance with this International Standard (class 1 machine and extensometer).
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be noted that when evaluating the total scatter in experimental results the uncertainty in
measurement should be considered in addition to the inherent scatter due to material inhomogeneity.
The statistical approach to the analysis of intercomparison exercises (Round Robin experiments) given
in appendix K does not separate out the two contributing causes of the scatter. Another useful approach
for estimating interlaboratory scatter is to employ a Certified Reference Material (CAM) which has
certified material properties. The selection of candidate materials for use as a room temperature tensile
CAM  has been discussed elsewhere  [3)  and a 1 tonne batch of a material (Nimonic 75) in the form of
14 mm diameter bar is in the process of being certified in a project under the supervision of the
Community Bureau of Reference (SCA).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>J.2
Estimation  of  uncertainty<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>J.2.1 Material Independent parameters<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manner in which errors from a variety of sources should be added together has been treated in
considerable detail  (4)  and more recently guidance has been given on assessing precision and
uncertainty in two ISO documents, ISO 5725-2 and the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in
measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the following analysis the conventional least mean squares approach has been used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tolerances for the various testing parameters for tensile properties are given in table J.1 together
with expected uncertainty. Because of the shape of the stress-strain curve, some of the tensile
properties in principle can be determined with a higher degree of precision than others, e.g., the upper
yield  strength R eH  is only dependent on the tolerances for measurement of force and cross sectional
area, whilst proof strength, R p'  is dependent on force, strain (displacement), gauge length and
cross-sectional area. In the case of reduction in area, Z, the measurement tolerance for cross-sectional
area  both  before and after fracture needs to  be  considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>J.2.2 Material dependent parameters<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For room temperature tensile testing, the only tensile properties significantly dependent upon the
materials response to the straining rate (or stressing rate) control parameters are  R eH,  R el  and  R p.
Tensile strength,  R m,  can also be strain rate dependent, however in practice it is usually determined at a
much higher straining rate than  R p  and is generally less sensitive to variations in strain rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In principle, it will be necessary to determine any material's strain rate response before the total error
budget can be calculated. Some limited data are available and the following examples may be used to
estimate uncertainty for some classes of materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical examples of data sets used to determine materials' response over the strain rate range specified
in this International Standard are shown in tables J.2 and J.3 and a summary of materials' response for
proof stress for a number of materials measured under strain rate control is given in table J.2. Earlier
data on a variety of steels measured under a set stressing rate are given in the seminar paper   l51 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>J.2.3 Total measurement uncertainty<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The material-dependent response of proof strength over the permitted strain rate range specified in
table J.2 may be combined with the material independent parameters specified in table J.1 to give a total
estimate of uncertainty for the various materials indicated, as shown in table J.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of this analysis, the total value of the variation in proof strength over the strain rate
range permitted in the standard has been halved and expressed as an equivalent tolerance,  i.e,  for
X5 Cr Ni Mo 17-12-2 stainless steel, the proof strength can vary by 6,8  %  over the permitted strain rate
range so it is equivalent to a tolerance of  ±  3,4  %.  Therefore for X5 Cr Ni Mo 17-12-2 stainlesss steel,
the total uncertainty is given by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Concluding  remarks<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A method of calculating the measurement uncertainty for room temperature tensile testing using an
"Error Budget" concept has been outlined and examples given for a few materials where the material
response to the testing parameters is known. It should be noted that the calculated uncertainties may
need to be modified to include a weighting factor in accordance with the guide to the expression of
uncertainty in measurement  [2]  and this will be undertaken when the Eurolab.and ISO working parties
finalise their recommendations on the optimum approach to be adopted. In addition, there are other
factors that can affect the measurement of tensile properties such as test piece bending, methods of
gripping the test piece, or the testing machine control mode, Le., extensometer control or loadlcrosshead
control which may affect the measured tensile properties  (6].  However since there is insufficient
quantitative data available it is not possible to include their effects in error budgets at present. It should
also be recognised that this error budget approach only gives an estimate of the uncertainty due to the
measurement technique and does not make an allowance for the inherent scatter in experimental results
attributable to material inhomogeneity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

equipment,  test  procedure  and  method  of calculation of the rnechamcal  proport.es<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>More  specifically,  the  following  causes  of  uncertainty  can  be mentioned:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>some  degree  of  inhomogeneity,  which  exists  even  within a  processing  batch  obtained  from a single
heat  of material;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>test  piece  geometry,  preparation  method  and  tolerances;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>gripping  method  and  axiality of  force  application;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>human  or  software  errors  associated  with the  determination  of  the  tensile properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  requirements  and  tolerances  of this International  Standard  do  not  permit  quantification of the effect
of all  these  factors.  Interlaboratory  tests  can  be  used  for  an  overall  determination  of the uncertainty of
the  results  under  conditions  close  to the industrial  practice  of  the  test.  They  do not,  however,  permit
separation  of  effects  related to  the  material  from  errors  due  to  the  test  method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>K.2
Procedure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  results  of  two  interlaboratory  test  programmes  (programme  A,  reference  [7]  and  programme  S,
reference  [8])  are  given  as  examples  of  the  type  of uncertainties,  which  are typically  obtained  when
testing  metallic  materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For  each  material  included  in  the  programme,  a fixed  number  of  specimen  blanks  are  randomly  selected
from  the  stock.  A  preliminary  study  checks  the  homogeneity  of  this  stock  and  provides  data  on the
"intrinsic"  scatter  of  the  mechanical  properties  within the stock.  The  blanks  are  sent  to the participating
laboratories,  where  the  test  pieces  are  machined  to the  drawings  they  normally  use.  The  only
requirement  for  the  test  pieces  and  the  testing  itself  are  the  compliance  with the  requirements  of  the
relevant  standards.  As  much  as  possible,  it is  recommended  that  the  tests  be  made  in a  short  period  of
time,  by  the  same  operator  using  the  same  machine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In tables K.1  and  K.2, these three kinds of error  are  expressed in terms of a relative uncertainty
coefficient:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>sR
is  the  estimated precision of the test method: reproducibility standard deviation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>These  quantities are close to the 95  %

<<PARAGRAPH>>K.3
Results  of  programme  A<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Details can be found in the report, reference [7]. The materials are a soft aluminium, a heat-treated
aluminium  alloy, a low alloy steel, an austenitic stainless steel,  a  nickel-base alloy and  a  high-alloy heat
treated steel.  For  each material, six tests were carried out by the six participants. In all cases, 12,5 mm
diameter  cylindrical test pieces were used.  The  results are summarized in table K.1. In the case of the
low-alloy steel having a yield point behaviour, only the 0,2
%
proof strength is reported. The elongation
values  are  relative to a gauge length equal to five diameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>K.4
Results  of  programme  B<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Details  can  be found in the report, reference [8]. The materials are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>two  sheet  materials:  a  low  carbon malleable steel  and  an austenitic stainless steel (thickness
2,5 mm);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>three  grades  of bars: a constructional steel, an austenitic stainless steel, a  heat  treated high
strength  steel  (diameter 20 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tests  were  carried  out  using flat test  pieces  for  the  first  two  materials  (18  participants,  5  tests  for  each
material)  and  10  mm  diameter  cylindrical test pieces  for  the  bars  (18  participants,  5  tests  for  each
material).  The  width of the flat test piece  was  20  mm  and  the  initial  gauge  length 80  mm.  The results  are
summarized  in table K.2.  No  distinction  is made between lower  yield  strength  (R eL)  and  proof  strength
(RpO,2)  in the case  of materials with  yield  points.  For  the  cylindrical  test  pieces,  the elongation  values
correspond to  a  gauge  length equal to five diameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
