<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement
of Works of River Valley Projects
Sectional
Committee,
RVD 23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Part 14 ) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after the
draft
finalized by the Measurement
of Works of River Valley Projects
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the River Valley Division
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the measurement
of works of river projects
a large diversity
of methods
exist at present
according
to local practices.
This lack of uniformity
creates
complications
regarding
measure-
ments and payments.
Keeping in view the large amount
of financial
outlay
involved
in river
valley projects and also the fact that the authorities
responsible
for
completing
these
projects,
are of the state level or national
level, it is felt
that
a suitable
methodology
is needed
for
adopting
uniform practices
towards the measurement
of works so that the scope of complications
and misinterpretation
of items of work is reduced,
as far as possible.
This
standard is being
formulated
in various parts so as to cover each type of work
separately.
This pa.rt is intended
to provide a uniform basis for measuring
the work done in respect of canal works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose of deciding whether a particular
requirement
of this standard
is complied
with,
the final value, observed
or calculated,
expressing
the result
of a test
or analysis,
shall be
rounded
ofI in accordance
with IS 2 : 1960 ‘Rules for rounding
off numerical
values
(  revised )‘.
The number of significant places retained
in the rounded
off value should be the same as that of
the specified value in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 The dimensions
shall be taken from
actual
measurements
in all
cases to arrive
at net
measurements
of filling, based
on prespecified
deductions
( stated as percentage
) for voids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 METHOD OF MEASUREMENT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  The measurement
of earthwork
shall be
done
in cubic
me&es and the measurement
taken,
shall
be of
authorised
dimensions.
Irregular areas shall be divided
into a number
of figures of known area say, triangles,
rectang-
les etc.
The remaining part which
cannot
be
formed into regular
figures may be evaluated
by taking
out average
height
drawn
on a
common base, by Simpson’s rule.
In the
case
of irregular
volume,
the same shall be deter-
.-mined by prismodial
formulae.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 The measurement
shall be taken in succes-
sive stages of 1.5 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5 If any tests are to be conducted
in respect
of degree
of compaction,
the same shall
be
specified and included in the item of work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6 The distance for lead shall be over the shortest
practicable,
and
not
necessarily
the route
actually taken.
Distances
not exceeding 250 m,
shall be measured
in units of 50 m, distances
exceeding 250 m and not exceeding 500 m shall
be measured as a separate
item.
Lead beyond
500 m shall be measured
in units of 500 m i.e,
there will be  one  item on lead exceeding
500 m
and not
exceeding
1 000 m.
Where
the
lead
exceeds 5 km, it will be measured
in units
of
1 kilometre,
half killometre
and above
being
treated
as one unit, less than half a kilometre
being ignored.
For the measurement
of lead,
the area excavated
shall be divided into suitable
blocks.
II1 each block
the distance
shall
be
from the centre of the block
to the centre
of
placed earth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6  MEASUREMENT
OF VARIOUS TYPES
OF EXCAVATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1  The description
of item shall include form-
ing of slopes and levels, using shoring
where
required,
depositing
as fill in embankment
or
otherwise
after making
outlines,
putting
pro-
files etc.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Where the excavation
is from
borrow pits
in fairly uniform
ground,
the measurement
of
cutting in borrow pits shall be made by taking
off dimensions
from the pits excavated,
based
on the telltales left at suitable
intervals,
so as
to determine
the average depth of excavation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 Where the ground is not
uniform,
excava-
tion shall be measured by taking
cross-sections
at suitable
intervals before
starting
the work
and after
its completion,
and computing
the
quantity
of excavation
from these levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 REMOVAL OF TREES AND HEDGES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1  Clearing areas of shrubs,
brush-wood
and
small trees not exceeding 30 cm girth
shall be
measured in square metres and shall be deemed
to include removal and disposal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4 All ‘excavation shall be measured in success-
ive stages of 1.5 m starting at the commencing
level.
This shall not apply to cases where
no
lift is involved.
Battering
and benching
shall
be specified and measured along with the
main
item of excavation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cutting down of trees exceeding 30 cm girth
and over upto 100 cm girth shall be enumerated
as one item.
The cutting down of trees exceed-
ing 100 cm girth shall be enumerated
separately
stating the girth.
The girth shall be measured
one metre above ground level.
The item shall
include lopping of branches
as well as removal
and disposal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5 Each type of classification
shall be measured
separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Separate measurement
for making embank-
ments shall be taken
only
if earth
from
the
excavation
is not utilised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 The actual
measurement
of
fill shall be
calculated
by taking levels at suitable intervals,
of the original ground before start of the work
after site clearance,
and after
compaction
of
the fill in suitable. layers
as specified.
The
quantity
of the fill shall be computed
from
these levels.
If filling materials
are obtained
from borrow pits, the same shall be measured
from borrowpits
as in 6 above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
