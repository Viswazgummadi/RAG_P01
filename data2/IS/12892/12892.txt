<<PARAGRAPH>>Barrages and Weirs Sectional Committee, RVD 20<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 22 December 1989, after
the draft finalized by the Barrages and Weirs Sectional Committee had been approved by the
River Valley Projects Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The safety of barrage and weir structures should be ensured right from the investigation stage and
continues up to the location, design, construction, operation and maintenance stages. There cannot
be any laxity on these aspects. A safe structure should not only be hydraulically and structurally
safe but it should also fulfil the functions for which it has been constructed. Fire fighting
equipment may be provided near the barrages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition 1.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (August 1991). Side bar indicates modification of
the text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4 SAFETY ASPECTS ON
INVESTIGATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This
standard provides guidelines
on
various aspects of safety of the barrage and
weir
structures,
such
as,
investigations,
location, design, construction, operation and
maintenance.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  The investigations should be carried out
without any laxity as the continued safety and
efficient functioning of barrage/weir structure
and integrating it with the master plan of the
basin development depends on the data
collected and analysed. The structure designed
based on inadequate data may suffer an
unexpected serious structural damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5 SAFETY ASPECTS ON LOCATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  For a safe and efficient barrage/weir, the
location of the structure is very important.
Various
considerations
for
locating
the
structure at the proper place shall include the
course of the river, the nature of silt, condition
of the banks, width of the river bed, foundation
conditions, confluence of tributaries, bends and
rapids in the river, etc. The following aspects
shall be thoroughly examined from safety
considerations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of
barrages and weirs<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Course of the River<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall be studied with survey maps/satellite
imageries that the course of the river has not
changed for many years at the prospective site
of the structure. In the case of shifting rivers,
proper measures shall be adopted to contain
the river in the desired course.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>11150 : 1984
Code
of
practice
for
construction
of
concrete
barrages<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall be examined to determine whether the
soil through which the canal alignment runs, is
able to withstand the velocity of flow which can
carry the silt down the canal. This factor will
influence the location of the head regulator and
also the overall cost of the barrage as costly
lining may be required otherwise for safe
operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 TERMINOLOGY<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  For various terms used in this standard,
reference may be made to the following Indian
Standards.
a) IS 6966 : 1989
b) IS 7349 : 1989
c) IS 7720 : 1975
d) IS 8408 : 1976
e) IS 11130 : 1984
f) IS 11150 : 1984<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  Condition of the Banks
It shall be ensured that the banks at the
proposed location are firm and not easily
erodible. The banks shall normally be high so
that the country areas are not submerged
during high floods. Otherwise, costly flood
protective embankments would be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_4>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 12892 : 1989<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>hazards are involved, a review of this criteria
based on site conditions may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)  Width of the River Bed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The width of the river at the proposed location
shall not be too wide which induces irregular
silt forming shoals on the upstream and
downstream and consequent irregular and
likely cross flows. A very narrow width of the
river shall also be avoided as it would reduce
the waterway and induce high intensities of
flow which would necessitate deeper cut offs
and foundations and protective works to make
the structure safe against surface flows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Free Board
The free board shall be carefully fixed so that
the structure and abutments are safe for a
higher flood with a frequency of 1 in 500 years.
The likely accretion of bed on the upstream
should also be taken into account while fixing
the free board. The top levels of abutments and
piers shall also be fixed to accommodate the
gates in the maximum lifted position such that
these are not damaged by floating trees, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)  Foundation Conditions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  Afflux
The permissible afflux shall be carefully fixed
so that the waterways of the barrage can be
fixed accordingly without causing damage to
nearby important/populated towns, industries,
etc and risk of outflanking by breaches of
bunds, etc could be avoided. Occasionally,
flooding of cultivated lands in the river bed
islands and the banks, under extreme case of
flood above 1 in 100 years frequency, may be
allowed. Otherwise, the water-way will be
unnecessarily too wide which may cause
sluggish flow through the barrage, shoal
formation, cross flows, excessive cost of
structure, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the safety of the structure, the foundation
conditions, such as, weak and fissured rocks,
fault zones, clayey layer, silty layers prone to
liquefaction, artisian and quicksand, etc, shall
be thoroughly known so that proper foundation
treatment could be effected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)  Confluence of Tributaries<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The location of the structure in the main river
with a tributary flowing parallel and close to
the main river shall be avoided as there would
be possibilities at a later date of the main river
breaking into the tributary and outflanking the
structure thereby rendering it unsafe and
infructuous.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)  Corrective Measures<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)  Waterway
The waterway of a barrage shall be very
carefully fixed to avoid shoal formation and
excessive scour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is always very difficult to select an ideal site
for the location of a barrage and its head
regulators satisfying all the requirements
including the safety aspects. Hence, it often
becomes necessary to select a site satisfying
most of the requirements and for the rest, some
corrective measures shall be incorporated in
the layout and designs to ensure a safe
structure. These include proper foundation
treatment, properly designed guide bunds,
spurs, flood protective embankments, pilot
channels, silt excluding devices, proper gate
regulation, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)  Hydraulic Design
The failures of barrages/weirs can be attributed
to the following main causes, acting alone or in
combination.
These
are
(1)
undermining
through piping, (2) eruption of floor caused by
uplift exceeding gravity forces (not in the case
of raft floor), (3) deep scour immediately
upstream and/or downstream of the solid floor,
(4) faulty construction, (5) faulty regulation of
gates, and (6) excessive retrogression.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 SAFETY ASPECTS ON DESIGN<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After
proper
investigation
of
foundation
conditions of the proposed barrage and its
abutments, suitable foundation treatments are
to be proposed by the design organization for
improving bearing capacity, reducing the
settlement and avoiding liquefaction, etc.
Proposals for preconsolidation, vibrofloatation,
compaction piles, grouting of loose rock, ground
anchors, etc, may be properly analysed and
design intimated to the construction agency
well in advance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Parameters, such as, design flood, pond
level, free board, waterway gauge-discharge
curve, etc, shall be properly selected to ensure
safe design of the structure and guidelines for
the same are given in the following paras.
Reference may also be made to IS 6966
(Part 1) : 1989.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Design Flood<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The barrage/weir shall be designed to safely
pass a flood with certain return period.
Usually, in the case of barrages of minor and
normal importance, the design flood for
waterway shall be taken to have a frequency of
1 in 50 years. In such cases where risks and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hydraulic design of the barrage/weir shall
be carried out to be safe against exit gradient,
scour and uplift and settlement of foundation.
For guidelines for their designs, reference may
be made to IS 6966 : 1989. In general, this<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 12892 : 1989<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>on river training works should be placed before
the designers for review and reconsideration
every year.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>would involve safe design of upstream and
downstream
cutoffs/sheet
piles,
energy
dissipation arrangements, thickness of floor,
flexible protections, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)  Design of Other Components<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)  Structural Designs
In so far as the structural design is concerned,
the various forces and moments including those
caused by the earthquake, differential heads,
differential settlement etc, shall be taken into
account and the various factors, such as,
sliding, overturning, etc, shall be arrived at to
be within the permissible limits. Allowable
stresses in materials, such as, concrete,
masonry, steel, etc, shall not be exceeded. For
guidelines for structural design of barrage/weir,
reference may be made to IS 11130 : 1984.
Proper measures to protect the barrage crest
and floor against abrasion damage by rolling
boulders may be provided. Fenders may be
added where navigation is expected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A safe design of fish pass would necessitate
proper provisions for the safe passage of fish
from upstream to downstream and  vice versa .
Effectiveness of the fish passes is to be
regularly observed both during the monsoon
and past-monsoon period. If it is not effective,
proper
modifications
in
the
design
and
operation method have to be requested from the
design organizations. Similarly, the safe design
of navigation lock would necessitate proper
filling and emptying arrangements, berthing
arrangements, desilting arrangements, etc.
Whenever ice formation takes place, provision
of de-icing arrangements for proper gate
operation should be ensured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE — For guidelines on the design of fish pass,
navigation lock, trash racks or head regulator, etc,
reference may be made to the Publication No. 179
Vol II* of the Central Board of Irrigation and Power,
New Delhi.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gate designs
For the safety of the barrages, proper remote
control and group control systems of the gate
operation must be provided. Sometimes, after
the erection of the gates, some gate leaves
vibrate under certain lifted conditions. These
should
be
immediately
checked
by
manufacturers and designers and necessary
rectifications carried out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 SAFETY ASPECTS ON CONSTRUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  A good coordination between designing and
constructing agencies shall be established for
bringing out a safe and economical structure.
The field engineers shall be in the knowledge of
the implications of provisions in the design of
various components. Any change required to be
made on account of site conditions or any other
reason whatsoever, shall not be attempted by
him on his own without evaluating the
implications due to such changes and the
designer shall invariably be consulted to find
out any other economical and safe alternative
thereof. Frequent checks on the construction
vis-a-vis  design provisions and constant quality
control shall be ensured for providing a safe
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Occasionally, floating tree trunks hit the
underside of the gate leaves which may
seriously damage the gates. Whenever such
possibility exists, sufficient margin must be
allowed above high flood level to allow large
size tree trunks to pass underneath the gates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radial gates may be advantageous in barrages
where flashy flood is expected. These can be
operated in a shorter time than vertical gates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)  River Training Works
Care shall be taken for the safe design of
various river training works, such as, guide
bunds, spurs, etc, and other safety works,
namely, afflux bund, marginal and approach
embankments, etc. For guidelines for design of
river training works, reference may be made to
IS
8408
:
1976.
For
major
barrages,
performance of river training works should be
reviewed from time to time. If necessary, it may
also be checked in models because the flow
conditions
in
upstream
and
downstream
regions of the barrages get considerably
changed after a few years due to shoal
formation, bank scour, etc. If necessary, the
guide bunds are sometimes required to be
extended or its protection works to be
strengthened after the flood season. Detailed
pictures of the flow conditions and their effect<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2  For carrying out the construction efficiently
and safely, the following points shall be
carefully planned and data on the same
regularly collected during the construction
period:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Sequence of construction of various items
of the structure including river diversion
and de-watering arrangements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Various constraints on different activities
of construction of the components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Inter-dependence of various items so that
there is minimum interference in the
continuity of progress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 12892 : 1989<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Cut-Off / Sheet Pile
1) Wherever sheetpiles are to be provided,
they shall be driven at their correct
alignment without any gaps between
them in the wall. Since it may not always
be possible to drive them at exact plumb,
suitable tolerances may be allowed. If the
tolerances exceed the permissible limit,
they shall be corrected by taper piles. If
there is any split in the interlock,
additional piles in front shall be driven to
cover it. Driving of welded sheet piles of
more than 8 m length shall not be allowed
as the weld may give way due to excessive
driving stresses. Random checking of
sheet pile joints should be done for
leakage by die-injection technique or any
other suitable technique. Wherever seals
are to be jointed to the sheet piles, it shall
be carefully done by welding and bracing.
Since sheet pile are designed to have
hinge action at the top, it shall be ensured
by the provision of the tar paper.
Wherever two piles rows are provided side
by side, cork mastic filler on top shall be
provided to take care of uneven heights
and hinge action.
Sheet pile caping beams should be cast
monalithic
with
the
barrage
raft.
Otherwise clean cold joints may form at
the inter face, which may cause short
circuiting of the seepage flow and even
piping along this joint.
Vibrosinkers should be recommended for
pile sinking to avoid mis-alignment,
damage of pile head, separation of
clutches and to facilities quick driving.
2) Wherever concrete/masonry cut offs are
provided, precautions shall be taken to
avoid cracking as it may lead to short
circuiting of seepage path and the exit
gradient may be exceeded endangering
the safety.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Obligatory precautions to be taken for the
protection of season’s works from the
ensuring floods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Special features, if any.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Proper
lighting
arrangements
to
be
provided at the project site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Right type and capacity of the equipment
required for de-watering well point and
pumping, excavation, machines, sheet
piling equipment, foundation treatment,
plants, such as, vibro-floatation, etc,
compaction equipment, concreting plant,
river crafts, floating cranes, etc to be
carefully planned and arranged before the
construction is started. Wrong selection of
equipment
often
causes
serious
bottlenecks in construction and even
causes accidents. The selection of the
above may be got vetted in the design
office including safety arrangements to be
provided for their operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Safety crew including divers with full
diving kit must be provided at site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j) First aid kit for accident or emergency
should be provided wherever necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3  Right from the preparation of foundation
for the structure, each and every component of
the barrage/weir shall be constructed properly
for ensuring safety of the structure. For general
guidelines on the construction of barrages/
weirs, reference may be made to IS 11150 :
1984.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4  Safety aspects on the construction of
following items shall be ensured by the
site-in-charge as detailed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Foundation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Foundation preparation is an important item
since the whole structure is going to rest on the
same. It shall be dressed up to the barrage/weir
profile and excavation shall be carried out
carefully without exceeding the tolerance
limits. The foundation shall not contain loose
pockets or materials and they shall be watered
and compacted to the specified relative density.
This is applicable to those portions of the
foundation also which may become loose during
excavation and de-watering operations. Clay
pockets shall be treated as specified by the
designer including removal, refilling with sand
and compacting. It shall be ensured that proper
drainage arrangements in the foundation in
accordance with the design including inverted
filter wherever indicated are provided before
concreting work is taken up. To avoid
honey-combing of concrete of the floor, proper
mudmat of lean concrete usually 50 to 150 mm
thick shall be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  Solid Floor
The solid floor shall be constructed carefully
avoiding stratification of concrete which may
lead to failure by blowing off against uplift
pressures. Cold joints shall be avoided. The
strength of cement concrete of the raft shall be
maintained
in
accordance
with
the
specifications so that the stresses in both the
concrete and steel reinforcement are not
exceeded.
The
main
and
distribution
reinforcement of the raft shall be carefully laid
in accordance with the specifications and
design requirements. The spacings shall be
arranged in such a way that proper placements
of
concrete
and
vibration
are
ensured.
Reinforcement around sill beam grooves shall<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_7>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS 12892 : 1989<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>around the same in accordance with the design
shall be provided. The change in the levels of
the bed in front of the sluice and spillway
portion shall be gradually made up and abrupt
changes avoided. The junction between the
divide wall and the bay concrete shall be done
with proper precautions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>not be omitted. Proper dowels between first and
second stage concrete in the gate grooves,
trestle foundation, etc, must not be forgotten.
The pier reinforcement shall be properly
anchored to the raft. Wherever horizontal or
vertical construction joints are necessary,
proper steps to cut the joint and provision of
seals when the joint is to be left open for more
than 3 days, are to be provided.
d)  Piers and Gates
In the piers, correct alignment of the gate and
stoplog grooves shall be ensured so that no
difficulty is experienced in their operation,
specially during floods. For inspection and
repairs
of
the
gate
wheels
wherever
contemplated, suitable galleries in the piers
with easy access shall be provided.
While concreting, the pressure relief pipes
installed in the piers and their outlets shall not
be lost sight of and the open ends of the pipes
shall be covered so that the concrete does not
fall into the pipes and chokes them.
In the case of gravity type of floor, the stepped
pier footings shall be concreted up to the
barrage floor level and further portion of the
pier above the bay level shall be concreted
simultaneously with the bay concrete. The
steps shall be so provided that there is no
vertical joint. In the raft type of floor, the bay
concreting and pier concreting shall be done
simultaneously.
e)  Abutment
Anchorage of the abutment reinforcement to
the base slab shall be ensured. The abutment
well shall be raised simultaneously along with
the backfill and in any case shall not be more
than about 1.5 m above the compacted backfill.
Specified relative density of the backfull shall
be ensured by proper compaction. Wherever
drainage is to be provided behind the abutment
walls in accordance with the design, the same
shall be done carefully so that the saturated
water level of the backfill is not allowed to
exceed the design values. Inverted filter and
sealing arrangements at the junctions of
different abutment blocks shall be properly
ensured.
High abutments sometimes undergo long term
settlements, in foundations susceptible to
settlement, at the toe side resulting in gradual
tilting of the abutment face. As a result, the
gate grooves may get jammed. It may be
desirable in such cases to provide extra depth
for the vertical grooves on the face of the
abutment to allow free movements of gates
even if tilted.
f)  Divide Wall
As the divide wall is the one coming under the
direct attack of flood flow, proper protection<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sometimes due to the cross-flow at the nose of
the upstream divide wall, a differential scour
may take place between the two faces of the
divide wall. This may even cause tilting of the
wall. Regular watch is necessary, by sounding,
on the two sides of the upstream divide wall. If
necessary, boulders in crates may have to be
dumped near the nose if the scour is serious.
Jute bags or nylon nets filled with sand may be
dumped in deep scour holes and covered with
crated boulders up to 1 m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)  Downstream Protection
As the downstream inverted filter below the
cement concrete (c.c.) blocks is very important
as a measure against piping, it shall be laid
with due care. The gaps between the c.c. blocks
shall always be filled with small stones or bajri.
Wherever downstream bed level is higher than
the level of downstream c.c. block protection,
reverse slopes, not steeper than 1 in 5 shall be
provided and it shall be ensured that some
loose stone protection is provided for a length of
not less than 2 m in the higher bed portion
after the reverse slope.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sometimes, due to error in gate operation and
also due to shoal formation near the barrage,
high concentration of flow may generate
unsteady shooting flow over the down stream
protection works. To prevent any damage due
to such contingency, indigenous geofilters of
bamboo mattress, etc, can be provided below
the mineral filters, to avoid displacement of the
filter material from below the c.c. blocks
resulting in the suction of bed materials
underneath.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)  Instrumentation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The importance of instrumentation shall be
understood fully and care shall be taken in
their installation so that wrong data are not
observed leading to misleading and dangerous
conclusions.
For
guidelines
on
the
instrumentation in barrages/weirs, reference
may be made to IS 6532 : 1972.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It may be stressed that often the instruments
are simply forgotten, once the construction is
over. Even the locations of the instruments are
not remembered. It is desirable to prepare an
exhaustive manual for instruments embedded
in the barrage, with their locations, frequency
of observations, analysis to be done, importance
of these observations, etc. This manual may be
kept both in the offices of the Assistant<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>IS 12892 : 1989<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Engineers and Executive Engineers in charge
of the barrage, as also in the site control room.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>poured into it. At the surface, special concrete,
namely, haematite concrete, epoxy concrete,
etc, may be used, for a thickness of 150 mm or
so.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The location of each of the instrument may also
be painted on the face of the piers where the
end of the cable pairs emerge out. The actual
tip location may also be indicated there by
paints.
j)  River Training Works
The materials used in the construction of
various river training works, such as, guide
bunds, afflux bunds, approach embankments
groynes
or
spurs,
etc,
and
that
their
construction
itself
shall
be
of
required
standards so that their failures, impairing the
hydraulic performance and hence the safety of
the diversion structure, do not occur, wherever
filters are indicated in the design, they shall be
provided without fail since the stability of the
bunds would depend on it. It shall be ensured
that the afflux bunds are tied to high grounds
to prevent outflanking of the structure and
endangering the same wherever the deep
channel of the river hugs the guide bunds and
adequate apron shall be provided to avoid scour
and consequent failures.
k)  Head Regulator
Head regulator is also a structure similar to the
main structure in so far as the general
principles of design are concerned. Hence,
whatever precautions are to be observed in the
construction of the main structure from safety
point of view, they shall be followed for the
head regulator also.
Whenever there is a chance of floating debris,
such as, grass logs, tree trunks, etc, entering
the
canal
through
the
head
regulator,
log-booms or trash booms may have to be
provided at the upstream of the head regulator.
If heavy silt deposition takes place at the entry
of the canal, thereby reducing the canal
capacity, it may be necessary to have a small
dredger operating in the canal (damage of
lining in the canal should be provided) and
clearing the silt deposited. The dredged
material can be dumped on either side of the
bank.
m)  Damages due to Rolling Stones
Barrages/weirs located in the bouldery reaches
face the problem of abrasion and damages due
to rolling stones thus endangering the safety of
the structure. In order to ensure the safety,
measures like provision of richer concrete in
the top thickness of the floor, paving stones,
clading of pier nose with steel or stone, etc,
shall be adopted.
While repairing the cavaties on the crest slope
and cistern of the barrage and in the piers,
proper dowel bars and wire mesh may be
embedded inside the cavities before concrete is<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When big boulders roll over the barrage, steel
rails with welded anchors may be fixed on the
surface, so that the boulders cannot damage the
concrete surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n)  Shearing Off of Pier Reinforcement<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the piers are under construction, the
projecting pier reinforcement shall be properly
protected from floods by bending them in the
direction of flow, well before the floods and
later
on
straightening
them
when
the
construction is resumed. As some damages
could be caused due to oblique flow or any other
reason, the reinforcement shall be first checked
up before starting the construction after floods
whether they are loosely sticking out or not.
After ensuring its proper bending with the
lower portion, new reinforcement shall be
welded on to the old ones. Proper bonding of
new concrete with the old one shall also be
ensured. A few welded rods shall also be test
checked for their strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>p) Provision of thrust forces, exerted by
ice-covers of the pond, with reference to the
safety of the structure should be made. This
provision is of importance in sub-Himalayan
areas of the country.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provision for safety against uplift forces on the
floor structure that are exerted by the water
seeping down the mountain on hill slopes
(Particularly, during rainy seasons) while the
floor is under repairs and no counterweight is
available due to diversion of river waters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>q)  Quality Control<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety of the barrages/weirs depends on the
sound construction with strict quality control.
Safety shall not be compromised for cost or
speed of construction. To prevent possible
failures, the spots where faulty construction
has
occurred
shall
be
identified
by
non-destructive tests and suitable measures
taken with strict quality control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alkali aggregate reaction sometimes causes
expansion of concrete at a much later stage
after construction. Sometimes, such expansion
in peirs and abutments james the gates. It is
essential that the cement and the aggregate
proposed to be used in the construction of the
barrage or the weirs should be tested in a
competent
laboratory
for
alkali-aggregate
reactivity. Use of pozzolana material, for
example, fly ash, etc, to a considerable extent
(up to 40 percent of the cement quantity) may
reduce the alkali aggregate reactivity. All the
cement and aggregates which are liable to such
reaction should be avoided in the construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>immediately before the flood and once
immediately after the flood. The committee
shall review the condition of the river, both
upstream and downstream of the barrage
utilising the cross-sections taken of the river.
Whenever serious scour is taking place, the
committee may advice repair work by crated
boulders etc, where high shoals have been
formed near the barrage, both upstream and
downstream, proper deshoaling measures
either by dredgers or by dozers during the
non-monsoon period are to be recommended.
Any bank scour near the barrage will also be
carefully surveyed and remedial measures to
be quickly designed. If quick decisions are
not taken, aggrevations may become beyond
the control of the maintenance engineers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>r) Strict quality control during construction
should be exercised so that the following
construction defects do not occur and the safety
of structure is ensured.
1) Stratification of concrete layers in the
solid floor and the improper bond between
the layers of concrete.
2) Various
construction
and
structural
design defects.
3) Cracks in the downstream glacis leading
to short circuiting of seepage path.
4) Improper foundation treatment leading to
subsidence and consequent disturbance in
the alignment of gate track and jamming.
5) Cracking of seals in the joints.
6) Tearing of sheet piles and improper
interlocking.
7) Improper
foundation
treatment
of
impervious layers leading to locked up
seepage pressure.
8) Inadequate cover for reinforcement bars.
9) Honeycombing of bottom layers of floor
concrete due to omission of inadequate
mudmat.
10) Improper concrete mix used resulting in
structural failure, etc.
11) Necking failures of flexible concrete cut off
walls.
12) Rigid sheet piles instead of hinged ones
due to non-provision of tar paper, cork
mastick, asphalt, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sometimes, the under sluice tunnels are
choked due to heavy silt deposition. This
should be regularly checked after closing the
tunnel
gates
on
the
downstream.
If
necessary, such chokages are to be cleaned
by compressed air or air water jets”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3  Safety of the barrages against scour
damages resulting from cross flows, shoal
formation, vortex formation, etc, shall be
ensured by proper operation of the gates and
dredging of shoals wherever necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4  The piezometric data shall be regularly
checked, particularly during and after the
floods and suitable action taken if unusual
behaviour different from the design values are
observed. Readings of tiltmeters installed over
abutments, piers and divide walls shall be
regularly observed and safety of the structure
ensured
whenever
adverse
behaviour
is
observed. Similarly, the readings of soil meters
and stress meters, wherever provided, shall be
analysed and suitable action taken to ensure
safety of the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 SAFETY ASPECTS ON MAINTENANCE
AND OPERATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  Proper
inspection,
maintenance
and
operation of the diversion structures are
necessary adjuncts to safe and economical
designs. Any slackness in these aspects would
lead to failures and extension of damages. For
guidelines on this aspect, reference may be
made to IS 7349 : 1989.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5  Safety
of
the
trash
racks
provided
sometimes upstream of the gates of the head
regulator feeding hydel channels shall be
ensured by frequently cleaning the clogged
openings, thus eliminating high differential
pressures to develop.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2  Safety against faulty gate regulation can be
prevented
only
by
imparting
adequate
knowledge to the operating personnel about the
significance of the proper regulation and proper
maintenance of the gates and other hoisting
arrangements. They shall also be imparted
adequate training in this regard. These shall
form part of the duties of the site-in-charge.
Operation and maintenance manual of gates
should be updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.6  Divide walls analysis of scour holes and
year to year maintenance required should be
examined from hydraulic performance, gate
operations and flow phenomenon. If the scour
holes are deepened to vortex formation leading
to washing of fine due materials and sinking
boulders, remedial measures should cover
treatment of proper fibre filter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

barrage, if any, should be taken into
consideration for protection measures and
river training measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>hydraulic and structural, shall be kept in the
office of the Divisional Engineer of the project.
The record shall also contain the details of its
failures/problems,
if
any,
and
remedial
measures adopted from time to time. Necessary
photographs shall also be available of the same.
These
would
always
help
for
future
modification if any, needed for the safety of the
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Construction details, design calculations and
construction drawings of barrages/weirs, etc,
should be documented and preserved for future
reference and use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>River plan forms in the vicinity of barrage
should be monitored from ground survey as
well as from satellite imageries if possible.
Model studies should be carried out before
design and construction of barrage/weir.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2  Whenever there is any problem or failure of
the barrage/weir, a lot of data needs to be
collected for study and analysis so that suitable
remedial measures could be adopted and safety
ensured. A list of such data is given below:
a) Detailed drawings of the barrage/weir, its
head regulators, guide bunds, afflux
bunds, approach bunds, spurs, etc.
b) Detailed note on the damages noticed
including
the

cement concrete blocks, stone protection
around divide walls and for a distance of
60 m or so at 15 m interval.
h) Gate operations followed during floods
and other times.
j) Any seismicity experienced prior to or
during the floods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3  Another important point leading to the
safety of the barrage/weir structures being
planned, designed, constructed and/or operated
and maintained is that of publishing the cases
of failures of barrages/weirs and remedial
measures adopted in the technical journals for
the benefit of the designers and the project
authorities. This shall be done wherever
feasible subject to orders, if any, regarding
publications on projects classified as secret.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
