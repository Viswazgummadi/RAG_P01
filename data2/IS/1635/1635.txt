<<PARAGRAPH>>Building Limes and Lime Products
Sectional Committee,
CED 4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>POREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard
( Second Revision
) was adopted
by the Bureau of Indian Standards,
after
the draft
finalized
by the Building
Limes and Lime Products
Sectional
Committee
had been
approved
by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Slaking
of quicklime
is an essential
operation
in the preparation
of lime at site for use in
building construction,
where standard
hydrated
lime is not readily
available.
Improper
slaking
results in serious defects in mortars and plasters and subsequent maintenance
work will be difficult
and elaborate.
Therefore,
in the interest
of sound construction,
wherever
lime is used, its
complete
slaking should be ensured.
This standard
intended
to give necessary
guidance for field
slaking of lime so as to achieve this objective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quicklime
can never
be used as such
for structural
purposes;
it must always be slaked first.
Slaking of calcium oxide results in calcium hydroxide.
The method of slaking
is an important
factor in determining
the quality of the finished products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard
was first published in 1960 and subsequently
revised in 1975. This present revision
has been taken up based on the experience
gained with the use of this standard
in order to bring
the required modifications
in the slaking methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE -
Tank slaking
is desirable
as in platform
slaking
it may
not be possible
to properly
slake the
lime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3  TERMINOLOGY<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1  Tank Slaking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purpose
of this standard
the definition
of terms
given in IS 6508  :  1988 and classifi-
cation of lime given in IS 712  :  1984 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method
directly
results in lime putty and
is thus
suitable
when
the
end
product
is
required
in this form.
The tank shall be water
tight
and large enough
to permit
stirring of
mix.
Its sides and bottom
shall be lined
with
a material which is not attacked
by lime. Brick
lining is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4 NECESSARY
INFORMATION<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following
information
is necessary
for
properly
planning slaking operation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Class of lime;
b) Slaking properties
( slow, fast, etc ); and
c) End use of the lime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.1  For
providing
continuous
slaking
operation
at site, two tanks may
be used, one
400 mm deep at a higher level above ground and
other 750-800 mm deep at a lower level below
ground.
The slaking operation
of quicklime
is
done continuously
in the higher tanks and the
resultant
milk of lime
is allowed
to
flow,
through
3.35
mm IS Sieve
[ see IS
460
( Part 1 )  :  1985 ] into the lower tank
where
it
will settle and mature into putty ( see Fig. 1 ).
The
sieve shall be cleaned,
as and
when
required,
to avoid
clogging
of the apertures.
To obtain
a continuous
supply of lime putty,
two tanks instead of one may be provided at the
lower level and used alternatively
so that when
putty
is being
used
from
one,
fresh
putty
may be formed in the other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5 STORAGE
OF QUICKLIME
BEFORE
SLAKING<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quicklime
deteriorates
rapidly
on exposure
by
taking
up moisture
and
carbon dioxide from
atmosphere.
It should
be slaked
as soon as
possible
after
the production
of
lime at kiln
before any deterioration
sets in. If unavoidable,
it may be stored
in air-tight
metal
containers
or polyethylene
lined jute
bags so as to have
minimum exposed area.
The
drums
or poly-
ethylene
lined jute bags should
be stored
in a
shed so that
it is properly
protected
from
dampness and also covered
properly
to avoid
direct contact
with rain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>FIG. 1
SLAKING TANK<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>should
not be allowed
to dry or stiffen till it
is used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.2  The higher tank is first filled with water
to a depth
of about 300 mm and quicklime is
gradually
added to it so as to cover the entire
bottom
of the tank to about
half the depth
of water.
While
quicklime
is being
added,
water
shall be constantly
stirred.
No part of
lime shall be allowed to get exposed above the
water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2  Platform Slaking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method of slaking converts
the quicklime
into dry hydrated
lime powder
which
can be
used as it is or after converting
it into putty
( see 6.2.2.1 ).
In
this process
quicklime
is
spread in 150 mm thick layer on a water-tight
masonry
platform
and water is sprinkled over
it in small quantities
through
a rose can or
with a hose pipe until
lime disintegrates
into
a fine powder.
As water is added,
the heap of
lime is turned over and over.
Care should
be
taken that minimum quantity
of water is added
as is required
for complete
slaking.
Slaking
should be allowed to continue
further
by itself
for a period of about 24 hours or so. It should
then
be screened
through a 3.35 mm IS Sieve.
Slaked
lime should
be stored
in a dry place
under cover or may be packed in polyethylene
lined gunny bags, well protected
from rain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It
is important
that
in tank
slaking, lime
should
be added
to water
and not water to
lime.
As Iime slakes with evolution
of heat,
water begins
to boil.
More
lime and water
may
be added
till
th;,;;ltdtisite
quantity
of
lime
has
been
.
After
the
apparent
slaking
is over,
stirring
should
be
continued
for
some time
further
to
make
sure that the whole of the lime has been fully
slaked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Milk of lime
thus formed
is aIlowed to flow
through a 3.35 mm IS Sieve into the lower tank
where
it is allowed
to
settle
by
standing
undisturbed
so as to
form
what
is putty.
Where
only
one tank is used, the slaked lime
is allowed to stand undisturbed
in tank.
Milk
of lime during
this process
looses moisture
by evaporation
and absorption
and
thus thic-
kens.
For maturing
of lime putty
at least 3
days should
be allowed
in case of fat lime
( class C and D ) but not more than 2 days in
case of semihydraulic
lime ( class B and F. ).
This ensures complete
slaking and at the same
time
improves
the workability.
Lime putty<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2.1  Preparation of putty<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The putty,
if required,
shall be obtained
by
adding
dry slaked
lime to water and stirring
to
the
consistency
of a thick
cream
and
allowing
it to stand
and mature for a period
which shall be not less than
16 hours
in the
case of Class C and D limes, and not more than
12 hours
in the
case of Class B and F limes
before using it as slaked lime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2 Dust from lime may be irritating
if inhaled,
though
it does
not cause abnormal
lung con-
ditions;
those
who regularly
work with such
limes may be provided
with
goggles
for pro-
tection
of eyes and suitable
respirators
for
protection
of nose, throat
and lungs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 STORAGE OF BUILDING LIME AFTER
SLAKING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Dry Slaked/Hydrated Lime<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the dry slaked
lime is to be used within a
few days, it may be stored
on the platform
suitably
covered
for protection
from rain and
wind.
If it is required
to be stored for a longer
period not exceeding 2 months, it may be bagged
in polyethylene
lined
gunny
bags,
properly
stitched
and kept in a dry and closed godown.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3 Quicklime
particles
may cause
burns
on
skin particularly
if the
skin is moist.
This
problem
would
be rather serious in warm and
humid
localities
where
there
would be much
perspiration.
Skin protecting
cream
may be
provided to the workers in addition
to goggles
and respirators.
They
may also be provided
with gum boots and gloves made of rubber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2  Putty<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lime putty
shall always be stored under
water.
The lime putty shall be used as soon
as possible after preparation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 Washing the face and skin with fresh water
will reduce
considerably
the
irritation
after
working in an atmosphere
of lime dust.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8 PRECAUTIONS<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Quicklime during
slaking
reacts
violently
with water liberating
an enormous
amount
of
heat.
Hence
suitable
precautions
against fire
hazard
shall be taken when slaking quicklime.
Quicklime before slaking shall not
be allowed
to come in contact
with water
during
storage,
handling or transit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.5 Freshly
slaked
lime,
while
hot,
may
produce
skin burns.
The workmen, who regu-
larly work with milk of lime, should be instruc-
ted to oil their
skin daily
least they develop
skin cracks leading to possible infection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
