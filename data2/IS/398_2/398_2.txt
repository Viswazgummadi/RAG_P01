<<PARAGRAPH>>FOREWORD<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Indian Standard (Third Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the draft finalized
by the Conductors and Accessories for Overhead Lines Sectional Committee had been approved by the
Electrotechnical
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard was originally published in 1953, the first revision was brought out in 1961.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this revision, the standard had been modified in the light of the modern development in the techniques
of the conductor manufacture. The other salient point incorporated in this revision was the inclusion of
wrapping test for the aluminium wires in place of the elongation test originally specified for aluminium
as well as steel wires.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The second revision was brought out in 1976 and the third revision has been undertaken with a view to
effecting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the following consid&ations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To line up with the International Standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All amendments approved and circulated after 1976 have been considered while preparing this
standard for third revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The most important consideration has been taken regarding improvement in conductivity of EC
grade aluminium, the maximum resistivity  of  0.028 264 ohm. mm*/mm at 20°C as per IEC Standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement of wire diameter, lay ratio, test procedure and testing of routine tests and acceptance

<<PARAGRAPH>>While revising this standard, it was decided to issue it in different parts covering different types of conductors.
This part d.+ing with galvanized steel-reinforced aluminium conductors form Part 2 of the series. Other

<<HEADING level=3>>NOTES
ON CALCULATION
OF RESISTANCE,
MASS .AND BREAKING
LOAD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.3
In calculating
the stranding
constants
in Table
5, the mean lay ratio, that is, the arithmetic
mean
of the relevant
minimum
and maximum
values
in
Table 4, has been assumed
for each layer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A-l
INCREASE
IN LENGTH
DUE TO
STRANDING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-l.1
When
straightened
out, each wire
in any
particular
layer
of standard
conductor,
except
the
central wire, is longer than the stranded conductor by
an amount
depending
on the lay ratio of that layer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3
CALCULATED
BREAKING
LOAD
OF
CONDUCTOR<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.1 The breaking load of an aluminium
conductor-
galvanized
steel, reinforced
in terms of the sum of
‘the strength of the individual
component
wires, may
be taken to be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2
RESISTANCE
AND MASS
OF
CONDUCTOR<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.1
In aluminium
conductors,
steel reinforced
the
conductivity
of the steel core is neglected
and the
resistance of the conductor is calculated with reference
to the resistance
of the aluminium
wires only. The
resistance
of any length of strauded conductor
is the
resistance
of  the same  length q any one aluminium
wire multiplied
by a constant, as set out in Table
5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
98 percent of the sum of the breaking
loads of
the aluminium
wires plus 89 percent of the sum
of the breaking
loads of the galvanized
steel
wires, when taken from the stranded
conductor
and tested;
or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
98 percent of the sum of the breaking
loads of
the aluminium
wires plus 85 percent of the sum
of the breaking loads of the galvanized steel wires,
based on the breaking
loads of the component
wires before
stranding,
that is, in the coil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-2.2
The mass ot each wire in a length of stranded
conductor,
except the central
wire, will be greater
than that of an equal iength of straight wire by an
amount
depending
on the lay ratio
of the layer
(see  A-1.1).  The total mass of any length of conductor
is, therefore,
obtained
by multiplying
.the mass of an
equal
length
of straight
wire by the approximate
constant
set out in Table 5. The masses of the steel
core and aluminium
wires are calculated
separately
and added together.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-3.2
The values of approximate
breaking
load of
conductors,
given
in Table
3 have been calculated
in accordance
with (b) above
and on the basis of
the minimum.bteaking
loads of the component
wires
