FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.1 This Indian Standard ( First Revision ) was adopted by the Indian
Standards Institution on 20 November
1985, after the draft
finalized
by
Dams
( Overflow
and Non-overflow
) Sectional
Committee
had been
approved by the Civil Engineering
Division Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.2 A dam constructed across any stream disturbs the natural drainage -
surface and sub-surface.
The seepage water inside the body and founda-
tions of the dam should
be disposed of to enhance the safety factor of
the structure.
Hence, a well planned drainage system is essential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.3 During
operation
of the
dam,
a watch
should
be kept
on the
prevailing
uplift
pressures
so as to assess the adequacy
or otherwise of
the drainage provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.4 It is necessary to observe and study the quantum
of seepage from
various
sources individually
as well as collectively
with respect to data
on rainfall, reservoir level, etc, and to take remedial
measures in case of
abrupt departures from the normal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>0.5 This standard was first published in 1982.
Many technical comments
were received
since then.
The present revision is being issued to take
care of these comments.
Important
modifications
incorporated
in this
revision include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provision of water seal to prevent entry of air in drainage
holes
for minimizing
formation

and
thereby
reducing choking of drainage holes; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Addition
of criteria
to determine
the necessity of providing

<<HEADING level=3>>IS : 10135 -“I985<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. SCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  This code prescribes general requirements
and methods of drainage
in and around
a gravity
dam, its foundations and abutments.
It does
not cover drainage requirements
for energy
dissipation
devices,
chutes
and training walls.
It may be supplemented
by specific
requirements
to suit the site conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.  CLASSIFICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1  Drainage is the safe disposal of surface
and
seepage
water
in the
abutment,
foundation
and the- body of the dam.
The drainage is thus
classified into the following four categories:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Surface drainage,
b) Sub-surface
drainage,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Internal
drainage of the dam, and
d) Foundation
drainage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although
foundation
drainage
forms
a part
of
the sub-surface
drainage,
yet for the purpose of this standard,
it has been covered under
a separate sub-head due to its importance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.  REQUIREMENTS
AND  METHODS
OF DRAINAGE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1 Surface
Drainage
-
All open surfaces in the vicinity
of the dam
shall
be
provided
with adequate
drainage.
For
this
purpose open
surface channels shall be so designed and laid as to drain off the area
effectively and carry away the surface run-off into the reservoir upstream
of the dam or into the river downstream of the dam.
The service roads
and other
approach
roads
leading
to dam shall have proper camber
and longitudinal
slopes for catch water drains.
The water from these
catch
drains shall
be collected at suitable intervals depending on topo-
graphy, rainfall, etc, and led away into the natural drains away from the
dam.
The
roadway,
the ducts for electric cable, the crane rail recesses
and any other recesses provided at the top of the dam
shall
be drained
through pipes of at least 100 mm diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2  Sub-surface
Drainage
-
This shall be provided for the following
purposes, if necessary:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Protection of slopes, and
b) Drainage
of abutments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.1  Protection
of Slopes -
In some river valley projects, the hill slopes
in the vicinity
of abutments
need
to be protected against likely slips.
This
sh-all be done by either
providing
a
combination
of concrete
cladding/shotcreting
and
drainage
holes
or
any
other
suitable<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_6>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IS : IO135 - 1985<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>arrangement
or by providing
drainage
holes only. Provision
of non-return
valves, Lvhich allow water to flow towards
the reservoir
area or hill slopes
in the vicinity
of abutment
only, shall be made in the drainage
holes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2
Drainage of Abutments -
The
drainage
gallery
may
be extended
into
the
abutment
rock,
together
with
provision
of cross
tunnels,
as drainage
tunnels,
if necessary,
for ensuring
the
stability
of abutment
blocks or the abutment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3  Internal
Drainage
of Dam -
Internal
drainage
of a gravity
dam<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>usually  comprises
porous concrete
drains/formed
drains
at the
contrac-
tion joints and  in  the body of the
dam.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.1
Vertical
drains
at contraction
joints shall be provided
to intercept
the seepage water through
the joint
and
such seepage
water
shall ulti-
mately
be let out into the
drainage
gallery
system.
For
water
stops to
be provided
reference
may be made to ‘Indian
Standard
code of practice
for water stops at transverse
contraction
joints
in masonry
and
concrete
dams’ (  under preparation ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.2
The internal
drainage
of concrete/masonry
dam shall be provid-
ed with 200 mm
dia vertical
drains
or
uniformly
inclined
( till
they
meet
the
gallery
) at
3 m
centre
to centre.
For masonry
dams these
shall be of precast
porous concrete
while for concrete
dams these shall be
formed
drains.
These
shall convey
the seepage
water through
the body
of the masonry/concrete
dam to drainage
gallery
system.
Suitable
water
seal to prevent
entry of air may be provided
at the discharge
end
of the
drainage
pipe in the gallery.
For masonry
dams, the drains shall
be
of
porous
concrete
blocks
while
for concrete
dams,
they shall
be
formed
drains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3.3

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4  Foundation
Drainage
Gallery
-
The main aim of a foundation
drainage gallery is to collect seepage water from foundation and the body
of the dam.
Besides,
it provides space for drilling
and grouting
the
foundations and inspection of dam structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.1 The upstream face of the gallery shall be located at a minimum
distance of 5 percent of the maximum
reservoir
head or 3 m from the
upstream face, whichever is more.
A supplementary
drainage
gallery is
sometimes provided
towards the toe.
For layout
and size of gallery,
reference may be made to ‘Indian Standard
Code of practice for galleries
and other
openings
in dams:
Part
1  General
requirements’
(under
~repardtion  ) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.2  Various
galleries
in the dam
and tunnels
in the abutments
receive water from drainage
holes, joint
drains,
formed
drains/porous
concrete drains, seepage, grouting operations, washing and cleaning,
fire-
fighting, spring leaks, etc.
This water should
be drained
away under
gravity with a slope not flatter than 1 in 1 000.
The water
collected
in
the galleries/tunnels below the general downstream level shall be led into
one or two sumps provided and pumped out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>IS  :  10135 - 1985<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4.3  Gallery
shall
invariably
be provided
in the body of the dam
where height of the structure above normal foundation level is more than
10 m ( measured up to crest level in the  case  of overflow
portion of the
dam ).
For dams with heights below 10 m, the designer should consider
the provision of gallery keeping in view factors like foundation condition
and height of water retained.
3.5  Foundation
Drainage
-
Foundation
drainage
provides a means to
relieve the uplift under the dam foundations.
This drainage is accomp-
lished by a line of holes drilled
from
the foundation
gallery
into the
foundation rock. The size, spacing and depth of these holes are assumed
on the basis of physical characteristics
of the foundation rock, foundation
condition
and depth of storage of the reservoir.
The diameter
of the
hole is generally J’VX drill which is 75 mm. The spacing of the hole may
be kept as 6 m centre to centre.
The depth of the holes may
be kept
between 20 and 40 percent of the maximum
reservoir depth and between
30
and 75
percent
of the curtain
grouting
depth
for preliminary
design.
The actual spacing and depth may be determined
on the basis
of geological
conditions.
These
should
be further reviewed and holes
provided
at closer intervals
or further deepened
on the basis
of actual
observations
after the reservoir
is filled.
To
facilitate
this, additional
nipples/pipes shall be embedded in the gallery
concrete.
The drainage
holes
of
75
mm
diameter are drilled
through 100 mm diameter pipe
embedded in the masonry/concrete
portion.
When drainage
holes are
drilled through soft foundations for the drainage of shear zones, faults, etc,
a perforated
pipe should be placed in the drainage holes and the space
between walls of hole and this pipe should be filled with pea gravel. This
arrangement
would avoid
caving-in
of walls
and the holes could
be
got washed, if required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.1 Drainage holes should be drilled
after
all foundation
grouting
has been completed within a minimum horizontal distance of 15 m.
The
drainage
holes shall be drilled, through the drainage,
gallery,
through
previously installed metal pipe extending down to the foundation
rock.
Additional
drainage holes or curtain grouting shall be provided,
if uplift
pressures
higher than designed
values are observed.
After drilling, the
pipes shall be plugged at top and seepage water from the hole shall
be
taken off at a T-joint
and let to the gutter of gallery ( see Fig. 2 ).
3.5.2 Besides the foundation
drainage gallery, the drainage
holes shall
be drilled
through
tunnels
in the foundation and abutments,
Spacing
and depth of the holes shall depend on the geology.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.3 Where cross galleries, additional
foundation
galleries
and drifts
are
introduced,
necessary
drainage
arrangements
should
also be
considered and provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5.4
The seepage water from
drainage
hoies should
be
monitored
from
consideration
of quantity,
contents
of fines and chemicals
and
remedial action taken, if warranted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
