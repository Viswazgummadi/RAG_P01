<<HEADING level=3>>Designation: A 992/A 992M – 04a<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Standard Speciﬁcation for
Structural Steel Shapes 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation A 992/A 992M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.
A superscript epsilon ( e ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope*
1.1 This speciﬁcation covers rolled steel structural shapes
for use in building framing or bridges, or for general structural
purposes.
1.2 Supplementary requirements are provided for use where
additional testing or additional restrictions are required by the
purchaser. Such requirements apply only when speciﬁed in the
purchase order.
1.3 When the steel is to be welded, a welding procedure
suitable for the grade of steel and intended use or service is to
be utilized. See Appendix X3 of Speciﬁcation A 6/A 6M for
information on weldability.
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system is to
be used independently of the other without combining values in
any way.
1.5 The text of this speciﬁcation contains notes or footnotes,
or both, that provide explanatory material; such notes and
footnotes, excluding those in tables and ﬁgures, do not contain
any mandatory requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. General Requirements For Delivery
3.1 Material furnished under this speciﬁcation shall con-
form to the requirements of the current edition of Speciﬁcation
A 6/A 6M for the ordered material, unless a conﬂict exists, in
which case this speciﬁcation shall prevail.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. Materials and Manufacture
4.1 The steel shall be killed, and such shall be affirmed in
the test report by a statement of  killed steel , a value of 0.10 %
or more for the silicon content, or a value of 0.015 % or more
for the total aluminum content.
4.2 The steelmaking practice used shall be one that pro-
duces steel having a nitrogen content not greater than 0.015 %
and includes the addition of one or more nitrogen-binding
elements, or one that produces steel having a nitrogen content
not greater than 0.012 % (with or without the addition of
nitrogen-binding elements). The nitrogen content need not be
reported, regardless of which steelmaking practice was used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Chemical Composition
5.1 The heat analysis shall conform to the requirements in
Table 1.
5.2 In addition to the elements listed in Table 1, test reports
shall include, for information, the chemical analysis for tin.
Where the amount of tin is less than 0.02 %, it shall be
permissible for the analysis to be reported as “< 0.02 %.”
5.3 The steel shall conform on product analysis to the
requirements prescribed in Table 1, subject to the product
analysis tolerances in Speciﬁcation A 6/A 6M.
5.4 The maximum permissible carbon equivalent value shall
be 0.47 % for shapes with ﬂange thickness over 2 in. [50 mm],
and 0.45 % in other shapes. The carbon equivalent value shall
be based on heat analysis. The required chemical analysis as
well as the carbon equivalent shall be reported. The carbon
equivalent shall be calculated using the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
