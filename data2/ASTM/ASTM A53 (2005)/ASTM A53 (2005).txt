<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope*
1.1 This speciﬁcation 2   covers seamless and welded black
and hot-dipped galvanized steel pipe in NPS   1 ⁄ 8  to NPS 26 [DN
6 to DN 650] ( Note 1 ), inclusive, with nominal wall thickness
( Note 2 ) as given in  Table X2.2  and  Table X2.3 . It shall be
permissible to furnish pipe having other dimensions provided
that such pipe complies with all other requirements of this
speciﬁcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.3.3 Type E is furnished either nonexpanded or cold
expanded at the option of the manufacturer.
1.4 The values stated in either SI units or inch-pound units
are to be regarded separately as standard. The values stated in
each system may not be exact equivalents; therefore, each
system is to be used independently of the other.
1.5 The following precautionary caveat pertains only to the
test method portion, Sections  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  13 ,  14 , and  15  of this
speciﬁcation:  This standard does not purport to address all of
the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica-
bility of regulatory requirements prior to use.
1.6 The text of this speciﬁcation contains notes or footnotes,
or both, that provide explanatory material. Such notes and
footnotes, excluding those in tables and ﬁgures, do not contain
any mandatory requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1—The dimensionless designators NPS (nominal pipe size) [DN
(diameter nominal)] have been substituted in this speciﬁcation for such
traditional terms as “nominal diameter,” “size,” and “nominal size.”
N OTE  2—The term nominal wall thickness has been assigned for the
purpose of convenient designation, existing in name only, and is used to
distinguish it from the actual wall thickness, which may vary over or
under the nominal wall thickness.
1.2 This speciﬁcation covers the following types and
grades:
1.2.1  Type F —Furnace-butt-welded, continuous welded
Grade A,
1.2.2  Type E —Electric-resistance-welded, Grades A and B,
and
1.2.3  Type S —Seamless, Grades A and B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6. Product Analysis
6.1 The purchaser is permitted to perform an analysis of two
pipes from each lot of 500 lengths, or fraction thereof. Samples
for chemical analysis, except for spectrographic analysis, shall
be taken in accordance with Practice  E 1806 . The chemical
composition thus determined shall conform to the requirements
given in  Table 1 .
6.2 If the analysis of either pipe does not conform to the
requirements given in  Table 1 , analyses shall be made on
additional pipes of double the original number from the same
lot, each of which shall conform to the speciﬁed requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>diameter of which is eight times the speciﬁed outside diameter
of the pipe, without failure.
7.2.3 Double-extra-strong pipe over NPS 1 1 ⁄ 4  [DN 32] need
not be subjected to the bend test.
7.3  Flattening Test :
7.3.1 The ﬂattening test shall be made on pipe over NPS 2
[DN 50] in extra-strong weight or lighter.
7.3.2  Seamless Pipe :
7.3.2.1 For seamless pipe, a test specimen at least 2 1 ⁄ 2  in.
[60 mm] in length shall be ﬂattened cold between parallel
plates in two steps. During the ﬁrst step, which is a test for
ductility, except as allowed by  7.3.5 ,  7.3.6 , and  7.3.7 , no cracks
or breaks on the inside, outside, or end surfaces shall be present
before the distance between the plates is less than the value of
H  calculated as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. Mechanical Properties
7.1  Tension Test :
7.1.1 For tension tests other than transverse weld tension
tests, the yield strength corresponding to a permanent offset of
0.2 % of the gage length or to an extension of 0.5 % of the gage
length under load, the tensile strength, and the elongation in 2
in. or 50 mm shall be determined, and the tension test results
shall conform to the applicable tensile property requirements
given in  Table 2 .
7.1.2 For transverse weld tension tests, the tensile strength
shall be determined, and the tension test results shall conform
to the applicable tensile strength requirement given in  Table 2 .
7.1.3 Electric-resistance-welded pipe NPS 8 [DN 200] or
larger shall be tested using two transverse test specimens, one
taken across the weld and one taken opposite the weld.
7.1.4 Transverse tension test specimens shall be approxi-
mately 1 1 ⁄ 2  in. [38 mm] wide in the gage length and shall
represent the full wall thickness of the pipe from which the test
specimens were cut.
7.2  Bend Test :
7.2.1 For pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] or smaller, a sufficient length
of pipe shall be capable of being bent cold through 90° around
a cylindrical mandrel, the diameter of which is twelve times the
speciﬁed outside diameter of the pipe, without developing
cracks at any portion and without opening the weld.
7.2.2 If ordered for close coiling, the pipe shall stand being
bent cold through 180° around a cylindrical mandrel, the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H  5  ~ 1  1  e ! t / ~ e  1  t / D !<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where:
H  = distance between ﬂattening plates, in. [mm] ( Note 4 ),
e
= deformation per unit length (constant for a given grade
of steel, 0.09 for Grade A, and 0.07 for Grade B),
t
= speciﬁed wall thickness, in. [mm], and
D  = speciﬁed outside diameter, in. [mm]
7.3.2.2 During the second step, which is a test for sound-
ness, the ﬂattening shall be continued until the test specimen
breaks or the opposite sides of the test specimen meet.
Evidence of laminated or unsound material that is revealed
during the entire ﬂattening test shall be cause for rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  4—The  H  values have been calculated for standard-weight and
extra-heavy weight pipe from NPS 2 1 ⁄ 2  to NPS 24 [DN 65 to DN 600],
inclusive, and are given in  Table X2.1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3  Electric-Resistance-Welded Pipe :
7.3.3.1 A test specimen at least 4 in. [100 mm] in length
shall be ﬂattened cold between parallel plates in three steps,
with the weld located either 0° or 90° from the line of direction
of force as required by  7.3.3.2  or  7.3.3.3 , whichever is
applicable. During the ﬁrst step, which is a test for ductility of
the weld, except as allowed by  7.3.5 ,  7.3.6 , and  7.3.7 , no cracks
or breaks on the inside or outside surface at the weld shall be
present before the distance between the plates is less than two
thirds of the speciﬁed outside diameter of the pipe. As a second
step, the ﬂattening shall be continued as a test for ductility
away from the weld. During the second step, except as allowed
by  7.3.6  and  7.3.7 , no cracks or breaks on the inside or outside
surface away from the weld shall be present before the distance
between the plates is less than one third of the speciﬁed outside
diameter of the pipe but is not less than ﬁve times the speciﬁed
wall thickness of the pipe. During the third step, which is a test
for soundness, the ﬂattening shall be continued until the test
specimen breaks or the opposite walls of the test specimen
meet. Evidence of laminated or unsound material or of incom-
plete weld that is revealed by the ﬂattening test shall be cause
for rejection.
7.3.3.2 For pipe produced in single lengths, the ﬂattening
test speciﬁed in  7.3.3.1  shall be made using a test specimen
taken from each end of each length of pipe. The tests from each
end shall be made alternately with the weld at 0° and at 90°
from the line of direction of force.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

7.3.7 , no cracks or breaks on the inside, outside, or end
surfaces at the weld shall be present before the distance
between the plates is less than three fourths of the speciﬁed
outside diameter of the pipe. As a second step, the ﬂattening
shall be continued as a test for ductility away from the weld.
During the second step, except as allowed by  7.3.6  and  7.3.7 ,
no cracks or breaks on the inside, outside, or end surfaces away
from the weld shall be present before the distance between the
plates is less than 60 % of the speciﬁed outside diameter of the
pipe. During the third step, which is a test for soundness, the
ﬂattening shall be continued until the test specimen breaks or
the opposite walls of the test specimen meet. Evidence of
laminated or unsound material or of incomplete weld that is
revealed by the ﬂattening test shall be cause for rejection.
7.3.5 Surface imperfections in the test specimen before
ﬂattening, but revealed during the ﬁrst step of the ﬂattening
test, shall be judged in accordance with the ﬁnish requirements
in Section  12 .
7.3.6 Superﬁcial ruptures as a result of surface imperfec-
tions shall not be cause for rejection.
7.3.7 For pipe with a  D -to- t  ratio less than 10, because the
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the
inside surface at the 6 and 12 o’clock locations, cracks at such
locations shall not be cause for rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  5—The hydrostatic test pressures given herein are inspection test
pressures, are not intended as a basis for design, and do not have any direct
relationship to working pressures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3 The minimum hydrostatic test pressure required to
satisfy the requirements speciﬁed in  8.2  need not exceed 2500
psi [17 200 kPa] for pipe NPS 3 [DN 80] or smaller, or 2800
psi [19 300 kPa] for pipe larger than NPS 3 [DN 80]; however,
the manufacturer has the option of using higher test pressures.
For all sizes of seamless pipe and electric-resistance-welded
pipe, the hydrostatic test pressure shall be maintained for at
least 5 s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. Nondestructive Electric Test
9.1  Type E Pipe :
9.1.1 The weld seam of each length of electric-resistance-
welded pipe NPS 2 [DN 50] or larger shall be tested with a
nondestructive electric test in accordance with Practices  E 213 ,
E 273 ,  E 309 , or  E 570  as follows:
9.1.2  Ultrasonic and Electromagnetic Inspection —Any
equipment utilizing the ultrasonic or electromagnetic principles
and capable of continuous and uninterrupted inspection of the
weld seam shall be used. The equipment shall be checked with
an applicable reference standard as described in  9.1.3  at least
once every working turn or not more than 8 h to demonstrate
its effectiveness and the inspection procedures. The equipment
shall be adjusted to produce well-deﬁned indications when the
reference standard is scanned by the inspection unit in a
manner simulating the inspection of the product.
9.1.3  Reference Standards —The length of the reference
standards shall be determined by the pipe manufacturer, and
they shall have the same speciﬁed diameter and thickness as
the product being inspected. Reference standards shall contain
machined notches, one on the inside surface and one on the
outside surface, or a drilled hole, as shown in  Fig. 1 , at the
option of the pipe manufacturer. The notches shall be parallel
to the weld seam, and shall be separated by a distance sufficient
to produce two separate and distinguishable signals. The   1 ⁄ 8 -in.
[3.2-mm] hole shall be drilled through the wall and perpen-
dicular to the surface of the reference standard as shown in  Fig.
1 . Care shall be taken in the preparation of the reference
standard to ensure freedom from ﬁns or other edge roughness,
or distortion of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  6—The calibration standards shown in  Fig. 1  are convenient
standards for calibration of nondestructive testing equipment. The dimen-
sions of such standards are not to be construed as the minimum sizes of
imperfections detectable by such equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.4  Acceptance Limits — Table 3  gives the height of accep-
tance limit signals in percent of the height of signals produced
by reference standards. Imperfections in the weld seam that
produce a signal greater than the acceptance limit signal given
in  Table 3  shall be considered a defect unless the pipe
manufacturer can demonstrate that the imperfection does not
reduce the effective wall thickness beyond 12.5 % of the
speciﬁed wall thickness.
9.2  Type S Pipe —As an alternative to the hydrostatic test at
the option of the manufacturer or if speciﬁed in the purchase
order, the full body of each seamless pipe shall be tested with
a nondestructive electric test in accordance with Practice<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. Hydrostatic Test
8.1 The hydrostatic test shall be applied, without leakage
through the weld seam or the pipe body.
8.2 Plain-end pipe shall be hydrostatically tested to the
applicable pressure given in  Table X2.2 , and threaded-and-
coupled pipe shall be hydrostatically tested to the applicable
pressure given in  Table X2.3 . It shall be permissible, at the
discretion of the manufacturer, to perform the hydrostatic test
on pipe with plain ends, with threads only, or with threads and
couplings; and it shall also be permissible to test pipe in either
single lengths or multiple lengths.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

ing is not necessarily capable of detecting short, deep imper-
fections.
9.2.2.3 The eddy current examination referenced in this
speciﬁcation has the capability of detecting signiﬁcant discon-
tinuities, especially of the short abrupt type.
9.2.2.4 The ﬂux leakage examination referred to in this
speciﬁcation is capable of detecting the presence and location
of signiﬁcant longitudinally or transversely oriented disconti-
nuities. The provisions of this speciﬁcation only require
longitudinal calibration for ﬂux leakage. Different techniques
need to be employed for the detection of differently oriented
imperfections.
9.2.2.5 The hydrostatic test referred to in  8.2  has the
capability of ﬁnding imperfections of a size permitting the test
ﬂuid to leak through the tube wall and may be either visually
seen or detected by a loss of pressure. Hydrostatic testing is not
necessarily capable of detecting very tight through-the-wall
imperfections or imperfections that extend an appreciable
distance into the wall without complete penetration.
9.2.2.6 A purchaser interested in ascertaining the nature
(type, size, location, and orientation) of imperfections that are
capable of being detected in the speciﬁc application of these
examinations is directed to discuss this with the manufacturer
of the tubular product.
9.2.3 For ultrasonic testing, the calibration reference
notches shall be at the option of the manufacturer, and shall be
any one of the three common notch shapes shown in Practice
E 213 . The depth of notch shall not exceed 12.5 % of the
speciﬁed wall thickness of the pipe or 0.004 in. [0.1 mm],
whichever is the greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.6.2 It shall be permissible to evaluate test signals pro-
duced by visual imperfections in accordance with the provi-
sions of Section  12 . A few examples of such imperfections are
straightener marks, cutting chips, scratches, steel die stamps,
stop marks, or pipe reducer ripple.
9.2.7 The test methods described in Section  9  are not
necessarily capable of inspecting the end portion of pipes. This
condition is referred to as end effect. The length of the end
effect shall be determined by the manufacturer and, if speciﬁed
in the purchase order, reported to the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.4 For eddy current testing, the calibration pipe shall
contain, at the option of the manufacturer, any one of the
following calibration standards to establish a minimum sensi-
tivity level for rejection.
9.2.4.1  Drilled Hole —The calibration pipe shall contain
three holes spaced 120° apart or four holes spaced 90° apart,
sufficiently separated longitudinally to ensure separately dis-
tinguishable responses. The holes shall be drilled radially and

ﬁle with a   1 ⁄ 4  in. [6 mm] diameter, a notch shall be ﬁled or
milled tangential to the surface and transverse to the longitu-
dinal axis of the pipe. The notch shall have a depth not
exceeding 12.5 % of the speciﬁed wall thickness of the pipe or
0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater.
9.2.4.3  Longitudinal Notch —A notch 0.031 in. [0.8 mm] or
less in width shall be machined in a radial plane parallel to the
pipe axis on the outside surface of the pipe, to a depth not
exceeding 12.5 % of the speciﬁed wall thickness of the pipe or
0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater. The length of the
notch shall be compatible with the testing method.
9.2.4.4  Compatibility —The calibration standards in the cali-
bration pipe shall be compatible with the testing equipment and
the method being used.
9 .2.5 For ﬂux leakage testing, the longitudinal calibration
reference notches shall be straight-sided notches machined in a
radial plane parallel to the pipe axis. For speciﬁed wall
thicknesses less than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], outside and inside
notches shall be used. For speciﬁed wall thicknesses equal to or
greater than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], only an outside notch shall be
used. The notch depth shall not exceed 12.5 % of the speciﬁed
wall thickness, or 0.012 in. [0.3 mm], whichever is the greater.
The notch length shall not exceed 1 in. [25 mm], and the notch
width shall not exceed the notch depth. Outside diameter and
inside diameter notches shall be located sufficiently apart to
allow separation and identiﬁcation of the signals.
9.2.6 Pipe containing one or more imperfections that pro-
duce a signal equal to or greater than the signal produced by the
calibration standard shall be rejected or the area producing the
signal shall be rejected.
9.2.6.1 Test signals produced by imperfections that cannot
be identiﬁed, or produced by cracks or crack-like imperfec-
tions, shall result in rejection of the pipe, unless it is repaired
and retested. To be accepted, the pipe shall pass the same
speciﬁcation test to which it was originally subjected and the
remaining wall thickness shall not have been decreased below
that permitted by the speciﬁcation. It shall be permissible to
reduce the outside diameter at the point of grinding by the
amount so removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  7—For pipe NPS 4 [DN 100] or smaller, the weight (mass)
tolerance is applicable to the weights (masses) of the customary lifts of
pipe as produced for shipment by the mill. For pipe larger than NPS 4 [DN
100], where individual lengths are weighed, the weight (mass) tolerance is
applicable to the individual lengths.
10.2  Diameter —For pipe NPS 1 1 ⁄ 2  [DN 40] or smaller, the
outside diameter at any point shall not vary more than  6   1 ⁄ 64  in.
[0.4 mm] from the speciﬁed outside diameter. For pipe NPS 2
[DN 50] or larger, the outside diameter shall not vary more
than  6  1 % from the speciﬁed outside diameter.
10.3  Thickness —The minimum wall thickness at any point
shall be not more than 12.5 % under the speciﬁed wall
thickness. The minimum wall thickness on inspection shall
conform to the requirements given in  Table X2.4 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11. End Finish
11.1 If ordered with plain ends, the pipe shall be furnished
to the following practice, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
11.1.1  NPS 1 1 ⁄ 2  [DN 40] or Smaller —Unless otherwise
speciﬁed in the purchase order, end ﬁnish shall be at the option
of the manufacturer.
11.1.2  Larger than NPS 1 1 ⁄ 2  [DN 40] :
11.1.2.1 Pipe of standard-weight or extra-strong weight, or
in wall thickness less than 0.500 in. [12.7 mm], other than
double extra-strong weight pipe, shall be plain-end beveled
with ends beveled to an angle of 30°, +5°, -0°, measured from
a line drawn perpendicular to the axis of the pipe, and with a
root face of   1 ⁄ 16  in.  6   1 ⁄ 32  in. [1.6 mm  6  0.8 mm].
11.1.2.2 Pipe with a speciﬁed wall thickness greater than
0.500 in. [12.7 mm], and all double extra-strong weight pipe,

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3 If ordered with couplings, one end of each length of
pipe shall be provided with a coupling manufactured in
accordance with Speciﬁcation  A 865 . The coupling threads
shall be in accordance with the gaging practice of ANSI
B1.20.1 . The coupling shall be applied handling-tight, unless
power-tight is speciﬁed in the purchase order. Couplings are to
be made of steel. Taper-tapped couplings shall be furnished on
all threaded pipe NPS 2 1 ⁄ 2  [DN 65] or larger. For pipe smaller
than NPS 2 1 ⁄ 2  [DN 65], it is regular practice to furnish
straight-tapped couplings for standard-weight pipe and taper-
tapped couplings for extra-strong and double extra-strong
weight pipe. If taper-tapped couplings are required for
standard-weight pipe smaller than NPS 2 1 ⁄ 2  [DN 65], it is
recommended that line pipe threads in accordance with API
Speciﬁcation  5B  be ordered. The taper-tapped couplings pro-
vided on line pipe in such sizes may be used on mill-threaded
standard-weight pipe of the same size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.7 The pipe shall contain no dents greater than 10 % of
the pipe diameter or   1 ⁄ 4  in. [6 mm], whichever is smaller,
measured as the gap between the lowest point of the dent and
a prolongation of the original contour of the pipe. Cold-formed
dents deeper than   1 ⁄ 8  in. [3 mm] shall be free of sharp-bottomed
gouges; it shall be permissible to remove the gouges by
grinding, provided that the remaining wall thickness is within
speciﬁed limits. The length of the dent in any direction shall
not exceed one half the speciﬁed outside diameter of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13. Number of Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1 Except as required by  13.2 , one of each of the tests
speciﬁed in Section 7 shall be made on test specimens taken
from one length of pipe from each lot of each pipe size. For
continuous-welded pipe, each lot shall contain no more than 25
tons [23 Mg] of pipe for pipe sizes NPS 1 1 ⁄ 2  [DN 40] and
smaller, and no more than 50 tons [45 Mg] of pipe for pipe
sizes larger than NPS 1 1 ⁄ 2  [DN 40]. For seamless and electric-
resistance-welded pipe, a lot shall contain no more than one
heat, and at the option of the manufacturer shall contain no
more than 500 lengths of pipe (as initially cut after the ﬁnal
pipe-forming operation, prior to any further cutting to the
required ordered lengths) or 50 tons [45 Mg] of pipe.
13.2 The number of ﬂattening tests for electric-resistance-
welded pipe shall be in accordance with  7.3.3.2  or  7.3.3.3 ,
whichever is applicable.
13.3 Except as allowed by  9.2 , each length of pipe shall be
subjected to the hydrostatic test (see Section  8 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance
12.1 The pipe manufacturer shall explore a sufficient num-
ber of visual surface imperfections to provide reasonable
assurance that they have been properly evaluated with respect
to depth.
12.2 Surface imperfections that penetrate more than 12.5 %
of the speciﬁed wall thickness or encroach on the minimum
wall thickness shall be considered defects. Pipe with defects
shall be given one or more of the following dispositions:
12.2.1 The defect shall be removed by grinding, provided
that the remaining wall thickness is within speciﬁed limits,
12.2.2 Type S pipe and the parent metal of Type E pipe,
except within
1 ⁄ 2  in. [13 mm] of the fusion line of the
electric-resistance-weld seam, are permitted to be repaired in
accordance with the welding provisions of  12.5 . Repair weld-
ing of Type F pipe and the weld seam of Type E pipe is
prohibited.
12.2.3 The section of pipe containing the defect shall be cut
off within the limits of requirement on length, or
12.2.4 Rejected.
12.3 At the purchaser’s discretion, pipe shall be subjected to
rejection if surface defects repaired in accordance with  12.2  are
not scattered, but appear over a large area in excess of what is
considered a workmanlike ﬁnish. Disposition of such pipe shall
be a matter of agreement between the manufacturer and the
purchaser.
12.4 For the removal of imperfections and defects by
grinding, a smooth curved surface shall be maintained, and the
wall thickness shall not be decreased below that permitted by
this speciﬁcation. It shall be permissible to reduce the outside
diameter at the point of grinding by the amount so removed.
12.4.1 Wall thickness measurements shall be made with a
mechanical caliper or with a properly calibrated nondestructive
testing device of appropriate accuracy. In the case of a dispute,
the measurement determined by use of the mechanical caliper
shall govern.
12.5 Weld repair shall only be permitted with the approval
of the purchaser and in accordance with Speciﬁcation  A 530/
A 530M .
12.6 The ﬁnished pipe shall be reasonably straight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14. Retests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1 Except for ﬂattening tests of electric-resistance-welded
pipe, if the results of a mechanical test for a lot fail to conform
to the applicable requirements speciﬁed in Section  7 , the lot
shall be rejected unless tests of additional pipe from the
affected lot of double the number originally tested are subse-
quently made and each such test conforms to the speciﬁed
requirements. Only one retest of any lot will be permitted. Any
individual length of pipe that conforms to the test requirements
is acceptable. Any individual length of pipe that does not
conform to the test requirements may be resubmitted for test

<<PARAGRAPH>>by dividing the total weight (mass) of zinc on the given surface
(outside or inside) by the area of the surface coated (outside or
inside).
17.3  Weight (Mass) per Unit Area of Coating Test —The
weight (mass) per unit area of zinc coating shall be determined
by stripping tests in accordance with Test Method  A 90/A 90M .
17.4  Test Specimens —Test specimens for determination of
weight (mass) per unit area of coating shall be cut approxi-
mately 4 in. [100 mm] in length.
17.5  Number of Tests —Two test specimens for the determi-
nation of weight (mass) per unit area of coating shall be taken,
one from each end of one length of galvanized pipe selected at
random from each lot of 500 lengths, or fraction thereof, of
each size.
17.6  Retests —If the weight (mass) per unit area of coating
of any lot does not conform to the requirements speciﬁed in
17.2 , retests of two additional pipes from the same lot shall be
made, each of which shall conform to the speciﬁed require-
ments.
17.7 If pipe ordered under this speciﬁcation is to be galva-
nized, the tension, ﬂattening, and bend tests shall be made on
the base material before galvanizing, if practicable. If speci-
ﬁed, results of the mechanical tests on the base material shall
be reported to the purchaser. If it is impracticable to make the
mechanical tests on the base material before galvanizing, it
shall be permissible to make such tests on galvanized samples,
and any ﬂaking or cracking of the zinc coating shall not be
considered cause for rejection. If galvanized pipe is bent or
otherwise fabricated to a degree that causes the zinc coating to
stretch or compress beyond the limit of elasticity, some ﬂaking
of the coating is acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

than extra-strong weight shall be in single-random lengths of
16 to 22 ft [4.88 to 6.71 m], with not more than 5 % of the total
number of threaded lengths furnished being jointers (two
pieces coupled together).
16.1.2 For plain-end pipe lighter than extra-strong weight, it
shall be permissible for not more than 5 % of the total number
of pipe to be in lengths of 12 to 16 ft [3.66 to 4.88 m].
16.1.3 Pipe of extra-strong weight or heavier shall be in
random lengths of 12 to 22 ft [3.66 to 6.71 m], except that it
shall be permissible for not more than 5 % of the total of pipe
to be in lengths of 6 to 12 ft [1.83 to 3.66 m].
16.1.4 For extra-strong weight or lighter pipe ordered in
double-random lengths, the minimum lengths shall be not less
than 22 ft [6.71 m] and the minimum average length for the
order shall be not less than 35 ft [10.67 m].
16.1.5 For pipe heavier than extra-strong weight ordered in
lengths longer than single random, the lengths shall be as
agreed upon between the manufacturer and the purchaser.

<<PARAGRAPH>>19. Rejection
19.1 The purchaser is permitted to inspect each length of
pipe received from the manufacturer and, if it does not meet the
requirements of this speciﬁcation based upon the inspection
and test method as outlined in the speciﬁcation, the length shall
be rejected and the manufacturer shall be notiﬁed. Disposition
of rejected pipe shall be a matter of agreement between the
manufacturer and the purchaser.
19.2 Pipe found in fabrication or in installation to be
unsuitable for the intended use, under the scope and require-
ments of this speciﬁcation, shall be set aside and the manufac-
turer notiﬁed. Such pipe shall be subject to mutual investiga-
tion as to the nature and severity of the deﬁciency and the
forming or installation, or both, conditions involved. Disposi-
tion shall be a matter for agreement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>17.1 Galvanized pipe ordered under this speciﬁcation shall
be coated with zinc inside and outside by the hot-dip process.
The zinc used for the coating shall be any grade of zinc
conforming to Speciﬁcation  B 6 .
17.2  Weight (Mass) per Unit Area of Coating —The weight
(mass) per unit area of zinc coating shall be not less than 1.8
oz/ft 2   [0.55 kg/m 2 ] as determined from the average results of
the two specimens taken for test in the manner prescribed in
17.5  and not less than 1.6 oz/ft 2   [0.49 kg/m 2 ] for each of these
specimens. The weight (mass) per unit area of coating, ex-
pressed in ounces per square foot [kilograms per square metre]
shall be calculated by dividing the total weight (mass) of zinc,
inside plus outside, by the total area, inside plus outside, of the
surface coated. Each specimen shall have not less than 1.3
oz/ft 2   [0.40 kg/m 2 ] of zinc coating on each surface, calculated<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

( 1 ) For speciﬁed wall thicknesses greater than the heaviest speciﬁed wall thickness listed in this table for the applicable speciﬁed outside diameter, the test pressure
shall be the highest value listed for the applicable speciﬁed outside diameter and grade.
( 2 ) For pipe smaller than NPS 2 [DN 50] with a speciﬁed wall thickness less than the lightest speciﬁed wall thickness listed in this table for the applicable speciﬁed outside
