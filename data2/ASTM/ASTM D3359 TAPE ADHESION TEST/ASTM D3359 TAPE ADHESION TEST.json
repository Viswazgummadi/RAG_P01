The intra- and inter-laboratory\nprecision of this test method is similar to other widely-accepted tests for coated substrates (for\nexample, Test Method D 2370 and Test Method D 4060), but this is partly the result of it being\ninsensitive to all but large differences in adhesion.

It is reasonable to state that\nat the present time no test exists that can precisely assess the actual physical strength\nof an adhesive bond. But it can also be said that it is possible to obtain an indication of\nrelative adhesion performance.\nX1.1.2  Practical adhesion test methods are generally of two types:  \u201cimplied\u201d  and\n\u201cdirect\u201d . \u201cImplied\u201d tests include indentation or scribe techniques, rub testing, and wear\ntesting. Criticism of these tests arises when they are used to quantify the strength of\nadhesive bonding. But this, in fact, is not their purpose. An \u201cimplied\u201d test should be\nused to assess coating performance under actual service conditions. \u201cDirect\u201d\nmeasurements, on the other hand, are intended expressly to measure adhesion.\nMeaningful tests of this type are highly sought after, primarily because the results are\nexpressed by a single discrete quantity, the force required to rupture the\ncoating/substrate bond under prescribed conditions.

          "content": "X1.3.1  By far the most prevalent test for evaluating coating \u201cadhesion\u201d is the tape-and-\npeel test, which has been used since the 1930\u2019s. In its simplest version a piece of\nadhesive tape is pressed against the paint film and the resistance to and degree of film\nremoval observed when the tape is pulled off. Since an intact film with appreciable\nadhesion is frequently not removed at all, the severity of the test is usually enhanced by\ncutting into the film a figure  X  or a cross hatched pattern, before applying and removing\nthe tape. Adhesion is then rated by comparing film removed against an established\nrating scale. If an intact film is peeled cleanly by the tape, or if it debonds just by cutting\ninto it without applying tape, then the adhesion is rated simply as poor or very poor, a\nmore precise evaluation of such films not being within the capability of this test.\nX1.3.2  The current widely-used version was first published in 1974; two test methods\nare covered in this standard. Both test methods are used to establish whether the\nadhesion of a coating to a substrate is at an adequate level; however they do not\ndistinguish between higher levels of adhesion for which more sophisticated methods of\nmeasurement are required. Major limitations of the tape test are its low sensitivity,\napplicabiity only to coatings of relatively low bond strengths, and non-determination of\nadhesion to the substrate where failure occurs within a single coat, as when testing\nprimers alone, or within or between coats in multicoat systems. For multicoat systems\nwhere adhesion failure may occur between or within coats, the adhesion of the coating\nsystem to the substrate is not determined.\nX1.3.3  Repeatability within one rating unit is generally observed for coatings on metals\nfor both methods, with reproducibility of one to two units. The tape test enjoys\nwidespread popularity and is viewed as \u201csimple\u201d as well as low in cost. Applied to\nmetals, it is economical to perform, lends itself to job site application, and most\nimportantly, after decades of use, people feel comfortable with it.\nX1.3.4  When a flexible adhesive tape is applied to a coated rigid substrate surface and\nthen removed, the removal process has been described in terms of the \u201cpeel\nphenomenon,\u201d as illustrated in Fig. X1.1.\nX1.3.5  Peeling begins at the \u201ctoothed\u201d leading edge (at the right) and proceeds along\nthe coating adhesive/interface or the coating/substrate interface, depending on the\nrelative bond strengths. It is assumed that coating removal occurs when the tensile\nforce generated along the latter interface, which is a function of the rheological\nproperties of the backing and adhesive layer materials, is greater than the bond strength\nat the coating-substrate interface (or cohesive strength of the coating). In actuality,\nhowever, this force is distributed over a discrete distance (O-A) in Fig. X1.1, which\nrelates directly to the properties described, not concentrated at a point (O) in Fig. X1.1\nas in the theoretical case\u2014though the tensile force is greatest at the origin for both. A\nsignificant compressive force arises from the response of the tape backing material to\nbeing stretched. Thus both tensile and compressive forces are involved in adhesion tape\ntesting.\nX1.3.6  Close scrutiny of the tape test with respect to the nature of the tape employed\nand certain aspects of the procedure itself reveal several factors, each or any\ncombination of which can dramatically affect the results of the test as discussed  (6) .",

Differences in tapes used can lead to different\nresults as small changes in backing stiffness and adhesive rheology cause large changes in the\ntension area. Some commercial tapes are manufactured to meet minimum standards. A given\nlot may surpass these standards and thus be suitable for general market distribution; however,\nsuch a lot may be a source of serious and unexpected error in assessing adhesion. One\ncommercially available tape test kit had included a tape with adhesion strength variations of up\nto 50 % claimed by the manufacturer. Also, because tapes change on storage, bond strengths of\nthe tape may change over time  (7, 8) .\nX1.5.2  While there are tapes available that appear to deliver consistent performance, a given\ntape does not adhere equally well to all coatings. For example, when the peel removal force of\nthe tape (from the coating) used earlier by Task Group D01.23.10 to establish precision of the\nmethod, by 3M No. 710 was examined with seven different electromagnetic interference/radio\nfrequency interference (EMI/RFI) coatings, it was found that, while peel was indeed consistent\nfor a given coating, the value varied by 25 % between the highest and lowest ratings among\ncoatings. Several factors that contribute to these differences include coating composition and\ntopology: as a result, no single tape is likely to be suitable for testing all coatings. Further, the\ntape test does not give an absolute value for the force required for bond rupture, but serves\nonly as an indicator that some minimum value for bond strength was met or exceeded  (7, 8) .",

          "content": "X1.6.3.1  Performance in the tape test is based on the amount of coating\nremoved compared to a descriptive scale. The exposure of the substrate can be\ndue to factors other than coating adhesion, including that arising from the\nrequirement that the coating be cut (hence the synonym\u201c cross-hatch adhesion\ntest\u201d). Justification for the cutting step is reasonable as cutting provides a free\nedge from which peeling can begin without having to overcome the cohesive\nstrength of the coating layer.\nX1.6.3.2  Cutting might be suitable for coatings applied to metal substrates, but\nfor coatings applied to plastics or wood, the process can lead to a misleading\nindication of poor adhesion due to the unique interfacial zone. For coatings on\nsoft substrates, issues include how deep should this cut penetrate, and is it\npossible to cut only to the interface?\nX1.6.3.3  In general, if adhesion test panels are examined microscopically, it is\noften clearly evident that the coating removal results from substrate failure at\nor below the interface, and not from the adhesive failure between the coating\nand the substrate. Cohesive failure within the coating film is also frequently\nobserved. However, with the tape test, failures within the substrate or coating\nlayers are rare because the tape adhesive is not usually strong enough to exceed\nthe cohesive strengths of normal substrates and organic coatings. Although\nsome rather brittle coatings may exhibit cohesive failure, the tape test adhesion\nmethod does not make provision for giving failure locality  (7, 8) .\nX1.6.4  Use of the test method in the field can lead to variation in test results due to\ntemperature and humidity changes and their effect upon tape, coating and substrate.",
