<<HEADING level=3>>Standard Test Methods for
Measuring Adhesion by Tape Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the fixed designation D 3359; the number immediately following the
designation indicates the year of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A
number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A superscript epsilon (€) indicates an
editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the Department of Defense.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1. Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1  These test methods cover procedures for assessing the adhesion of coating films to metallic
substrates by applying and removing pressure-sensitive tape over cuts made in the film.
1.2  Test Method A is primarily intended for use at job sites while Test Method B is more suitable
for use in the laboratory. Also, Test Method B is not considered suitable for films thicker than 5
mils (125μm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1—Subject to agreement between the purchaser and the seller, Test Method B can be used for
thicker films if wider spaced cuts are employed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.3  These test methods are used to establish whether the adhesion of a coating to a substrate is
at a generally adequate level. They do not distinguish between higher levels of adhesion for
which more sophisticated methods of measurement are required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2—It should be recognized that differences in adherability of the coating surface can affect the
results obtained with coatings having the same inherent adhesion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.4  In multicoat systems adhesion failure may occur between coats so that the adhesion of the
coating system to the substrate is not determined.
1.5  The values stated in inch-pound units are to be regarded as the standard. The values given in
parentheses are for information only.
1.6  This standard does not purport to address the safety concerns, if any, associated with its use.
It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health
practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3. Summary of Test Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1  Test Method A —An X-cut is made in the film to the substrate, pressure-sensitive tape is
applied over the cut and then removed, and adhesion is assessed qualitatively on the 0 to 5
scale.
3.2  Test Method B —A lattice pattern with either six or eleven cuts in each direction is made in
the film to the substrate, pressure-sensitive tape is applied over the lattice and then removed,
and adhesion is evaluated by comparison with descriptions and illustrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Significance and Use<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1  If a coating is to fulfill its function of protecting or decorating a substrate, it must adhere to it for
the expected service life. Because the substrate and its surface preparation (or lack of it) has a
drastic effect on the adhesion of coatings, a method of evaluation adhesion of a coating to different
substrates or surface treatments, or of different coatings to the same substrate and treatment, is of
considerable usefulness in the industry.
4.2  The limitations of all adhesion methods and the specific limitation of this test method to lower
levels of adhesion (see 1.3) should be recognized before using it. The intra- and inter-laboratory
precision of this test method is similar to other widely-accepted tests for coated substrates (for
example, Test Method D 2370 and Test Method D 4060), but this is partly the result of it being
insensitive to all but large differences in adhesion. The limited scale of 0 to 5 was selected
deliberately to avoid a false impression of being sensitive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>TEST METHOD A—X-CUT TAPE TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. Apparatus and Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Cutting Tool —Sharp razor blade, scalpel, knife or other cutting devices. It is of particular
importance that the cutting edges be in good condition.
5.2  Cutting Guide —Steel or other hard metal straightedge to ensure straight cuts.
5.3  Tape —One-inch (25-mm) wide semitransparent pressure-sensitive tape with an adhesion
strength agreed upon by the supplier and the user is needed7. Because of the variability in
adhesion strength from batch-to-batch and with time, it is essential that tape from the same
batch be used when tests are to be run in different laboratories. If this is not possible the test
method should be used only for ranking a series of test coatings.
5.4  Rubber Eraser , on the end of a pencil.
5.5  Illumination —A light source is helpful in determining whether the cuts have been made
through the film to the substrate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_3>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. Test Specimens<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  When this test method is used in the field, the specimen is the coated structure or article on
which the adhesion is to be evaluated.
6.2  For laboratory use apply the materials to be tested to panels of the composition and surface
conditions on which it is desired to determine the adhesion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3—Applicable test panel description and surface preparation methods are given in practice D 609
and Practices D 1730 and D 2092.
NOTE 4—Coatings should be applied in accordance with Practice D 823, or as agreed upon between the
purchaser and the seller.
NOTE 5—If desired or specified, the coated test panels may be subjected to a preliminary exposure such
as water immersion, salt spray, or high humidity before conducting the tape test. The conditions and time
of exposure will be governed by ultimate coating use or shall be agreed upon between the purchaser and
seller.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1  Select an area free of blemishes and minor surface imperfections. For tests in the field,
ensure that the surface is clean and dry. Extremes in temperature or relative humidity may
affect the adhesion of the tape or the coating.
7.2  Make two cuts in the film each about 1.5 in. (40 mm) long that intersect near their middle
with a smaller angle of between 30 and 45°. When making the incisions, use the straightedge
and cut through the coating to the substrate in one steady motion.
7.3  Inspect the incisions for reflection of light from the metal substrate to establish that the
coating film has been penetrated. If the substrate has not been reached make another X in a
different location. Do not attempt to deepen a previous cut as this may affect adhesion along
the incision.
7.4  Remove two complete laps of the pressure-sensitive tape from the roll and discard. Remove
an additional length at a steady (that is, not jerked) rate and cut a piece about 3 in. (75 mm)
long.
7.5  Place the center of the tape at the intersection of the cuts with the tape running in the same
direction as the smaller angles. Smooth the tape into place by finger in the area of the incisions
and then rub firmly with the eraser on the end of a pencil. The color under the transparent tape
is a useful indication of when good contact has been made.
7.6  Within 90 6 30 s of application, remove the tape by seizing the free end and pulling it off
rapidly (not jerked) back upon itself at as close to an angle of 180° as possible.
7.7  Inspect the X-cut area for removal of coating from the substrate or previous coating and rate
the adhesion in accordance with the following scale:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5A No peeling or removal,
4A Trace peeling or removal along incisions or at their intersection,
3A Jagged removal along incisions up to 1/16 in. (1.6 mm) on either side,
2A Jagged removal along most of incisions up to 1/8 in. (3.2 mm) on either side,
1A Removal from most of the area of the X under the tape, and
0A Removal beyond the area of the X.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_4>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8  Repeat the test in two other locations on each test panel. For large structures make
sufficient tests to ensure that the adhesion evaluation is representative of the whole surface.
7.9  After making several cuts examine the cutting edge and, if necessary, remove any flat spots
or wire-edge by abrading lightly on a fine oil stone before using again. Discard cutting tools that
develop nicks or other defects that tear the film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. Report<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  Report the number of tests, their mean and range, and for coating systems, where the
failure occurred that is, between first coat and substrate, between first and second coat, etc.
8.2  For field tests report the structure or article tested, the location and the environmental
conditions at the time of testing.
8.3  For test panels report the substrate employed, the type of coating, the method of cure, and
the environmental conditions at the time of testing.
8.4  If the adhesion strength of the tape has been determined in accordance with Test Methods
D 1000 or D 3330, report the results with the adhesion rating(s). If the adhesion strength of the
tape has not been determined, report the specific tape used and its manufacturer. 7 Permacel
99, manufactured by Permacel, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, and available from various Permacel
tape distributors, is reported to be suitable for this purpose. The manufacturer of this tape and
the manufacturer of the tape used in the interlaboratory study (see RR: D01-1008), have advised
this subcommittee that the properties of these tapes were changed. Users of it should,
therefore, check whether current material gives comparable results to previous supplied
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9. Precision and Bias 8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  In an interlaboratory study of this test method in which operators in six laboratories made
one adhesion measurement on three panels each of three coatings covering a wide range of
adhesion, the within-laboratories standard deviation was found to be 0.33 and the between-
laboratories 0.44. Based on these standard deviations, the following criteria should be used for
judging the acceptability of results at the 95 % confidence level:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1  Repeatability —Provided adhesion is uniform over a large surface, results obtained
by the same operator should be considered suspect if they differ by more than 1 rating
unit for two measurements.
9.1.2  Reproducibility —Two results, each the mean of triplicates, obtained by different
operators should be considered suspect if they differ by more than 1.5 rating units.
9.2  Bias cannot be established for these test methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>TEST METHOD B—CROSS-CUT TAPE TEST<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10. Apparatus and Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1  Cutting Tool —Sharp razor blade, scalpel, knife or other cutting device having a cutting edge
angle between 15 and 30° that will make either a single cut or several cuts at once9. It is of
particular importance that the cutting edge or edges be in good condition.
10.2  Cutting Guide —If cuts are made manually (as opposed to a mechanical apparatus) a steel
or other hard metal straightedge or template to ensure straight cuts.
10.3  Rule —Tempered steel rule graduated in 0.5 mm for measuring individual cuts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

10.5  Rubber Eraser , on the end of a pencil.
10.6  Illumination , as described in 5.5.
10.7  Magnifying Glass —An illuminated magnifier to be used while making individual cuts and
examining the test area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11. Test Specimens<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  Test specimens shall be as described in Section 6. It should be noted, however, that
multitip cutters provide good results only on test areas sufficiently plane10 that all cutting edges
contact the substrate to the same degree. Check for flatness with a straight edge such as that of
the tempered steel rule (10.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12. Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1  Where required or when agreed upon, subject the specimens to a preliminary test before
conducting the tape test (see Note 3). After drying or testing the coating, conduct the tape test
at room temperature as defined in Specification D 3924, unless D 3924 standard temperature is
required or agreed.
12.2  Select an area free of blemishes and minor surface imperfections, place on a firm base, and
under the illuminated magnifier, make parallel cuts as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.2.1 For coatings having a dry film thickness up to and including 2.0 mils (50 μm)
space the cuts 1 mm apart and make eleven cuts unless otherwise agreed upon.
12.2.2 For coatings having a dry film thickness between 2.0 mils (50 μm) and 5 mils (125
μm), space the cuts 2 mm apart and make six cuts. For films thicker than 5 mils use Test
Method A.11
12.2.3 Make all cuts about 3/4 in. (20 mm) long. Cut through the film to the substrate in
one steady motion using just sufficient pressure on the cutting tool to have the cutting
edge reach the substrate. When making successive single cuts with the aid of a guide,
place the guide on the uncut area.
12.3  After making the require cuts brush the film lightly with a soft brush or tissue to remove
any detached flakes or ribbons of coatings.
12.4  Examine the cutting edge and, if necessary, remove any flat spots or wire-edge by abrading
lightly on a fine oil stone. Make the additional number of cuts at 90° to and centered on the
original cuts.
12.5  Brush the area as before and inspect the incisions for reflection of light from the substrate.
If the metal has not been reached make another grid in a different location.
12.6 Remove two complete laps of tape and discard. Remove an additional length at a steady
(that is, not jerked) rate and cut a piece about 3 in. (75 mm) long.
12.7  Place the center of the tape over the grid and in the area of the grid smooth into place by a
finger. To ensure good contact with the film rub the tape firmly with the eraser on the end of a
pencil. The color under the tape is a useful indication of when good contact has been made.
12.8  Within 90 6 30 s of application, remove the tape by seizing the free end and rapidly (not
jerked) back upon itself at as close to an angle of 180° as possible.
12.9  Inspect the grid area for removal of coating from the substrate or from a previous coating
using the illuminated magnifier. Rate the adhesion in accordance with the following scale
illustrated in Fig. 1:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>14. Precision and Bias 8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14.1  On the basis of two interlaboratory tests of this test method in one of which operators in
six laboratories made one adhesion measurement on three panels each of three coatings
covering a wide range of adhesion and in the other operators in six laboratories made three
measurements on two panels each of four different coatings applied over two other coatings,
the pooled standard deviations for within- and between laboratories were found to be 0.37 and
0.7. Based on these standard deviations, the following criteria should be used for judging the
acceptability of results at the 95 % confidence level:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>X1. COMMENTARY<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X1.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X1.1.1  Given the complexities of the adhesion process, can adhesion be measured? As
Mittal  (1) 12 has pointed out, the answer is both yes and no. It is reasonable to state that
at the present time no test exists that can precisely assess the actual physical strength
of an adhesive bond. But it can also be said that it is possible to obtain an indication of
relative adhesion performance.
X1.1.2  Practical adhesion test methods are generally of two types:  “implied”  and
“direct” . “Implied” tests include indentation or scribe techniques, rub testing, and wear
testing. Criticism of these tests arises when they are used to quantify the strength of
adhesive bonding. But this, in fact, is not their purpose. An “implied” test should be
used to assess coating performance under actual service conditions. “Direct”
measurements, on the other hand, are intended expressly to measure adhesion.
Meaningful tests of this type are highly sought after, primarily because the results are
expressed by a single discrete quantity, the force required to rupture the
coating/substrate bond under prescribed conditions. Direct tests include the
Hesiometer and the Adherometer  (2) . Common methods which approach the direct
tests are peel, lapshear, and tensile tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X1.2 Test Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X1.2.1  In practice, numerous types of tests have been used to attempt to evaluate
adhesion by inducing bond rupture by different modes. Criteria deemed essential for a
test to warrant large-scale acceptance are: use of a straightforward and unambiguous
procedure; relevance to its intended application; repeatability and reproducibility; and
quantifiability, including a meaningful rating scale for assessing performance.
X1.2.2  Test methods used for coatings on metals are: peel adhesion or “tape testing”;
Gardner impact flexibility testing; and adhesive joint testing including shear (lap joint)
and direct tensile (butt joint) testing. These tests do not strictly meet all the criteria
listed, but an appealing aspect of these tests is that in most cases the
equipment/instrumentation is readily available or can be obtained at reasonable cost.
X1.2.3  A wide diversity of tests methods have been developed over the years that
measure aspects of adhesion  (1-5) . There generally is difficulty, however, in relating
these tests to basic adhesion phenomena.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_8>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X1.3 The Tape Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X1.3.1  By far the most prevalent test for evaluating coating “adhesion” is the tape-and-
peel test, which has been used since the 1930’s. In its simplest version a piece of
adhesive tape is pressed against the paint film and the resistance to and degree of film
removal observed when the tape is pulled off. Since an intact film with appreciable
adhesion is frequently not removed at all, the severity of the test is usually enhanced by
cutting into the film a figure  X  or a cross hatched pattern, before applying and removing
the tape. Adhesion is then rated by comparing film removed against an established
rating scale. If an intact film is peeled cleanly by the tape, or if it debonds just by cutting
into it without applying tape, then the adhesion is rated simply as poor or very poor, a
more precise evaluation of such films not being within the capability of this test.
X1.3.2  The current widely-used version was first published in 1974; two test methods
are covered in this standard. Both test methods are used to establish whether the
adhesion of a coating to a substrate is at an adequate level; however they do not
distinguish between higher levels of adhesion for which more sophisticated methods of
measurement are required. Major limitations of the tape test are its low sensitivity,
applicabiity only to coatings of relatively low bond strengths, and non-determination of
adhesion to the substrate where failure occurs within a single coat, as when testing
primers alone, or within or between coats in multicoat systems. For multicoat systems
where adhesion failure may occur between or within coats, the adhesion of the coating
system to the substrate is not determined.
X1.3.3  Repeatability within one rating unit is generally observed for coatings on metals
for both methods, with reproducibility of one to two units. The tape test enjoys
widespread popularity and is viewed as “simple” as well as low in cost. Applied to
metals, it is economical to perform, lends itself to job site application, and most
importantly, after decades of use, people feel comfortable with it.
X1.3.4  When a flexible adhesive tape is applied to a coated rigid substrate surface and
then removed, the removal process has been described in terms of the “peel
phenomenon,” as illustrated in Fig. X1.1.
X1.3.5  Peeling begins at the “toothed” leading edge (at the right) and proceeds along
the coating adhesive/interface or the coating/substrate interface, depending on the
relative bond strengths. It is assumed that coating removal occurs when the tensile
force generated along the latter interface, which is a function of the rheological
properties of the backing and adhesive layer materials, is greater than the bond strength
at the coating-substrate interface (or cohesive strength of the coating). In actuality,
however, this force is distributed over a discrete distance (O-A) in Fig. X1.1, which
relates directly to the properties described, not concentrated at a point (O) in Fig. X1.1
as in the theoretical case—though the tensile force is greatest at the origin for both. A
significant compressive force arises from the response of the tape backing material to
being stretched. Thus both tensile and compressive forces are involved in adhesion tape
testing.
X1.3.6  Close scrutiny of the tape test with respect to the nature of the tape employed
and certain aspects of the procedure itself reveal several factors, each or any
combination of which can dramatically affect the results of the test as discussed  (6) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X1.4 Peel Adhesion Testing on Plastic Substrates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X1.4.1  Tape tests have been criticized when used for substrates other than metal, such
as plastics. The central issues are that the test on plastics lacks reproducibility and does
not relate to the intended application. Both concerns are well founded: poor precision is
a direct result of several factors intrinsic to the materials employed and the procedure
itself. More importantly, in this instance the test is being applied beyond its intended
scope. These test methods were designed for relatively ductile coatings applied to metal
substrates, not for coatings (often brittle) applied to plastic parts  (7) . The unique
functional requirements of coatings on plastic substrates cause the usual tape tests to
be unsatisfactory for measuring adhesion performance in practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X1.5 The Tape Controversy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X1.5.1  With the withdrawal from commerce of the tape specified originally, 3M No. 710, current
test methods no longer identify a specific tape. Differences in tapes used can lead to different
results as small changes in backing stiffness and adhesive rheology cause large changes in the
tension area. Some commercial tapes are manufactured to meet minimum standards. A given
lot may surpass these standards and thus be suitable for general market distribution; however,
such a lot may be a source of serious and unexpected error in assessing adhesion. One
commercially available tape test kit had included a tape with adhesion strength variations of up
to 50 % claimed by the manufacturer. Also, because tapes change on storage, bond strengths of
the tape may change over time  (7, 8) .
X1.5.2  While there are tapes available that appear to deliver consistent performance, a given
tape does not adhere equally well to all coatings. For example, when the peel removal force of
the tape (from the coating) used earlier by Task Group D01.23.10 to establish precision of the
method, by 3M No. 710 was examined with seven different electromagnetic interference/radio
frequency interference (EMI/RFI) coatings, it was found that, while peel was indeed consistent
for a given coating, the value varied by 25 % between the highest and lowest ratings among
coatings. Several factors that contribute to these differences include coating composition and
topology: as a result, no single tape is likely to be suitable for testing all coatings. Further, the
tape test does not give an absolute value for the force required for bond rupture, but serves
only as an indicator that some minimum value for bond strength was met or exceeded  (7, 8) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X1.6 Procedural Problems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X1.6.1  The tape test is operator intensive. By design it was made as simple as possible to
perform, and requires a minimum of specialized equipment and materials that must meet
certain specifications. The accuracy and precision depend largely upon the skill of the operator
and the operator’s ability to perform the test in a consistent manner. Key steps that directly
reflect the importance of operator skill include the angle and rate of tape removal and the visual
assessment of the tested sample. It is not unexpected that different operators might obtain
different results  (7, 8) .
X1.6.2  Peel Angle and Rate :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The standard requires that the free end of the tape be removed rapidly at as close to a
180° angle as possible. If the peel angle and rate vary, the force required to remove the
tape can change dramatically. Nearly linear increases were observed in peel force
approaching 100 % as peel angle was changed from 135 to 180, and similar large<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>differences can be expected in peel force as peel rate varies. These effects are related as
they reflect certain rheological properties of the backing and adhesive that are
molecular in origin. Variation in pull rate and peel angle can effect large differences in
test values and must be minimized to assure reproducibility  (9) .
X1.6.3  Visual Assessment :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The final step in the test is visual assessment of the coating removed from the
specimen, which is subjective in nature, so that the coatings can vary among individuals
evaluating the same specimen  (9) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X1.6.3.1  Performance in the tape test is based on the amount of coating
removed compared to a descriptive scale. The exposure of the substrate can be
due to factors other than coating adhesion, including that arising from the
requirement that the coating be cut (hence the synonym“ cross-hatch adhesion
test”). Justification for the cutting step is reasonable as cutting provides a free
edge from which peeling can begin without having to overcome the cohesive
strength of the coating layer.
X1.6.3.2  Cutting might be suitable for coatings applied to metal substrates, but
for coatings applied to plastics or wood, the process can lead to a misleading
indication of poor adhesion due to the unique interfacial zone. For coatings on
soft substrates, issues include how deep should this cut penetrate, and is it
possible to cut only to the interface?
X1.6.3.3  In general, if adhesion test panels are examined microscopically, it is
often clearly evident that the coating removal results from substrate failure at
or below the interface, and not from the adhesive failure between the coating
and the substrate. Cohesive failure within the coating film is also frequently
observed. However, with the tape test, failures within the substrate or coating
layers are rare because the tape adhesive is not usually strong enough to exceed
the cohesive strengths of normal substrates and organic coatings. Although
some rather brittle coatings may exhibit cohesive failure, the tape test adhesion
method does not make provision for giving failure locality  (7, 8) .
X1.6.4  Use of the test method in the field can lead to variation in test results due to
temperature and humidity changes and their effect upon tape, coating and substrate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X1.7 Conclusion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X1.7.1  All the issues aside, if these test methods are used within the Scope Section and are
performed carefully, some insight into the approximate, relative level of adhesion can be
gained.<<HEADING_END>>
