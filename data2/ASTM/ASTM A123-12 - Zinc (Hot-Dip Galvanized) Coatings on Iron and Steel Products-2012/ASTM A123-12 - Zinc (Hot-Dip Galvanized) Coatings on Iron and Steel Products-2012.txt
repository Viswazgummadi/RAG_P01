<<PARAGRAPH>>inclusions are raised surfaces and are easily knocked off
through contact with lifting straps or chains, tools, ﬁxtures, or
other galvanized parts.
3.2.5  material category, n— the general class or type of
material or process of manufacture, or both, that nominally
describes a unit of product, or from which a unit of product is
made. For example, bar grating belongs to the category “strip,”
handrail belongs to the category “pipe,” etc.
3.2.6  multi-specimen article, n— a unit of product whose
surface area is greater than 160 in. 2   [100 000 mm 2 ]. For
thickness testing purposes, articles whose surface area is
greater than 160 in. 2   are subdivided into three continuous local
sections, nominally equal in surface area, each of which
constitutes a specimen. In the case of any such local section
containing more than one material category or steel thickness
range as delineated in  Table 1 , that section will contain more
than one specimen (see  Fig. 1 ).
3.2.7  sample, n— a collection of individual units of product
from a single lot selected in accordance with Section  7 , and
intended to represent that lot for acceptance. If a sample is
taken as representing the lot for acceptance, the sample shall be
taken at random from the lot without regard to the perceived
quality or appearance of any individual unit in the lot being
sampled. The sample consists of one or more test articles.
3.2.8  single-specimen article, n— a unit of product whose
surface area is equal to or less than 160 in. 2   [100 000 mm 2 ] or
that is centrifuged or otherwise similarly handled in the
galvanizing process to remove excess galvanizing bath metal
(free zinc). For thickness testing purposes, the entire surface
area of each unit of product constitutes a specimen. In the case
of any such article containing more than one material category
or steel thickness range as delineated in  Table 1 , that article
will contain more than one specimen (see  Fig. 1 ).
3.2.9  specimen, n— the surface of an individual test article
or a portion of a test article, upon which thickness measure-
ments are to be performed, which is a member of a lot, or a
member of a sample representing that lot. For magnetic
thickness measurements, specimen excludes any area of the
surface which is subject to processes (such as ﬂame cutting,
machining, threading, etc.) that can be expected to result in
surface conditions not representative of the general surface
condition of the test article, or is disqualiﬁed by the measure-
ment method. The minimum average coating thickness grade
for any specimen shall be one coating grade below that
required for the appropriate material category and thickness in
Table 1 . For a unit of product whose surface area is equal to or
less than 160 in. 2   [100 000 mm 2 ], the entire surface area of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>each test article constitutes a specimen. In the case of an article
containing more than one material category or steel thickness
range as delineated in  Table 1 , that article will contain more
than one specimen, as appropriate (see  Fig. 1 ).
3.2.10  specimen coating thickness, n— the average thickness
from no less than ﬁve test measurements on a specimen, when
each measurement location is selected to provide the widest
dispersion (in all applicable directions) of locations for the
steel category of the test article within the conﬁnes of the
specimen volume.
3.2.11  test article, n— an individual unit of product that is a
member of the sample and that is examined for conformance to
a part of this speciﬁcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Ordering Information<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1 Orders for coatings provided under this speciﬁcation
shall include the following:
4.1.1 Quantity (number of pieces to be galvanized) and total
weight.
4.1.2 Description (type and size of products) and weight.
4.1.3 ASTM speciﬁcation designation and year of issue.
4.1.4 Material identiﬁcation (see  5.1 ) and surface condition
or contamination.
4.1.5 Sampling plan, if different from  7.3 .
4.1.6 Special test requirements (see  8.1 ).
4.1.7 Special requirements (special stacking, heavier coat-
ing weight, etc.).
4.1.8 Tagging or piece identiﬁcation method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. Materials and Manufacture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1  Steel or Iron— The speciﬁcation, grade, or designation
and type and degree of surface contamination of the iron or
steel in articles to be galvanized shall be supplied by the
purchaser to the hot-dip galvanizer prior to galvanizing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  2—The presence in steels and weld metal, in certain percentages,
of some elements such as silicon, carbon, and phosphorus tends to
accelerate the growth of the zinc-iron alloy layer so that the coating may
have a matte ﬁnish with little or no outer zinc layer. The galvanizer has
only limited control over this condition. The mass, shape, and amount of
cold working of the product being galvanized may also affect this
condition. Practice  A385  provides guidance on steel selection and
discusses the effects of various elements in steel compositions (for
example, silicon), that inﬂuence coating weight and appearance.
5.2  Fabrication— The design and fabrication of the product
to be galvanized are the responsibilities of the designer and the
fabricator. Practices  A143/A143M ,  A384/A384M , and  A385
provide guidance for steel fabrication for optimum hot dip
galvanizing and shall be complied with in both design and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

6.1.1 For articles whose surface area is greater than 160 in. 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3  Castings— The composition and heat treatment of iron
and steel castings shall conform to speciﬁcations designated by
the purchaser. Some types of castings have been known to
show potential problems with predisposition to being em-
brittled during the normal thermal cycle of hot-dip galvanizing.
It is the responsibility of the purchaser to heat treat or
otherwise allow for the possibility of such embrittling phenom-
ena. The requirements for malleable iron castings to be
galvanized shall be as stated in Speciﬁcation  A47/A47M .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>[100 000 mm 2 ] (multi-specimen articles), each test article in
the sample must meet the appropriate minimum average
coating thickness grade requirements of  Table 1 , and each
specimen coating thickness grade comprising that overall
average for each test article shall average not less than one
coating grade below that required in  Table 1 .
6.1.2 For articles whose surface area is equal to or less than
160 in. 2   [100 000 mm 2 ] (single-specimen articles), the average
of all test articles in the sample must meet the appropriate
minimum average coating thickness grade requirements of
Table 1 , and for each test article, its specimen coating thickness
shall be not less than one coating grade below that required in
Table 1 .
6.1.3 No individual measurement, or cluster of measure-
ments at the same general location, on a test specimen shall be
cause for rejection under the coating thickness requirements of
this speciﬁcation provided that when those measurements are
averaged with the other dispersed measurements to determine
the specimen coating thickness grade for that specimen, the
requirements of  6.1.1  or  6.1.2 , as appropriate are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4  Zinc— The zinc used in the galvanizing bath shall
conform to Speciﬁcation  B6 , or Speciﬁcation  B960 , or both. If
a zinc alloy is used as the primary feed to the galvanizing bath,
then the base material used to make that alloy shall conform to
Speciﬁcation  B6 , or Speciﬁcation  B960 , or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5  Bath Composition— The molten metal in the working
volume of the galvanizing bath shall contain not less than an
average value of 98.0 % zinc by weight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  3—The galvanizer may choose to add trace amounts of certain
elements (for example, aluminum, nickel, and tin) to the zinc bath to help
in the processing of certain reactive steels or to enhance the cosmetic
appearance of the ﬁnished product. The use of these trace elements is
permitted provided that the bulk chemistry of the galvanizing bath is at
least 98.0 % zinc by weight. The elements can be added to the galvanizing
bath as part of a pre-alloyed zinc feed, or they can be added to the bath by
the galvanizer using a master feed alloy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  4—The coating thickness grades in  Table 1  represent the
minimum value obtainable with a high level of conﬁdence for the ranges
typically found in each material category. While most coating thicknesses
will be in excess of those values, some materials in each category may be
less reactive (for example, because of chemistry or surface condition) than
other materials of the steel category spectrum. Therefore, some articles
may have a coating grade at or close to the minimum requirement shown
in  Table 1 . In such cases, the precision and accuracy of the coating
thickness measuring technique should be taken into consideration when
rejecting such articles for coating thickness below that required by this
speciﬁcation. Purchasers desiring a guarantee of heavier coatings than the
minimum thicknesses shown herein should use the special requirements
(see  4.1.6 ) to specify coating thickness grades higher than those shown in
Table 1 . In addition, the purchaser should anticipate the need for test
batches or extra preparation steps, or both, such as blasting before
galvanizing or other methods, to attempt to reach the higher requirements
with consistency. Some higher-than-standard thicknesses may be imprac-
tical or unattainable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6. Coating Properties<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1  Coating Thickness— The average thickness of coating
for all specimens tested shall conform to the requirements of
Table 1  for the categories and thicknesses of the material being
galvanized. Minimum average thickness of coating for any
individual specimen is one coating grade less than that required
in  Table 1 . Where products consisting of various material
thicknesses or categories are galvanized, the coating thickness
grades for each thickness range and material category of
material shall be as shown in  Table 1 . In the case of orders in
SI units, the values in  Table 1 , shall be applicable as metric
units in micrometres. In the case of orders in inch-pound units,
the measured value shall be converted to coating grade units by
the use of  Table 2 . The speciﬁcation of coating thicknesses
heavier than those required by  Table 1  shall be subject to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2  Finish— The coating shall be continuous (except as
provided below), and as reasonably smooth and uniform in
thickness as the weight, size, shape of the item, and necessary<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

coating thickness which would interfere with the use of the
product, or make it dangerous to handle (edge tears or spikes),
rejection for nonuniform coating shall be made only for plainly
visible excess coating not related to design factors such as
holes, joints, or special drainage problems (see  Note 6 ). Since
surface smoothness is a relative term, minor roughness that
does not interfere with the intended use of the product, or
roughness that is related to the as-received (un-galvanized)
surface condition, steel chemistry, or steel reactivity to zinc
shall not be grounds for rejection (see  Note 7 ). Surface
conditions related to deﬁciencies related to design, detailing, or
fabrication as addressed by Practice  A385  shall not be grounds
for rejection. The zinc coating on threaded components of
articles galvanized under this speciﬁcation shall conform to
that required in Speciﬁcation  A153/A153M . Surfaces that
remain uncoated after galvanizing shall be renovated in accor-
dance with the methods in Practice  A780  unless directed by the
purchaser to leave the uncoated areas untreated for subsequent
renovation by the purchaser.
6.2.1 Each area subject to renovation shall be 1 in. [25 mm]
or less in its narrowest dimension.
6.2.2 The total area subject to renovation on each article
shall be no more than   1 ⁄ 2  of 1 % of the accessible surface area
to be coated on that article, or 36 in. 2   per short ton [256 cm 2   per

<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1—Each specimen comprises nominally one third of the total
surface area of the article. A minimum of ﬁve measurements should be
made within the volume of each specimen, as widely dispersed within that
volume as is practical, so as to represent as much as possible, the general
coating thickness within that specimen volume.
FIG. 2 Articles Made of Many Components<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  5—Inaccessible surface areas are those which cannot be reached
for appropriate surface preparation and application of repair materials as
described in Practice  A780 . Such inaccessible areas, for example, would
be the internal surfaces of certain tanks, poles, pipes, tubes, and so forth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3 The thickness of renovation shall be that required by
the thickness grade for the appropriate material category and
thickness range in  Table 1  in accordance with the requirements
of  6.1 , except that for renovation using zinc paints, the
thickness of renovation shall be 50 % higher than that required
by  Table 1 , but not greater than 4.0 mils.
6.2.4 When areas requiring renovation exceed the criteria
previously provided, or are inaccessible for repair, the coating
shall be rejected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  6—The requirements for the ﬁnish of a galvanized product
address themselves to a visual type of inspection. They do not address the
matter of measured coating thickness variations that can be encountered
because of different steels or different thicknesses of a given steel being
used in an assembly.
N OTE  7—Items which are prepared for galvanizing by abrasive cleaning
will generally develop a thicker coating with a moderately rougher
surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Threaded Components in Assemblies—  The zinc coating
on external threads shall not be subjected to a cutting, rolling,
or ﬁnishing tool operation, unless speciﬁcally authorized by the
purchaser. Internal threads are not prohibited from being
tapped or retapped after galvanizing. Coatings shall conform to
the requirements of Speciﬁcation  A153/A153M .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4  Appearance— Upon shipment from the galvanizing fa-
cility, galvanized articles shall be free from uncoated areas,

<<PARAGRAPH>>permitted. Plain holes of   1 ⁄ 2 -in. [12.5-mm] diameter or more
shall be clean and reasonably free from excess zinc. Marks in
the zinc coating caused by tongs or other items used in
handling the article during the galvanizing operation shall not
be cause for rejection unless such marks have exposed the base
metal and the bare metal areas exceed allowable maximums
from  6.2.1  and  6.2.2 . The pieces shall be handled so that after
galvanizing they will not freeze together on cooling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1  Test Requirements— The following tests shall be con-
ducted to ensure that the zinc coating is being furnished in
accordance with this speciﬁcation. The specifying of tests for
adhesion and embrittlement shall be subject to mutual agree-
ment between the galvanizer and purchaser. Visual inspection
of the coating shall be made for compliance with the require-
ments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2  Thickness of Coating Test— The thickness of coating is
determined by one or more of the three methods described as
follows.
8.2.1  Magnetic Thickness Measurements—  The thickness of
the coating shall be determined by magnetic thickness gage
measurements in accordance with Practice  E376  unless the
methods described in  8.2.2 ,  8.2.3 , or  8.2.4  are used. For each
specimen (as described in  3.2.9 ) ﬁve or more measurements
shall be made at points widely dispersed throughout the
volume occupied by the specimen so as to represent as much as
practical, the entire surface area of the test specimen. The
average of the ﬁve or more measurements thus made for each
specimen is the specimen coating thickness.
8.2.1.1 For articles whose surface area is greater than 160
in. 2   [100 000 mm 2 ] (multi-specimen articles as described in
3.2.6 ), the average of the three specimen coating thickness
grades comprising each test article is the average coating
thickness for that test article. A specimen must be evaluated for
each steel category and material thickness within the require-
ments for each specimen of the test article.
8.2.1.2 For articles whose surface area is equal to or less
than 160 in. 2
[100 000 mm 2 ] (single-specimen articles as
described in  3.2.8 ), the average of all specimen coating
thickness grades is the average coating thickness for the
sample.
8.2.1.3 In the case of threaded components, the thickness of
coating shall be made on a portion of the article that does not
include any threads.
8.2.1.4 The use of magnetic measurement methods is ap-
propriate for larger articles, and is appropriate for smaller
articles when there is sufficient ﬂat surface area for the probe
tip to sit ﬂat on the surface using Practice  E376 .
8.2.2  Stripping Method— The average weight of coating
shall be determined by stripping a test article, a specimen
removed from a test article, or group of test articles in the case
of very small items such as nails, etc., in accordance with Test
Method  A90/A90M  unless the methods described in  8.2.1 ,
8.2.3 , or  8.2.4  are used. The weight of coating per unit area
thus determined is converted to equivalent coating thickness
values in accordance with  Table 2  (rounding up or down as
appropriate). The thickness of coating thus obtained is the test
article coating thickness, or in the case of a specimen removed
from a test article, is the specimen average coating thickness.
8.2.2.1 The stripping method is a destructive test and is
appropriate for single specimen articles, but is not practical for
multi-specimen articles.
8.2.3  Weighing Before and After Galvanizing— The average
weight of coating shall be determined by weighing articles
before and after galvanizing, subtracting the ﬁrst weight from
the second and dividing the result by the surface area unless the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  8—Depending upon product design or material thickness, or both,
ﬁlming or excess zinc buildup in plain holes of less than   1 ⁄ 2 -in. [12.5-mm]
diameter may occur that requires additional work to make the holes usable
as intended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5  Adherence— The zinc coating shall withstand handling
consistent with the nature and thickness of the coating and the
normal use of the article, without peeling or ﬂaking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  9—Although some material may be formed after galvanizing, in
general the zinc coating on the articles covered by this speciﬁcation is too
heavy to permit severe bending without damaging the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7. Sampling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1 Sampling of each lot shall be performed for confor-
mance with the requirements of this speciﬁcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 A lot is a unit of production or shipment from which a
sample is taken for testing. Unless otherwise agreed upon
between the galvanizer and the purchaser, or established within
this speciﬁcation, the lot shall be as follows: For testing at a
galvanizer’s facility, a lot is one or more articles of the same
type and size comprising a single order or a single delivery
load, whichever is the smaller, or any number of articles
identiﬁed as a lot by the galvanizer, when these have been
galvanized within a single production shift and in the same
bath. For test by the purchaser after delivery, the lot consists of
the single order or the single delivery load, whichever is the
smaller, unless the lot identity, established in accordance with
the above, is maintained and clearly indicated in the shipment
by the galvanizer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3 The method of selection and number of test specimens
shall be agreed upon between the galvanizer and the purchaser.
Otherwise, the test specimens shall be selected at random from
each lot. In this case, the minimum number of specimens from
each lot shall be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Number of Pieces in Lot

20<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  10—Where a number of identical items are to be galvanized, a
statistical sampling plan may be desired. Such a plan is contained in Test
Method  B602  which addresses sampling procedures for the inspection of
electrodeposited metallic coatings and related ﬁnishes. If Test Method
B602  is used, the level of sampling shall be agreed upon between the
galvanizer and the purchaser at the time the coating order is placed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 A test specimen which fails to conform to a requirement
of this speciﬁcation shall not be used to determine the
conformance to other requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>tending to remove a portion of the coating. The adhesion shall
be considered inadequate if the coating ﬂakes off in the form of
a layer of the coating so as to expose the base metal in advance
of the knife point. Do not use testing carried out at edges or
corners (points of lowest coating adhesion) to determine
adhesion of the coating. Likewise, do not use removal of small
particles of the coating by paring or whittling to determine
failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>methods described in  8.2.1 ,  8.2.2 , or  8.2.4  are used. The ﬁrst
weight shall be determined after pickling and drying and the
second after cooling to ambient temperature. The weight of
coating per unit area thus determined is converted to equivalent
coating thickness values according to  Table 2  (rounding up or
down as appropriate). The thickness of coating thus obtained is
the test article coating thickness.
8.2.3.1 The weighing before and after method is appropriate
for single-specimen articles, but is not practical for multi-
specimen articles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4  Embrittlement— Test for embrittlement shall be made in
accordance with Practice  A143/A143M . These tests shall not
be required unless strong evidence of embrittlement is present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  11—Both the stripping method and the weighing before and after
method do not take into account the weight of iron reacted from the article
that is incorporated into the coating. Thus, the methods may underestimate
coating weight (and therefore the calculated thickness) by up to 10 %. The
accuracy of both methods will be inﬂuenced by the accuracy to which the
surface area of the articles tested can be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9. Inspection, Rejection, and Retest<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  Inspection by the Galvanizer— It is the responsibility of
the galvanizer to ensure compliance with this speciﬁcation.
This shall be achieved by an in-plant inspection program
designed to maintain the coating thickness, ﬁnish, and appear-
ance within the requirements of this speciﬁcation unless the
inspection is performed in accordance with  9.2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.4  Microscopy— The thickness of coating shall be deter-
mined by cross-sectional and optical measurement in accor-
dance with Test Method  B487  unless the methods described in
8.2.1 ,  8.2.2 , or  8.2.3  are used. The thickness thus determined is
a point value. No less than ﬁve such measurements shall be
made at locations on the test article which are as widely
dispersed as practical, so as to be representative of the whole
surface of the test article. The average of no less than ﬁve such
measurements is the specimen coating thickness.
8.2.4.1 The microscopy method is a destructive test and is
appropriate for single-specimen articles, but is not practical for
multi-specimen articles.
8.2.5  Referee Method— In the event of a dispute over
thickness of coating measurements, the dispute shall be re-
solved as follows:
8.2.5.1 For multi-specimen articles, a new sample shall be
taken randomly from the lot of material, which has twice the
number of test articles as the sample which failed to conform
to this speciﬁcation. If the lot size is such that the sample size
cannot be doubled, then the sample size shall be as previous,
but the number of widely dispersed sites at which measure-
ments were made shall be doubled, and these sites will
constitute the new sample. This new sample shall be measured
using magnetic thickness gages which have been calibrated for
accuracy against reference material thickness standards. If the
lot is found to be nonconforming by the new sample, the
galvanizer has the right to sort the lot for conforming articles
by individual test, to re-galvanize non-conforming articles, or
to renovate the nonconforming articles in accordance with  6.2 .
8.2.5.2 For single-specimen articles, a new sample shall be
taken randomly from the lot of material, which has twice the
number of test articles as the sample which failed to conform
to this speciﬁcation. The test method for the new sample shall
be selected by mutual agreement between the purchaser and
galvanizer. If the lot is found to be nonconforming by the new
sample, the galvanizer has the right to sort the lot for
conforming articles by individual test, to re-galvanize non-
conforming articles, or to renovate the nonconforming articles
in accordance with  6.2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2  Inspection By the Purchaser— The purchaser shall ac-
cept or reject material by inspection either through the galva-
nizer’s inspector, the purchaser’s inspector, or an independent
inspector. The inspector representing the purchaser shall have
access at all times to those areas of the galvanizer’s facility
which concern the application of the zinc coating to the
material ordered while work on the contract of the purchaser is
being performed. The galvanizer shall afford the inspector all
reasonable facilities to satisfy him that the zinc coating is being
furnished in accordance with this speciﬁcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3  Location— The material shall be inspected at the galva-
nizer’s plant prior to shipment. However, by agreement the
purchaser is not prohibited from making tests which govern the
acceptance or rejection of the materials in his own laboratory
or elsewhere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.4  Reinspection— When inspection of materials to deter-
mine conformity with the visual requirements of  6.2  warrants
rejection of a lot, the galvanizer is not prohibited from sorting
the lot and submit it once again for acceptance after he has
removed any nonconforming articles and replaced them with
conforming articles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.5 The sampling plan that was used when the lot was ﬁrst
inspected shall be used for resampling of a sorted lot. By
mutual agreement, the galvanizer is not prohibited from
submitting the lot remaining after sorting and removing non-
conforming articles without replacement of the nonconforming
articles. In such case, the now-smaller lot shall be treated as a
new lot for purposes of inspection and acceptance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.6 Materials that have been rejected for reasons other than
embrittlement are not prohibited from being stripped and
regalvanized and again submitted for inspection and test at
which time they shall conform to the requirements of this
speciﬁcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
