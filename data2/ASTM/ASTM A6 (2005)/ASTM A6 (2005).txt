<<PARAGRAPH>>testing or additional restrictions are required by the purchaser,
and apply only where speciﬁed individually in the purchase
order.
1.9 In case of any conﬂict in requirements, the requirements
of the applicable product speciﬁcation prevail over those of this
general requirements speciﬁcation.
1.10 Additional requirements that are speciﬁed in the pur-
chase order and accepted by the supplier are permitted,
provided that such requirements do not negate any of the
requirements of this general requirements speciﬁcation or the
applicable product speciﬁcation.
1.11 For purposes of determining conformance with this
general requirements speciﬁcation and the applicable product
speciﬁcation, values are to be rounded to the nearest unit in the
right-hand place of ﬁgures used in expressing the limiting
values in accordance with the rounding method of Practice
E 29 .
1.12 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system is to
be used independently of the other, without combining values
in any way.
1.13 This general requirements speciﬁcation and the appli-
cable product speciﬁcation are expressed in both inch-pound
units and SI units; however, unless the order speciﬁes the
applicable “M” speciﬁcation designation (SI units), the struc-
tural product is furnished to inch-pound units.
1.14 The text of this general requirements speciﬁcation
contains notes and/or footnotes that provide explanatory ma-
terial. Such notes and footnotes, excluding those in tables and
ﬁgures, do not contain any mandatory requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

3.1  Deﬁnitions of Terms Speciﬁc to This Standard:
3.1.1  Plates (other than ﬂoor plates) —Flat, hot-rolled steel,
ordered to thickness or weight [mass] and typically width and
length, commonly classiﬁed as follows:
3.1.1.1  When Ordered to Thickness :
(1)  Over 8 in. [200 mm] in width and 0.230 in. [6 mm] or
over in thickness.
(2)  Over 48 in. [1200 mm] in width and 0.180 in. [4.5 mm]
or over in thickness.
3.1.1.2  When Ordered to Weight [Mass] :
(1)  Over 8 in. [200 mm] in width and 9.392 lb/ft 2   [47.10
kg/m 2 ] or heavier.
(2)  Over 48 in. [1200 mm] in width and 7.350 lb/ft 2   [35.32
kg/m 2 ] or heavier.
3.1.1.3  Discussion —Steel products are available in various
thickness, width, and length combinations depending upon
equipment and processing capabilities of various manufactur-
ers and processors. Historic limitations of a product based upon
dimensions (thickness, width, and length) do not take into
account current production and processing capabilities. To
qualify any product to a particular product speciﬁcation re-
quires all appropriate and necessary tests be performed and that
the results meet the limits prescribed in that product speciﬁ-
cation. If the necessary tests required by a product speciﬁcation
cannot be conducted, the product cannot be qualiﬁed to that
speciﬁcation. This general requirement standard contains per-
mitted variations for the commonly available sizes. Permitted
variations for other sizes are subject to agreement between the
customer and the manufacturer or processor, whichever is
applicable.
3.1.1.4 Slabs, sheet bars, and skelp, though frequently
falling in the foregoing size ranges, are not classed as plates.
3.1.1.5 Coils are excluded from qualiﬁcation to the appli-
cable product speciﬁcation until they are decoiled, leveled or
straightened, formed (if applicable), cut to length, and, if
required, properly tested by the processor in accordance with
ASTM speciﬁcation requirements (see Sections 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 18, and 19 and the applicable product speciﬁcation).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A 6/A 6M – 05a<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2  Shapes (Flanged Sections) :
3.1.2.1  structural-size shapes —rolled ﬂanged sections hav-
ing at least one dimension of the cross section 3 in. [75 mm] or
greater.
3.1.2.2  bar-size shapes —rolled ﬂanged sections having a
maximum dimension of the cross section less than 3 in. [75
mm].
3.1.2.3  “W”
shapes —doubly-symmetric,
wide-ﬂange
shapes with inside ﬂange surfaces that are substantially paral-
lel.
3.1.2.4  “HP” shapes —are wide-ﬂange shapes generally
used as bearing piles whose ﬂanges and webs are of the same
n o minal thickness and whose depth and width are essentially
the same.
3.1.2.5  “S” shapes —doubly-symmetric beam shapes with
inside ﬂange surfaces that have a slope of approximately 16 2 ⁄ 3
%.
3.1.2.6  “M” shapes —doubly-symmetric shapes that cannot
be classiﬁed as “W,” “ S,” or “HP” shapes.
3.1.2.7  “C” shapes —channels with inside ﬂange surfaces
that have a slope of approximately 16 2 ⁄ 3  %.
3.1.2.8  “MC” shapes —channels that cannot be classiﬁed as
“C” shapes.
3.1.2.9  “L” shapes —shapes having equal-leg and unequal-
leg angles.
3.1.3  sheet piling —rolled steel sections that are capable of
being interlocked, forming a continuous wall when individual
pieces are driven side by side.
3.1.4  bars —rounds, squares, and hexagons, of all sizes; ﬂats
13 ⁄ 64  in. (0.203 in.) and over [over 5 mm] in speciﬁed thickness,
not over 6 in. [150 mm] in speciﬁed width; and ﬂats 0.230 in.
and over [over 6 mm] in speciﬁed thickness, over 6 to 8 in.
[150 to 200 mm] inclusive, in speciﬁed width.
3.1.5  exclusive —when used in relation to ranges, as for
ranges of thickness in the tables of permissible variations in
dimensions, is intended to exclude only the greater value of the
range. Thus, a range from 60 to 72 in. [1500 to 1800 mm]
exclusive includes 60 in. [1500 mm], but does not include 72
in. [1800 mm].
3.1.6  rimmed steel —steel containing sufficient oxygen to
give a continuous evolution of carbon monoxide during sol-
diﬁcation, resulting in a case or rim of metal virtually free of
voids.
3.1.7  semi-killed steel —incompletely deoxidized steel con-
taining sufficient oxygen to form enough carbon monoxide
during solidiﬁcation to offset solidiﬁcation shrinkage.
3.1.8  capped steel —rimmed steel in which the rimming
action is limited by an early capping operation. Capping is
carried out mechanically by using a heavy metal cap on a
bottle-top mold or chemically by an addition of aluminum or
ferrosilicon to the top of the molten steel in an open-top mold.
3.1.9  killed steel —steel deoxidized, either by addition of
strong deoxidizing agents or by vacuum treatment, to reduce
the oxygen content to such a level that no reaction occurs
between carbon and oxygen during solidiﬁcation.
3.1.10  mill edge —the normal edge produced by rolling
between horizontal ﬁnishing rolls. A mill edge does not<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>conform to any deﬁnite contour. Mill edge plates have two mill
edges and two trimmed edges.
3.1.11  universal mill edge —the normal edge produced by
rolling between horizontal and vertical ﬁnishing rolls. Univer-
sal mill plates, sometimes designated UM Plates, have two
universal mill edges and two trimmed edges.
3.1.12  sheared edge —the normal edge produced by shear-
ing. Sheared edge plates are trimmed on all edges.
3.1.13  gas cut edge —the edge produced by gas ﬂame
cutting.
3.1.14  special cut edge —usually the edge produced by gas
ﬂame cutting involving special practices such as pre-heating or
post-heating, or both, in order to minimize stresses, avoid
thermal cracking and reduce the hardness of the gas cut edge.
In special instances, special cut edge is used to designate an
edge produced by machining.
3.1.15  sketch —when used to describe a form of plate,
denotes a plate other than rectangular, circular, or semi-
circular. Sketch plates may be furnished to a radius or with four
or more straight sides.
3.1.16  normalizing —a heat treating process in which a steel
plate is reheated to a uniform temperature above the upper
critical temperature and then cooled in air to below the
transformation range.
3.1.17  plate-as-rolled —when used in relation to the loca-
tion and number of tests, the term refers to the unit plate rolled
from a slab or directly from an ingot. It does not refer to the
condition of the plate.
3.1.18  ﬁne grain practice —a steelmaking practice that is
intended to produce a killed steel that is capable of meeting the
requirements for ﬁne austenitic grain size.
3.1.18.1  Discussion —It normally involves the addition of
one or more austenitic grain reﬁning elements in amounts that
have been established by the steel producer as being sufficient.
Austenitic grain reﬁning elements include, but are not limited
to, aluminum, columbium, titanium, and vanadium.
3.1.19  structural product —a hot-rolled steel plate, shape,
sheet piling, or bar.
3.1.20  coil —hot-rolled steel in coiled form that is intended
to be processed into a ﬁnished structural product.
3.1.21  manufacturer —the organization that directly con-
trols the conversion of steel ingots, slabs, blooms, or billets, by
hot-rolling, into an as-rolled structural product or into coil; and
for structural products produced from as-rolled structural
products, the organization that directly controls, or is respon-
sible for, the operations involved in ﬁnishing the structural
product.
3.1.21.1  Discussion —Such ﬁnishing operations include lev-
eling or straightening, hot forming or cold forming (if appli-
cable), welding (if applicable), cutting to length, testing,
inspection, conditioning, heat treatment (if applicable), pack-
aging, marking, loading for shipment, and certiﬁcation.
3.1.22  processor —the organization that directly controls, or
is responsible for, the operations involved in the processing of
coil into a ﬁnished structural product. Such processing opera-
tions include decoiling, leveling or straightening, hot-forming
or cold-forming (if applicable), welding (if applicable), cutting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

3.1.22.1  Discussion —The processing operations need not
be done by the organization that did the hot rolling of the coil.
If only one organization is involved in the hot rolling and
processing operations, that organization is termed the  manu-
facturer  for the hot rolling operation and the  processor  for the
processing operations. If more than one organization is in-
volved in the hot rolling and processing operations, the
organization that did the hot rolling is termed the  manufacturer
and an organization that does one or more processing opera-
tions is termed a  processor .

<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  2—When no heat treatment is required, the manufacturer or
processor has the option of heat treating the structural product by
normalizing, stress relieving, or normalizing then stress relieving to meet
the applicable product speciﬁcation.
6.2 Where the heat treatment is to be performed by other
than the manufacturer, the order shall so state.
6.2.1 Where the heat treatment is to be performed by other
than the manufacturer, the structural products shall be accepted
on the basis of tests made on test specimens taken from full
thickness test coupons heat treated in accordance with the
requirements speciﬁed in the applicable product speciﬁcation
or in the purchase order. If the heat-treatment temperatures are
not speciﬁed, the manufacturer or processor shall heat treat the
test coupons under conditions he considers appropriate, pro-
vided that the purchaser is informed of the procedure followed
in heat treating the test coupons.
6.3 Where the heat treatment is to be performed by the
manufacturer or the processor, the structural product shall be

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2  Coarse Austenitic Grain Size —Where coarse austenitic
grain size is speciﬁed, one austenitic grain size test per heat
shall be made and the austenitic grain size number so deter-
mined shall be in the range of 1 to 5, inclusive.
8.3  Fine Austenitic Grain Size :
8.3.1 Where ﬁne austenitic grain size is speciﬁed, except as
allowed in  8.3.2 , one austenitic grain size test per heat shall be
made and the austenitic grain size number so determined shall
be 5 or higher.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>class, and type; and any austenitic grain reﬁning element
whose content is to be used in place of austenitic grain size
testing of the heat (see  8.3.2 ).
7.1.3 Except as allowed by  7.1.4  for primary heats, heat
analyses shall conform to the heat analysis requirements of the
applicable product speciﬁcation for the applicable grade, class,
and type.
7.1.4 Where vacuum-arc remelting or electroslag remelting
is used, a remelted heat is deﬁned as all ingots remelted from
a single primary heat. If the heat analysis of the primary heat
conforms to the heat analysis requirements of the applicable
product speciﬁcation for the applicable grade, class, and type,
the heat analysis for the remelted heat shall be determined from
one test sample taken from one remelted ingot, or the product
of one remelted ingot, from the primary heat. If the heat
analysis of the primary heat does not conform to the heat
analysis requirements of the applicable product speciﬁcation
for the applicable grade, type, and class, the heat analysis for
the remelted heat shall be determined from one test sample
taken from each remelted ingot, or the product of each
remelted ingot, from the primary heat.
7.2  Product Analysis —For each heat, the purchaser shall
have the option of analyzing representative samples taken from
the ﬁnished structural product. Sampling for chemical analysis
and methods of analysis shall be in accordance with Test
Methods, Practices, and Terminology  A 751 . The product
analyses so determined shall conform to the heat analysis
requirements of the applicable product speciﬁcation for the
applicable grade, class, and type, subject to the permitted
variations in product analysis given in Table A. If a range is
speciﬁed, the determinations of any element in a heat shall not
vary both above and below the speciﬁed range. Rimmed or
capped steel is characterized by a lack of homogeneity in its
composition, especially for the elements carbon, phosphorus,
and sulfur. Therefore, the limitations for these elements shall
not be applicable unless misapplication is clearly indicated.
7.3  Referee Analysis —For referee purposes, Test Methods,
Practices, and Terminology  A 751  shall be used.
7.4  Grade Substitution —Alloy steel grades that meet the
chemical requirements of Table 1 of Speciﬁcation  A 829  shall
not be substituted for carbon steel grades.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  3—Such austenitic grain size numbers may be achieved with
lower contents of austenitic grain reﬁning elemenst than  8.3.2  requires for
austenitic grain size testing to be waived.
8.3.2 Unless testing for ﬁne austenitic grain size is speciﬁed
in the purchase order, an austenitic grain size test need not be
made for any heat that has, by heat analysis, one or more of the
following:
8.3.2.1 A total aluminum content of 0.020 % or more.
8.3.2.2 An acid soluble aluminum content of 0.015 % or
more.
8.3.2.3 A content for an austenitic grain reﬁning element
that exceeds the minimum value agreed to by the purchaser as
being sufficient for austenitic grain size testing to be waived, or
8.3.2.4 Contents for the combination of two or more auste-
nitic grain reﬁning elements that exceed the applicable mini-
mum values agreed to by the purchaser as being sufficient for
austenitic grain size testing to be waived.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9. Quality
9.1  General —Structural products shall be free of injurious
defects and shall have a workmanlike ﬁnish.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  4—Unless otherwise speciﬁed, structural products are normally
furnished in the as-rolled condition and are subjected to visual inspection
by the manufacturer or processor. Non-injurious surface or internal
imperfections, or both, may be present in the structural product as
delivered and the structural product may require conditioning by the
purchaser to improve its appearance or in preparation for welding, coating,
or other further operations.
More restrictive requirements may be speciﬁed by invoking supplemen-
tary requirements or by agreement between the purchaser and the supplier.
Structural products that exhibit injurious defects during subsequent
fabrication are deemed not to comply with the applicable product
speciﬁcation. (See  17.2 .) Fabricators should be aware that cracks may
initiate upon bending a sheared or burned edge during the fabrication
process; this is not considered to be a fault of the steel but is rather a
function of the induced cold-work or the heat-affected zone.
The conditioning requirements in  9.2 ,  9.3 , and  9.4  limit the condition-
ing allowed to be performed by the manufacturer or processor. Condition-
ing of imperfections beyond the limits of  9.2 ,  9.3 , and  9.4  may be
performed by parties other than the manufacturer or processor at the
discretion of the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. Metallurgical Structure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1 Where austenitic grain size testing is required, such
testing shall be in accordance with Test Methods  E 112  and at
least 70 % of the grains in the area examined shall meet the
speciﬁed grain size requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.5.3.3 Except as provided in  11.5.3.4  and  11.5.3.5 , test
specimens for bars over   3 ⁄ 4  in. [20 mm] in thickness or diameter
shall conform either to the requirements for the 1 1 ⁄ 2 -in.
[40-mm] or   1 ⁄ 2 -in. [12.5-mm] wide test specimen shown in Fig.
3 of Test Methods and Deﬁnitions  A 370 , or to the require-
ments for the 0.500–in. [12.5–mm] diameter test specimen
shown in Fig. 4 of Test Methods and Deﬁnitions  A 370 .
11.5.3.4 For bars other than those to be used for pins and
rollers, the manufacturer or processor shall have the option of
using test specimens that are machined to a thickness or
diameter of at least   3 ⁄ 4  in. [20 mm] for a length of at least 9 in.
[230 mm].
11.5.3.5 Test specimens for bars to be used for pins and
rollers shall conform to the requirements shown in Fig. 4 of
Test Methods and Deﬁnitions  A 370  for the 0.500–in.
[12.5–mm] diameter test specimen.
11.6  Elongation Requirement Adjustments :
11.6.1 Due to the specimen geometry effect encountered
when using the rectangular tension test specimen for testing
thin material, adjustments in elongation requirements must be
provided for thicknesses under 0.312 in. [8 mm]. Accordingly,
the following deductions from the base elongation require-
ments shall apply:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.000 and thicker [152.50 and thicker]
3.0<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.6.4 The tensile property requirements tables in many of
the product speciﬁcations covered by this general requirements
speciﬁcation specify elongation requirements in both 8-in.
[200–mm] and 2-in. [50–mm] gage lengths. Unless otherwise
provided in the applicable product speciﬁcation, both require-
ments are not required to be applied simultaneously and the
elongation need only be determined in the gage length appro-
priate for the test specimen used. After selection of the
appropriate gage length, the elongation requirement for the
alternative gage length shall be deemed not applicable.
11.7  Yield Strength Application :
11.7.1 When test specimens do not exhibit a well-deﬁned
disproportionate yield point, yield strength shall be determined
and substituted for yield point.
11.7.2 The manufacturer or processor shall have the option
of substituting yield strength for yield point if the test specimen
exhibits a well-deﬁned disproportionate yield point.
11.7.3 Yield strength shall be determined either by the
0.2 % offset method or by the 0.5 % extension-under-load
method.
11.8  Product Tension Tests —This speciﬁcation does not
provide requirements for product tension testing subsequent to
shipment (see  15.1 ). Therefore, the requirements of  11.1  to
11.7  inclusive and Section  13  apply only for tests conducted at
the place of manufacture prior to shipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

product speciﬁcation by a manufacturer or processor does not preclude the
possibility that product tension test results might vary outside speciﬁed
ranges. The tensile properties will vary within the same heat or piece, be
it as-rolled, control-rolled, or heat-treated. Tension testing according to the
requirements of Speciﬁcation A 6/A 6M does not provide assurance that
all products of a heat will be identical in tensile properties with the
products tested. If the purchaser wishes to have more conﬁdence than that
provided by Speciﬁcation A 6/A 6M testing procedures, additional testing
or requirements, such as Supplementary Requirement S4, should be
imposed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A  Elongation deductions for thicknesses less than 0.180 in. [4.60 mm] apply to
plates and structural shapes only.
11.6.2 Due to the specimen geometry effect encountered
when using full-section test specimens for angles, the elonga-
tion requirements for structural-size angles shall be increased
by six percentage points when full-section test specimens are
used.
11.6.3 Due to the inherently lower elongation that is obtain-
able in thicker structural products, adjustments in elongation
requirements shall be provided. For structural products over
3.5 in. [90 mm] in thickness, a deduction of 0.5 percentage
point from the speciﬁed percentage of elongation in 2 in. [50
mm] shall be made for each 0.5–in. [12.5–mm] increment of
thickness over 3.5 in. [90 mm], up to a maximum deduction of
3.0 percentage points. Accordingly, the following deductions
from the base elongation requirements shall apply:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

12.1 One cubic foot of rolled steel is assumed to weigh 490
lb. One cubic metre of rolled steel is assumed to have a mass
of 7850 kg.
12.2  Plates —The permitted variations for dimensions and
weight [mass] shall not exceed the applicable limits in  Tables
1-15  [ Annex A1 , Tables A1.1 to A1.15], inclusive.
12.3  Shapes :
12.3.1  Annex A2  lists the designations and dimensions, in
both inch-pound and SI units, of shapes that are most com-
monly available. Radii of ﬁllets and toes of shape proﬁles vary
with individual manufacturers and therefore are not speciﬁed.
12.3.2 The permitted variations in dimensions shall not
exceed the applicable limits in  Tables 16-25  [ Annex A1 ,
Tables A1.16 to A1.25], inclusive. Permitted variations for
special shapes not listed in such tables shall be as agreed upon

specimen is less than that speciﬁed and any part of the fracture
is more than   3 ⁄ 4  in. [20 mm] from the center of the gage length
of a 2-in. [50-mm] specimen or is outside the middle half of the
gage length of an 8-in. [200-mm] specimen, as indicated by
scribe scratches marked on the specimen before testing, a retest
shall be allowed.
13.3 Except as provided in  13.3.1 , if the results from an
original tension specimen fails to meet the speciﬁed require-
ments, but are within 2 ksi [14 MPa] of the required tensile
strength, within 1 ksi [7 MPa] of the required yield strength or
yield point, or within 2 percentage points of the required

and contiguous to the surface of the place at each of the two adjacent wave
peaks, when the plate is resting on a ﬂat horizontal surface, as measured
in an increment of less than 4000 mm of length. The permitted variation
in waviness is a function of the permitted variation from a ﬂat surface as

<<PARAGRAPH>>X1.1
Continuous wide hot strip rolling mills are normally
equipped with coilers. Regardless of the different types of
systems employed during or following the rolling operations, it
is common for the steel to be reeled into the coiler at
temperatures in the stress-relieving range. In general, such
temperatures are higher as the steel thickness increases. The
coils subsequently cool to ambient temperature with outer and
inner laps cooling more rapidly than central laps. The differ-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ence in cooling rate can result in measurable differences in the
mechanical properties throughout a coil. Data conﬁrm reduced
yield and tensile strength with increased percent elongation for
the steel with slower cooling rates from the coiling temperature
to ambient. Such differences are in addition to the effects on
mechanical properties caused by differences in heat analysis
and chemical segregation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>X2. VARIATION OF TENSILE PROPERTIES IN PLATES AND SHAPES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>tural Plate Mechanical Properties” was published in January
2003. That survey analyzed the results of variability testing on
more modern as-rolled steels that were generally of higher
minimum yield strength steels and also compared those results
statistically to the previous surveys. 8<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.1
The tension testing requirements of Speciﬁcation
A 6/A 6M are intended only to characterize the tensile prop-
erties of a heat of steel for determination of conformance to the
requirements of the applicable product speciﬁcation. Such
testing procedures are not intended to deﬁne the upper or lower
limits of tensile properties at all possible test locations within
a heat of steel. It is well known and documented that tensile
properties will vary within a heat or individual piece of steel as
a function of chemical composition, processing, testing proce-
dure and other factors. It is, therefore, incumbent on designers
and engineers to use sound engineering judgement when using
tension test results shown on mill test reports. The testing
procedures of Speciﬁcation A 6/A 6M have been found to
provide structural products adequate for normal structural
design criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.3
Speciﬁcation A 6/A 6M contains no requirements
applicable to product tension tests; conformance to the appli-
cable product speciﬁcation is determined on the basis of tests
performed at the place of manufacture or processing prior to
shipment, unless otherwise speciﬁed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.4
A Task Group of ASTM Subcommittee A01.02 has
determined, based on review of the earlier AISI data, 7   that the
variation in tensile properties of plates and structural shapes
can be expressed as a function of speciﬁed requirements: one
standard deviation equals approximately 4 % of required ten-
sile strength, 8 % of required yield strength, and 3 percentage
points of required elongation. The January 2003 survey re-
sulted in similar ﬁndings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.2
A survey of the variation to be expected in tensile
properties obtained from plates and structural shapes was
conducted by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). 7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The results of this survey are contained in a  Contributions to
the Metallurgy of Steel entitled “The Variation of Product
Analysis and Tensile Properties—Carbon Steel Plates and
Wide Flange Shapes” (SU/18, SU/19 and SU/20), published in
September 1974. The data are presented in tables of probability
that tensile properties at other than the official location may
differ from those of the reported test location. Another survey

<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.5
Acceptance criteria for product testing based upon
these values, either below the minimum or above the maximum
allowed by the applicable product speciﬁcation, are generally
acceptable to manufacturers. Such tolerances could be consid-
ered by users of structural products as a reasonable basis for
acceptance of structural products that, due to their inherent
variability, deviate from the applicable product speciﬁcation
requirements when subjected to product tension testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>X3. WELDABILITY OF STEEL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X3.1  Weldability  is a term that usually refers to the relative
ease with which a metal can be welded using conventional
practice. Difficulties arise in steel when the cooling rates
associated with weld thermal cycles produce microstructures
(for example, martensite) that are susceptible to brittle fracture
or, more commonly, hydrogen-induced (or cold) cracking. 9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>contributions of a steel’s constituent elements (for example,
manganese, vanadium) to an equivalent amount of carbon,
which is the most signiﬁcant hardening agent. The most
popular formula is the IIW (International Institute of Welding)
equation presented in S31.2, which has been found suitable for
predicting hardenability in a wide range of commonly used
carbon-manganese and low alloy steels. 11<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(Solidiﬁcation or hot cracking is a relatively rare phenomenon
that will not be addressed here. See Randall 10   for further
information.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X3.3
It should be noted, however, that for the current
generation of low carbon (<0.10 %) low alloy steels that derive
strength from a combination of microalloys and thermal
processing methods the use of other formulae may more
accurately assess hardenability and cold cracking sensitivity. 12<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X3.2
The relative sensitivity of steels to forming cold
cracking microstructures is called hardenability and can be
measured in a number of ways. Perhaps the most popular
method of assessing this is by the carbon equivalent (CE)
formula, which attempts to equate the relative hardening<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A 6/A 6M – 05a<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>it is unnecessary to specify the use of CE limits. However, in
order to obtain a higher level of conﬁdence in avoiding cold
cracking, the chemistry controls in S31 are available. A
purchaser who speciﬁes the use of S31 should be aware that
there are several factors involved in the judicious selection of
a maximum CE value, such as the following:
X3.4.1 Actual production joint restraint/base metal thick-
ness(es),
X3.4.2 Filler metal and base metal strength compatibility,
X3.4.3 Deposited weld metal diffusible hydrogen content,
X3.4.4 Preheat and interpass temperatures,
X3.4.5 Filler metal and base metal cleanliness, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X3.4.6 Heat input.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X3.5
Though it is widely believed that low CE steels are
immune to weld cracking problems, failure to consider these
factors and others have resulted in weld or base metal HAZ
(heat affected zone) cracks in such steels. 10<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X3.6 It is important to note that carbon equivalence is only
a qualitative assessment of potential welding problems, and
should never be solely relied on to ensure weld integrity. The
proper use of welding speciﬁcations, coupled with the knowl-
edge of actual construction conditions, must also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>X4.2 The bend radius and the radius of the male die should
be as liberal as the ﬁnished part will permit. The width across
the shoulders of the female die should be at least eight times
the plate thickness. Higher strength steels require larger die
openings. The surface of the dies in the area of radius should
be smooth.
X4.2.1 Since cracks in cold bending commonly originate
from the outside edges, shear burrs and gas cut edges should be
removed by grinding. Sharp corners on edges and on punched
or gas cut holes should be removed by chamfering or grinding
to a radius.
X4.2.2 If possible, parts should be formed such that the
bend line is perpendicular to the direction of ﬁnal rolling. If it
is necessary to bend with the bend line parallel to the direction
of ﬁnal rolling, a more generous radius is suggested (1 1 ⁄ 2  times

dicular to the direction of rolling).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
