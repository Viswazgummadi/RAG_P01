These inspections, when performed to resolve controversy,
shall be conducted at the frequency speciﬁed in the quality
assurance provisions of ASME B18.2.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1  Deﬁnition— The rotational capacity test is intended to
evaluate the presence of a lubricant, the efficiency of the
lubricant, and the compatibility of assemblies as represented by
the components selected for testing.
6.3.2  Requirement— Zinc-coated bolts, zinc-coated washers,
and zinc-coated and lubricated nuts tested full size in an
assembled joint or tension measuring device, in accordance
with  10.2 , shall not show signs of failure when subjected to the
nut rotation in  Table 6 . The test shall be performed by the
responsible party (see Section  14 ) prior to shipment after zinc
coating and lubrication of nuts (see  10.2  and Note  4 ).
6.3.3  Acceptance Criterion— The bolt and nut assembly
shall be considered as non-conforming if the assembly fails to
pass any one of the following speciﬁed requirements:
6.3.3.1 Inability to install the assembly to the nut rotation in
Table 6 .
6.3.3.2 Inability to remove the nut after installing to the
rotation speciﬁed in  Table 6 .
6.3.3.3 Shear failure of the threads as determined by visual
examination of bolt and nut threads following removal.
6.3.3.4 Torsional or torsional/tension failure of the bolt.
Elongation of the bolt, in the threads between the nut and bolt
head, is to be expected at the required rotation and is not to be
classiﬁed as a failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2  Rotational Capacity— The zinc-coated bolt shall be
placed in a steel joint or tension measuring device and
assembled with a zinc-coated washer and a zinc-coated and
lubricated nut with which the bolt is intended to be used (see
Note  4 ). The nut shall have been provided with the lubricant
described in the last paragraph of the Manufacturing Processes
section of Speciﬁcation  A563 . The joint shall be one or more
ﬂat structural steel plates or ﬁxture stack up with a total
thickness, including the washer, such that 3 to 5 full threads of
the bolt are located between the bearing surfaces of the bolt
head and nut. The hole in the joint shall have the same nominal
diameter as the hole in the washer. The initial tightening of the
nut shall produce a load in the bolt not less than 10 % of the
speciﬁed proof load. After initial tightening, the nut position
shall be marked relative to the bolt, and the rotation shown in
Table 6  shall be applied. During rotation, the bolt head shall be
restrained from turning. After the tightening rotation has been
applied, the assembly shall be taken apart and examined for
compliance with  6.3.3 .
N OTE  4—Rotational capacity tests shall apply only to matched assem-
bly lots that contain one A325 bolt, one  A563  lubricated nut, and one  F436
washer that have been zinc coated in accordance with either Speciﬁcations
F2329  or  B695 . Both the bolt and nut components of the matched
assembly shall be zinc coated using the same process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3  Lot Method— All bolts shall be processed in accordance
with a lot identiﬁcation-control quality assurance plan. The
manufacturer, secondary processors, and distributors shall
identify and maintain the integrity of each production lot of
bolts from raw-material selection through all processing op-
erations and treatments to ﬁnal packing and shipment. Each lot
shall be assigned its own lot-identiﬁcation number, each lot
shall be tested, and the inspection test reports for each lot shall
be retained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.4  Lot Deﬁnition— A lot shall be a quantity of uniquely
identiﬁed heavy hex structural bolts of the same nominal size
and length produced consecutively at the initial operation from
a single mill heat of material and processed at one time, by the
same process, in the same manner so that statistical sampling is
valid. The identity of the lot and lot integrity shall be
maintained throughout all subsequent operations and packag-
ing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
