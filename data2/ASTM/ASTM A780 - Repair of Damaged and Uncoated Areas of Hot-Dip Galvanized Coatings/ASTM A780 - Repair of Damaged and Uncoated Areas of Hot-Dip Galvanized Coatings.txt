<<HEADING level=2>>Standard Practice for
Repair of Damaged and Uncoated Areas of Hot-Dip
Galvanized Coatings 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation A780/A780M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.
A superscript epsilon ( ´ ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the Department of Defense.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope*
1.1 This practice describes methods that may be used to
repair damaged hot-dip galvanized coatings on hardware,
structural shapes, and other products fabricated prior to hot-dip
galvanizing, and uncoated areas remaining after initial hot-dip
galvanizing. The damage may be the result of welding or
cutting (ﬂame), in which case the coating will be damaged
predominantly by burning. This practice can also be used to
repair hot-dip galvanized coatings damaged by excessively
rough handling during shipping or erection. Requirements
concerning the renovation of uncoated areas remaining after
initial hot-dip galvanizing are contained within the applicable
material speciﬁcation.
1.2 This practice describes the use of low melting point zinc
alloy repair rods or powders made speciﬁcally for this purpose,
the use of paints containing zinc dust, and the use of sprayed
zinc (metallizing).
1.3 The extent of repair shall be limited to an area mutually
agreeable to the contracting parties. Similarly, contracting
parties shall agree to the repair method to be used.
1.4 This speciﬁcation is applicable to orders in either
inch-pound units (as A780) or in SI units (as A780M).
Inch-pound units and SI units are not necessarily exact
equivalents. Within the text of this speciﬁcation and where
appropriate, SI units are shown in brackets. Each system shall
be used independently of the other without combining values in
any way.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.5  This standard does not purport to address the safety
problems, if any, associated with its use. It is the responsibility
of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and
health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory
limitations prior to use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2 The applied coating shall provide barrier protection
and shall preferably be anodic to steel.
4.1.3 Application of the coating material shall be possible
under shop or ﬁeld conditions.
4.2  Types —There are three types of material that possess
the required properties and may be used to repair damaged
galvanized coatings, as follows:
4.2.1  Zinc-Based Solders —Zinc alloy solders are to be used
for repairs. The most common types of solders are zinc-
cadmium, zinc-tin-lead, and zinc-tin-copper alloys. Zinc-
cadmium and zinc-tin-lead alloys have liquidus temperatures in
the ranges from 518 to 527°F (270 to 275°C) and 446 to 500°F
(230 to 260°C), respectively. (The liquidus temperature is that
temperature above which an alloy is completely molten.) The
zinc-tin-copper alloys have a liquidus temperature in the range
from 660 to 670°F (349 to 354°C), but they are applied while
in a semisolid state in the preferred application temperature
range from 480 to 570°F (250 to 300°C). The solders can be
used in rod form or as powders.  Annex A1  describes the use of
zinc-based solders.
4.2.2  Paints Containing Zinc Dust —These are usually
based on organic binders, pre-mixed and formulated speciﬁ-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cally for use on steel surfaces. Paints containing zinc dust, with
concentrations of zinc dust in the range of 65 to 69 % or above
92 % in the dried ﬁlm, are considered equally effective for the
repair of damaged galvanized coatings. The repair paint to be
used shall be selected by the galvanizer, unless the purchaser
speciﬁes a particular concentration or paint system. Corrosion
resistance and service performance are very dependent on the
properties of the paint system, the extent of surface prepara-
tion, and skills of individual applicators.  Annex A2  describes
the use of paints containing zinc dust. Speciﬁcation  D520
describes the zinc dust component of these paints.
4.2.3  Sprayed Zinc —This method involves the application
of a zinc coating by spraying the surface to be repaired with
droplets of molten metal using wire or ribbon, or powder
processes.  Annex A3  describes the use of sprayed zinc.
4.3 For further information, reference may be made to the
papers, procedures, and speciﬁcations in Refs.  ( 1 )  through  ( 4 )
(see list of references at the end of this practice).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A1. REPAIR USING ZINC-BASED ALLOYS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A1.1
Clean the surface to be reconditioned using a wire
brush, a light grinding action, or mild blasting. To ensure that
a smooth reconditioned coating can be effected, surface prepa-
ration shall extend into the surrounding, undamaged galva-
nized coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>burned. Wire brush the surface to be reconditioned during
preheating. Pre-ﬂux, if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A1.4
Rub the cleaned, preheated area with the repair stick
to deposit an evenly distributed layer of the zinc alloy. When
powdered zinc alloys are used, sprinkle the powder on the
cleaned, preheated surface and spread out with a spatula or
similar tool. The thickness of the applied coating shall be as
agreed upon between the contracting parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A1.2
If the area to be reconditioned includes welds, ﬁrst
remove all weld ﬂux residue and weld spatter (of a size that
cannot be removed by wire brushing or blast cleaning) by
mechanical means, such as chipping, grinding, or power
scaling, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A1.5
When the repair has been effected, remove ﬂux
residue by rinsing with water or wiping with a damp cloth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A1.3 Preheat the cleaned area to be reconditioned to at least
600°F (315°C). Do not overheat the surface beyond 750°F
(400°C), nor allow the surrounding galvanized coating to be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A1.6 Take thickness measurements with either a magnetic,
electromagnetic, or eddy-current gage to ensure that the
applied coating is as speciﬁed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A2. REPAIR USING PAINTS CONTAINING ZINC DUST<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A2.1 Preparation of the damaged surface will be inﬂuenced
by the type of paint selected and the anticipated service
conditions. Experience shows that in general, organic zinc-rich
systems are tolerant of marginal surface preparation. Most
organic paints containing zinc dust are not critical of climatic
or atmospheric conditions for curing. The following general
guidelines shall apply:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A2.1.1 Surfaces to be reconditioned with paints containing
zinc dust shall be clean, dry, and free of oil, grease, preexisting
paint, and corrosion by-products.
A2.1.2 Where anticipated, ﬁeld service conditions include
immersion, blast clean the surface in accordance with SSPC-
SP10/NACE No. 2 near white metal. For less critical ﬁeld
exposure conditions, clean the surface to bare metal, in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>accordance with  SSPC-SP11 , as a minimum. Where circum-
stances do not allow blast or power tool cleaning, it is
permissible to hand tool areas clean in accordance with
SSPC-SP2 . To ensure that a smooth reconditioned coating can
be effected, surface preparation shall extend into the undam-
aged galvanized coating. The method and extent of surface
preparation shall be mutually agreeable to the contracting
parties.
A2.1.3 If the area to be reconditioned includes welds, ﬁrst
remove all weld ﬂux residue and weld spatter (of a size that
cannot be removed by wire brushing or blast cleaning) by
mechanical means, such as chipping, grinding, or power
scaling, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A2.1.4 Spray or brush-apply the paints containing zinc dust
to the prepared area. Apply the paint as in accordance with the
manufacturer’s printed instructions in a single application
employing multiple passes to achieve a dry ﬁlm thickness to be
agreed upon between the contracting parties. Allow adequate
curing time before subjecting repaired items to service condi-
tions in accordance with the manufacturer’s printed instruc-
tions.
A2.1.5 Take thickness measurements with either a mag-
netic, electromagnetic, or eddy-current gage to ensure that the
applied coating is as speciﬁed in accordance with  SSPC-PA2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A3. REPAIR USING SPRAYED ZINC (METALLIZING)<<HEADING_END>>

zinc powder. Apply the sprayed coating as soon as possible
after surface preparation and before visible deterioration of the
surface has occurred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A3.2
If the area to be reconditioned includes welds, ﬁrst
remove all ﬂux residue and weld spatter of a size or type that
cannot be removed by blast cleaning by mechanical means,
that is, chipping, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A3.6 The surface of the sprayed coating shall be of uniform
texture, free of lumps, coarse areas, and loosely adherent
particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A3.3
Blast clean the surface to be reconditioned in accor-
dance with SSPC-SP5/NACE No. 1, white metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A3.7
The nominal thickness of the sprayed zinc coating
shall be previously agreed upon between the contracting
parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A3.4 To ensure that a smooth reconditioned coating can be
effected, surface preparation shall be extended into the sur-
rounding undamaged galvanized coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A3.8 Take thickness measurements with either a magnetic,
