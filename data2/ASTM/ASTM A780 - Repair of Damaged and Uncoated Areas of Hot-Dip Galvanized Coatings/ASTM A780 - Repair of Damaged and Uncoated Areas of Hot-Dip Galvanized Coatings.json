Scope*\n1.1 This practice describes methods that may be used to\nrepair damaged hot-dip galvanized coatings on hardware,\nstructural shapes, and other products fabricated prior to hot-dip\ngalvanizing, and uncoated areas remaining after initial hot-dip\ngalvanizing. The damage may be the result of welding or\ncutting (\ufb02ame), in which case the coating will be damaged\npredominantly by burning. This practice can also be used to\nrepair hot-dip galvanized coatings damaged by excessively\nrough handling during shipping or erection. Requirements\nconcerning the renovation of uncoated areas remaining after\ninitial hot-dip galvanizing are contained within the applicable\nmaterial speci\ufb01cation.\n1.2 This practice describes the use of low melting point zinc\nalloy repair rods or powders made speci\ufb01cally for this purpose,\nthe use of paints containing zinc dust, and the use of sprayed\nzinc (metallizing).\n1.3 The extent of repair shall be limited to an area mutually\nagreeable to the contracting parties. Similarly, contracting\nparties shall agree to the repair method to be used.\n1.4 This speci\ufb01cation is applicable to orders in either\ninch-pound units (as A780) or in SI units (as A780M).\nInch-pound units and SI units are not necessarily exact\nequivalents. Within the text of this speci\ufb01cation and where\nappropriate, SI units are shown in brackets. Each system shall\nbe used independently of the other without combining values in\nany way.",

The most common types of solders are zinc-\ncadmium, zinc-tin-lead, and zinc-tin-copper alloys. Zinc-\ncadmium and zinc-tin-lead alloys have liquidus temperatures in\nthe ranges from 518 to 527\u00b0F (270 to 275\u00b0C) and 446 to 500\u00b0F\n(230 to 260\u00b0C), respectively.

The\nzinc-tin-copper alloys have a liquidus temperature in the range\nfrom 660 to 670\u00b0F (349 to 354\u00b0C), but they are applied while\nin a semisolid state in the preferred application temperature\nrange from 480 to 570\u00b0F (250 to 300\u00b0C). The solders can be\nused in rod form or as powders.
