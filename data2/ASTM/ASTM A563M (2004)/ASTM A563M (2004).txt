N OTE  2—Requirements for the four classes 5, 9, 10, and 12 are
e ss entially identical with requirements given for these classes in ISO
898/II. Requirements for Classes 8S and 10S are essentially identical with
requirements in an ISO 4775 Hexagon Nuts for High-Strength Structural
Bolting with Large Width Across Flats, Product Grade B, Property Classes
8 and 10. Classes 8S3 and 10S3 are not recognized in ISO standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.2 Classes 8S3 and 10S3 nuts have atmospheric corrosion
resistance and weathering characteristics comparable to those
of the steels covered in Speciﬁcation A 588/A 588M. The
atmospheric corrosion resistance of these steels is substantially
better than that of carbon steel with or without copper addition
(see 5.2). When properly exposed to the atmosphere, these
steels can be used bare (uncoated) for many applications.
1.3 The nut size range for which each class is applicable is
given in the table on mechanical requirements.
1.4 Appendix X1 gives guidance to assist designers and
purchasers in the selection of a suitable class.
1.5 Appendix X2 gives data on the properties of slotted hex
nuts and hex jam nuts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

manufacture of the material ordered. The manufacturer shall
afford the inspector all reasonable facilities to satisfy him that
the material is being furnished in accordance with this speci-

9, 10, 12, 8S, 10S, 8S3, or 10S3) on the top or bearing surface,
on the top of ﬂange, or on one of the wrenching ﬂats of the nut.
Markings located on the top or bearing surface or on the top of
the ﬂange shall be positioned with the base of the numeral(s)
oriented toward the nut periphery. Class 9 nuts marked on one
of the wrenching ﬂats shall have the numeral 9 underlined.
13.3 Additionally, nuts of Classes 10, 12, 8S, 8S3, 10S, and
10S3 shall be marked with a symbol to identify the manufac-
turer or private label distributor, as appropriate. The manufac-
turer’s identiﬁcation symbol shall be of his design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11. Report
11.1 When speciﬁed in the order, the manufacturer shall

<<PARAGRAPH>>A  The term “bolt” includes all types of externally threaded products.
B  “Plain” applies to any bolt that is non-coated or non-plated, or that has a coating or plating of insufficient thickness to require that the nut be overtapped. “Zinc-coated”
applies to any bolt that is hot-dip or mechanically zinc-coated or otherwise coated or plated with a coating or plating of sufficient thickness to require the use of overtapped
nuts.
C  H1—ANSI B 18.2.4.1M hex nut, Style 1.
D  HH—ANSI B 18.2.4.6M heavy hex nut.
E  H2—ANSI B 18.2.4.2M hex nut, Style 2.
F  HF—ANSI B 18.2.4.4M hex ﬂange nut.
G  Recommended nut class and style.
H  Non-suitable nut.
