deformation shall indicate the tension in a tightened structural
bolt.
5.3  Heat Treatment —The process used for heat treatment of
DTIs shall be through-hardening by heating to a temperature
above the upper transformation temperature, quenching in a
liquid medium, and then retempering by reheating to a suitable
temperature to attain desired mechanical/performance proper-
ties.
5.4  Protective Coatings :
5.4.1 Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the direct tension indica-
tors shall be furnished “plain,” with the “as fabricated” surface
ﬁnish without protective coatings.

<<HEADING level=3>>X1. FIELD TESTING OF DIRECT TENSION INDICATORS FOR BOLT TENSION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>DTIs may be ﬁeld tested in a bolt tension calibrator with
bolts, nuts, and ﬂat washers, according to the provisions of the
Research Council on Structural Connections Speciﬁcation for
Structural Joints Using A 325 or A 490 Bolts to determine a job
inspection gap. The job inspection gap shall be a gap less than
the measured DTI test gap at 1.05 3  the minimum required bolt
tension.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because bolt tension calibrators are “soft” devices, unlike
hard steel connections, care should be taken to tension the bolts
with a non-impacting wrench so the tension readings can be
recorded exactly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
