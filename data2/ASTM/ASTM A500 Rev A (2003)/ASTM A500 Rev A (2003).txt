<<PARAGRAPH>>10. Flattening Test
10.1 The ﬂattening test shall be made on round structural
tubing. A ﬂattening test is not required for shaped structural
tubing.
10.2 For welded round structural tubing, a test specimen at
least 4 in. (102 mm) in length shall be ﬂattened cold between
parallel plates in three steps, with the weld located 90° from the
line of direction of force. During the ﬁrst step, which is a test
for ductility of the weld, no cracks or breaks on the inside or
outside surfaces of the test specimen shall be present until the
distance between the plates is less than two-thirds of the
speciﬁed outside diameter of the tubing. For the second step,
no cracks or breaks on the inside or outside parent metal
surfaces of the test specimen, except as provided for in 10.5,
shall be present until the distance between the plates is less
than one-half of the speciﬁed outside diameter of the tubing.
During the third step, which is a test for soundness, the
ﬂattening shall be continued until the test specimen breaks or
the opposite walls of the test specimen meet. Evidence of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Process
5.1 The steel shall be made by one or more of the following
processes: open-hearth, basic-oxygen, or electric-furnace.
5.2 When steels of different grades are sequentially strand
cast, the steel producer shall identify the resultant transition
material and remove it using an established procedure that
positively separates the grades.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. Manufacture
6.1 The tubing shall be made by a seamless or welding
process.
6.2 Welded tubing shall be made from ﬂat-rolled steel by
the electric-resistance-welding process. The longitudinal butt
joint of welded tubing shall be welded across its thickness in
such a manner that the structural design strength of the tubing
section is assured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tubing having a ratio of outside large to small ﬂat dimension in the range of 1.5 to
3.0 inclusive, the permissible variations in small ﬂat dimension shall be 1.5 times
the permissible variations in large ﬂat dimension. For rectangular tubing having a

During the second step, which is a test for soundness, the
ﬂattening shall be continued until the specimen breaks or the

unsound material that is revealed during the entire ﬂattening
test shall be cause for rejection.
10.4 Surface imperfections not found in the test specimen
before ﬂattening, but revealed during the ﬁrst step of the
ﬂattening test, shall be judged in accordance with Section 15.
10.5 When low  D -to- t  ratio tubulars are tested, because the
strain imposed due to geometry is unreasonably high on the
inside surface at the 6 and 12 o’clock locations, cracks at these
locations shall not be cause for rejection if the  D -to- t  ratio is
less than 10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.3  Length —Structural tubing is normally produced in
random lengths 5 ft (1.5 m) and over, in multiple lengths, and
in speciﬁc lengths. Refer to Section 4. When speciﬁc lengths
are ordered, the length tolerance shall be in accordance with
Table 4.
11.4  Straightness —The permissible variation for straight-
ness of structural tubing shall be   1 ⁄ 8  in. times the number of feet
(10.4 mm times the number of metres) of total length divided
by 5.
11.5  Squareness of Sides —For square and rectangular struc-
tural tubing, adjacent sides shall be square (90°), with a
permissible variation of  6 2° max.
11.6  Radius of Corners —For square and rectangular struc-
tural tubing, the radius of each outside corner of the section
shall not exceed three times the speciﬁed wall thickness.
11.7  Twist —For square and rectangular structural tubing,
the permissible variations in twist shall be as given in Table 5.
Twist shall be determined by holding one end of the tubing
down on a ﬂat surface plate, measuring the height that each
corner on the bottom side of the tubing extends above the
surface plate near the opposite ends of the tubing, and
calculating the twist (the difference in heights of such corners),
except that for heavier sections it shall be permissible to use a
suitable measuring device to determine twist. Twist measure-
ments shall not be taken within 2 in. (50.8 mm) of the ends of
the tubing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11. Permissible Variations in Dimensions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1  Outside Dimensions :
11.1.1  Round Structural Tubing —The outside diameter
shall not vary more than  6 0.5 %, rounded to the nearest 0.005
in. (0.13 mm), from the speciﬁed outside diameter for speciﬁed
outside diameters 1.900 in. (48.3 mm) and smaller, and
6 0.75 %, rounded to the nearest 0.005 in., from the speciﬁed
outside diameter for speciﬁed outside diameters 2.00 in. (50.8
mm) and larger. The outside diameter measurements shall be
made at positions at least 2 in. (50.8 mm) from the ends of the
tubing.
11.1.2  Square and Rectangular Structural Tubing —The
outside dimensions, measured across the ﬂats at positions at
least 2 in. (50.8 mm) from the ends of the tubing, shall not vary
from the speciﬁed outside dimensions by more than the
applicable amount given in Table 3, which includes an allow-
ance for convexity or concavity.
11.2  Wall Thickness —The minimum wall thickness at any
point of measurement on the tubing shall be not more than
10 % less than the speciﬁed wall thickness. The maximum wall
thickness, excluding the weld seam of welded tubing, shall be
not more than 10 % greater than the speciﬁed wall thickness.
For square and rectangular tubing, the wall thickness require-
ments shall apply only to the centers of the ﬂats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

when their depth reduces the remaining wall thickness to less
than 90 % of the speciﬁed wall thickness. It shall be permis-
sible for defects having a depth not in excess of 33 1 ⁄ 3  % of the
speciﬁed wall thickness to be repaired by welding, subject to
the following conditions:
16.2.1.1 The defect shall be completely removed by chip-
ping or grinding to sound metal,
16.2.1.2 The repair weld shall be made using a low-
hydrogen welding process, and
16.2.1.3 The projecting weld metal shall be removed to
produce a workmanlike ﬁnish.
16.2.2 Surface imperfections such as handling marks, light
die or roll marks, or shallow pits are not considered defects
provided that the imperfections are removable within the
speciﬁed limits on wall thickness. The removal of such surface
imperfections is not required. Welded tubing shall be free of
protruding metal on the outside surface of the weld seam.
16.3 Unless otherwise speciﬁed in the purchase order,
structural tubing shall be furnished with square cut ends, with
the burr held to a minimum. When so speciﬁed in the purchase

14.1
If the results of the mechanical tests representing any
lot fail to conform to the applicable requirements speciﬁed in
Sections 9 and 10, the lot shall be rejected or retested using
additional tubing of double the original number from the lot.
The lot shall be acceptable if the results of all such retests
representing the lot conform to the speciﬁed requirements.
14.2
If one or both of the retests speciﬁed in 14.1 fail to
conform to the applicable requirements speciﬁed in Sections 9

tubing received from the manufacturer and reject any tubing
that does not meet the requirements of this speciﬁcation, based
upon the inspection and test methods outlined herein. The
purchaser shall notify the manufacturer of any tubing that has
been rejected, and the disposition of such tubing shall be
subject to agreement between the manufacturer and the pur-
chaser.
17.2 It shall be permissible for the purchaser to set aside any
tubing that is found in fabrication or installation within the
scope of this speciﬁcation to be unsuitable for the intended end
use, based on the requirements of this speciﬁcation. The
purchaser shall notify the manufacturer of any tubing that has
been set aside. Such tubing shall be subject to mutual investi-
gation as to the nature and severity of the deﬁciency and the
forming or installation, or both, conditions involved. The

15.1 Tension test specimens shall conform to the applicable
requirements of Test Methods and Deﬁnitions A 370, Annex

test specimens or longitudinal strip test specimens. For welded
tubing, any longitudinal strip test specimens shall be taken
from a location at least 90° from the weld and shall be prepared
without ﬂattening in the gage length. Longitudinal strip test
specimens shall have all burrs removed. Tension test specimens
shall not contain surface imperfections that would interfere
with proper determination of the tensile properties.
15.3 The yield strength corresponding to an offset of 0.2 %
of the gage length or to a total extension under load of 0.5 %
of the gage length shall be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
