<<HEADING level=2>>Standard Test Method for
Potential Expansion of Aggregates from Hydration
Reactions 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation D 4792; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of
original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A
superscript epsilon ( e ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope
1.1 This test method covers the determination of potential
volume expansion of dense graded compacted aggregates that
contain components susceptible to hydration and consequent
volume increase, such as the free calcium and magnesium
oxides that occur in some industrial by-products.
1.2 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the
standard. The inch-pound units in parentheses are for informa-
tion purposes only.
1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica-
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. Signiﬁcance and Use
4.1 This test method provides a procedure for determining
the compliance of steel slags and other materials with speciﬁ-
cations, such as Speciﬁcation D 2940, that limit permissible
expansion of base and subbase aggregates containing compo-
nents subject to hydration.
4.2 This test method can also be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of aging or other treatments for reducing the
expansive potential of such materials.
4.3 Test results have not been correlated with ﬁeld perfor-
mance, and values obtained do not necessarily indicate expan-
sion that may occur in service conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Apparatus
5.1  Molds, Spacer Disks, Expansion Measuring Apparatus,
Stainless Steel Weights, and Dial Gages
conforming to the
requirements of Test Method D 1883.
5.2  Mixing Bowl, Straight-Edge, Scale, Filter Paper,

<<PARAGRAPH>>3. Summary of Test Method
3.1 This test method consists of measuring the volume
expansion of compacted specimens following the general
procedures of Test Method D 1883. Compaction is based on
maximum density determination using Test Methods D 698. To
accelerate the hydration reaction, specimens are stored in water
at 70  6  3°C (158  6  5°F) for a minimum of 7 days.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. Preparation of Sample
7.1 Reduce the ﬁeld sample to testing size in accordance
with Practice C 702, obtaining two 18-kg (40-lb) portions.
7.2 Pass the samples through the 19.0-mm ( 3 ⁄ 4 -in.) and
4.75-mm (No. 4) sieves. If 10 % or more is retained on the
19.0-mm ( 3 ⁄ 4 -in.) sieve proceed to 7.2.1 for oversize correction.
7.2.1 Pass the material through a 75-mm (3-in.) sieve.
Discard the material retained on the 75-mm (3-in.) sieve. The
material passing the 75-mm (3-in.) sieve and retained on the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

material passing a 19-mm ( 3 ⁄ 4 -in.) sieve and retained on a
4.75-mm (No. 4) sieve. The material for replacement shall be
taken from an unused portion of the sample.

and multiplying by 100.
10.2  Rate of Expansion —Plot the percent expansion (y-
axis) versus the time in days (x-axis).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  3—Seven days is usually adequate to evaluate probable expan-
sive behavior, with a pronounced decrease in the rate prior to this time. If
the expansion rate has not dropped by seven days, the test may be
continued to obtain additional data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. Moisture-Density Relationship
8.1 Determine the moisture-density relationship in accor-
dance with Test Method D 698, Moisture Preparation Method,
except that the mold speciﬁed in Test Method D 1883 shall be
used.
8.2 Use Method B or C depending upon the gradation of the
sample, with oversize corrections as recommended in 7.2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11. Report<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1 The report shall include the following:
11.1.1 Identiﬁcation of the sample by source and date,
11.1.2 Moisture content and percentages of material re-
tained on the 19.0 mm ( 3 ⁄ 4 -in.) and 4.75-mm (No. 4) sieves as
received,
11.1.3 Optimum moisture content, maximum density, the
method used (B or C) and oversize correction made from Test
Methods D 698,
11.1.4 Expansion data for each specimen and the average
for three specimens from 10.1,
11.1.5 The plot of the rate-of-expansion for each specimen
and the average of three from 10.2, and
11.1.6 A continuous or daily record of the temperature of
the water bath.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. Expansion Test
9.1 Prepare three expansion test specimens from the sample
set aside for this purpose, following the procedure in Test
Method D 1883 for specimens to be soaked.
9.2 After placing the adjustable stem and perforated plate on
the compacted specimens in the molds, add weights to produce
a surcharge of 4.54 kg (10 lb), and submerge the molds and
weights in water at 70  6  3°C (158  6  5°F). Allow free access
of water to the top and bottom of the specimens, and maintain
the temperature at 70  6  3°C (158  6  5°F) for the testing period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1—The molds should be well coated with a rust preventative,
such as 10W motor oil, whether they are constructed of corrosion-resistant
metal or not.
N OTE  2—Excessive (more than 2.5 cm) evaporation of the bath water
may necessitate the use of a cover over the water bath. This will reduce
required water addition and variations in bath temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12. Precision and Bias<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1 This data was obtained in a study of variability using
four and six laboratories and thus should be regarded as
preliminary.
12.1.1  Expansion of less than 0.5 % —The average multi-
laboratory coefficient of variation, when testing one specimen,
has been found to be 25 %, therefore the difference in results
reported by different laboratories on samples of the same
material should not differ by more than 71 % of their average,
nineteen times in twenty.
12.1.2  Expansion of more than 0.5 % —The average multi-
laboratory coefficient of variation, when testing one specimen,
has been found to be 18 %, therefore the difference in results
reported by different laboratories on samples of the same
material should not differ by more than 51 % of their average,
nineteen times in twenty.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 After the specimens have been immersed in the hot
water for 30 minutes to allow for thermal expansion of the test
apparatus, take the initial dial gage measurements. These are
the base readings from which the expansion will be deter-
mined.
9.4 Add heated water daily to keep the test specimens fully
submerged. Make daily dial gage readings of specimen heights
for a period of seven days, allowing at least 2 h to elapse
between the addition of water and the measurement.
9.5 Measure and record the temperature of the water on a
continuous or daily basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
