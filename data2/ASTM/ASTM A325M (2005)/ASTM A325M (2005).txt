<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  Testing Responsibility :
9.1.1 Each lot shall be tested by the manufacturer prior to
shipment in accordance with the lot identiﬁcation control
quality assurance plan in  9.2-9.5 .
9.1.2 When bolts are furnished by a source other than the
manufacturer, the Responsible Party as deﬁned in  14.1  shall be
responsible for assuring all tests have been performed and the
bolts comply with the requirements of this speciﬁcation (see
4.5 ).
9.2  Purpose of Lot Inspection —The purpose of a lot inspec-
tion program is to ensure that each lot conforms to the
requirements of this speciﬁcation. For such a plan to be fully
effective it is essential that secondary processors, distributors,
and purchasers maintain the identiﬁcation and integrity of each
lot until the product is installed.
9.3  Lot Method —All bolts shall be processed in accordance
with a lot identiﬁcation-control quality assurance plan. The
manufacturer, secondary processors, and distributors shall
identify and maintain the integrity of each production lot of
bolts from raw-material selection through all processing op-
erations and treatments to ﬁnal packing and shipment. Each lot
shall be assigned its own lot-identiﬁcation number, each lot
shall be tested, and the inspection test reports for each lot shall
be retained.
9.4  Lot Deﬁnition —A lot shall be a quantity of uniquely
identiﬁed heavy hex structural bolts of the same nominal size
and length produced consecutively at the initial operation from
a single mill heat of material and processed at one time, by the
same processor in the same manner so that statistical sampling
is valid. The identity of the lot and lot integrity shall be
maintained throughout all subsequent operations and packag-
ing.
9.5  Number of Tests —The minimum number of tests from
each lot for the tests speciﬁed below shall be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. Dimensions
7.1  Head and Body :
7.1.1 The bolts shall conform to the dimensions for metric
heavy hex structural bolts speciﬁed in ASME  B 18.2.3.7M .
7.1.2 The thread length shall not be changed except as
provided in Supplementary Requirement S1. Bolts with thread
lengths other than those required by this speciﬁcation shall be
ordered under Speciﬁcation F 568M.
7.2  Threads :
7.2.1  Uncoated —Threads shall be Metric Coarse Thread
Series as speciﬁed in ASME  B 1.13M  and shall have Grade 6g
tolerances.
7.2.2  Coated :
7.2.2.1 Unless otherwise speciﬁed, zinc-coated bolts, to be
used with zinc-coated nuts or tapped holes, which are tapped
oversize in accordance with Speciﬁcation  A 563M , shall have
6g threads before hot-dip or mechanically deposited zinc
