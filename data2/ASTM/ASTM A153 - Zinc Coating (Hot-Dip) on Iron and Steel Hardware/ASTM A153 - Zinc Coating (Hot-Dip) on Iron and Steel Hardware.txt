<<HEADING level=3>>Standard Speciﬁcation for
Zinc Coating (Hot-Dip) on Iron and Steel Hardware 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation A 153/A 153M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.
A superscript epsilon ( e ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the Department of Defense.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope*
1.1 This speciﬁcation covers zinc coatings applied by the
hot-dip process on iron and steel hardware. The hot-dip
galvanizing process consists of parts being immersed in molten
zinc for a sufficient time to allow a metallurgical reaction
between iron from the steel surface and the molten zinc,
resulting in the formation of Zn/Fe alloy layers bonding the
coating to the steel surface.
1.2 This speciﬁcation is intended to be applicable to hard-
ware items that are centrifuged or otherwise handled to remove
excess galvanizing bath metal (free zinc). Coating thickness
grade requirements reﬂect this.
1.3 This speciﬁcation is applicable to orders in either
inch-pound units (as A 153) or in SI units (as A 153M).
Inch-pound units and SI units are not necessarily exact
equivalents. Within the text of this speciﬁcation and where
appropriate, SI units are shown in brackets. Each system shall
be used independently of the other without combining values in
any way. In the case of orders in SI units, all testing and
inspection shall be done using the metric equivalent of the test
or inspection method as appropriate. In the case of orders in SI
units, such shall be stated to the galvanizer when the order is
placed.
1.4  This standard does not purport to address all of the
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica-
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A 153/A 153M – 05<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1 Minimum coating weight [mass] or minimum coating
thickness in  4.3 .
7.1.2 Finish and appearance in  5.1  and  5.2 .
7.1.3 Embrittlement in  5.3  and  5.4 .
7.1.4 Adherence in  5.5 .
7.2  Average Weight [Mass] of Coating :
7.2.1 The average weight [mass] of the zinc coating shall be
determined by weighing specimens after pickling and drying
and again after galvanizing unless the method described in
7.2.2  is used. The number of specimens that are used to
determine the average of an inspection lot shall be derived
from Section  6 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>is related to the as-received (ungalvanized) surface condition of the part,
shall not be grounds for rejection.
N OTE  3—Since this speciﬁcation is applicable to items that are centri-
fuged or otherwise handled to remove excess bath metal (see  1.2 ),
irregular coating distribution is not normally encountered. Drainage
problems, which manifest themselves as local excess coating thickness
that would interfere with function or as edge tears or spikes that present
a safety hazard because of their sharpness, are grounds for rejection under
the terms of  5.1 .
5.3 Embrittlement is a potential condition of steel that is
cold-worked, depending on such factors as the steel type
(strength level, aging characteristics), thickness, degree of cold
work, and galvanizing process. The galvanizer, the designer
and the fabricator shall take precautions against embrittlement.
The precautions to fabricate properly and prepare the material
for galvanizing to prevent embrittlement are described in
Practice  A 143 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  5—This method does not take into account the weight [mass] of
iron reacted from the article that is incorporated into the coating. It will
thus underestimate coating weight [mass] by up to approximately 10 %.
Base metal reactivity will affect the extent of underestimation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2 In the case of materials inspected after galvanizing,
the average weight [mass] of coating shall be determined by
stripping the number of specimens derived in Section  6  in
accordance with Test Method  A 90/A 90M , and averaging the
results of the individual specimens, unless the method de-
scribed in  7.2.1  is used.
7.3  Average Thickness of Coating :
7.3.1 In the case of fasteners such as bolts, nuts, and screws,
the determination of the thickness of coating shall be made on
a portion of the article that does not include any threads.
7.3.2 The average thickness of coating shall be determined
by magnetic thickness gage in accordance with Practice  E 376
unless the method described in  7.3.3  is used. The thickness
shall be measured on at least ﬁve widely separated spots on a
specimen. No individual spot measurement shall be cause for
rejection. If an individual spot does not provide a coating
thickness reading, this spot must be repaired in accordance
with  4.5 . The ﬁve or more individual coating thickness
measurements on a specimen must be averaged to determine
the specimen average coating thickness. The average coating
thickness for the inspection lot is determined by averaging the
specimen average coating thickness values for the number of
specimens derived from Section  6 .
7.3.3 The thickness of coating shall be determined by cross
section and optical measurement in accordance with Test
Method  B 487 , unless the method described in  7.3.2  is used.
The thickness thus determined is a point value. No less than
ﬁve such measurements shall be made at locations on the
specimen, which are as widely dispersed as practical, so as to
be representative of the whole surface of the specimen. The
average of no less than ﬁve such measurements is the specimen
average coating thickness. The average coating thickness for
the inspection lot is determined by averaging the specimen
average coating thickness values for the number of specimens
derived from Section  6 .
7.4  Finish and Appearance —The test for ﬁnish and appear-
ance shall be conducted through visual inspection without
additional magniﬁcation.
7.5  Embrittlement —Hardware that is susceptible to em-
brittlement shall be tested in accordance with Practice  A 143 .
The tests shall be performed through agreement between the
galvanizer and the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  4—Low service temperatures increase the risk of brittle failure of
all plain carbon steels including those which have been galvanized. This
temperature embrittling effect varies with type of steel. The expected
service temperature should thus be taken into account when selecting
steels for galvanizing.
5.4 Malleable castings shall be of such composition as will
preclude the possibility that they become embrittled by the
galvanizing process, or they shall be either cooled from the
anneal, or subsequently heat-treated so as to immunize them
against embrittlement.
5.5 The zinc coating shall adhere tenaciously to the surface
of the base metal.
5.6 If the galvanized material covered by this speciﬁcation
is bent or otherwise fabricated to the degree that causes the zinc
coatings to stretch or compress beyond the limit of elasticity,
any cracking or ﬂaking of the coating resulting from the
bending or fabricating shall not be cause for rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. Sampling
6.1 Test specimens shall be selected at random from each
inspection lot.
6.2 The method of selection and sample size shall be agreed
upon between the galvanizer and the purchaser. Otherwise, the
sample size selected from each lot shall be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

20<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3 A specimen that fails to conform to a requirement of this
speciﬁcation shall not be used to determine the conformance to
other requirements.
6.4 The method of sampling for fasteners that are required
to meet the standards of the Fastener Quality Act is described
in Guide  F 1470 . Sample quantities and deﬁnitions of termi-
nology are included in the referenced speciﬁcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A 153/A 153M – 05<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6  Adherence —Determine adherence of the zinc coating to
the surface of the base metal by cutting or prying with the point
of a stout knife, applied with considerable pressure in a manner
tending to remove a portion of the coating. The adherence shall
be considered inadequate if the coating delaminates in the form
of a layer of skin so as to expose the base metal in advance of
the knife point. Do not use testing carried out at edges or
corners (points of lowest coating adherence) to determine
adherence of coating. Likewise, do not use removal of small
particles of the coating by paring or whittling to determine
failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>tion of a lot, the galvanizer is not prohibited from sorting the
lot and submitting it once again for inspection.
9.3 The number of specimens in a sample of a lot permitted
to fail to conformance tests shall be agreed upon between the
galvanizer and the purchaser.
9.4 If a set of test specimens fails to conform to the
requirements of this speciﬁcation, two additional sets shall be
tested, both of which shall conform to the requirements in
every respect, or the lot of material represented by the
specimens shall be rejected.
9.5 Materials that have been rejected for reasons other than
embrittlement are not prohibited from being stripped, regalva-
nized, and resubmitted for test and inspection. They shall then
conform to the requirements of this speciﬁcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. Inspection
8.1 The inspector representing the purchaser shall have
access at all times while work on the contract of the purchaser
is being performed, to those areas of the manufacturer’s work
which concern the application of the zinc coating to the
material ordered. The manufacturer shall afford the inspector
all reasonable facilities to satisfy him that the zinc coating is
being furnished in accordance with this speciﬁcation. All
inspection and tests shall be made at the place of manufacture
prior to shipments, unless otherwise speciﬁed, and shall be so
conducted as not to interfere unnecessarily with the operation
of the works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10. Packaging
10.1 The supplier shall employ such methods of packaging
zinc-coated articles as shall be required to ensure their receipt
by the purchaser in satisfactory condition, with the use to be
made of the article being taken into consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11. Certiﬁcation
11.1 When speciﬁed in the purchase order or contract, the
purchaser shall be furnished certiﬁcation that samples repre-
senting each inspection lot have been either tested or inspected
as directed by this speciﬁcation and the requirements have been
met. When speciﬁed in the purchase order or contract, a report
of the test results shall be furnished.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. Rejection and Retest
9.1 For all galvanized articles except those fasteners that
must meet the requirements of the Fastener Quality Act, the
following sections are used to determine rejection and retest-
ing.
