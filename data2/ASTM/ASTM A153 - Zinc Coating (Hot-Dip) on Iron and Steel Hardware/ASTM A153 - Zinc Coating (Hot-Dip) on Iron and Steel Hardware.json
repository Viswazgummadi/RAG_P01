The hot-dip\ngalvanizing process consists of parts being immersed in molten\nzinc for a sufficient time to allow a metallurgical reaction\nbetween iron from the steel surface and the molten zinc,\nresulting in the formation of Zn/Fe alloy layers bonding the\ncoating to the steel surface.\n1.2 This speci\ufb01cation is intended to be applicable to hard-\nware items that are centrifuged or otherwise handled to remove\nexcess galvanizing bath metal (free zinc). Coating thickness\ngrade requirements re\ufb02ect this.\n1.3 This speci\ufb01cation is applicable to orders in either\ninch-pound units (as A 153) or in SI units (as A 153M).\nInch-pound units and SI units are not necessarily exact\nequivalents. Within the text of this speci\ufb01cation and where\nappropriate, SI units are shown in brackets. Each system shall\nbe used independently of the other without combining values in\nany way. In the case of orders in SI units, all testing and\ninspection shall be done using the metric equivalent of the test\nor inspection method as appropriate. In the case of orders in SI\nunits, such shall be stated to the galvanizer when the order is\nplaced.\n1.4  This standard does not purport to address all of the\nsafety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the\nresponsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-\npriate safety and health practices and determine the applica-\nbility of regulatory limitations prior to use.",
