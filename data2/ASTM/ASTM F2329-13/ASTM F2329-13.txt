<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2  Hot-Dip Zinc Coating:
7.2.1  Effect of Temperature on Mechanical Properties:
7.2.1.1 Galvanizing carried out at a temperature above
800°F [425°C] can adversely affect the ﬁnal mechanical
properties of the fasteners. Therefore, the supplier of the
fasteners submitting the product to the galvanizer shall be
aware of the tempering temperature of the fasteners relative to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A  The acceptance criterion in all cases is zero defects.
B  The sample size is the number of specimen(s) required to be tested/inspected to
the applicable criteria.
C  Frequency of coating thickness measurements: one set of specimen(s) for every
ﬁve batch lots. For test method, see  11.1 .
D  Visual inspection for conformance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>the temperature of the galvanizing bath and the potential effect
it may have on the product. When requested by the purchaser,
the average galvanizing temperature that the fasteners will be
subjected to shall be furnished.
7.2.1.2 Unless otherwise required by the product standard or
by the purchaser, testing for mechanical properties is not
necessary if the galvanizing process is carried out at a lower
temperature than the stress relief or tempering temperature of
the fasteners. If the galvanizing process is carried out at a
higher temperature than the stress relief or the tempering
temperature of the fasteners, than the purchaser shall make
provision for mechanical testing.
7.2.1.3 Threaded fasteners made from carbon or alloy steel
heat treated to a minimum speciﬁed hardness of 40 HRC, or
case hardened steel fasteners shall not be hot-dip zinc coated.
7.2.2  Effect of Hydrogen on the Mechanical Properties after
Galvanizing— Hydrogen has the potential of being introduced
into the steel during acid pickling, prior to hot-dip galvanizing.
For high strength fasteners (having a speciﬁed minimum
product hardness of 33 HRC), there is a risk of internal
hydrogen embrittlement. If required by the product standard or
by the purchaser, mechanical descaling (with or without ﬂash
pickling) or baking shall be conducted to reduce the risk of
internal hydrogen embrittlement. Baking shall be conducted
after pickling and prior to hot-dip galvanizing.
7.2.3  Effect of the Galvanizing Temperature— Externally
threaded ferrous fasteners over 1.00 in. [M24] diameter with a
speciﬁed minimum hardness of HRC 33 and higher shall not be
hot-dip zinc coated at high temperature (see deﬁnition in  3.1.4 )
in order to avoid microcracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>galvanizer shall not be held responsible for any unanticipated
distortion of parts. In addition, the purchaser shall provide
fasteners having sufficient dimensional allowance to accom-
modate the zinc thickness deposition, as required in  8.1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3  Adhesion of Zinc Coating— The zinc coating shall ad-
here tenaciously to the surface of the base metal. The method
for testing the condition of adherence is speciﬁed in  11.5 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9. Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  Appearance of Zinc Coating:
9.1.1 After hot-dip galvanizing, the fasteners shall meet the
requirements of the section on Workmanship, Finish, and
Appearance of Speciﬁcation  A153/A153M . Galvanized wash-
ers shall not be bonded to each other (See  Note 3 ). Parts may
be dull due to the presence of silicon in the steel. The dull
appearance shall not be cause for rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  3—Hot-dip washers tend to bond to each other. Suitable accep-
tance criteria shall be agreed between the purchaser and the galvanizer
before placing the order. Unless otherwise agreed to in the purchase order,
delivered galvanized washers shall not be bonded to each other.
9.1.2 The test method shall be in accordance with  11.3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2  Smoothness of Zinc Coating:
9.2.1 The zinc coating shall be smooth and reasonably
uniform
in
thickness,
as
deﬁned
in
the
section
on
Workmanship, Finish, and Appearance of Speciﬁcation  A153/
A153M . Smoothness of a surface is a relative term. Minor
roughness that does not impair the intended use of the part, or
roughness that is related to the uncoated surface condition of
the part, shall not constitute grounds for rejection of the parts.
9.2.2 The test method shall be in accordance with  11.3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>X1.1 Normally galvanizing is carried out at a bath tempera-
ture of 820°F to 900°F [435°C to 480°C]. High temperature
galvanizing is used to produce a smoother and thinner coating<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and is carried out at a bath temperature of 990°F to 1040°F
[530°C to 560°C]. The ﬁnish obtained using the high tempera-
ture process is dull.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X2. VARIATION IN COATING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.1 During galvanizing of a production lot, variation can
be experienced due to factors inherent to the galvanizing
