<<PARAGRAPH>>A The coating designation is the term by which the minimum triple spot, total both sides coating weight [mass] is speciﬁed. Because of the many variables and changing
conditions that are characteristic of continuous hot-dip coating lines, the zinc or zinc-iron alloy coating is not always evenly divided between the two surfaces of a coated
sheet; nor is it always evenly distributed from edge to edge. However, the minimum triple-spot average coating weight (mass) on any one side shall not be less than 40 %
of the single-spot requirement.
B As it is an established fact that the atmospheric corrosion resistance of zinc or zinc-iron alloy-coated sheet products is a direct function of coating thickness (weight
(mass)), the selection of thinner (lighter) coating designations will result in almost linearly reduced corrosion performance of the coating. For example, heavier galvanized
coatings perform adequately in bold atmospheric exposure whereas the lighter coatings are often further coated with paint or a similar barrier coating for increased
corrosion resistance. Because of this relationship, products carrying the statement “meets ASTM A653/A653Mrequirements” should also specify the particular coating
designation.
C International Standard, ISO 3575, continuous hot-dip zinc-coated carbon steel sheet contains Z100 and Z200 designations and does not specify a ZF75 coating.
D No minimum means that there are no established minimum requirements for triple- and single-spot tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2.2.1  Discussion —The single side relationship of either
speciﬁed “coating designation” is the same as shown in the
note of  Table 1  regarding uniformity of coating.
3.2.3  high strength low alloy steel ,  n —a speciﬁc group of
sheet steels whose strength is achieved through the use of
microalloying elements such as columbium (niobium), vana-
dium, titanium, and molybdenum resulting in improved form-
ability and weldability than is obtained from conventional
carbon-manganese steels.
3.2.3.1  Discussion —Producers use one or a combination of
microalloying elements to achieve the desired properties. The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>product is available in two designations, HSLAS and
HSLAS-F. Both products are strengthened with microalloys,
but HSLAS-F is further treated to achieve inclusion control.
3.2.4  minimized spangle ,  n —the ﬁnish produced on hot-dip
zinc-coated steel sheet in which the grain pattern is visible to
the unaided eye, and is typically smaller and less distinct than
the pattern visible on regular spangle.
3.2.4.1  Discussion —This ﬁnish is produced by one of two
methods: either  (1)  the zinc crystal growth has been started but
arrested by special production practices during solidiﬁcation of
the zinc, or  (2)  the zinc crystal growth is inhibited by a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Ordering Information
5.1 Zinc-coated or zinc-iron alloy-coated sheet in coils and
cut lengths is produced to thickness requirements expressed to
0.001 in. [0.01 mm]. The thickness of the sheet includes both
the base metal and the coating.
5.2 Orders for product to this speciﬁcation shall include the
following information, as necessary, to adequately describe the
desired product:
5.2.1 Name of product (steel sheet, zinc-coated (galvanized)
or zinc-iron alloy-coated (galvannealed)),
5.2.2 Designation of sheet [CS (Types A, B, and C), FS
(Types A and B), DDS (Types A and C), EDDS, SS, HSLAS,
HSLAS-F, SHS, or BHS].
5.2.2.1 When a CS type is not speciﬁed, CS Type B will be
furnished. When a FS type is not speciﬁed, FS Type B will be
furnished. When a DDS type is not speciﬁed, DDS Type A will
be furnished.
5.2.3 When a SS, HSLAS, HSLAS-F, SHS, or BHS desig-
nation is speciﬁed, state the grade, or class, or combination
thereof.
5.2.4 ASTM designation number and year of issue, as A653
for inch-pound units or A653M for SI units.
5.2.5 Coating designation,
5.2.6 Chemically treated or not chemically treated,
5.2.7 Oiled or not oiled,
5.2.8 Minimized spangle (if required),
5.2.9 Extra smooth (if required),
5.2.10 Phosphatized (if required),
5.2.11 Dimensions (show thickness, minimum or nominal,
width, ﬂatness requirements, and length, (if cut lengths)).
5.2.12 Coil size requirements (specify maximum outside
diameter (OD), acceptable inside diameter (ID), and maximum
weight [mass]),
5.2.13 Packaging,
5.2.14 Certiﬁcation, if required, heat analysis and mechani-
cal property report,
5.2.15 Application (part identiﬁcation and description), and
5.2.16 Special requirements (if any).
5.2.16.1 If required, the product may be ordered to a
speciﬁed base metal thickness (see Supplementary Require-
ment S1.)
5.2.16.2 If required, the product may be ordered to a
speciﬁed single spot/single side coating mass (see Supplemen-
tary Requirement S2.)
5.2.16.3 When the purchaser requires thickness tolerances
for   3 ⁄ 8 -in. [10-mm] minimum edge distance (see Supplemen-
tary Requirement in Speciﬁcation  A924/A924M ), this require-
ment shall be speciﬁed in the purchase order or contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>combination of coating-bath chemistry plus cooling during
solidiﬁcation of the zinc. Minimized spangle is normally
produced in coating designations G90 [Z275] and lighter.
3.2.5  regular spangle ,  n —the ﬁnish produced on hot-dip
zinc-coated steel sheet in which there is a visible multifaceted
zinc crystal structure.
3.2.5.1  Discussion —Solidiﬁcation of the zinc coating is
typically uncontrolled, which produces the variable grain size
associated with this ﬁnish.
3.2.6  solid-solution hardened steel or solution hardened
steel ,  n —steel sheet strengthened through additions of substi-
tutional alloying elements such as Mn, P, or Si.
3.2.6.1  Discussion —Substitutional alloying elements such
as Mn, P, and Si can occupy the same sites as iron atoms within
the crystalline structure of steels. Strengthening arises as a
result of the mismatch between the atomic sizes of these
elements and that of iron.
3.2.7  spangle-free ,  n —the uniform ﬁnish produced on hot-
dip zinc-coated steel sheet in which the visual spangle pattern,
especially the surface irregularities created by spangle forma-
tion, is not visible to the unaided eye.
3.2.7.1  Discussion —This ﬁnish is produced when the zinc
crystal growth is inhibited by a combination of coating-bath
chemistry, or cooling, or both during solidiﬁcation of the zinc.
3.2.8  zinc-iron alloy ,  n —a dull grey coating with no spangle
pattern that is produced on hot-dip zinc-coated steel sheet.
3.2.8.1  Discussion —Zinc-iron alloy coating is composed
entirely of inter-metallic alloys. It is typically produced by
subjecting the hot-dip zinc-coated steel sheet to a thermal
treatment after it emerges from the molten zinc bath. This type
of coating is suitable for immediate painting without further
treatment except normal cleaning (refer to Guide  D7396 ). The
lack of ductility of the alloy coating presents a potential for
powdering, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A Where an ellipsis (. . .) appears in this table there is no requirement.
B For sheet thickness of 0.028 in. [0.71 mm] or thinner, the elongation requirement is reduced two percentage points for SS Grades 60 [410] and 70 [480].
C For sheet thickness of 0.028 in. [0.71 mm] or thinner, no tension test is required if the hardness result in Rockwell B85 or higher.
D As there is no discontinuous yield curve, the yield strength should be taken as the stress at 0.5 % elongation under load or 0.2 % offset.
E SS Grade 80 [550] Class 2 may exhibit different forming characteristics than Class 1, due to difference in chemistry.
F The purchaser should consult with the producer when ordering SS Grade 80 [550] Class 3 material in sheet thicknesses 0.028 in. [0.71 mm] or thinner regarding
elongation and tension test requirements.
G If a higher tensile strength is required, the user should consult the producer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.4.1 1.00 oz/ft 2   coating weight = 305 g/m 2   coating mass.
8.2  Coating Weight [Mass] Tests :
8.2.1 Coating weight [mass] tests shall be performed in
accordance with the requirements of Speciﬁcation  A924/
A924M .
8.2.2 The referee method to be used shall be Test Method
A90/A90M .
8.3  Coating Bend Test :
8.3.1 The bend test specimens of coated sheet designated by
preﬁx “G” [“Z”] shall be capable of being bent through 180° in
any direction without ﬂaking of the coating on the outside of
the bend only. The coating bend test inside diameter shall have
a relation to the thickness of the specimen as shown in  Table 6 .
Flaking of the coating within 0.25 in. [6 mm] of the edge of the
bend specimen shall not be cause for rejection.
8.3.2 Because of the characteristics of zinc-iron alloy coat-
ings designated by preﬁx “A” [“ZF”] as explained in the
Discussion following  3.2.8 , coating bend tests are not appli-
cable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 The typical mechanical properties for CS (Types A, B,
and C), FS (Types A and B), DDS (Types A and C), and EDDS
sheet designations are listed in  Table 5 . These mechanical
property values are nonmandatory. They are intended solely to
provide the purchaser with as much information as possible to
make an informed decision on the steel to be speciﬁed. Values
outside of these ranges are to be expected.
7.3 When base metal mechanical properties are required, all
tests shall be conducted in accordance with the methods
speciﬁed in Speciﬁcation  A924/A924M .
7.4  Bending Properties Minimum Cold Bending Radii —
Structural steel and high-strength low-alloy steel are com-
monly fabricated by cold bending. There are many interrelated
factors that affect the ability of a steel to cold form over a given
radius under shop conditions. These factors include thickness,
strength level, degree of restraint, relationship to rolling
direction, chemistry, and base metal microstructure. The table
in  Appendix X1  lists the suggested minimum inside radius for
90° cold bending for structural steel and high-strength low-
alloy steel. They presuppose “hard way” bending (bend axis
parallel to rolling direction) and reasonably good shop forming
practices. Where possible, the use of larger radii or “easy way”
bends are recommended for improved performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9. Retests and Disposition of Non-Conforming Material<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1 Retests, conducted in accordance with the requirements
of the section on Retests and Disposition of Non-Conforming
Material of Speciﬁcation  A924/A924M , are permitted when an
unsatisfactory test result is suspected to be the consequence of
the test method procedure.
9.2 Disposition of non-conforming material shall be subject
to the requirements of 13.2 of Speciﬁcation  A924/A924M .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. Coating Properties
8.1  Coating Weight [Mass] :
8.1.1 Coating weight [mass] shall conform to the require-
ments as shown in  Table 1  for the speciﬁc coating designation,
or
8.1.2 If required, the coating mass shall conform to the
requirements as shown in  Table S2.1  for the speciﬁc single
spot/single side coating mass designation (single spot/single
side designations are available only in SI units).
8.1.3 Use the following relationships to estimate the coating
thickness from the coating weight [mass]:
8.1.3.1 1.00 oz/ft 2   coating weight = 1.68 mils coating
thickness, and
8.1.3.2 7.14 g/m 2   coating mass = 1.00 µm coating thickness.
8.1.4 Use the following relationship to convert coating
weight to coating mass:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A The typical mechanical property values presented here are nonmandatory. They are intended solely to provide the purchaser with as much information as possible to
make an informed decision on the steel to be speciﬁed. Values outside of these ranges are to be expected. The purchaser may negotiate with the supplier if a speciﬁc
range or a more restrictive range is required for the application.
B These typical mechanical properties apply to the full range of steel sheet thicknesses. The yield strength tends to increase and some of the formability values tend to
decrease as the sheet thickness decreases.

<<PARAGRAPH>>A The coating designation is the term by which the minimum single spot/single side coating mass is speciﬁed for each side.
B As it is an established fact that the atmospheric corrosion resistance of zinc or zinc-iron alloy-coated sheet products is a direct function of coating thickness (mass),
the selection of thinner (lighter) coating designations will result in almost linearly reduced corrosion performance of the coating. For example, heavier galvanized coatings
perform adequately in bold atmospheric exposure whereas the lighter coatings are often further coated with paint or a similar barrier coating for increased corrosion
resistance. Because of this relationship, products carrying the statement “meets ASTM A653/A653Mrequirements” should also specify the particular coating designation.
C Ordering to single spot/single side spot coating weight designations allows for the possibility of receiving product with a higher average total coating mass on both
surfaces than what might be expected on assumed equivalent product coated to the total both sides requirement of  Table 1 . The user should be aware that this may result
in issues during forming and spot welding.
D It is permissible to order Coating Designation 100G as 98G. Historically, the conversion from 0.32 oz/ft 2  to g/m 2  resulted in a value of 98 g/m 2  which was subsequently
rounded to 100 g/m 2 . Both SI designations have the same limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A1.1 Determination of Bake Hardening Index
A1.1.1 The bake hardening index (BHI) is determined by a
two-step procedure using a standard longitudinal (rolling
direction) tensile-test specimen, prepared in accordance with
Test Methods  A370 . The test specimen is ﬁrst strained in
tension. The magnitude of this tensile “pre-strain” shall be 2 %
(extension under load). The test specimen is then removed
from the test machine and baked at a temperature of 340°F
[170°C] for a period of 20 minutes. Referring to  Fig. A1.1 , the
bake hardening index (BHI) of the material is calculated as
follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A1.1.2 The original test specimen cross section (width and
thickness) is used in the calculation of all engineering strengths
in this test.
A1.1.3 The pre-straining of 2 % in tension is intended to
simulate a modest degree of forming strain, while the subse-
quent baking is intended to simulate a paint-curing or similar
treatment. In the production of actual parts, forming strains and
baking treatments can differ from those employed here and, as
a result, ﬁnal properties can differ from the values obtained
under these controlled conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>X2. RATIONALE FOR CHANGES IN PRODUCT DESIGNATIONS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.1
Subcommittee A05.11 has revised the designations
used to classify the various products available in each hot-dip
coated speciﬁcation. The previous “quality” designations have
been replaced with designations and descriptions more closely
related with product characteristics. Many of the former
“quality” speciﬁcations described the steel only in terms of
limited chemical composition, which in some cases was
identical for two or more qualities. The former designations
also did not reﬂect the availability of new steels which are the
result of the use of new technologies such as vacuum degassing
and steel ladle treatments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>mechanical properties included in the new designation system
are those indicated by the tension test. These properties are
more predictive of steel formability than other tests such as the
hardness test which may not compensate adequately for
product variables such as substrate thickness and coating
weight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.3
The new designations also provide the user with the
ﬂexibility to restrict the steels applied on any order. For
example, a user can restrict the application of ultra low carbon
steels on an application through the selection of an appropriate
“type” designator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.2
The former “quality” designators, deﬁned in very
broad qualitative terms, did not provide the user with all the
information needed to select the appropriate steel for an
application. The new designations are deﬁned with technical
information such as speciﬁc chemical composition limits and
typical nonmandatory mechanical properties. These steel char-
acteristics are important to users concerned with the weldabil-
ity and formability of the coated steel products. The typical<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.4 There is a limited relationship between the former and
current systems of designation. Some of the reasons for this
limited relationship are: addition of steels not previously
described in ASTM speciﬁcations, restrictions placed on
ranges of chemical composition, the addition of typical me-
chanical properties, and the enhanced capability of steel
producers to combine chemical composition and processing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>tained to assist with the transition to the new system of
designations. A user with concerns about the appropriate
coated steel to order for a speciﬁc application should consult

<<PARAGRAPH>>X2.5 The changes in designation are signiﬁcant which may
create transition issues that will have to be resolved. Continued
dialogue between users and producers will have to be main-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X3. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPECIFICATIONS THAT DESCRIBE REQUIREMENTS FOR A COMMON PRODUCT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X3.1
ISO 3575  and  ISO 4998  may be reviewed for com-
parison with this standard. The relationship between the
standards may only be approximate; therefore, the respective<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>documents should be consulted for actual requirements. Those
who use these documents must determine which speciﬁcations
address their needs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X4. COATING MASS SELECTION BASED ON ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION RATES 4   FOR ZINC-COATED STEEL SHEET<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X4.1 The proper selection of coating mass to meet a user’s
needs for zinc-coated steel sheet requires some knowledge
about the relative corrosiveness of the environment in which
the product will be used. The corrosion rate of the zinc coating
varies widely depending upon many factors of the environ-
ment. For example, the time of wetness is an important issue
that affects the corrosion rate. The presence of impurities such
as chlorides, nitrates, and sulfates can also dramatically affect
the rate of corrosion. Other issues such as the presence or
absence of oxygen and the temperature of the environment are
important determinants for predicting the “life of the product.”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X4.3
No matter how one deﬁnes the “product life,” there
are data in the published literature to assist users once the
environment and desired product life are determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X4.4
Although the corrosion rate can vary considerably
depending on the environmental factors, it is well known that,
in most instances, the life of the zinc coating is a linear
function of coating mass for any speciﬁc environment. That
means, to achieve twice the life for any speciﬁc application, the
user should order twice the coating mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X4.4.1  Examples :
X4.4.1.1 A G60 coating mass will exhibit approximately
twice the life of a G30 coating mass.
X4.4.1.2 A G90 coating mass will exhibit about 50 %
longer life than a G60 coating mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X4.2
The ﬁnal performance requirements can also impact
the minimum coating mass needed for a given application. For
example, is the application an aesthetic one that requires no red
rust. In this case, the time to failure is thus deﬁned as the time
for the onset of red rust (the time for the zinc coating to be
consumed in a large enough area for rusting of the steel to be
observed). Or, is the application one in which the time to
failure is deﬁned as the time when perforation of the steel sheet
is observed? In this case, the thickness of the steel sheet as well
as the thickness of the zinc coating impact the time to failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X4.5
The following two reference books are excellent
sources for additional and more detailed information on the
corrosion behavior of zinc-coated steel sheet products:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
