<<HEADING level=3>>Designation: A 36/A 36M – 05<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Standard Speciﬁcation for
Carbon Structural Steel 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation A 36/A 36M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.
A superscript epsilon ( e ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the Department of Defense.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope*
1.1 This speciﬁcation 2   covers carbon steel shapes, plates,
and bars of structural quality for use in riveted, bolted, or
welded construction of bridges and buildings, and for general
structural purposes.
1.2 Supplementary requirements are provided for use where
additional testing or additional restrictions are required by the
purchaser. Such requirements apply only when speciﬁed in the
purchase order.
1.3 When the steel is to be welded, a welding procedure
suitable for the grade of steel and intended use or service is to
be utilized. See Appendix X3 of Speciﬁcation A 6/A 6M for
information on weldability.
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system is to
be used independently of the other, without combining values
in any way.
1.5 The text of this speciﬁcation contains notes or footnotes,
or both, that provide explanatory material. Such notes and
footnotes, excluding those in tables and ﬁgures, do not contain
any mandatory requirements.
1.6 For structural products produced from coil and fur-
nished without heat treatment or with stress relieving only, the
additional requirements, including additional testing require-
ments and the reporting of additional test results, of A 6/A 6M
apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

tion until they are processed into a ﬁnished structural product.
Structural products produced from coil means structural prod-
ucts that have been cut to individual lengths from a coil. The
processor directly controls, or is responsible for, the operations
involved in the processing of a coil into a ﬁnished structural
product. Such operations include decoiling, leveling or
straightening, hot-forming or cold-forming (if applicable),
cutting to length, testing, inspection, conditioning, heat treat-
ment (if applicable), packaging, marking, loading for shipment,
and certiﬁcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

diameter need not be subjected to tension tests by the manu-
facturer, provided that the chemical composition used is
appropriate for obtaining the tensile properties in  Table 3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1—For structural products produced from coil and furnished
without heat treatment or with stress relieving only, two test results are to
be reported for each qualifying coil. Additional requirements regarding
