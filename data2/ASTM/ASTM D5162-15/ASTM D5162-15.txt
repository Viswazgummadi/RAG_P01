corrosion, reduce abrasion or reduce product contamination, or
all three. The degree of coating continuity required is dictated
by service conditions. Discontinuities in a coating are fre-
quently very minute and not readily visible. This practice
provides a procedure for electrical detection of minute discon-
tinuities in nonconductive coating systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4 Coatings that are applied at a thickness of less than 0.5
mm (20 mil) may be susceptible to damage if tested with high
voltage spark testing equipment. Consult the coating manufac-
turer for proper test equipment and inspection voltages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5 To prevent damage to a coating ﬁlm when using high
voltage test instrumentation, total ﬁlm thickness and dielectric
strength in a coating system shall be considered in selecting the
appropriate voltage for detection of discontinuities. Atmo-
spheric conditions shall also be considered since the voltage
required for the spark to gap a given distance in air varies with
the conductivity of the air at the time the test is conducted.
Suggested starting voltages are provided in  Table 1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6 The coating manufacturer shall be consulted to obtain
the following information, which would affect the accuracy of
this test to determine discontinuities:
4.6.1 Establish the length of time required to adequately dry
or cure the applied coating ﬁlm prior to testing. Solvents
retained in an uncured coating ﬁlm may form an electrically
conductive path through the ﬁlm to the substrate.
4.6.2 Determine whether the coating contains electrically
conductive ﬁllers or pigments that may affect the normal
dielectric properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7 This practice is intended for use with new coatings
applied to metal substrates. Its use on a coating previously
exposed to an immersion condition has often resulted in
damage to the coating and has produced erroneous detection of
discontinuities due to permeation or moisture absorption of the
coating. Deposits may also be present on the surface causing
telegraphing (current traveling through a moisture path to a
discontinuity, giving an erroneous indication) or current leak-
age across the surface of the coating due to contamination. The
use of a high voltage tester on previously exposed coatings has
to be carefully considered because of possible spark-through,
which will damage an otherwise sound coating. Although a low
voltage tester can be used without damaging the coating, it may
also produce erroneous results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

given in Test Methods  G62  and NACE RP0188, SP0274, and SP0490.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2 Low  Voltage Wet Sponge Tester— a sensitivity device
with the operating voltage being of little importance other than
being part of the particular electronic circuit design.
5.1.3 Wet  Sponge Type Instruments— a number of commer-
cially available, industry-accepted, instruments are available.
The following electronic principle describes two types of
devices generally used; others may be available but are not
described in this practice.
5.1.3.1 Lightweight , Self-Contained, Portable Devices—
based on the electrical principle of an electromagnetic sensitive
relay or a solid-state electronic relay circuit that energizes an
audible or visual indicator when a coating discontinuity is
detected. Generally this equipment is capable of being recali-
brated in the ﬁeld by the user.

also based on the principle of an electronic relaxation oscillator<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Apparatus:
5.1.1 Low  Voltage Holiday Detector— an electronic device
powered by a self-contained battery with voltages ranging from
5 to 90 V dc, depending on the equipment manufacturer’s
circuit design. It is used to locate discontinuities in a noncon-
ductive coating applied to a conductive substrate. Operation
includes the use of an open-cell sponge electrode wetted with
a solution for exploring the coating surface, a signal return
connection, and an audible or visual indicator, or both, for
signaling a point of coating discontinuity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>D5162 −15<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>circuit that reacts signiﬁcantly to the abrupt drop in electrical
resistance between the high dielectric value of the coating ﬁlm
and the conductive substrate at the point of coating ﬁlm
discontinuity. This results in a rise in oscillator frequency as
well as in the audible signal from the device. Generally, this
equipment is incapable of being recalibrated in the ﬁeld by the
user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.10 Discontinuities that require repair shall be identiﬁed
with a marker that is compatible with the repair coating or one
that is easily removed. Marking the defects with making tape is
acceptable providing the tape adhesive does not affect the
subsequent repair.
5.2.11 To prevent telegraphing take care to ensure that the
solution is wiped dry from a previously detected discontinuity
where possible before continuing the test.
5.2.12 The wetting agent must be completely removed by
rinsing the holiday area prior to repair.
5.2.13 Wet sponge holiday detection is not recommended
between coats of a multicoat system. However, when a test is
conducted between coats of a multicoat system, a wetting agent
shall not be used and all residue left by the test water must be
completely removed prior to applying additional coats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2 Procedure:
5.2.1 Sufficient drying or curing of the coating shall be
allowed prior to conducting a test. The length of time required
shall be obtained from the coating manufacturer. Solvents
retained in the coating ﬁlm could produce erroneous indicators.
5.2.2 The surface shall be clean, dry, and free of oil, dirt and
other contaminates. Measure the ﬁlm thickness of the coating
with a nondestructive dry ﬁlm thickness gage. If the coating
ﬁlm exceeds 0.5 mm (20 mil), use the procedures for high
voltage spark testing described in Test Method B, High Voltage
Spark Testing.
5.2.3 Test the instrument for sensitivity in accordance with
5.3 .
5.2.4 Attach the signal return wire from the instrument
terminal to the metallic substrate and ensure a good electrical
contact.
5.2.5 Attach the exploring sponge lead to the other terminal.
5.2.6 Wet the sponge with a solution consisting of tap water
and a low sudsing wetting agent, combined at a ratio of not
more than   1 ⁄ 2  ﬂuid oz of wetting agent to 1 gal water. An
example of a low sudsing wetting agent is one used in
photographic development. The sponge shall be wetted suffi-
ciently to barely avoid dripping of the solution while the
sponge is moved over the coating. The wetting agent residue
must be removed prior to executing repairs to the coating.
5.2.7 Sodium chloride (salt) shall not be added to the
wetting solution because of the potential erroneous indications
of discontinuities. The salt, after drying on the coated surface,
may form a continuous path of conductivity across the surface.
It will also interfere with intercoat adhesion of additional coats.
5.2.8 Contact a bare spot on the conductive substrate with
the wetted sponge to verify that the instrument is properly
connected. This procedure shall be repeated periodically dur-
ing the test.
5.2.9 For open areas move the sponge over the surface of
the coating at a moderate rate, with a maximum rate of 0.3 m/s
(1 ft/s), using a double pass over each area. For internal pipe
coatings a single pass is appropriate as a double pass could lead
to telegraphing and false positives. Apply sufficient pressure to
maintain a wet surface. If a discontinuity is detected, turn the
sponge on end to determine the exact location of the discon-
tinuity. Improved accuracy of location can be achieved using a
corner of the sponge if practical. It should be noted that the
detection of pinholes depends on the migration of the moisture
in to the holes and therefore the sponge may have to be moved
over the surface at a slower rate to maximize detection,
particularly for small holes in thicker coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3 Verifying  Operation of Equipment :
5.3.1 The instrument shall be tested for sensitivity prior to
initial use and periodically thereafter, in accordance with the
equipment manufacturer’s instructions.
5.3.2 Test the battery for proper voltage output. Refer to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
5.3.3 Switch the instrument to the “on position,” if appli-
cable.
5.3.4 Wet the sponge with a wetting solution consisting of
tap water and a wetting agent (see  5.2.6 ).
5.3.5 Connect the signal return wire to the instrument
ground output terminal.
5.3.6 Touch the signal return wire alligator clip to the wetted
sponge. The instrument signal should signal in accordance with
the instrument manufacturer’s instructions.
5.3.7 If the instrument should fail to signal, it shall be
considered defective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Verifying  Instrument Calibration :
5.4.1 Verify instrument calibration in accordance with the
manufacturer’s latest published instructions. If out of
calibration, the instrument shall be calibrated in accordance
with
the
instrument
manufacturer’s
latest
published
instructions, or returned for calibration. A certiﬁcate of
calibration, renewed annually, may be required if the quality
management system that controls the testing dictates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

5.5.1 High  Voltage Detector (in excess of 500 V)— an
electronic device used to locate discontinuities in a noncon-
ductive protective coating applied to a conductive substrate. It
consists of an electrical voltage source, an exploring electrode,
and a signal return wire connection from the indicator, signal-
ing current ﬂow through a coating ﬁlm discontinuity, to the
substrate. The detector shall be equipped with a visual or
audible indicator, or both.
5.5.2 Exploring  Electrode,  shall be of the type capable of

<<PARAGRAPH>>inspected, such as bolts, raised areas, etc. It shall be kept clean
and free of coating material. It is important that the electrode is
kept in contact with the coating during the test particularly
when testing the internal coating on a pipe.
5.5.3 High  Voltage Electrical Detector,  can be identiﬁed as
either a pulse or direct current type. A pulse type detector
discharges a cycling, high voltage pulse with a typical voltage
repetition rate of between 20 and 60 Hz when a ﬂaw is
detected, while a direct current type discharges continuous
voltage when a ﬂaw is detected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6 Procedure:
5.6.1 Sufficient drying or curing of the coating shall be
allowed prior to conducting a holiday test. The length of time
required shall be obtained from the coating manufacturer.
Solvents retained in the coating ﬁlm could produce erroneous
results, as well as a ﬁre hazard.
5.6.2 The surface shall be clean, dry, and free of oil, dirt and
other contaminates. Measure thickness of the coating with a
nondestructive dry ﬁlm thickness gage. If the coating ﬁlm is
less than 0.5 mm (20 mil), consider using procedures for low
voltage testing (see Test Method A, Low Voltage Wet Sponge
Testing). Although the high voltage spark tester is suitable for
determining discontinuities in coating ﬁlms of less than 0.5
mm (20 mil), it is recommended that the coating manufacturer
be consulted before using this test. Certain coatings may be
damaged if tested with this equipment.
5.6.3 Verify test instrument operation in accordance with
5.7 .
5.6.4 Adjust the test instrument to the proper voltage for the
coating thickness being tested. In selecting the inspection
voltage, it is important to provide sufficient voltage to break the
air gap that exists at the holiday. The air gap will vary
depending on the total applied ﬁlm thickness. The voltage
required to break a given air gap may also vary due to
atmospheric conditions such as relative humidity and air
pressure. Ensure that the voltage is high enough to break the air
gap equivalent to the highest coating ﬁlm thickness by sepa-
rating the exploring electrode from the bare metal substrate
using a nonconductive spacer equal to the maximum coating
thickness. A sheet of plastic ﬁlm may be used for this purpose.
The voltage is set high enough to conduct the holiday test only
if the spark will jump the gap formed by the spacer. A hole may
be deliberately made in the plastic sheet to simulate a defect in
a coating. Excessive voltage may cause a holiday to form in the
coating ﬁlm. The maximum voltage for the applied coating
shall be obtained from the coating manufacturer.  Table 1
contains suggested voltages that can be used as guides. An
alternative to  Table 1 , the test voltage is represented by the
expression:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V  5  525  = 20  5  525*4.472  5  2347  V  ~ 2.3  kV !<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) For a coating of 1500 µm, Tc = 1.5 and M =7843
Therefore<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V  5  7843  = 1.5  5  7843*1.224
5  9599  V  ~ 9.6  kV !<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) For a coating of 60 mil, Tc = 60 and M = 1250
Therefore<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V  5  1250  = 60  5  1250*7.745  5  9681  V  ~ 9.7  kV !<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.5 Adjust the test instrument for alarm sensitivity if this
feature is available. The alarm sensitivity sets the threshold
current at which the audible alarm sounds. If the high voltage
can charge the coating, a small amount of current will ﬂow
while this charge is established. If the coating contains a
pigment that allows a low-level leakage current to ﬂow from
the probe while testing the current can be set so that the alarm
does not sound until this current is exceeded, that is, when a
ﬂaw is detected. Increasing the current threshold setting makes
the instrument less sensitive to this low level current ﬂow,
decreasing the current threshold setting makes the instrument
more sensitive to current ﬂow.
5.6.6 Attach signal return wire from the instrument terminal
to the metal substrate and ensure a good electrical contact. In
the case of the pulsed type detector, direct contact to the metal
substrate is the preferred option, it is not essential. Due to the
pulsing of the voltage, a capacitance connection through the
coating is sufficient for ﬂaw detection. A conductive rubber mat
over the coating or a trailing bare-wire on a pipe coating for
example, makes a capacitive connection to the metal substrate
allowing current ﬂow when a ﬂaw is detected.
5.6.7 Make contact with the exploring electrode on the
conductive substrate to verify that the instrument is properly
grounded. This test shall be conducted periodically during the
test. The spacer test described in  5.6.4  shall also be repeated if
signiﬁcant atmospheric changes take place during testing.
5.6.8 Move the exploring electrode over the surface of the
dry coating at a rate of approximately 0.3 m/s (1 ft/s) using a
single pass. Moisture on the coating surface may cause
erroneous indications. If moisture exists, remove or allow to
dry before conducting test.
5.6.9 Discontinuities that require repair shall be identiﬁed
with a coating-safe marker that is compatible with the repair
coating or one that is easily removed. Marking the defects with
masking tape is acceptable providing the tape adhesive does
not affect the subsequent repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

alligator clip. The instrument signal should actuate in accor-
dance with the instrument manufacturer’ operating instruc-
tions.
5.7.5 If the instrument fails to signal, it shall be considered
defective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>exploring electrode voltage may be reduced by the slight
current ﬂow of the coating.
5.8.3 If required, compare measured voltage with the se-
lected test voltage. Depending on the type of tester, adjust the
selected voltage by up to  6 5 %. Adjustment beyond this value
indicates that the instrument may be defective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1 Repaired areas should be tested in the same manner as
used for the original system test unless otherwise agreed by the
interested parties. The following aspects must be considered:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2 Sufficient drying or curing of the repair coating shall be
allowed prior to retesting. The length of time required shall be
obtained from the coating manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8 Verifying  Instrument Calibration:
5.8.1 Verify instrument calibration in accordance with the
manufacturer’s latest published instructions. If out of
calibration, the instrument shall be calibrated in accordance
with
the
instrument
manufacturer’s
latest
published
instructions, or returned for calibration. A certiﬁcate of
calibration, renewed annually, may be required if the calibra-
tion program or the quality management system that controls
the testing dictates.
5.8.2 Perform ﬁeld checking of the test voltage with the
electrode placed against the surface of the coating since the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
