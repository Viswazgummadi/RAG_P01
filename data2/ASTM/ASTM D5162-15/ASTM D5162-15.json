Solvents\nretained in the coating \ufb01lm could produce erroneous indicators.\n5.2.2 The surface shall be clean, dry, and free of oil, dirt and\nother contaminates. Measure the \ufb01lm thickness of the coating\nwith a nondestructive dry \ufb01lm thickness gage. If the coating\n\ufb01lm exceeds 0.5 mm (20 mil), use the procedures for high\nvoltage spark testing described in Test Method B, High Voltage\nSpark Testing.\n5.2.3 Test the instrument for sensitivity in accordance with\n5.3 .\n5.2.4 Attach the signal return wire from the instrument\nterminal to the metallic substrate and ensure a good electrical\ncontact.\n5.2.5 Attach the exploring sponge lead to the other terminal.\n5.2.6 Wet the sponge with a solution consisting of tap water\nand a low sudsing wetting agent, combined at a ratio of not\nmore than   1 \u2044 2  \ufb02uid oz of wetting agent to 1 gal water. An\nexample of a low sudsing wetting agent is one used in\nphotographic development. The sponge shall be wetted suffi-\nciently to barely avoid dripping of the solution while the\nsponge is moved over the coating. The wetting agent residue\nmust be removed prior to executing repairs to the coating.\n5.2.7 Sodium chloride (salt) shall not be added to the\nwetting solution because of the potential erroneous indications\nof discontinuities. The salt, after drying on the coated surface,\nmay form a continuous path of conductivity across the surface.\nIt will also interfere with intercoat adhesion of additional coats.\n5.2.8 Contact a bare spot on the conductive substrate with\nthe wetted sponge to verify that the instrument is properly\nconnected. This procedure shall be repeated periodically dur-\ning the test.\n5.2.9 For open areas move the sponge over the surface of\nthe coating at a moderate rate, with a maximum rate of 0.3 m/s\n(1 ft/s), using a double pass over each area. For internal pipe\ncoatings a single pass is appropriate as a double pass could lead\nto telegraphing and false positives. Apply sufficient pressure to\nmaintain a wet surface. If a discontinuity is detected, turn the\nsponge on end to determine the exact location of the discon-\ntinuity. Improved accuracy of location can be achieved using a\ncorner of the sponge if practical. It should be noted that the\ndetection of pinholes depends on the migration of the moisture\nin to the holes and therefore the sponge may have to be moved\nover the surface at a slower rate to maximize detection,\nparticularly for small holes in thicker coatings.",
