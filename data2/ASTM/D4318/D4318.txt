<<HEADING level=3>>Standard Test Methods for
Liquid Limit, Plastic Limit, and Plasticity Index of Soils 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation D 4318; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of
original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A
superscript epsilon ( e ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the several consistency states of plastic soils.
1.6 The composition and concentration of soluble salts in a
soil affect the values of the liquid and plastic limits as well as
the water content values of soils (see Method D 2216). Special
consideration should therefore be given to soils from a marine
environment or other sources where high soluble salt concen-
trations may be present. The degree to which the salts present
in these soils are diluted or concentrated must be given careful
consideration.
1.7 The methods described herein are performed only on
that portion of a soil that passes the 425-µm (No. 40) sieve.
Therefore, the relative contribution of this portion of the soil to
the properties of the sample as a whole must be considered
when using these tests to evaluate properties of a soil.
1.8 The values stated in acceptable metric units are to be
regarded as the standard, except as noted below. The values
given in parentheses are for information only.
1.8.1 The standard units for the resilience tester covered in
Annex A1 are inch-pound, not metric. The metric values given
are for information only.
1.9  This standard does not purport to address all of the
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica-
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope *
1.1 These test methods cover the determination of the liquid
limit, plastic limit, and the plasticity index of soils as deﬁned
in Section 3 on Terminology.
1.2 Two methods for preparing test specimens are provided
as follows:  Wet preparation method,  as described in 10.1.  Dry
preparation method,  as described in 10.2. The method to be
used shall be speciﬁed by the requesting authority. If no
method is speciﬁed, use the wet preparation method.
1.2.1 The liquid and plastic limits of many soils that have
been allowed to dry before testing may be considerably
different from values obtained on non-dried samples. If the
liquid and plastic limits of soils are used to correlate or
estimate the engineering behavior of soils in their natural moist
state, samples should not be permitted to dry before testing
unless data on dried samples are speciﬁcally desired.
1.3 Two methods for determining the liquid limit are pro-
vided as follows:  Method A,  Multipoint test as described in
Sections 11 and 12.  Method B,  One-point test as described in
Sections 13 and 14. The method to be used shall be speciﬁed
by the requesting authority. If no method is speciﬁed, use
Method A.
1.3.1 The multipoint liquid limit method is generally more
precise than the one-point method. It is recommended that the
multipoint method be used in cases where test results may be
subject to dispute, or where greater precision is required.
1.3.2 Because the one-point method requires the operator to
judge when the test specimen is approximately at its liquid
limit, it is particularly not recommended for use by inexperi-
enced operators.
1.3.3 The correlation on which the calculations of the
one-point method are based may not be valid for certain soils,
such as organic soils or soils from a marine environment. It is
strongly recommended that the liquid limit of these soils be
determined by the multipoint method.
1.4 The plastic limit test is performed on material prepared
for the liquid limit test.
1.5 The liquid limit and plastic limit of soils (along with the
shrinkage limit) are often collectively referred to as the
Atterberg limits. These limits distinguished the boundaries of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>determined by performing trials in which a portion of the
specimen is spread in a brass cup, divided in two by a grooving
tool, and then allowed to ﬂow together from the shocks caused
by repeatedly dropping the cup in a standard mechanical
device. The multipoint liquid limit, Method A, requires three or
more trials over a range of water contents to be performed and
the data from the trials plotted or calculated to make a
relationship from which the liquid limit is determined. The
one-point liquid limit, Method B, uses the data from two trials
at one water content multiplied by a correction factor to
determine the liquid limit.
4.2 The plastic limit is determined by alternately pressing
together and rolling into a 3.2-mm ( 1 ⁄ 8 -in.) diameter thread a
small portion of plastic soil until its water content is reduced to
a point at which the thread crumbles and can no longer be
pressed together and re-rolled. The water content of the soil at
this point is reported as the plastic limit.
4.3 The plasticity index is calculated as the difference
between the liquid limit and the plastic limit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3. Terminology
3.1  Deﬁnitions:
3.1.1 The deﬁnitions of terms in this standard are in
accordance with Terminology D 653.
3.2  Description of Terms Speciﬁc to This Standard:
3.2.1  Atterberg Limits —Originally, six “limits of consis-
tency” of ﬁne-grained soils were deﬁned by Albert Atterberg:
the upper limit of viscous ﬂow, the liquid limit, the sticky limit,
the cohesion limit, the plastic limit, and the shrinkage limit. In
current engineering usage, the term usually refers only to the
liquid limit, plastic limit, and in some references, the shrinkage
limit.
3.2.2  consistency —the relative ease with which a soil can be
deformed.
3.2.3  liquid limit (LL, w L )—the water content, in percent, of
a soil at the arbitrarily deﬁned boundary between the semi-
liquid and plastic states.
3.2.3.1  Discussion —The undrained shear strength of soil at
the liquid limit is considered to be approximately 2 kPa (0.28
psi).
3.2.4  plastic limit (PL, w p )—the water content, in percent,
of a soil at the boundary between the plastic and semi-solid
states.
3.2.5  plastic soil —a soil which has a range of water content
over which it exhibits plasticity and which will retain its shape
on drying.
3.2.6  plasticity index (PI) —the range of water content over
which a soil behaves plastically. Numerically, it is the differ-
ence between the liquid limit and the plastic limit.
3.2.7  liquidity index —the ratio, expressed as a percentage of
(1) the water content of a soil minus its plastic limit, to (2) its
plasticity index.
3.2.8  activity number (A) —the ratio of (1) the plasticity
index of a soil to (2) the percent by mass of particles having an
equivalent diameter smaller than 2 µm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Signiﬁcance and Use
5.1 These test methods are used as an integral part of several
engineering classiﬁcation systems to characterize the ﬁne-
grained fractions of soils (see Practices D 2487 and D 3282)
and to specify the ﬁne-grained fraction of construction mate-
rials (see Speciﬁcation D 1241). The liquid limit, plastic limit,
and plasticity index of soils are also used extensively, either
individually or together, with other soil properties to correlate
with engineering behavior such as compressibility, hydraulic
conductivity (permeability), compactibility, shrink-swell, and
shear strength.
5.2 The liquid and plastic limits of a soil and its water
content can be used to express its relative consistency or
liquidity index. In addition, the plasticity index and the
percentage ﬁner than 2-µm particle size can be used to
determine its activity number.
5.3 These methods are sometimes used to evaluate the
weathering characteristics of clay-shale materials. When sub-
jected to repeated wetting and drying cycles, the liquid limits
of these materials tend to increase. The amount of increase is
considered to be a measure of a shale’s susceptibility to
weathering.
5.4 The liquid limit of a soil containing substantial amounts
of organic matter decreases dramatically when the soil is
oven-dried before testing. Comparison of the liquid limit of a
sample before and after oven-drying can therefore be used as a
qualitative measure of organic matter content of a soil (see
Practice D 2487).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1—The quality of the result produced by this standard is
dependent on the competence of the personnel performing it and the
suitability of the equipment and facilities used. Agencies that meet the
criteria of Practice D 3740, generally, are considered capable of competent
and objective testing/sampling/inspection/etc. Users of this standard are
cautioned that compliance with Practice D 3740 does not in itself assure
reliable results. Reliable results depend on many factors; Practice D 3740
provides a means of evaluating some of those factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4. Summary of Test Method

<<PARAGRAPH>>drop onto a hard rubber base. Fig. 1 shows the essential
features and critical dimensions of the device. The device may
be operated by either a hand crank or electric motor.
6.1.1  Base —A hard rubber base having a Type D Durometer
hardness of 80 to 90, and resilience rebound of at least 77 %
but no more than 90 %. Conduct resilience tests on the ﬁnished
base with the feet attached. Details for measuring the resilience
of the base are given in Annex A1.
6.1.2  Rubber Feet,  supporting the base, designed to provide
isolation of the base from the work surface, and having a Type
A Durometer hardness no greater than 60 as measured on the
ﬁnished feet attached to the base.
6.1.3  Cup,  brass, with a mass, including cup hanger, of 185
to 215 g.
6.1.4  Cam —Designed to raise the cup smoothly and con-
tinuously to its maximum height, over a distance of at least
180° of cam rotation, without developing an upward or
downward velocity of the cup when the cam follower leaves
the cam. (The preferred cam motion is a uniformly accelerated
lift curve.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>mm (0.394 in.), and designed such that the cup and cup hanger
assembly is only attached to the carriage by means of a
removable pin. See Fig. 2 for deﬁnition and determination of
the height-of-drop of the cup.
6.1.6  Motor Drive (Optional) —As an alternative to the
hand crank shown in Fig. 1, the device may be equipped with
a motor to turn the cam. Such a motor must turn the cam at
2  6  0.1 revolutions per second and must be isolated from the
rest of the device by rubber mounts or in some other way that
prevents vibration from the motor being transmitted to the rest
of the apparatus. It must be equipped with an ON-OFF switch
and a means of conveniently positioning the cam for height-
of-drop adjustments. The results obtained using a motor-driven
device must not differ from those obtained using a manually
operated device.
6.2  Flat Grooving Tool —A tool made of plastic or
noncorroding-metal having the dimensions shown in Fig. 3.
The design of the tool may vary as long as the essential
dimensions are maintained. The tool may, but need not,
incorporate the gage for adjusting the height-of-drop of the
liquid limit device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  2—The cam and follower design in Fig. 1 is for uniformly
accelerated (parabolic) motion after contact and assures that the cup has
no velocity at drop off. Other cam designs also provide this feature and
may be used. However, if the cam-follower lift pattern is not known, zero
velocity at drop off can be assured by carefully ﬁling or machining the
cam and follower so that the cup height remains constant over the last 20
to 45° of cam rotation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  3—Prior to the adoption of this test method, a curved grooving
tool was speciﬁed as part of the apparatus for performing the liquid limit
test. The curved tool is not considered to be as accurate as the ﬂat tool
described in 6.2 since it does not control the depth of the soil in the liquid
limit cup. However, there are some data which indicate that typically the
liquid limit is slightly increased when the ﬂat tool is used instead of the
curved tool.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.5  Carriage,  constructed in a way that allows convenient
but secure adjustment of the height-of-drop of the cup to 10<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3  Gage —A metal gage block for adjusting the height-of-
drop of the cup, having the dimensions shown in Fig. 4. The
design of the tool may vary provided the gage will rest securely
on the base without being susceptible to rocking, and the edge
which contacts the cup during adjustment is straight, at least 10
mm ( 3 ⁄ 8  in.) wide, and without bevel or radius.
6.4  Water Content Containers —Small corrosion-resistant
containers with snug-ﬁtting lids for water content specimens.
Aluminum or stainless steel cans 2.5 cm (1 in.) high by 5 cm
(2 in.) in diameter are appropriate.
6.5  Balance,  conforming to Speciﬁcation D 4753, Class<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>GP1 (readability of 0.01 g).
6.6  Mixing and Storage Container —A container to mix the
soil specimen (material) and store the prepared material.
During mixing and storage, the container shall not contaminate
the material in any way, and prevent moisture loss during
storage. A porcelain, glass, or plastic dish about 11.4 cm
(4 1 ⁄ 2  in.) in diameter and a plastic bag large enough to enclose
the dish and be folded over is adequate.
6.7  Plastic Limit:

<<PARAGRAPH>>having a rim at least 5 cm (2 in.) above the mesh. A 2.00-mm
(No. 10) sieve meeting the same requirements may also be
needed.
6.10  Wash Bottle,  or similar container for adding controlled
amounts of water to soil and washing ﬁnes from coarse
particles.
6.11  Drying Oven,  thermostatically controlled, preferably of
the forced-draft type, capable of continuously maintaining a
temperature of 110  6  5°C (230  6  9°F) throughout the drying
chamber.
6.12  Washing Pan,  round, ﬂat-bottomed, at least 7.6 cm (3

6.7.2  Plastic Limit-Rolling Device (optional) —A device
made of acrylic conforming to the dimensions shown in Fig.
5. 7,8   The type of unglazed paper attached to the top and bottom
plate (see 16.2.2) shall be such that it does not add foreign
matter (ﬁbers, paper fragments, etc.) to the soil during the
rolling process.
6.8  Spatula —A spatula or pill knife having a blade about 2
cm ( 3 ⁄ 4  in.) wide, and about 10 to 13 cm (3 to 4 in.) long.
6.9  Sieve(s) —A 200-mm (8-in.) diameter, 425-µm (No. 40)
sieve conforming to the requirements of Speciﬁcation E 11 and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. Reagents and Materials
7.1  Purity of Water —Where distilled water is referred to in
this test method, either distilled or demineralized water may be
used. See Note 7 covering the use of tap water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. Sampling and Specimen
8.1 Samples may be taken from any location that satisﬁes
testing needs. However, Practices C 702, D 75, and D 420
should be used as guides for selecting and preserving samples
from various types of sampling operations. Samples in which
specimens will be prepared using the wet-preparation method
(10.1) must be kept at their as–sampled water content prior to
preparation.
8.1.1 Where sampling operations have preserved the natural
stratiﬁcation of a sample, the various strata must be kept
separated and tests performed on the particular stratum of
interest with as little contamination as possible from other
strata. Where a mixture of materials will be used in construc-
tion, combine the various components in such proportions that
the resultant sample represents the actual construction case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7  The plastic limit-rolling device is covered by a patent (U.S. Patent No.
5,027,660). 7   Interested parties are invited to submit information regarding the
identiﬁcation of an alternative(s) to this patented item to ASTM Headquarters. Your
comments will receive careful consideration at a meeting of the responsible
subcommittee, which you may attend.

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2 Where data from these test methods are to be used for
correlation with other laboratory or ﬁeld test data, use the same
material as used for those tests where possible.
8.2  Specimen —Obtain a representative portion from the
total sample sufficient to provide 150 to 200 g of material
passing the 425-µm (No. 40) sieve. Free ﬂowing samples
(materials) may be reduced by the methods of quartering or
splitting. Non-free ﬂowing or cohesive materials shall be
mixed thoroughly in a pan with a spatula or scoop and a
representative portion scooped from the total mass by making
one or more sweeps with a scoop through the mixed mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>maximum height. Slide the height gage under the cup from the front, and
observe whether the gage contacts the cup or the tape. (See Fig. 2.) If the
tape and cup are both simultaneously contacted, the height-of-drop is
ready to be checked. If not, adjust the cup until simultaneous contact is
made. Check adjustment by turning the crank at 2 revolutions per second
while holding the gage in position against the tape and cup. If a faint
ringing or clicking sound is heard without the cup rising from the gage, the
adjustment is correct. If no ringing is heard or if the cup rises from the
gage, readjust the height-of-drop. If the cup rocks on the gage during this
checking operation, the cam follower pivot is excessively worn and the
worn parts should be replaced. Always remove tape after completion of
adjustment operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10. Preparation of Test Specimen
10.1  Wet Preparation Method —Except where the dry
method of specimen preparation is speciﬁed (10.2), prepare the
specimen for testing as described in the following sections.
10.1.1  Material Passes the 425-µm (No. 40) Sieve:
10.1.1.1 Determine by visual and manual methods that the
specimen from 8.2 has little or no material retained on a
425-µm (No. 40) sieve. If this is the case, prepare 150 to 200
g of material by mixing thoroughly with distilled or deminer-
alized water on the glass plate or mixing dish using the spatula.
If desired, soak the material in a mixing/storage dish with a
small amount of water to soften the material before the start of
mixing. If using Method A, adjust the water content of the
material to bring it to a consistency that would require about 25
to 35 blows of the liquid limit device to close the groove (Note
6). For Method B, the number of blows should be between
about 20 and 30 blows.
10.1.1.2 If, during mixing, a small percentage of material is
encountered that would be retained on a 425-µm (No. 40)
sieve, remove these particles by hand (if possible). If it is
impractical to remove the coarser material by hand, remove
small percentages (less than about 15 %) of coarser material by
working the material (having the above consistency) through a
425-µm sieve. During this procedure, use a piece of rubber
sheeting, rubber stopper, or other convenient device provided
the procedure does not distort the sieve or degrade material that
would be retained if the washing method described in 10.1.2
were used. If larger percentages of coarse material are encoun-
tered during mixing, or it is considered impractical to remove
the coarser material by the procedures just described, wash the
sample as described in 10.1.2. When the coarse particles found
during mixing are concretions, shells, or other fragile particles,
do not crush these particles to make them pass a 425-µm sieve,
but remove by hand or by washing.
10.1.1.3 Place the prepared material in the mixing/storage
dish, check its consistency (adjust if required), cover to prevent
loss of moisture, and allow to stand (cure) for at least 16 h
(overnight). After the standing period and immediately before
starting the test, thoroughly remix the soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. Calibration of Apparatus
9.1  Inspection of Wear:
9.1.1  Liquid Limit Device —Determine that the liquid limit
device is clean and in good working order. Check the following
speciﬁc points.
9.1.1.1  Wear of Base —The spot on the base where the cup
makes contact should be worn no greater than 10 mm ( 3 ⁄ 8  in.)
in diameter. If the wear spot is greater than this, the base can
be machined to remove the worn spot provided the resurfacing
does not make the base thinner than speciﬁed in 6.1 and the
other dimensional relationships are maintained.
9.1.1.2  Wear of Cup —Replace the cup when the grooving
tool has worn a depression in the cup 0.1 mm (0.004 in.) deep
or when the rim of the cup has been reduced to half its original
thickness. Verify that the cup is ﬁrmly attached to the cup
hanger.
9.1.1.3  Wear of Cup Hanger —Verify that the cup hanger
pivot does not bind and is not worn to an extent that allows
more than 3 mm ( 1 ⁄ 8  in.) side-to-side movement of the lowest
point on the rim.
9.1.1.4  Wear of Cam —The cam shall not be worn to an
extent that the cup drops before the cup hanger (cam follower)
loses contact with the cam.
9.1.2  Grooving Tools —Inspect grooving tools for wear on a
frequent and regular basis. The rapidity of wear depends on the
material from which the tool is made, and the types of soils
being tested. Soils containing a large proportion of ﬁne sand
particles may cause rapid wear of grooving tools; therefore,
when testing these materials, tools should be inspected more
frequently than for other soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  4—The width of the tip of grooving tools is conveniently checked
using a pocket-sized measuring magniﬁer equipped with a millimeter
scale. Magniﬁers of this type are available from most laboratory supply
companies. The depth of the tip of grooving tools can be checked using the
depth-measuring feature of vernier calipers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2  Adjustment of Height-of-Drop —Adjust the height-of-
drop of the cup so that the point on the cup that comes in
contact with the base rises to a height of 10  6  0.2 mm. See Fig.
2 for proper location of the gage relative to the cup during
adjustment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  6—The time taken to adequately mix a soil will vary greatly,
depending on the plasticity and initial water content. Initial mixing times
of more than 30 min may be needed for stiff, fat clays.
10.1.2  Material Containing Particles Retained on a 425-µm
(No. 40) Sieve:
10.1.2.1 Place the specimen (see 8.2) in a pan or dish and
add sufficient water to cover the material. Allow the material to
soak until all lumps have softened and the ﬁnes no longer<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  5—A convenient procedure for adjusting the height-of-drop is as
follows: place a piece of masking tape across the outside bottom of the cup
parallel with the axis of the cup hanger pivot. The edge of the tape away
from the cup hanger should bisect the spot on the cup that contacts the
base. For new cups, placing a piece of carbon paper on the base and
allowing the cup to drop several times will mark the contact spot. Attach
the cup to the device and turn the crank until the cup is raised to its<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>number of blows should be between about 20 and 30. Put, if
necessary, the mixed material in the storage dish, cover to
prevent loss of moisture, and allow to stand (cure) for at least
16 h. After the standing period and immediately before starting
the test, thoroughly remix the specimen.
10.2  Dry Preparation Method:
10.2.1 Dry the specimen from 8.2 at room temperature or in
an oven at a temperature not exceeding 60°C until the soil
clods will pulverize readily. Disaggregation is expedited if the
material is not allowed to completely dry. However, the
material should have a dry appearance when pulverized.
10.2.2 Pulverize the material in a mortar with a rubber-
tipped pestle or in some other way that does not cause
breakdown of individual particles. When the coarse particles
found during pulverization are concretions, shells, or other
fragile particles, do not crush these particles to make them pass
a 425-µm (No. 40) sieve, but remove by hand or other suitable
means, such as washing. If a washing procedure is used, follow
10.1.2.1-10.1.2.4.
10.2.3 Separate the material on a 425-µm (No. 40) sieve,
shaking the sieve by hand to assure thorough separation of the
ﬁner fraction. Return the material retained on the 425-µm sieve
to the pulverizing apparatus and repeat the pulverizing and
sieving operations. Stop this procedure when most of the ﬁne
material has been disaggregated and material retained on the
425-µm sieve consists of individual particles.
10.2.4 Place material retained on the 425-µm (No. 40) sieve
after the ﬁnal pulverizing operations in a dish and soak in a
small amount of water. Stir this mixture and transfer it to a
425-µm sieve, catching the water and any suspended ﬁnes in
the washing pan. Pour this suspension into a dish containing
the dry soil previously sieved through the 425-µm sieve.
Discard material retained on the 425-µm sieve.
10.2.5 Proceed as described in 10.1.2.3 and 10.1.2.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  7—In some cases, the cations of salts present in tap water will
exchange with the natural cations in the soil and signiﬁcantly alter the test
results if tap water is used in the soaking and washing operations. Unless
it is known that such cations are not present in the tap water, distilled or
demineralized water should be used. As a general rule, water containing
more than 100 mg/L of dissolved solids should not be used for either the
soaking or washing operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.2.2 When the material contains a large percentage of
particles retained on the 425-µm (No. 40) sieve, perform the
following washing operation in increments, washing no more
than 0.5 kg (1 lb) of material at one time. Place the 425-µm
sieve in the bottom of the clean pan. Transfer, without any loss
of material, the soil-water mixture onto the sieve. If gravel or
coarse sand particles are present, rinse as many of these as
possible with small quantities of water from a wash bottle, and
discard. Alternatively, transfer the soil-water mixture over a
2.00-mm (No. 10) sieve nested atop the 425-µm sieve, rinse the
ﬁne material through and remove the 2.00-mm sieve. After
washing and removing as much of the coarser material as
possible, add sufficient water to the pan to bring the level to
about 13 mm ( 1 ⁄ 2  in.) above the surface of the 425-µm sieve.
Agitate the slurry by stirring with the ﬁngers while raising and
lowering the sieve in the pan and swirling the suspension so
that ﬁne material is washed from the coarser particles. Disag-
gregate ﬁne soil lumps that have not slaked by gently rubbing
them over the sieve with the ﬁngertips. Complete the washing
operation by raising the sieve above the water surface and
rinsing the material retained with a small amount of clean
water. Discard material retained on the 425-µm sieve.
10.1.2.3 Reduce the water content of the material passing
the 425–µm (No. 40) sieve until it approaches the liquid limit.
Reduction of water content may be accomplished by one or a
combination of the following methods: ( a ) exposing to air
currents at room temperature, ( b ) exposing to warm air currents
from a source such as an electric hair dryer, ( c ) decanting clear
water from surface of the suspension, ( d ) ﬁltering in a Büchner
funnel or using ﬁlter candles, or ( e ) draining in a colander or
plaster of Paris dish lined with high retentivity, 9   high wet-
strength ﬁlter paper. If a plaster of Paris dish is used, take care
that the dish never becomes sufficiently saturated that it fails to
absorb water into its surface. Thoroughly dry dish between
uses. During evaporation and cooling, stir the material often
enough to prevent over-drying of the fringes and soil pinnacles
on the surface of the mixture. For materials containing soluble
salts, use a method of water reduction ( a  or  b ) that will not
eliminate the soluble salts from the test specimen.
10.1.2.4 If applicable, remove the material retained on the
ﬁlter paper. Thoroughly mix this material or the above material
on the glass plate or in the mixing dish using the spatula.
Adjust the water content of the mixture, if necessary, by adding
small increments of distilled or demineralized water or by
allowing the mixture to dry at room temperature while mixing
on the glass plate. If using Method A, the material should be at
a water content that would require about 25 to 35 blows of the
liquid limit device to close the groove. For Method B, the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>MULTIPOINT LIQUID LIMIT—METHOD A<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11. Procedure
11.1 Thoroughly remix the specimen (soil) in its mixing
cup, and, if necessary, adjust its water content until the
constancy requires about 25 to 35 blows of the liquid limit
device to close the groove. Using a spatula, place a portion(s)
of the prepared soil in the cup of the liquid limit device at the
point where the cup rests on the base, squeeze it down, and
spread it into the cup to a depth of about 10 mm at its deepest
point, tapering to form an approximately horizontal surface.
Take care to eliminate air bubbles from the soil pat, but form
the pat with as few strokes as possible. Keep the unused soil in
the mixing/storage dish. Cover the dish with a wet towel (or
use other means) to retain the moisture in the soil.
11.2 Form a groove in the soil pat by drawing the tool,
beveled edge forward, through the soil on a line joining the
highest point to the lowest point on the rim of the cup. When
cutting the groove, hold the grooving tool against the surface of
the cup and draw in an arc, maintaining the tool perpendicular
to the surface of the cup throughout its movement. See Fig. 6.
In soils where a groove cannot be made in one stroke without
tearing the soil, cut the groove with several strokes of the
grooving tool. Alternatively, cut the groove to slightly less than
9  S and S 595 ﬁlter paper available in 320-mm circles has proven satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

bring the groove to ﬁnal dimensions. Exercise extreme care to
prevent sliding the soil pat relative to the surface of the cup.
11.3 Verify that no crumbs of soil are present on the base or
the underside of the cup. Lift and drop the cup by turning the
crank at a rate of 1.9 to 2.1 drops per second until the two
halves of the soil pat come in contact at the bottom of the
groove along a distance of 13 mm ( 1 ⁄ 2  in.). See Fig. 7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.4 Verify that an air bubble has not caused premature
closing of the groove by observing that both sides of the groove
have ﬂowed together with approximately the same shape. If a
bubble has caused premature closing of the groove, reform the
soil in the cup, adding a small amount of soil to make up for
that lost in the grooving operation and repeat 11.1-11.3. If the
soil slides on the surface of the cup, repeat 11.1-11.3 at a higher
water content. If, after several trials at successively higher
water contents, the soil pat continues to slide in the cup or if the
number of blows required to close the groove is always less<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

11.5 Record the number of drops,  N,  required to close the
groove. Remove a slice of soil approximately the width of the
spatula, extending from edge to edge of the soil cake at right
angles to the groove and including that portion of the groove in
which the soil ﬂowed together, place in a container of known
mass, and cover.
11.6 Return the soil remaining in the cup to the dish. Wash
and dry the cup and grooving tool and reattach the cup to the
carriage in preparation for the next trial.
11.7 Remix the entire soil specimen in the dish adding
distilled water to increase the water content of the soil and
decrease the number of blows required to close the groove.
Repeat 11.1-11.6 for at least two additional trials producing
successively lower numbers of blows to close the groove. One
of the trials shall be for a closure requiring 25 to 35 blows, one
for closure between 20 and 30 blows, and one trial for a closure
requiring 15 to 25 blows.
11.8 Determine the water content,  W n ,  of the soil specimen
from each trial in accordance with Test Method D 2216.
11.8.1 Determination of initial masses (container plus moist
soil) should be performed immediately after completion of the
test. If the test is to be interrupted for more than about 15
minutes, determine the mass of the water content specimens
already obtained at the time of the interruption.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>15. Preparation of Test Specimen
15.1 Select a 20-g or more portion of soil from the material
prepared for the liquid limit test; either, after the second mixing
before the test, or from the soil remaining after completion of
the liquid limit test. Reduce the water content of the soil to a
consistency at which it can be rolled without sticking to the
hands by spreading or mixing continuously on the glass plate
or in the mixing/storage dish. The drying process may be
accelerated by exposing the soil to the air current from an
electric fan, or by blotting with paper, that does not add any
ﬁber to the soil. Paper such as hard surface paper toweling or
high wet-strength ﬁlter paper is adequate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12. Calculation
12.1 Plot the relationship between the water content,  W n ,
and the corresponding number of drops,  N,  of the cup on a
semilogarithmic graph with the water content as ordinates on
the arithmetical scale, and the number of drops as abscissas on
a logarithmic scale. Draw the best straight line through the
three or more plotted points.
12.2 Take the water content corresponding to the intersec-
tion of the line with the 25-drop abscissa as the liquid limit of
the soil and round to the nearest whole number. Computational
methods may be substituted for the graphical method for ﬁtting
a straight line to the data and determining the liquid limit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

16.1 From this plastic-limit specimen, select a 1.5 to 2.0 g
portion. Form the selected portion into an ellipsoidal mass.

water content of the soil and repeat the procedure.
13.2 Immediately after removing a water content specimen
as described in 11.5, reform the soil in the cup, adding a small
amount of soil to make up for that lost in the grooving and
water content sampling orientations. Repeat 11.2-11.5, and, if
the second closing of the groove requires the same number of
drops or no more than two drops difference, secure another
water content specimen. Otherwise, remix the entire specimen
and repeat.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>16.2.1  Hand Method —Roll the mass between the palm or
ﬁngers and the ground-glass plate with just sufficient pressure
to roll the mass into a thread of uniform diameter throughout its
length (see Note 10). The thread shall be further deformed on
each stroke so that its diameter reaches 3.2 mm ( 1 ⁄ 8  in.), taking
no more than 2 min (see Note 11). The amount of hand or
ﬁnger pressure required will vary greatly according to the soil
being tested, that is, the required pressure typically increases
with increasing plasticity. Fragile soils of low plasticity are
best rolled under the outer edge of the palm or at the base of the
thumb.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>together, knead between the thumb and ﬁrst ﬁnger of each
hand, reform into an ellipsoidal mass, and re-roll. Continue this
alternate rolling to a thread 3.2 mm in diameter, gathering
together, kneading and re-rolling, until the thread crumbles
under the pressure required for rolling and the soil can no
longer be rolled into a 3.2-mm diameter thread (see Fig. 8). It
has no signiﬁcance if the thread breaks into threads of shorter
length. Roll each of these shorter threads to 3.2 mm in
diameter. The only requirement for continuing the test is that
these threads can be reformed into an ellipsoidal mass and
rolled out again. The operator shall at no time attempt to
produce failure at exactly 3.2-mm diameter by allowing the
thread to reach 3.2 mm, then reducing the rate of rolling or the
hand pressure, or both, while continuing the rolling without
further deformation until the thread falls apart. It is permis-
sible, however, to reduce the total amount of deformation for
feebly plastic soils by making the initial diameter of the
ellipsoidal mass nearer to the required 3.2-mm ﬁnal diameter.
If crumbling occurs when the thread has a diameter greater
than 3.2 mm, this shall be considered a satisfactory end point,
provided the soil has been previously rolled into a thread 3.2
mm in diameter. Crumbling of the thread will manifest itself
differently with the various types of soil. Some soils fall apart
in numerous small aggregations of particles, others may form
an outside tubular layer that starts splitting at both ends. The
splitting progresses toward the middle, and ﬁnally, the thread
falls apart in many small platy particles. Fat clay soils require
much pressure to deform the thread, particularly as they
approach the plastic limit. With these soils, the thread breaks
into a series of barrel-shaped segments about 3.2 to 9.5 mm ( 1 ⁄ 8
to   3 ⁄ 8  in.) in length.
16.4 Gather the portions of the crumbled thread together<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  10—A normal rate of rolling for most soils should be 80 to 90
strokes per minute, counting a stroke as one complete motion of the hand
forward and back to the starting position. This rate of rolling may have to
be decreased for very fragile soils.
N OTE  11—A 3.2-mm ( 1 ⁄ 8 -in.) diameter rod or tube is useful for frequent
comparison with the soil thread to ascertain when the thread has reached
the proper diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.2.2  Rolling Device Method —Attach smooth unglazed
paper to both the top and bottom plates of the plastic
limit-rolling device. Place the soil mass on the bottom plate at
the midpoint between the slide rails. Place the top plate in
contact with the soil mass(es). Simultaneously apply a slight
downward force and back and forth motion to the top plate so
that the top plate comes into contact with the side rails within
2 min (see Notes 10 and 12). During this rolling process, the
end(s) the soil thread(s) shall not contact the side rail(s). If this
occurs, roll a smaller mass of soil (even if it is less than that
mentioned in Section 16.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  12—In most cases, two soil masses (threads) can be rolled
simultaneously in the plastic limit-rolling device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16.3 When the diameter of the thread becomes 3.2 mm,
break the thread into several pieces. Squeeze the pieces<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

20.1  Precision —Criteria for judging the acceptability of test
results obtained by these test methods on a range of soil types
are given in Tables 2 and 3. In performing these test methods,
Method A and the Wet Preparation Method (except soil was
air-dried) were used.
20.1.1 These estimates of precision are based on the results
of the interlaboratory program conducted by the ASTM Ref-
erence Soils and Testing Program. 10   In this program, some
laboratories performed three replicate tests per soil type
(triplicate test laboratory), while other laboratories performed a
single test per soil type (single-test laboratory). A description
of the soils tested is given in 20.1.5. The precision estimates
vary with soil type and method(s) used. Judgment is required
when applying these estimates to another soil and method used
(Method A or B, or Wet or Dry Preparation Method).
20.1.2 The data in Table 2 are based on three replicate tests
performed by each triplicate test laboratory on each soil type.
The single operator and multilaboratory standard deviation
shown in Table 2, Column 4, were obtained in accordance with
Practice E 691, which recommends each testing laboratory
perform a minimum of three replicate tests. Results of two
properly conducted tests performed by the same operator on
the same material, using the same equipment, and in the
shortest practical period of time should not differ by more than
the single-operator d2 s  limits shown in Table 2, Column 5. For
deﬁnition of d2 s  see Footnote C in Table 2. Results of two

<<PARAGRAPH>>A1.1 A device for measuring the resilience of liquid limit
device bases is shown in Fig. A1.1. The device consists of a
clear acrylic plastic tube and cap, a   5 ⁄ 16 -in. diameter steel ball,
and a small bar magnet. The cylinder may be cemented to the
cap or threaded as shown. The small bar magnet is held in the
recess of the cap and the steel ball is ﬁxed into the recess in the
underside of the cap with the bar magnet. The cylinder is then
turned upright and placed on the top surface of the base to be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>tested. Holding the tube lightly against the liquid limit device
base with one hand, release the ball by pulling the magnet out
of the cap. Use the scale markings on the outside of the
cylinder to determine the highest point reached by the bottom
of the ball. Repeat the drop at least three times, placing the
tester in a different location for each drop. Tests should be
conducted at room temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>FIG. A1.1 Resilience Tester<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SUMMARY OF CHANGES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Committee D18 has identiﬁed the location of selected changes to this standard since the last issue (1998) that
may impact the use of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>( 1 ) Replaced “procedure” with “method,” when the topic
covers how one is to perform a task.
( 2 ) In Scope covering “units,” clariﬁed that the standard units
for resilience tester are in inch-pound, not metric.
( 3 ) Where applicable, replaced “weight” with “mass” or
reworded to remove such terms as “weight,” “weighing,” or
“weigh.”
( 4 ) Where applicable, replaced “natural” as an adjective to
water content with such terms as “its” or “as-sampled.”
( 5 ) In Apparatus, under 6.6, “storage container” was changed
to “mixing and storage container” and subsection reworded to
indicate this container/dish may be used to mix the soil.
Remaining sections in the standard, where applicable, were
reworded to indicate “storage dish” may also be the “mixing
dish.”
( 6 ) In Section 8, changed title to include “Specimen,” and
where applicable reworded to distinguish between the sample
and the specimen before processing using the wet or dry
preparation method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>( 7 ) Under Preparation of Test Specimen: The subsections
covering the wet and dry preparation methods were reworded
to include the required number of blows for Method A and B.
In addition, used the term “material” instead of soil or sample,
whenever applicable, and replaced “grains” with “particle.”.
( 8 ) Under One-Point Liquid Limit, Method B, Section 13 on
Preparation of Test Specimen was removed since the informa-
tion given in that section was moved to 10.1.2.4.
( 9 ) In the calculation sections, deﬁned that the calculated test
result is rounded to the nearest whole number.
( 10 ) References to Practice C 670 were deleted in text, and
references to Practices D 3740, D 6026, E 177, and E 691 were
incorporated.
( 11 ) At the end of the Signiﬁcance and Use section, a new Note
1 was added referencing Practice D 3740 in accordance with
D18 policy, and all subsequent notes were renumbered.
( 12 ) Section 20.1 on Precision was revised completely.
( 13 ) In Table 1, corrected the factor for 20 number of drops.
( 14 ) Appendix X1 was changed to Annex A1, and the scribe<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
