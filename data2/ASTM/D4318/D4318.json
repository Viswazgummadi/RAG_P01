Scope *\n1.1 These test methods cover the determination of the liquid\nlimit, plastic limit, and the plasticity index of soils as de\ufb01ned\nin Section 3 on Terminology.\n1.2 Two methods for preparing test specimens are provided\nas follows:  Wet preparation method,  as described in 10.1.  Dry\npreparation method,  as described in 10.2. The method to be\nused shall be speci\ufb01ed by the requesting authority. If no\nmethod is speci\ufb01ed, use the wet preparation method.\n1.2.1 The liquid and plastic limits of many soils that have\nbeen allowed to dry before testing may be considerably\ndifferent from values obtained on non-dried samples. If the\nliquid and plastic limits of soils are used to correlate or\nestimate the engineering behavior of soils in their natural moist\nstate, samples should not be permitted to dry before testing\nunless data on dried samples are speci\ufb01cally desired.\n1.3 Two methods for determining the liquid limit are pro-\nvided as follows:  Method A,  Multipoint test as described in\nSections 11 and 12.  Method B,  One-point test as described in\nSections 13 and 14. The method to be used shall be speci\ufb01ed\nby the requesting authority. If no method is speci\ufb01ed, use\nMethod A.\n1.3.1 The multipoint liquid limit method is generally more\nprecise than the one-point method. It is recommended that the\nmultipoint method be used in cases where test results may be\nsubject to dispute, or where greater precision is required.\n1.3.2 Because the one-point method requires the operator to\njudge when the test specimen is approximately at its liquid\nlimit, it is particularly not recommended for use by inexperi-\nenced operators.\n1.3.3 The correlation on which the calculations of the\none-point method are based may not be valid for certain soils,\nsuch as organic soils or soils from a marine environment. It is\nstrongly recommended that the liquid limit of these soils be\ndetermined by the multipoint method.\n1.4 The plastic limit test is performed on material prepared\nfor the liquid limit test.\n1.5 The liquid limit and plastic limit of soils (along with the\nshrinkage limit) are often collectively referred to as the\nAtterberg limits.

Signi\ufb01cance and Use\n5.1 These test methods are used as an integral part of several\nengineering classi\ufb01cation systems to characterize the \ufb01ne-\ngrained fractions of soils (see Practices D 2487 and D 3282)\nand to specify the \ufb01ne-grained fraction of construction mate-\nrials (see Speci\ufb01cation D 1241). The liquid limit, plastic limit,\nand plasticity index of soils are also used extensively, either\nindividually or together, with other soil properties to correlate\nwith engineering behavior such as compressibility, hydraulic\nconductivity (permeability), compactibility, shrink-swell, and\nshear strength.\n5.2 The liquid and plastic limits of a soil and its water\ncontent can be used to express its relative consistency or\nliquidity index. In addition, the plasticity index and the\npercentage \ufb01ner than 2-\u00b5m particle size can be used to\ndetermine its activity number.\n5.3 These methods are sometimes used to evaluate the\nweathering characteristics of clay-shale materials. When sub-\njected to repeated wetting and drying cycles, the liquid limits\nof these materials tend to increase. The amount of increase is\nconsidered to be a measure of a shale\u2019s susceptibility to\nweathering.\n5.4 The liquid limit of a soil containing substantial amounts\nof organic matter decreases dramatically when the soil is\noven-dried before testing. Comparison of the liquid limit of a\nsample before and after oven-drying can therefore be used as a\nqualitative measure of organic matter content of a soil (see\nPractice D 2487).",

Preparation of Test Specimen\n10.1  Wet Preparation Method \u2014Except where the dry\nmethod of specimen preparation is speci\ufb01ed (10.2), prepare the\nspecimen for testing as described in the following sections.\n10.1.1  Material Passes the 425-\u00b5m (No. 40) Sieve:\n10.1.1.1 Determine by visual and manual methods that the\nspecimen from 8.2 has little or no material retained on a\n425-\u00b5m (No. 40) sieve. If this is the case, prepare 150 to 200\ng of material by mixing thoroughly with distilled or deminer-\nalized water on the glass plate or mixing dish using the spatula.\nIf desired, soak the material in a mixing/storage dish with a\nsmall amount of water to soften the material before the start of\nmixing. If using Method A, adjust the water content of the\nmaterial to bring it to a consistency that would require about 25\nto 35 blows of the liquid limit device to close the groove (Note\n6). For Method B, the number of blows should be between\nabout 20 and 30 blows.\n10.1.1.2 If, during mixing, a small percentage of material is\nencountered that would be retained on a 425-\u00b5m (No. 40)\nsieve, remove these particles by hand (if possible). If it is\nimpractical to remove the coarser material by hand, remove\nsmall percentages (less than about 15 %) of coarser material by\nworking the material (having the above consistency) through a\n425-\u00b5m sieve. During this procedure, use a piece of rubber\nsheeting, rubber stopper, or other convenient device provided\nthe procedure does not distort the sieve or degrade material that\nwould be retained if the washing method described in 10.1.2\nwere used. If larger percentages of coarse material are encoun-\ntered during mixing, or it is considered impractical to remove\nthe coarser material by the procedures just described, wash the\nsample as described in 10.1.2. When the coarse particles found\nduring mixing are concretions, shells, or other fragile particles,\ndo not crush these particles to make them pass a 425-\u00b5m sieve,\nbut remove by hand or by washing.\n10.1.1.3 Place the prepared material in the mixing/storage\ndish, check its consistency (adjust if required), cover to prevent\nloss of moisture, and allow to stand (cure) for at least 16 h\n(overnight). After the standing period and immediately before\nstarting the test, thoroughly remix the soil.",

It\nhas no signi\ufb01cance if the thread breaks into threads of shorter\nlength. Roll each of these shorter threads to 3.2 mm in\ndiameter.

It is permis-\nsible, however, to reduce the total amount of deformation for\nfeebly plastic soils by making the initial diameter of the\nellipsoidal mass nearer to the required 3.2-mm \ufb01nal diameter.\nIf crumbling occurs when the thread has a diameter greater\nthan 3.2 mm, this shall be considered a satisfactory end point,\nprovided the soil has been previously rolled into a thread 3.2\nmm in diameter.
