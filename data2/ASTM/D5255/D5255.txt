<<HEADING level=2>>Standard Practice for
Certiﬁcation of Personnel Engaged in the Testing of Soil
and Rock 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation D 5255; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of
original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A
superscript epsilon ( e ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope *
1.1 This practice provides a guide for evaluation and certi-
ﬁcation procedures for personnel engaged in testing soil and
rock in accordance with ASTM test methods and is intended
for use by independent organizations providing certiﬁcation
services.
1.2 Qualiﬁcations for certiﬁcation candidates, qualiﬁcations
of those administering the certiﬁcation examinations, methods
of administering the certiﬁcation tests, and certain certiﬁcation
organization operating requirements are given.
1.3 Certiﬁcation is speciﬁc to a single ASTM test method. A
monitored written examination and a monitored performance
examination are normally required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>and details of a performance test. The qualiﬁcations of the
examiner and limitations on the relationship between the
examiner and the examinee are given in this practice.
4.2 The basic criteria provided by this practice is intended to
be supplemented by more speciﬁc criteria serving the require-
ments of the certiﬁcation organization.
4.3 It is unrealistic and unintended that each individual be
certiﬁed for every test that the employing agency performs.
Rather it should be a goal of an agency that a majority of
personnel normally performing a given test are certiﬁed.
Depending on the purpose of the testing, it may be appropriate
for the client to specify whether or not a certiﬁed technician
should perform a given test.
4.4 Although this practice calls for certiﬁcation speciﬁc to a
single ASTM test method, it is not intended that the certiﬁca-
tion organization avoid grouping related test methods in the
interest of efficiency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>nism for responding to inquiries from individuals and organi-
zations wanting to verify that a particular certiﬁcant has a
speciﬁc certiﬁcation.
5.4  Records :
5.4.1 The ﬁles of the certiﬁcation organization should con-
tain at least the following:
5.4.1.1 Examination identity and date administered,
5.4.1.2 Examination question source,
5.4.1.3 Identity and qualiﬁcations of written examination
proctor,
5.4.1.4 Identity and qualiﬁcations of performance examina-
tion examiner, and
5.4.1.5 Examination question performance statistics.
5.5  Evidence of Certiﬁcation :
5.5.1 Evidence of certiﬁcation shall be issued by the orga-
nization to the candidate upon successful completion of the
examinations. Certiﬁcation shall include the date of certiﬁca-
tion, the period of certiﬁcation, and the ASTM test method or
test methods for which the examinee is qualiﬁed.
5.5.1.1 The ASTM test method shall be listed by use of
“ASTM,” the test method designation, and the year of the
version used for the certiﬁcation, for example, “ASTM
D XXXX – 86.”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Certiﬁcation Organization
5.1  Structure :
5.1.1 The certiﬁcation organization shall be administratively
independent in matters pertaining to certiﬁcation. Administra-
tively independent means that all policy decisions relating to
certiﬁcation matters are the sole decision of the certifying
organization and not subject to approval by any other body and
that all ﬁnancial matters related to the operation of the
certifying organization are segregated from those of the parent
or affiliated organization.
5.1.1.1 A certifying organization that is not a legal entity in
and of itself shall provide proof that the organization’s gov-
erning body is administratively independent in certiﬁcation
matters from the organization of which it is part.
5.1.2 The certiﬁcation organization shall disclose, through
publication of a publicly available document, rules and proce-
dures that describe how the certiﬁcant, the employer, and the
specifying entity have input into the policies and decisions of
the organization.
5.2  Resources :
5.2.1 The certiﬁcation organization shall disclose, through
publication of a publicly available document, evidence that the
organization has the ﬁnancial resources to properly conduct the
certiﬁcation activities.
5.2.2 The certiﬁcation organization shall disclose, through
publication of a publicly available document, evidence that its
staff possesses the knowledge and skill necessary to conduct
the certiﬁcation activities or has available and makes use of
non-staff consultants and professionals to sufficiently supple-
ment staff knowledge and skill.
5.3  Responsibilities :
5.3.1 The certiﬁcation organization shall disclose, through
publication of a publicly available document, evidence that the
mechanism used to evaluate individual competence is objec-
tive, fair, and based on the knowledge and skills needed to
properly perform the test method(s).
5.3.2 The certiﬁcation organization shall publish, at least
annually, a summary of certiﬁcation activities to include
number tested, number passing the examinations, number
certiﬁed, and, when applicable, number re-certiﬁed.
5.3.3 The certiﬁcation organization shall provide a mecha-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. Examiner
6.1 The performance examination examiner shall be a
qualiﬁed professional with at least ﬁve years of experience at
performing and supervising the performance of a variety of
ASTM test methods and shall have repeatedly performed the
ASTM test method(s) the examinees will be performing.
6.1.1 The examiner shall not be a relative, a supervisor, or
an associate (co-worker) of the examinee.
6.1.1.1 When there is a possibility of conﬂict of interest,
documentation shall be attached to the examinee’s ﬁle certify-
ing that there is sufficient separation in the organization’s
structure between the examiner and examinee so that it is not
in the examiner’s interest whether or not the examinee is
certiﬁed.
6.2 In the interest of efficiency, use of qualiﬁed assistant
examiners may be appropriate.
6.2.1 The assistant examiner shall be an individual with at
least one-half year of experience at performing the ASTM test
method(s) and shall be certiﬁed for the ASTM test method(s)
the examinees will be performing.
6.2.2 The assistant examiner shall not be a relative, a
supervisor, or an associate (co-worker) of the examinee.
6.2.3 The assistant examiner, if used, shall assist the exam-
iner and cannot be used in lieu of the examiner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. Examinee
7.1 Examinee must be sufficiently literate to read and
answer questions of the written examination, to be capable of
performing required calculations, to place necessary data in
forms or unformatted data tables, and personally perform the
test method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8. Certiﬁcation and Recertiﬁcation
8.1 Initial certiﬁcation shall be valid for a period not to
exceed ﬁve years. This period for which the certiﬁcation is<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_3>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D 5255<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>valid shall be clearly and prominently stated on any documents
that attest to the certiﬁcation(s) held by the individual.
8.2 Recertiﬁcation shall be valid for a period not to exceed
ﬁve years. This recertiﬁcation action and the period for which
the recertiﬁcation is valid shall be clearly and prominently
stated on any documents that attest to the certiﬁcation(s) held
by the individual.
8.2.1 The recertiﬁcation process shall involve, as a mini-
mum, the performance examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>underlying the test method and the basis of some of the
required calculations for the test method should also be
stressed. The questions shall cover the test method elements
such as apparatus, specimen preparation, test procedure, and
report requirements.
9.3 The written examination shall be given in a room that
provides the lighting level, noise control, work space, ventila-
tion, and temperature control that is universally recognized as
necessary for a testing facility in which written examinations
are administered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  2—An appropriate written examination should be given if suffi-
cient changes to the test method have occurred which cannot be properly
covered by the performance exam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10. Performance Examination
10.1 The performance examination for each test method
shall be administered by one or more examiners meeting the
requirements of Section 6.
10.2 The examiner shall conduct the performance examina-
tion for a given ASTM test method in accordance with a
pre-established checklist that recognizes and weighs the steps
that must be done to properly perform the test method.
10.3 The performance examination shall be given in an
environment that duplicates or attempts to duplicate the envi-
ronment where the ASTM test method is normally conducted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3 Revocation of certiﬁcation for just cause shall occur
only after due process is provided to the person charged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. Written Examination
9.1 The written examination shall be prepared by qualiﬁed
professionals thoroughly familiar with the ASTM test meth-
od(s). The examination shall be changed periodically. All
measures required to prevent compromise of the examination
shall be taken.
9.1.1 When there is reasonable suspicion of compromise of
an examination, that examination shall not be used.
9.2 The examination shall stress the essentials of the ASTM
test method(s), as well as details. In particular, common
sources of error of the test should be the basis for a number of
examination questions. A basic understanding of the principles<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
