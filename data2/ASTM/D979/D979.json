If it were possible,\nthe entire load might be tested as a practical matter. A \ufb01eld sample is\ncomposed of three or more increments chosen at random from the material\nas it is loaded or unloaded from the truck. Research has shown that such\na procedure permits an acceptable estimate to be made of the average\ngradation that might be measured from 15 or 20 increments from the\ntruck.\nN OTE  4\u2014Signi\ufb01cant variability within a lot of material, where it might\nexist, should be indicated by statistical measures, such as the standard\ndeviation between units selected at random from within the lot.",
