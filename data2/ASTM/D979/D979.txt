1.1 This practice covers sampling of bituminous paving
mixtures at points of manufacture, storage, delivery, or in
place.
1.2  This standard does not purport to address all of the
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica-
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.
1.3 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the
standard. The values in parentheses are provided for informa-
tion purposes only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. Signiﬁcance and Use
4.1  General :
4.1.1 Sampling is equally as important as the testing, and
the sampler shall take every precaution to obtain samples that
will yield an acceptable estimate of the nature and conditions
of the materials which they represent.
4.1.2 Samples for the development of preliminary data are
obtained by the party responsible for the development of the
data. Samples for control of the product at the source of
manufacture or storage, or at the site of use, are obtained by the
manufacturer, contractor, or other parties responsible for ac-
complishing the work. Samples for tests to be used in accep-
tance or rejection decisions by the purchaser are obtained by
the purchaser or his authorized representative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Procedure
5.1  Inspection —The material shall be inspected to deter-
mine discernible variations. The seller shall provide equipment
needed for safe and appropriate inspection and sampling.
5.2  Sampling —The procedures for selecting locations or
times for sampling are described in Practice D 3665.
5.2.1  Sampling from a Conveyor Belt —Stop the conveyor
belt. Randomly select at least three areas of approximately
equal size on the belt for sampling. In each of the locations to
be sampled, insert templates, the shape of which conform to the
shape of the belt. From the selected areas obtain approximately
equal increments of material which will form a sample whose
quantity equals or exceeds the minimum recommended in
4.3.2. Carefully scoop all material between templates into a
suitable container.
5.2.2  Sampling from Truck Transports —By a random
method, select the units to be sampled from the production of
materials delivered. Obtain at least three approximately equal
increments. Avoid sampling the extreme top surface. Select at
random from the unit being sampled and combine to form a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>ﬁeld sample whose quantity equals or exceeds the minimum
recommended in 5.3.2. The sample may be obtained by
collecting the increments with a scoop or shovel.
5.2.3  Sampling from the Roadway Prior to Compaction —
When only one sample is to be taken, obtain at least three
approximately equal increments, selected at random from the
unit being sampled, and combine to form a ﬁeld sample whose
quantity equals or exceeds the minimum recommended in
5.3.2.
5.2.3.1 When three or more samples are to be taken in order
to evaluate a lot of material, utilize a random method to
determine the locations to be sampled. Select a sample,
consisting of approximately three equal increments, from each
location, assuring the quantity of each sample exceeds the
minimum recommended in 5.3.2.
5.2.3.2 Take all increments or samples from the roadway for
the full depth of the material, taking care to exclude any
underlying material. When necessary, place templates on the
existing roadway to exclude any underlying material. Clearly
mark the speciﬁed area from which each increment or sample
is to be removed. Templates which are placed before the
mixture is spread will be a deﬁnite aid securing increments of
approximately equal mass.
5.2.4  Sampling from a Skip Conveyor Delivering Mixture to
Bin Storage —Select the units to be sampled from the skip
conveyor by a random method based on the bin’s storage
capacity. Stop the skip conveyor immediately following pug
mill discharge. Dig a furrow 150 mm (6 in.) in depth extending
from the top to the bottom of the pile. Obtain three approxi-
mately equal increments from the top, middle, and bottom of
the furrow depositing each increment in a container. The
combined increments should form a ﬁeld sample whose
quantity equals or exceeds the minimum recommended in
5.3.2.
5.2.5  Sampling from a Funnel Device Feeding a Conveyor
for Mixture Delivery to Storage —Select the units to be
sampled from the funnel device by a random method based on
the bin’s maximum storage capacity. Obtain at least three
approximately equal increments of material for each sample by
passing a bucket or pan or other suitable container across the
full ﬂow of materials as it drops from the funnel device onto
the conveyor. The combined portions should form a ﬁeld
sample whose quantity equals or exceeds the minimum recom-
mended in 5.3.2.
5.2.6  Sampling from Roadway after Compaction —Select
the units to be sampled by a random method from the material
in place. Obtain at least three approximately equal samples
selected at random from the unit being sampled. Test each
sample and average the test results to determine the accept-
ability. Take all samples from the roadway for the full depth of
the material, taking care to exclude any underlying material.
Each increment shall be obtained by coring, sawing, or other
methods in such a manner as to ensure a minimum disturbance
of the material.
5.2.7  Sampling from Bituminous Cold Mix Stockpiles —
Cold mixes that are in a stockpile for some time may develop
a crust on the surface of the pile. This crust should be removed
to a depth of 100 mm, over an area of one square meter, to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>expose the unweathered mix. Stir the exposed stockpile and
obtain three approximately equal samples selected at random
from the unit being sampled, and combine to form a ﬁeld
sample whose quantity equals or exceeds the minimum recom-
mended in 5.3.2.
5.2.7.1 When three or more samples are to be taken, sample
in accordance with 5.2.3.1.
5.3  Number and Quantities of Field Samples :
5.3.1 The number of ﬁeld samples (obtained by one of the
methods described in 5.2) required depends on the criticality
of, and variation in, the properties to be measured. Designate
each unit from which a ﬁeld sample is to be obtained prior to
sampling. The number of ﬁeld samples from the production
should be sufficient to give the desired conﬁdence in test
results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1—Guidance for determining the number of samples required to
obtain the desired level of conﬁdence in test results may be found in
Method D 2234, Practice E 105, Practice E 122, and Practice E 141.
N OTE  2—The unit to be represented by a single ﬁeld sample should not
be so large as to mask the effects of signiﬁcant variability within the unit.
Nor should a unit be so small as to be affected by the inherent variability
between small portions of any bulk material.
N OTE  3—A unit of bulk material composed of graded aggregate or
aggregate mixtures might consist of a full truckload. If it were possible,
the entire load might be tested as a practical matter. A ﬁeld sample is
composed of three or more increments chosen at random from the material
as it is loaded or unloaded from the truck. Research has shown that such
a procedure permits an acceptable estimate to be made of the average
gradation that might be measured from 15 or 20 increments from the
truck.
N OTE  4—Signiﬁcant variability within a lot of material, where it might
exist, should be indicated by statistical measures, such as the standard
deviation between units selected at random from within the lot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2 A guide to the quantity of material in ﬁeld samples is
given in Table 1. The quantities depend on the type and number
of tests to which the material is to be subjected, and sufficient
material must be obtained to provide for the proper execution
of these tests. Standard control and acceptance tests are
covered by ASTM Standards and specify the portion of the
ﬁeld sample required for each speciﬁc test. Generally, the
amounts speciﬁed in Table 1 will provide adequate material for
routine testing. Extract test portions from the ﬁeld sample by
quartering or splitting in a similar manner to Practice C 702 or
as required by other applicable test methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
