<<HEADING level=2>>Standard Speciﬁcation for
Forged Carbon and Alloy Steel Flanges for Low-

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation A707/A707M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.

<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1 This speciﬁcation covers forged carbon and alloy steel
ﬂanges intended primarily for petroleum and gas pipelines in
areas subject to low ambient temperatures. Included are ﬂanges
to speciﬁed dimensions or to dimensional standards such as
those MSS, ASME, and API speciﬁcations that are referenced
in Section  2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>22.1 In addition to the marking requirements of Speciﬁca-
tion  A961/A961M , the following additional marking require-
ments apply:
22.1.1 The impact test temperature shall be legibly stamped
on each ﬂange.
22.1.2 If the ﬂanges have been quenched-and-tempered or
quenched-and-aged the letters QT or QA, as applicable, shall
be stamped on the ﬂanges following the ASTM designation.
22.1.3 Forgings repaired by welding shall be marked with
the letter “W” following the ASTM designation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18. Repair by Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18.1 Repair of imperfections shall be permitted only with
the approval of the purchaser. When approved, the limitations
and requirements of Speciﬁcation  A961/A961M  shall apply:
18.1.1 In addition, the deposited weld metal shall be capable
of producing welds with mechanical and impact test properties
as speciﬁed in  Table 2  at the test temperature speciﬁed in  Table
3  for the base metal after the thermal treatments in  18.1.2 .
SMAW (using only low-hydrogen electrodes), GMAW, FCAW
or GTAW may be used. Electrodes shall conform to the
applicable AWS A5 electrode speciﬁcation. The GMAW pro-
cess is limited to either the spray transfer or pulsed arc process.
FCAW process is limited to repair of carbon or carbon-
molybdenum base materials only. Welding procedures shall be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>22.2  Bar Coding— In addition to the requirements in  22.1 ,
bar coding is acceptable as a supplemental identiﬁcation
method. The purchaser may specify in the order a speciﬁc bar
coding system to be used. The bar coding system, if applied at
the discretion of the supplier, should be consistent with one of
the published industry standards for bar coding. If used on<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>S2.1 In addition to the requirements of Sections  9 ,  10 ,  11
and  14 , one tension specimen and one set of impact specimens
shall be obtained from a representative ﬂange at a location
agreed upon between the manufacturer and purchaser. The
results of these specimens shall comply with the requirements
of  Table 3  and  Table 1  and shall be reported to the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
