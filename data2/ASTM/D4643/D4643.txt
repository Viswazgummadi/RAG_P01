<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope *
1.1 This test method outlines procedures for determining the
water (moisture) content of soils by incrementally drying soil
in a microwave oven.
1.2 This test method can be used as a substitute for Test
Method D 2216 when more rapid results are desired to expe-
dite other phases of testing and slightly less accurate results are
acceptable.
1.3 When questions of accuracy between this test method
and Test Method D 2216 arise, Test Method D 2216 shall be
the referee method.
1.4 This test method is applicable for most soil types. For
some soils, such as those containing signiﬁcant amounts of
halloysite, mica, montmorillonite, gypsum or other hydrated
materials, highly organic soils, or soils in which the pore water
contains dissolved solids (such as salt in the case of marine
deposits), this test method may not yield reliable water content
values.
1.5 The values stated in SI units are to be regarded as the
standard.
1.6  This standard does not purport to address all of the
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica-
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.  See Section 7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. Terminology
3.1  Deﬁnitions:
3.1.1 All deﬁnitions are in accordance with Terminology
D 653.
3.2  Deﬁnitions of Terms Speciﬁc to This Standard:
3.2.1  microwave heating —a process by which heat is in-
duced within a material due to the interaction between dipolar
molecules of the material and an alternating, high frequency
electric ﬁeld. Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with 1
mm to 1 m wavelengths.
3.2.2  water (moisture) content —the ratio, expressed as a
percentage, of the mass of “pore” or “free” water in a given
mass of soil to the mass of the solid particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. Summary of Test Method
4.1 A moist soil specimen is placed in a suitable container
and its mass is determined. It is then placed in a microwave
oven, subjected to an interval of drying, and removed from the
oven and its new mass is determined. This procedure is
repeated until the mass becomes nearly constant.
4.2 The difference between the mass of the moist specimen
and the dried specimen is used as the mass of water originally
contained in the specimen. The water content is determined by
dividing the mass of water by the dry mass of soil, multiplied
by 100. For a given soil and sample size, the time to achieve a
constant dry mass can be noted and used as a minimum drying
time for subsequent tests using the same size specimen of the
same soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Signiﬁcance and Use
5.1 The water content of a soil is used throughout geotech-
nical engineering practice both in the laboratory and in the
ﬁeld. The use of Test Method D 2216 for water content
determination can be time consuming and there are occasions
when a more expedient method is desirable. The use of a
microwave oven is one such method.
5.2 The principal objection to the use of the microwave
oven for water-content determination has been the possibility
of overheating the soil, thereby yielding a water content higher
than would be determined by Test Method D 2216. While not
eliminating this possibility, the incremental drying procedure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>described in this test method will minimize its effects. Some
microwave ovens have settings at less than full power, which
can also be used to reduce overheating.
5.3 The behavior of a soil, when subjected to microwave
energy, is dependent on its mineralogical compositions, and as
a result no one procedure is applicable for all types of soil.
Therefore, the procedure recommended in this test method is
meant to serve as a guide when using the microwave oven.
5.4 This test method is best suited for minus No. 4 sized
material. Larger size particles can be tested; however, care
must be taken because of the increased chance of particle
shattering.
5.5 The use of this method may not be appropriate when
highly accurate results are required, or the test using the data is
extremely sensitive to moisture variations.
5.6 Due to the localized high temperatures that the specimen
is exposed to in microwave heating, the physical characteristics
of the soil may be altered. Degregation of individual particles
may occur, along with vaporization or chemical transition. It is
therefore recommended that samples used in this test method
not be used for other tests subsequent to drying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>wave to absorb energy after the moisture has been driven from
the test specimen. The heat sink reduces the possibility of
overheating the specimen and damage to the oven. Glass
beakers ﬁlled with water and materials that have a boiling point
above water, such as nonﬂammable oils, have been used
successfully. Moistened bricks have also been used.
6.7  Stirring Tools —Spatulas, putty knives, and glass rods
for cutting and stirring the test specimen before and during the
test. Short lengths of glass rods have been found useful for
stirring and may be left in the specimen container during
testing, reducing the possibility of specimen loss due to
adhesion to the stirring tool.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. Hazards
7.1 Handle hot containers with a container holder. Some soil
types can retain considerable heat, and serious burns could
result from improper handling.
7.2 Suitable eye protection is recommended due to the
possibility of particle shattering during the heating, mixing, or
mass determinations.
7.3 Safety precautions supplied by the manufacturer of the
microwave should be observed. Particular attention should be
paid to keeping the door sealing gasket and door interlocks
clean and in good working condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1—The quality of the results produced by this test method is
dependent on the competence of the personnel performing it and the
suitability of the equipment and facilities used. Agencies that meet the
criteria of Practice D 3740 are generally considered capable of competent
and objective testing. Users of this test method are cautioned that
compliance with Practice D 3740 does not in itself ensure reliable results.
Reliable results depend on many factors; Practice D 3740 provides a
means of evaluating some of those factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  3—The use of a microwave oven for the drying of soils may be
considered abusive by the manufacturers and consitute voiding of war-
ranties. Microwave drying of soils containing metallic materials may
cause arcing in the oven. Highly organic soils and soils containing oils and
coal may ignite and burn during microwave drying. Continued operation
of the oven after the soil has reached constant weight may also cause
damage or premature failure of the microwave oven.
N OTE  4—When ﬁrst introduced, microwave ovens were reported to
affect heart pacemakers, primarily because of the operating frequencies of
the two devices. Since that time, pacemakers have been redesigned, and
the microwave oven is not regarded as the health hazard it once was.
However, it may be advisable to post warnings that a microwave is in use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. Apparatus
6.1  Microwave Oven —A microwave oven, preferably with
a vented chamber, is suitable. The required size and power
rating of the oven is dependent on its intended use. Ovens with
variable power controls and input power ratings of about 700
W have been found to be adequate for this use. Variable power
controls are important and reduce the potential for overheating
of the test specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4 Highly organic soils and soils containing oil or other
contaminates may ignite into ﬂames during microwave drying.
Means for smothering ﬂames to prevent operator injury or oven
damage should be available during testing. Fumes given off
from contaminated soils or wastes may be toxic, and the oven
should be vented accordingly.
7.5 Due to the possibility of steam explosions, or thermal
stress shattering porous or brittle aggregates, a covering over
the sample container may be appropriate to prevent operator
injury or oven damage. A cover of heavy paper toweling has
been found satisfactory for this purpose. This also prevents
scattering of the test sample in the oven during the drying
cycle.
7.6 Do not use metallic containers in a microwave oven
because arcing and oven damage may result.
7.7 Observe manufacturer’s operating instructions when
installing and using the oven.
7.8 The placement of the test specimen directly on the glass
liner tray provided with some ovens is strongly discouraged.
The concentrated heating of the specimen may result in the
glass tray shattering, possibly causing injury to the operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  2—Microwave ovens equipped with built-in scales and computer
controls have been developed for use in drying soils. Their use is
compatible with this test method.
6.2  Balances , having a capacity of 2000 g or greater and
meeting the requirements of Speciﬁcation D 4753 for a balance
of 0.1 g readability.
6.3  Specimen Containers —Suitable containers made of a
nonmetallic nonabsorbent material, resistant to thermal shock,
and not subject to changes in mass or shape when subjected to
repeated heating, cooling, or cleaning. Porcelain evaporating
dishes and standard borosilicate glass dishes perform satisfac-
torily. Other containers, such as paper cups or plates, also have
been used satisfactorily; however, they may require pre-drying
prior to use.
6.4  Container Handling Apparatus —A glove or holder,
suitable for removing hot containers from the oven.
6.5  Desiccator —A desiccator cabinet or jar of suitable size
containing silica gel, anhydrous calcium phosphate, or equiva-
lent. It is preferable to use a desiccant that changes color to
indicate that it needs reconstitution.
6.6  Heat Sink —A material or liquid placed in the micro-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

cans, and the like) or unsealed sample bags are used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>sample for this test method. Precautions should be taken to
obtain a sample of the same water (moisture) content. The
comparison sample should be processed as quickly as possible
to avoid moisture losses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10. Conditioning
10.1 Prepare and process the specimens as quickly as
possible to minimize unrecorded moisture loss that will result
in erroneous water content determinations.
10.2 Cut or break up the soil into small size aggregations to
aid in obtaining more uniform drying of the specimen.
10.3 If the specimens are not to be tested immediately, store
them in sealed containers to prevent loss of moisture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. Test Specimen
9.1 For water contents being determined as part of another
ASTM test method, the specimen selection process and tech-
niques speciﬁed in that test method should be followed.
9.2 The manner in which the test specimen is selected and
its required mass is basically dependent on the purpose
(application) of the test, type of material being tested, and the
type of sample (specimen from another test, bag, tube, split-
barrel, and the like). In all cases, however, a representative
portion of the total sample shall be selected. If a thinly layered
soil or more than one soil type is encountered, select an
average portion or individual portions, or both, and note which
portion(s) was tested in the report of the results.
9.2.1 For bulk samples, select the test specimen from the
material after it has been mixed thoroughly. The mass of moist
material selected shall be in accordance with Table 1.
9.2.2 For small (jar) samples, select a representative portion
in accordance with the following procedure:
9.2.2.1 For cohesionless soils, mix thoroughly the material,
then select a test specimen having a mass of moist material in
accordance with Table 1.
9.2.2.2 For cohesive soils, remove about 3 mm of material
from the exposed periphery of the sample and slice the
remaining specimen in half (to check if the material is layered),
prior to selecting the test specimen. If the soil is layered, see
9.2. The mass of moist material selected should be in accor-
dance with Table 1, if coarse-grained particles are noted.
Breaking or cutting of cohesive samples to approximately
6-mm ( 1 ⁄ 4 -in.) particles will speed drying and prevent crusting
or the overheating of the surface while drying the interior.
9.3 Using a test specimen smaller than the minimum mass
indicated previously requires discretion, though it may be
adequate for the purpose of the test. A specimen having a mass
less than the previously indicated value shall be noted in the
report of the results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11. Procedure
11.1 Determine the mass of a clean, dry container or dish,
and record.
11.2 Place the soil specimen in the container, and immedi-
ately determine and record the mass.
11.3 Place the soil and container in a microwave oven with
the heat sink and turn the oven on for 3 min. If experience with
a particular soil type and specimen size indicates shorter or
longer initial drying times can be used without overheating, the
initial and subsequent drying times may be adjusted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  6—The 3-min initial setting is for a minimum sample mass of
100 g, as indicated in Table 1. Smaller samples are not recommended
when using the microwave oven because drying may be too rapid for
proper control. When very large samples are needed to represent soil
containing large gravel particles, the sample may need to be split into
segments and dried separately to obtain the dry mass of the total sample.
N OTE  7—Most ovens have a variable power setting. For the majority of
soils tested, a setting of “high” should be satisfactory; however, for some
soils such a setting may be too severe. The proper setting can be
determined only through the use of and experience with a particular oven
for various soil types and sample sizes. The energy output of microwave
ovens may decrease with age and usage; therefore, power settings and
drying times should be established for each oven.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11.4 After the set time has elapsed, remove the container
and soil from the oven, either weigh the specimen immediately,
or place in desiccator to cool to allow handling and to prevent
damage to the balance. Determine and record the mass.
11.5 With a small spatula or knife or short length of glass
rod carefully mix the soil, taking special precaution not to lose
any soil.
11.6 Return the container and soil to the oven and reheat in
the oven for 1 min.
11.7 Repeat 11.4-11.6, until the change between two con-
secutive mass determinations would have an insigniﬁcant
effect on the calculated moisture content. A change of 0.1 % or
less of the initial wet mass of the soil should be acceptable for
most specimens.
11.8 Use the ﬁnal mass determination in calculating the
water content. Obtain this value immediately after the heating
cycle, or, if the mass determination is to be delayed, after
cooling in dessicator.
11.9 When routine testing of similar soils is contemplated,
the drying times and number of cycles may be standardized for
each oven. When standardized drying times and cycles are
utilized, periodic veriﬁcation to assure that the results of the
ﬁnal dry mass determination are equivalent to the procedure in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  5—In many cases, when working with a small sample containing
a relatively large coarse-grained particle, it is appropriate not to include
this particle in the test specimen. If this occurs, it should be noted in the
report of the results.
9.4 When results of a water (moisture) content determina-
tion by the use of this test method are to be compared to the
results of another method, such as Test Method D 2216, a
second sample should be obtained during the selection of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  8—Incremental heating, together with stirring, will minimize
overheating and localized drying of the soil, thereby yielding results more
consistent with results obtained by Test Method D 2216. The recom-
mended time increments have been suitable for most specimens having
particles smaller than a No. 4 sieve and with a mass of approximately 200
g; however, they may not be appropriate for all soils and ovens, and
adjustment may be necessary.
N OTE  9—Water content specimens should be discarded after testing and
not used in any other tests due to particle breakdown, chemical changes or
losses, melting, or losses of organic constituents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  10—Water (moisture) content determinations conducted in accor-
dance with Test Method D 2216 or other methods may be recorded on the
same report. This is not a mandatory requirement, but may be convenient
when the results of the two methods are to be compared.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14. Precision and Bias
14.1  Precision —Studies on microwave drying have indi-
cated a single-laboratory average precision of 0.96 % or less,
depending upon the soil type, initial moisture, and specimen
size.
14.2 The precision of this test method is operator-
dependent, and is a function of the care exercised in perform-
ing the steps of the procedure, giving particular attention to
careful control and systematic repetition of the procedures
used.
14.3  Bias —There is no accepted reference value for this test
method, therefore, bias cannot be determined.
14.3.1 Studies to determine bias between this test method
and Test Method D 2216 using a convection drying oven
indicate that the mean difference between the value of water
content, expressed as a percentage of mass, when tested by the
microwave oven and the convection oven is 0.24 % for
micaceous soils (having 5 to 25 % mica particles by mass), and
0.61 % for other soils. The standard deviation of the value of
the difference between the water content, expressed as a
percentage of mass, by the microwave and convection oven
methods is 0.2 % for the micaceous soils and 0.3 % for other
soils.
14.4 Subcommittee D18.08 is seeking pertinent data from
users of this test method on precision and bias comparisons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
