This procedure is\nrepeated until the mass becomes nearly constant.\n4.2 The difference between the mass of the moist specimen\nand the dried specimen is used as the mass of water originally\ncontained in the specimen. The water content is determined by\ndividing the mass of water by the dry mass of soil, multiplied\nby 100.

In all cases, however, a representative\nportion of the total sample shall be selected. If a thinly layered\nsoil or more than one soil type is encountered, select an\naverage portion or individual portions, or both, and note which\nportion(s) was tested in the report of the results.\n9.2.1 For bulk samples, select the test specimen from the\nmaterial after it has been mixed thoroughly. The mass of moist\nmaterial selected shall be in accordance with Table 1.\n9.2.2 For small (jar) samples, select a representative portion\nin accordance with the following procedure:\n9.2.2.1 For cohesionless soils, mix thoroughly the material,\nthen select a test specimen having a mass of moist material in\naccordance with Table 1.\n9.2.2.2 For cohesive soils, remove about 3 mm of material\nfrom the exposed periphery of the sample and slice the\nremaining specimen in half (to check if the material is layered),\nprior to selecting the test specimen.
