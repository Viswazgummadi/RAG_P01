<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope*
1.1 This speciﬁcation covers hot-rolled, carbon, structural,
high-strength low-alloy, and high-strength low-alloy with im-
proved formability steel sheet and strip, in coils and cut
lengths.
1.2 Hot rolled steel sheet and strip is available in the
designations as listed in 4.1.
1.3 This speciﬁcation is not applicable to the steel covered
by Speciﬁcation A 635/A 635M.
1.4 The values stated in either inch-pound units or SI units
are to be regarded separately as standard. Within the text, the
SI units are shown in brackets. The values stated in each
system are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must
be used independently of the other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. Terminology
3.1  Deﬁnitions —For deﬁnitions of other terms used in this
speciﬁcation refer to Terminology A 941.
3.2  Deﬁnitions of Terms Speciﬁc to This Standard:
3.2.1  aging —loss of ductility with an increase in hardness,
yield strength, and tensile strength that occurs when steel,
which has been slightly cold worked (such as by temper
rolling) is stored for some time.
3.2.1.1  Discussion —Aging also increases the tendency to-
ward stretcher strains and ﬂuting.
3.2.2  stabilization —the addition of one or more nitride or
carbide forming elements, or both, such as titanium and
columbium, to control the level of the interstitial elements
carbon and nitrogen in the steel.
3.2.2.1  Discussion —Stabilization improves formability and
increases resistance to aging.
3.2.3  vacuum degassing —a process of reﬁning liquid steel
in which the liquid is exposed to a vacuum as part of a special
technique for removing impurities or for decarburizing the
steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A  Where an ellipsis (. . .) appears in the table, there is no requirement but the analysis shall be reported.
B  The sum of copper, nickel, chromium, and molybdenum shall not exceed 0.50 % on heat analysis. When one or more of these elements are speciﬁed by the purchaser,
the sum does not apply, in which case, only the individual limits on the remaining unspeciﬁed elements shall apply.
C  When copper is speciﬁed, the copper limit is a minimum requirement. When copper steel is not speciﬁed, the copper limit is a maximum requirement.
D  For SS steels, the sum of chromium and molybdenum shall not exceed 0.16 % on heat analysis. When one or more of these elements are speciﬁed by the purchaser
the sum does not apply, in which case, the individual limit on the remaining unspeciﬁed element shall apply.
E  For each reduction of 0.01 % below the speciﬁed carbon maximum, an increase of 0.06 % manganese above the speciﬁed maximum will be permitted up to a maximum
of 1.50 % .
F  The purchaser has the option of restricting the nitrogen content. It should be noted that, depending on the microalloying scheme (for example, use of Vanadium) of
the producer, nitrogen may be a deliberate addition. Consideration should be made for the use of nitrogen binding elements (for example, Vanadium, Titanium).
G  For HSLAS steels, it is permissible to add columbium and vanadium singly or in combination.
H  These steels shall also contain one or more of the following elements: vanadium, titanium, and columbium. Other alloying elements are permissible, but are not
required.
I  These steels may be treated for inclusion control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2 Each of the elements listed in Tables 1 and 2 shall be
included in the report of the heat analysis. When the amount of
copper, nickel, chromium, or molybdenum is less than 0.02 %,
report the analysis as <0.02 % or the actual determined value.
When the amount of vanadium, columbium, or titanium is less
than 0.008 %, report the analysis as <0.008 % or the actual
determined value.
7.3 Sheet steel grades deﬁned by this speciﬁcation are
suitable for welding if appropriate welding conditions are
selected. For certain welding processes, if more restrictive
composition limits are desirable, they shall be speciﬁed at the
time of inquiry and conﬁrmed at the time of ordering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

B  A minimum and maximum tensile strength has been speciﬁed for SS36 Type 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.2.1  Requirements —Material as represented by the test
specimen shall conform to the mechanical property require-
ments speciﬁed in Table 4. These requirements do not apply to
the uncropped ends of unprocessed coils.
8.2.2.2  Number of Tests —Two tension tests shall be made
from each heat or from each 50 tons [45 000 kg]. When the
amount of ﬁnished material from a heat is less than 50 tons
[45 000 kg], one tension test shall be made. When material
rolled from one heat differs 0.050 in. [1.27 mm] or more in
thickness, one tension test shall be made from the thickest and
thinnest material regardless of the weight represented.
8.2.2.3 Tension test specimens shall be taken at a point
immediately adjacent to the material to be qualiﬁed.
8.2.2.4 Tension test specimens shall be taken from the full
thickness of the sheet as-rolled.
8.2.2.5 Tension test specimens shall be taken from a loca-
tion approximately halfway between the center of sheet and the
edge of the material as-rolled.
8.2.2.6 Tension test specimens shall be taken with the
lengthwise axis of the test specimen parallel to the rolling
direction (longitudinal test)
8.2.2.7  Test Method —Yield strength shall be determined by
either the 0.2 % offset method or the 0.5 % extension under
load method unless otherwise speciﬁed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3  Bending Properties :
8.2.3.1 The suggested minimum inside radii for cold bend-
ing are listed in Appendix X1 and is discussed in more detail
in Speciﬁcations A 568/A 568M (6.6) and A 749/A 749M
(7.6). Where a tighter bend radius is required, where curved or
offset bends are involved, or where stretching or drawing are
also a consideration, the producer shall be consulted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9. Finish and Appearance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1  Surface Finish :
9.1.1 Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the material shall be fur-
nished as rolled, that is, without removing the hot-rolled oxide
or scale.
9.1.2 When required, it is permissible to specify that the
material be pickled or blast cleaned (descaled).
9.2  Oiling :
9.2.1 Unless otherwise speciﬁed, as-rolled material shall be
furnished not oiled (that is, dry), and pickled or blast cleaned
material shall be furnished oiled.
9.3  Edges :
9.3.1 Steel sheet is available with mill edge or cut edge.
9.3.2 Steel strip is available with mill edge or cut edge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10. Retests and Resamples
10.1  Retests —If the results on an original tension test
specimen are within 2 ksi [14 MPa] of the required tensile
strength, within 1 ksi [7 MPa] of the required yield strength, or
within 2 percentage points of the required elongation, a retest
shall be permitted for which one test specimen selected at
random shall be tested. If the results on this retest specimen
satisfy the speciﬁed mechanical properties and all other re-
quirements of the applicable speciﬁcation are satisﬁed, the
material shall be accepted. Retests are permitted in accordance
with Speciﬁcation A 568/A 568M.
10.2  Resamples —Resamples are permitted in accordance
with Speciﬁcation A 568/A 568M.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12. Product Marking
12.1 In addition to the requirements of Speciﬁcation A 568/
A 568M for sheet and Speciﬁcation A 749/A 749M for strip,
each lift or coil shall be marked with the designation shown on
the order {CS (Type A, B, or C), DS (Type A or B), SS (Grade
and for SS36, Type), HSLAS (Grade and Class), or HSLAS-F
(Grade)}. The designation shall be legibly stenciled on the top
of each lift or shown on a tag attached to each coil or shipping
unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11. Certiﬁcation
11.1 A report of heat analysis shall be supplied, if requested,
for CS and DS steels. For material with required mechanical
properties, SS, HSLAS, and HSLAS-F, a report is required of
heat analysis and mechanical properties as determined by the
tension test.
11.2 The report shall include the purchase order number; the
ASTM designation number and year date; product designation;
grade; type or class, as applicable; the heat number; and as
required, heat analysis and mechanical properties as indicated
by the tension test.
11.3 A signature is not required on the test report. However,
the document shall clearly identify the organization submitting<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

requirements of Test Method E 18.
N OTE  3—The hardness values are Rockwell B scale as measured or
converted from the appropriate Rockwell scales.
N OTE  4—The typical hardness values apply to the full range of steel
sheet thickness. Hardness tends to increase as the steel sheet thickness
decreases.
N OTE  5—Hardness testing is commonly used to assess the relative
formability of various designations of uncoated steel sheet. This assess-
ment done by many users is recognized to be only an approximation of the
relative formability and therefore cannot be used as a speciﬁcation
requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
