<<HEADING level=3>>Designation: D 1599 – 99 (Reapproved 2005)
An American National Standard<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>Standard Test Method for
Resistance to Short-Time Hydraulic Pressure of Plastic
Pipe, Tubing, and Fittings 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation D 1599; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of
original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A
superscript epsilon ( e ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the Department of Defense.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope
1.1 This test method covers the determination of the resis-
tance of either thermoplastic or reinforced thermosetting resin
pipe, tubing, or ﬁttings to hydraulic presssure in a short time
period. Procedure A is used to determine burst pressure of a
specimen if the mode of failure is to be determined. Procedure
B is used to determine that a specimen complies with a
minimum burst requirement.
1.2 This test method is suitable for establishing laboratory
testing requirements for quality control purposes or for pro-
curement speciﬁcations.
1.3 The values given in parentheses are provided for infor-
mation purposes only.
1.4  This standard does not purport to address all of the
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the
responsibility of whoever uses this standard to consult and
establish appropriate safety and health practices and deter-
mine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. Summary of Test Method
3.1 This test method consists of loading a specimen to
failure, or a predetermined minimum level, in short-time
interval by means of continuously increasing internal
hydraulic-pressure while immersed in a controlled-temperature
environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. Signiﬁcance and Use
4.1 This test method establishes the short-time hydraulic
failure pressure of thermoplastic or reinforced thermosetting
resin pipe, tubing, or ﬁttings. Data obtained by this test method
are of use only in predicting the behavior of pipe, tubing, and
ﬁttings under conditions of temperature, time, method of
loading, and hoop stress similar to those used in the actual test.
They are generally not indicative of the long-term strength of
thermoplastic or reinforced thermosetting resin pipe, tubing,
and ﬁttings.
4.2 Procurement speciﬁcations utilizing this test method
may stipulate a minimum and maximum time for failure other
than the 60 to 70 s listed in  9.1.3 . Either the internal hydraulic
pressure or the hoop stress may be listed in the requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  1—Many thermoplastics give signiﬁcantly different burst
strengths depending on the time to failure. For instance, signiﬁcant
differences have been observed between failure times of 65 and 85 s.
4.3 This test method is also used as a short-term pressur-
ization validation procedure, where the specimens are pressur-
ized to a predetermined minimum pressure requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Failure
5.1 Any instantaneous or rapid loss of pressure shall con-
stitute failure.
5.2 Any visible passage of ﬂuid through the wall of the
specimen shall constitute failure.
5.3 Any loss of pressure that interrupts the continuous and
uniform pressure increase, described in  9.1.3 , shall constitute
failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4 Leakage at the end closure or fracture of the specimen in
the immediate vicinity of the end closure shall be considered as
an invalid test item, not a failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ﬁttings, a metal band not extending more than one third of the threaded or
socket depth, may be used: When the mode of failure of a piping system
is to be determined, no reinforcement shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. Test Specimen
7.1  Pipe or Tubing :
7.1.1  Specimen Size— For pipe sizes of 6 in. (150 mm) or
less, the specimen length between the end closures shall be not
less than ﬁve times the outside diameter of the pipe, but in no
case less than 12 in. (300 mm). For larger sizes, the minimum
length shall be not less than three times the outside diameter,
but in no case less than 30 in. (760 mm).
7.1.2  Sample Size —Unless otherwise speciﬁed ﬁve speci-
mens shall be tested.
7.1.3  Measurements —Dimensions shall be determined in
accordance with Test Method  D 2122  or Practice  D 3567 .
7.2  Fittings :
7.2.1  Specimen Size— Specimens shall consist of complete
ﬁttings without alteration.
7.2.2  Sample Size —Unless otherwise speciﬁed ﬁve speci-
mens shall be tested.
7.2.3  Specimen Surface —All surfaces of the specimens
shall be free of visible ﬂaws, scratches, or other imperfections,
except for the usual marks common on good extrusions and
molding, unless these imperfections are being investigated, in
which case the purpose shall be included in the report along
with a description of the imperfections.
7.3  Systems (Pipe, Fittings, and Joints) :
7.3.1 Systems shall be prepared from pipe and ﬁttings
meeting the requirements of  7.1  and  7.2 , unless otherwise
speciﬁed.
7.3.2 The pipe and ﬁttings shall be joined as recommended
by the manufacturer using solvent cement, heat fusion, or other
techniques. When solvent cements are used they shall meet the
requirements of the relevant solvent cement speciﬁcation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6. Apparatus
6.1  Constant-Temperature Bath —A water bath or other
ﬂuid bath equipped so that uniform temperature is maintained
throughout the bath. This may require agitation. If an air or
other gaseous environment is used, provisions shall be made
for adequate circulation. Unless otherwise stated, the tests shall
be conducted at 23  6  2°C (73 6  3.6°F). The tolerance on other
test temperatures shall be  6  2°C (3.6°F). Fluid environments
that chemically attack the specimens shall not be used unless
this effect is being studied. In that case, the purpose of the test
shall be included in the report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  2—Reinforced thermosetting resin pipe and ﬁttings may show
increasing failure pressures as temperature is raised above 23°C in this
test.
6.2  Pressurizing System —A device capable of applying an
essentially continuously increasing internal hydraulic pressure
to the test specimen. Suggested equipment for this test may
include the following:
6.2.1  Nitrogen Supply (Cylinder Gas)  with a pressure regu-
lator and hydraulic accumulator, or
6.2.1.1  Pump , capable of applying essentially continuously
increasing internal hydraulic pressure to the test specimen.
6.3  Pressure Gage , having a precision of not less than 1 %
of full-scale deﬂection with a maximum indicating hand. The
pressure gage shall be selected such that the ﬁnal readings are
in the mid-60 % of the scale. The gage should be equipped with
a surge protection device.
6.3.1 The gage shall be located in the test system at a
location such that it only indicates pressure on the specimen
and not indicate pressure built up by water ﬂowing in the
supply lines to the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. Conditioning
8.1 Test specimens shall be conditioned at the test tempera-
ture for a minimum of 1 h in a liquid bath or 16 h in a gaseous
medium before pressurizing, unless otherwise speciﬁed. Unless
otherwise agreed upon, the test temperature shall be 23  6  2°C
(73  6  3.6°F) for thermoplastic pipe. For thermosets, test at 23
6  2°C or at maximum rated temperature depending on
intended service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  3—When testing materials such as Polyoleﬁns that change in
volume greatly before rupture, a large diameter water supply line or
location of the gage on the specimen should be used to eliminate
erroneous readings caused by the pressure drop in the water supply line.
6.4  Timing Device —Stop watch or equivalent.
6.5  Specimen End Closures :
6.5.1  Pipe or Tubing —Either free-end or restrained-end
closures, that will withstand the maximum test pressures, may
be used. Closures shall be designed so that they do not cause
failure of the specimen. Free-end closures shall be used for
referee tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9. Procedure
9.1  Procedure A :
9.1.1 Attach the end closures to the specimen and ﬁll it
completely with test ﬂuid which is maintained at the test
temperature. Attach specimen to the pressuring device, making
certain no gas is entrapped when using liquids. The specimen
shall be completely immersed in the conditioning medium.
9.1.2 Condition the specimen as speciﬁed in  8.1 .
9.1.3 Increase the pressure uniformly and continuously until
the specimen fails, measuring the time with a stop watch. If
failure time is less than 60 s, reduce the rate of loading and
repeat the test. The time to failure for all specimens shall be
between 60 and 70 s.
9.1.4 Record the pressure and time-to-failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  4—Free-end closures fasten to the specimen so that internal
pressure produces longitudinal tensile stresses in addition to hoop and
radial stesses in the pipe wall. Restrained-end closures rely on a rod
through the specimen or an external structure to resist the end thrust.
Stresses in the wall of restrained-end specimens act in the hoop and radial
directions only. Because of this difference in loading, the expected hoop
stress at failure in free-end specimens of solid-wall thermoplastic pipes are
approximately 11 % lower than in restrained-end specimens. The test
results will reﬂect this difference in test method.
6.5.2  Fittings —Caps and plugs for ﬁttings shall not extend
beyond the bottom thread or the bottom of the socket.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>11.1.3 Pipe dimensions, including nominal size, minimum
wall thickness, and average outside diameter. For reinforced
thermosetting pipe, wall thickness and outside diameter shall
be reinforced dimensions only. Unreinforced thicknesses shall
also be reported. For ﬁttings, report nominal size and schedule,
or pressure rating.
11.1.4 Type of end closure used, that is, free or restrained,
11.1.5 Number of specimens tested.
11.1.6 Test temperature.
11.1.7 Test environment, including conditioning time.
11.1.8 Purpose of the tests. Refer also to  6.1  and  7.2.3 .
11.1.9 Failure pressure and failure time (Procedure A or B)
or minimum pressure reached and time to reach minimum
pressure (Procedure B) for each specimen.
11.1.10 For pipe, calculate the average maximum stress and
the standard deviation.
11.1.11 Type of failure for Procedure A (bursting, cracking,
splitting, weeping, leaking).
11.1.12 Date of test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  6—If additional data can be obtained by continued pressurization
after failure (as deﬁned in Section  5 ), it is the tester’s prerogative to do so
but is beyond the scope of this method.
9.2  Procedure B :
9.2.1 Prepare the test specimen in the same way as de-
scribed in Procedure A ( 9.1.1  to  9.1.2 ).
9.2.2 Increase the pressure uniformly and continuously,
measuring the time. To determine that the specimen complies
with a minimum burst requirement the specimen shall burst
between 60 and 70 s, or the minimum burst pressure shall be
reached or exceeded between 60 and 70 s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10. Calculation
10.1 Calculate the pipe hoop stress as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S  5  P  ~ D  2  t ! /2 t  for outside diameter controlled pipe<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S  5  P  ~ d  1  t ! /2 t  for inside diameter controlled pipe<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12. Precision and Bias   3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S
= hoop stress, psi (or MPa),
P
= internal pressure, psi (or MPa),
D  = average outside diameter, in. (or mm). For reinforced
thermosetting pipe, outside diameter shall not include
nonreinforced covers,
d
= average inside diameter, in. (or mm), and
t
= minimum wall thickness, in. (or mm). For reinforced
thermosetting pipe use minimum reinforced wall thick-
ness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12.1  Precision 3 —Based on a mini laboratory round-robin
conducted on 2-in. medium density polyethylene pipe, the
precision (one standard deviation) of this test method for
medium density polyethylene pipe is as follows:
12.1.1 Within-laboratory,  6 3 % (repeatability).
12.1.2 Between-laboratory,  6 6 % (reproducibility).
12.2  Bias —Data obtained using this test method are be-
lieved to be reliable, since accepted techniques of analysis are
used. However, because no referee method is available, no bias
statement can be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N OTE  7—An alternative method for calculating the hoop stress of
reinforced pipe is given in the Annex of Speciﬁcation  D 3517 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
