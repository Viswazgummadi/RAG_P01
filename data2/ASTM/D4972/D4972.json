Such measure-\nments are used in the agricultural, environmental, and natural\nresources \ufb01elds. This measurement determines the degree of\nacidity or alkalinity in soil materials suspended in water and a\n0.01  M  calcium chloride solution. Measurements in both\nliquids are necessary to fully de\ufb01ne the soil\u2019s pH. This variable\nis useful in determining the solubility of soil minerals and the\nmobility of ions in the soil and assessing the viability of the\nsoil-plant environment. A more detailed discussion of the\nusefulness of this parameter is not warranted here; however, it\ncan be found in many discussions of the subject. A few such\ndiscussions are given as Refs  (1-6) 2   at the end of the text.\n1.2 The values given in SI units are to be regarded as the\nstandard.\n1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the\nsafety concerns, if any, associated with its use.

Signi\ufb01cance and Use\n5.1 The pH of the soil is a useful variable in determining the\nsolubility of soil minerals and the mobility of ions in the soil\nand assessing the viability of the soil-plant environment.\n5.2 pH measurements are made in both water and a calcium\nchloride solution because the calcium displaces some of the\nexchangeable aluminum. The low ionic strength counters the\ndilution effect on the exchange equilibrium by setting the salt\nconcentration of the solution closer to that expected in the soil\nsolution. The pH values obtained in the solution of calcium\nchloride are slightly lower than those measured in water due to\nthe release of more aluminum ions which then hydrolyses.\nTherefore, both measurements are required to fully de\ufb01ne the\ncharacter of the soil\u2019s pH.\n5.3 For the purpose of this test method the test soil must be\nsieved through a No. 10 sieve (2 mm sieve mesh openings).\nMeasurements on soils or soil fractions having particle sizes\nlarger than 2 mm by this test method may be invalid. If soil or\nsoil fractions with particles larger than 2 mm are used, it must\nbe stated in the report since the results may be signi\ufb01cantly\ndifferent.\n5.4 All water used for this test method must be ASTM Type\nIII or better. Type III water is de\ufb01ned by Speci\ufb01cation D 1193.\nIt is prepared by distillation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, or\na combination thereof.",
