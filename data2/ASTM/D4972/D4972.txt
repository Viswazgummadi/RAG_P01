<<HEADING level=3>>Standard Test Method for
pH of Soils 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation D 4972; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year of
original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval. A
superscript epsilon ( e ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope *
1.1 This test method covers the measurement of the pH of
soils for uses other than for corrosion testing. Such measure-
ments are used in the agricultural, environmental, and natural
resources ﬁelds. This measurement determines the degree of
acidity or alkalinity in soil materials suspended in water and a
0.01  M  calcium chloride solution. Measurements in both
liquids are necessary to fully deﬁne the soil’s pH. This variable
is useful in determining the solubility of soil minerals and the
mobility of ions in the soil and assessing the viability of the
soil-plant environment. A more detailed discussion of the
usefulness of this parameter is not warranted here; however, it
can be found in many discussions of the subject. A few such
discussions are given as Refs  (1-6) 2   at the end of the text.
1.2 The values given in SI units are to be regarded as the
standard.
1.3  This standard does not purport to address all of the
safety concerns, if any, associated with its use. It is the
responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appro-
priate safety and health practices and determine the applica-
bility of regulatory limitations prior to use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

3.1  Deﬁnitions:
3.1.1 For common deﬁnitions of terms used in this standard,
refer to Terminology D 653.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4. Summary of Test Method
4.1 Measurement of the pH of soils in both suspensions of
water and a calcium chloride solution are made with either a
potentiometer using a pH sensitive electrode system (Method
A), or pH sensitive paper (Method B). The potentiometer is
calibrated with buffer solutions of known pH. The pH sensitive
paper is a less accurate measurement and should only be used
for a rough estimate of the soil pH. The electrode must be used
for this measurement unless the pH sensitive paper is speciﬁed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. Signiﬁcance and Use
5.1 The pH of the soil is a useful variable in determining the
solubility of soil minerals and the mobility of ions in the soil
and assessing the viability of the soil-plant environment.
5.2 pH measurements are made in both water and a calcium
chloride solution because the calcium displaces some of the
exchangeable aluminum. The low ionic strength counters the
dilution effect on the exchange equilibrium by setting the salt
concentration of the solution closer to that expected in the soil
solution. The pH values obtained in the solution of calcium
chloride are slightly lower than those measured in water due to
the release of more aluminum ions which then hydrolyses.
Therefore, both measurements are required to fully deﬁne the
character of the soil’s pH.
5.3 For the purpose of this test method the test soil must be
sieved through a No. 10 sieve (2 mm sieve mesh openings).
Measurements on soils or soil fractions having particle sizes
larger than 2 mm by this test method may be invalid. If soil or
soil fractions with particles larger than 2 mm are used, it must
be stated in the report since the results may be signiﬁcantly
different.
5.4 All water used for this test method must be ASTM Type
III or better. Type III water is deﬁned by Speciﬁcation D 1193.
It is prepared by distillation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, or
a combination thereof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6. Interferences
6.1 This test method as measured by a pH probe has
possible interferences due to a suspension effect or sedimen-
tation potential. Users interested in a detailed discussion of the<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>mechanism of this effect can ﬁnd it in Refs  (5)  and  (6) .
6.2 This effect is the main reason Test Method G 51 can not
be used for general measurement of pH outside of that for
corrosion analysis. Test Method G 51 measures pH (an aque-
ous parameter) without adding any aqueous phase to the soil.
This results in excessive soil particle-pH probe contact that
overestimates the activity of the hydrogen ions in solution and
is therefore unacceptable for general soil analysis.
6.3 The suspension effect can be mitigated by careful
attention to 10.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

9.1 Calibrate the pH meter using the acid potassium phtha-
late and phosphate buffer solutions. Adjustment of the pH
meter should follow the manufacturer’s direction.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10. Procedure
10.1 When making measurements with the pH electrode,
place the electrode into the partially settled suspension to
mitigate the suspension effect.
10.2 For both methods, begin with an air dried soil that has
been sieved through a No. 10 sieve (2 mm holes) to remove the
coarser soil fraction. Air drying the soil is necessary to
accomplish sieving and to control the amount of water present
at the time of measurement.
10.3  pH in Distilled Water —For both methods, weigh out
approximately 10 g of air dried soil. Place the soil into a glass
container and add approximately 10 mL of water. Mix thor-
oughly and let stand for 1 h.
10.4  Method A —Read pH on pH meter.
10.5  Method B —Read pH on pH paper.
10.6  pH in 0.01 M Calcium Chloride Solution —For both
methods weigh out approximately 10 g of air dried soil. Place
the soil into a glass container and add approximately 10 mL of
the 0.01  M  CaCl 2  solution. Mix thoroughly and let stand for 1
h.
10.7  Method A —Read pH on pH meter.
10.8  Method B —Read pH on pH paper.
10.9 The mixture should be at approximately room tempera-
ture (15 to 25°C) at the time of pH measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. Apparatus
7.1  Method A, pH Meter —Potentiometer equipped with
glass-calomel electrode system. Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions for the pH meter used. A silver/silver chloride
electrode system or similar is also acceptable.
7.2  Method B, pH Paper —pH paper sensitive to a pH range
from 1 to 12, with resolution to the nearest 0.2 pH unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. Reagents
8.1  Purity of Reagents —Reagent grade chemicals should be
used in all tests. Unless otherwise indicated, it is intended that
all reagents should conform to the speciﬁcations of the
Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical
Society, where such speciﬁcations are available. 8   Other grades
may be used, provided it is ﬁrst ascertained that the reagent is
of sufficient purity to permit its use without lessening the
accuracy of the determination.
8.2  Purity of Water —All water used for this test method
must be ASTM Type III or better. Type III water is deﬁned by
Speciﬁcation D 1193. It is prepared by distillation, ion ex-
change, reverse osmosis, or a combination thereof.
8.3  Acid Potassium Phthalate Buffer Solution  (0.05  M )—
Dissolve 10.21 g (dried 1 h at 105°C) of potassium phthalate in
water and dilute to 1 L. The pH of this solution should be 4.0
at 20°C. Protect the solution against evaporation and against
contamination with molds. Replace the solution when mold is
noticed. The effect of temperature is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11. Report
11.1 Report the pH of the soil to the ﬁrst decimal place.
Specify which of the pH measurements is in water and which
is in the calcium chloride solution. Also specify whether the
determinations were made with Method A or Method B. If size
fractions other than sieved through the No. 10 sieve are used,
it must be stated in the report since the results may be
signiﬁcantly different.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This illustrates that the pH of the solution does not change
over the range in temperature from 5 to 37°C.
8.4  Calcium Chloride Stock Solution  (1.0  M )—Dissolve
147 g of CaCl  2 * 2H 2 O in water in a 1-L volumetric ﬂask, cool,
dilute to volume with water, and mix.
8.5  Calcium Chloride Solution  (0.01  M )—Dilute 20.0 mL
of stock 1.0  M  CaCl 2  solution to 2 L with water. The pH of this
solution should be between 5 and 7.
8.6  Phosphate Buffer Solution  (0.025  M )—Dissolve 3.40 g
of KH  2 PO 4  and 3.55 g of KH 2 HPO 4  in water and dilute to 1
L. Dry salts 2 h at 130°C before use. The pH of this solution
should be 6.9 at 20°C. The effect of temperature is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12. Precision and Bias
12.1  Precision :
12.1.1  Within-Laboratory Precision —The within laboratory
standard deviations for Method A are 0.031 (pH units) for the
water mixture and 0.139 9   (pH units) for the calcium chloride
mixture. Therefore, results of two properly conducted tests in
the same or different laboratories should not differ by more
than 0.065 9   (pH units) for the water mixture and 0.389 pH units
for the calcium chloride mixture. The within-laboratory stan-
dard deviations for Method B are 0.189 (pH units) for the water
mixture and 0.212 9   (pH units) for the calcium chloride mixture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
