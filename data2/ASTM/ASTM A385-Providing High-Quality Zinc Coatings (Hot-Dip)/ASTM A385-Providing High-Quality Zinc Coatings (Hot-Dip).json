          "content": "3. Steel Selection\n3.1 The production of a galvanized coating has as its basis\nthe metallurgical reaction between the steel and the molten\nzinc, resulting in the formation of several iron-zinc compound\nlayers, for example, gamma (not always visible microscopi-\ncally), delta, and zeta in  Fig. 1 . In addition, a layer of the\nmolten zinc adheres to the surface of the compound layers as\nthe steel is withdrawn from the galvanizing bath. Upon\nsolidi\ufb01cation, this adherent zinc forms the eta layer.\n3.2 It is known that the exact structural nature of the\ngalvanized coating, as typi\ufb01ed by  Fig. 1 , may be modi\ufb01ed in\naccordance with the exact chemical nature of the steel being\ngalvanized. Certain elements found in steels are known to have\nan in\ufb02uence on the coating structure. The elements carbon in\nexcess of about 0.25 %, phosphorus in excess of 0.04 %, or\nmanganese in excess of about 1.3 % will cause the production\nof coatings different from the coating typi\ufb01ed by  Fig. 1 . Steels\nwith silicon in the range 0.04 % to 0.15 % or above 0.22 % can\nproduce galvanized coating growth rates much higher than\nthose for steels with silicon levels below 0.04 % and between\n0.15 % and 0.22 %. Recent studies have shown that even in\ncases where the silicon and phosphorous are individually held\nto desirable limits, a combined effect between them can\nproduce a coating as shown in  Fig. 2 , which typically would\nhave a mottled or dull gray appearance.\n3.3 These elements manifest their structural effect as an\naccelerated growth of the compound layers, particularly the\nzeta layer, and the virtual elimination of the eta layer. Cosmeti-\ncally this accelerated growth is seen as a gray matte \ufb01nished\ncoating as opposed to the usual bright and smooth appearance\nof galvanized coatings. Sometimes, a large surface may have\nadjacent areas of matte \ufb01nish and bright \ufb01nish leading to a\nmottled appearance.\n3.4 There is some evidence that the coatings resulting from\nthis accelerated growth are more brittle and less adherent than\nnormal coatings. There is also evidence that these coatings are\nsubject to a premature red staining in atmospheric exposure;\nhowever, this staining has been found not to be associated with\ncorrosion of the substrate steel.",

The steel beams are then cooled back\nto ambient temperature so the thermal cycling can create\nthermal stresses in the area of the cope.\n8.2 One method that has had fairly good success at mini-\nmizing the cracking at the edges of the \ufb02ame cut cope is to\nweld a bead along the sides of the cope in the area where the\n\ufb02ame cutting was done before hot-dip galvanizing. This\nwelding operation will reheat the area and may relieve some of\nthe residual stress near the cope edges. The weld bead will not",

Similarly these holes shall allow all solutions and molten\nzinc to drain freely from the assemblies.

Pipe\nhandrail shall preferably be vented full open internally, as\nshown in  Fig. 7 . In addition, there shall be one   3 \u2044 8 -in. [9.5-mm]\nminimum diameter external hole at each intersection to prevent\nany possible explosions in the event that the fabricator neglects\nto provide internal venting. This hole shall be located as close\nas possible to the weld bead joining the two steel pieces and the\nedge of the hole shall be not more than 0.5 in. [12 mm] from\nthe edge of the weld bead. Where internal venting is not\npossible, external vents shall be provided with one vent hole in\neach side of each intersection. The vent openings shall be a\nminimum of   3 \u2044 8  in. [1 cm] in diameter or 25 % of the diameter\nof the pipe that is used, whichever is larger (see  Fig. 8 ) and\nshall be located as described above.\n12.4  Figs. 9-12  show most of the conditions encountered\nwith tubular product assemblies. The venting shall open\nwherever possible. This is the most desirable situation. A\nminimum vent opening of 25 to 30 % of the cross-sectional\narea of tubular structure shall be speci\ufb01ed where full-open\nventing is not possible. For small cross sections, larger percent\nvent openings are recommended. See attached drawings for\nspeci\ufb01c recommendations. In box sections (see  Fig. 9 ) where\ngusset plates are used, the gusset plates shall be clipped at the\nfour corners. In addition, a center hole shall be provided so that\nthe cumulative area of the vent holes meets the recommended\nminimum. Gusset plates shall not be spaced closer than 36 in.\n[914 mm] apart. In the case of columns with end plates (see\nFig. 10 ) where the end plate must be closed, the shaft of the\ncolumn shall be vented. The vent opening shall be a half circle\nwith its diameter at the base plate ( D ,  Fig. 10 ). This is much\nsuperior to putting a hole with the circumference of the hole",

Galvanized Steel in Concrete\n15.1 Galvanized steel can be placed in direct contact with\nconcrete as the galvanized coating forms an excellent bond\nwith the concrete materials. When embedding steel parts in\nconcrete, the highest quality system is produced when all of the\nsteel parts are coated with the same corrosion protection\nsystem. If there are galvanized parts in concrete near steel parts\nwith no corrosion protection, there can be active corrosion cells\nwhenever moisture is present. This will lessen the corrosion\nprotection offered by the galvanized coating. The highest\nquality system contains all galvanized steel parts.\n15.2 Galvanized steel parts when placed in concrete are\nnormally passivated either by natural weathering prior to\nplacement, by applying a passivation coating after the hot-dip\ngalvanizing process, or, effectively, by the presence of more\nthan 100 PPM of chromate in the concrete mix. When no\npassivation layer is on the surface of the galvanized coating\nand no chromates are in the concrete, there is a slight chance of\na reaction between the zinc metal and the concrete water\nsolution. The reaction between zinc metal and concrete water\nsolution can release small quantities of hydrogen gas bubbles.\nWhen the concrete cover is designed to be thin and the surface\narea of the galvanized part in the concrete is large, these\nescaping gas bubbles could cause rough concrete surfaces.",
