<<HEADING level=3>>Standard Practice for
Providing High-Quality Zinc Coatings (Hot-Dip) 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is issued under the ﬁxed designation A385/A385M; the number immediately following the designation indicates the year
of original adoption or, in the case of revision, the year of last revision. A number in parentheses indicates the year of last reapproval.
A superscript epsilon ( ´ ) indicates an editorial change since the last revision or reapproval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard has been approved for use by agencies of the Department of Defense.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1. Scope
1.1 This practice covers the precautions that should be taken
to obtain high-quality hot-dip galvanized coatings.
1.2 Where experience on a speciﬁc product indicates a
relaxing of any provision, the mutually acceptable change shall
be a matter for agreement between the manufacturer and
purchaser.
1.3 This speciﬁcation is applicable to orders in either
inch-pound units (as A385) or in SI units (as A385M).
Inch-pound units and SI units are not necessarily exact
equivalents. Within the text of this speciﬁcation and where
appropriate, SI units are shown in brackets. Each system shall
be used independently of the other without combining values in
any way.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3. Steel Selection
3.1 The production of a galvanized coating has as its basis
the metallurgical reaction between the steel and the molten
zinc, resulting in the formation of several iron-zinc compound
layers, for example, gamma (not always visible microscopi-
cally), delta, and zeta in  Fig. 1 . In addition, a layer of the
molten zinc adheres to the surface of the compound layers as
the steel is withdrawn from the galvanizing bath. Upon
solidiﬁcation, this adherent zinc forms the eta layer.
3.2 It is known that the exact structural nature of the
galvanized coating, as typiﬁed by  Fig. 1 , may be modiﬁed in
accordance with the exact chemical nature of the steel being
galvanized. Certain elements found in steels are known to have
an inﬂuence on the coating structure. The elements carbon in
excess of about 0.25 %, phosphorus in excess of 0.04 %, or
manganese in excess of about 1.3 % will cause the production
of coatings different from the coating typiﬁed by  Fig. 1 . Steels
with silicon in the range 0.04 % to 0.15 % or above 0.22 % can
produce galvanized coating growth rates much higher than
those for steels with silicon levels below 0.04 % and between
0.15 % and 0.22 %. Recent studies have shown that even in
cases where the silicon and phosphorous are individually held
to desirable limits, a combined effect between them can
produce a coating as shown in  Fig. 2 , which typically would
have a mottled or dull gray appearance.
3.3 These elements manifest their structural effect as an
accelerated growth of the compound layers, particularly the
zeta layer, and the virtual elimination of the eta layer. Cosmeti-
cally this accelerated growth is seen as a gray matte ﬁnished
coating as opposed to the usual bright and smooth appearance
of galvanized coatings. Sometimes, a large surface may have
adjacent areas of matte ﬁnish and bright ﬁnish leading to a
mottled appearance.
3.4 There is some evidence that the coatings resulting from
this accelerated growth are more brittle and less adherent than
normal coatings. There is also evidence that these coatings are
subject to a premature red staining in atmospheric exposure;
however, this staining has been found not to be associated with
corrosion of the substrate steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.5 A problem with steel chemistry is not usually apparent
until after an item has been galvanized. Not all combinations of
silicon, phosphorus, carbon, and manganese can be galvanized
successfully. When the steel chemistry is known beforehand,
experienced galvanizers can in some, but not all, instances
exercise limited control over the coatings as shown in  Fig. 2 .
Also, the combination of two different steel types or thick-
nesses in one item may result in a nonuniform galvanizing
ﬁnish. The experience of the steel supplier, designer, manufac-
turer, and galvanizer should determine the steel selection.
3.6 In general, galvanized coatings are speciﬁed because of
their corrosion resistance, not because of their appearance. The
relative corrosion resistance of the normal and abnormal
coatings is, for all practical purposes, equal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4. Assemblies of Different Materials or Different Surfaces

4.1 Whenever possible, assemblies should consist of ele-
ments of similar steel chemistry and surface condition.
4.2 Whenever different analyses of steel or different sur-
faces of steel are united in an assembly the galvanized ﬁnish is
not generally uniform in appearance. These differences in-
clude:
4.2.1 Excessively rusted surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1 Overlapping or contacting surfaces that have not had all
edges seal welded are undesirable.
5.2 When the distance between the overlapping surfaces is
less than   3 ⁄ 32  in. [2.38 mm], these surfaces will not normally be
wet by molten zinc. Furthermore, cleaning solution compounds
that remain on these surfaces volatilize during the galvanizing
process and may interfere with zinc wetting in adjacent areas.
Such uncoated surfaces cause a rust staining after exposure to
the environment. Traditionally however, steel grating has been<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6. Sheet Steel Rolled Over a Wire or Rod Stiffener
6.1 All oil or grease should be removed from both the sheet
steel and wire or rod before rolling (see  Fig. 3 ). Grease or oil
becomes volatile at the galvanizing temperature and will
generate gas which will prevent zinc from sealing the contact
edges. All steel should be degreased before pickling and in the
case of folded assemblies, before folding and assembling (see
Fig. 4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>FIG. 3 Rolled Surfaces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7. Weld Flux Removal and Welding Rods
7.1 Welding ﬂux residues are chemically inert in normal
pickling solutions. Thus, they will not be removed by standard
galvanizing cleaning techniques and are best removed at the
time of fabrication by grit or sand-blasting or by a wire needle
gun.
7.2 It is desirable to choose a welding rod with a chemical
composition as close as possible to the parent metal.
7.3 Welding rods high in silicon may cause excessively
thick or darkened coatings or both to form in the welded area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>FIG. 4 Folded Surfaces<<HEADING_END>>

likelihood of cracking.
8.3 The weld rod material should be chosen as described in
Section  7 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8. Flame Cut Cope Edges Preparation
8.1 Flame cut copes on beams can be extremely sensitive to
residual stresses in the steel beam and, with the rough surface
from the ﬂame cutting operation, can be sources of cracking
during the thermal cycling of the hot-dip galvanizing process.
The steel beams start near ambient temperature then are
immersed in the molten zinc and heated to above 800°F for
usually 5 to 10 minutes. The steel beams are then cooled back
to ambient temperature so the thermal cycling can create
thermal stresses in the area of the cope.
8.2 One method that has had fairly good success at mini-
mizing the cracking at the edges of the ﬂame cut cope is to
weld a bead along the sides of the cope in the area where the
ﬂame cutting was done before hot-dip galvanizing. This
welding operation will reheat the area and may relieve some of
the residual stress near the cope edges. The weld bead will not<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>12. Design Recommendations for Providing for the Free
Flow of Cleaning Solutions, Fluxes, Air, and Zinc
12.1 All fabricated assemblies shall be so designed with
vent and drain holes such that no air is trapped during the
immersion of the assemblies into cleaning solutions or molten
zinc. Similarly these holes shall allow all solutions and molten
zinc to drain freely from the assemblies. Failure to follow this
practice will result in areas that will not galvanize properly, or
that may retain entrapped ﬂux or excessive amounts of zinc.
12.2 Free ﬂow of cleaning solutions and molten zinc shall
also be provided for in assemblies of hot-rolled shapes. This is
accomplished by cropping the corner to provide an opening
with a minimum area of 0.3 in. 2   [1.9 cm 2 ] at the corners of all
stiffeners (see  Fig. 5 ), gussets, or bracing (see  Fig. 6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>12.3 Air or moisture, or both, entrapped within closed
fabricated pipework, such as handrail, can develop destructive
pressures when heated to the galvanizing temperature. Pipe
handrail shall preferably be vented full open internally, as
shown in  Fig. 7 . In addition, there shall be one   3 ⁄ 8 -in. [9.5-mm]
minimum diameter external hole at each intersection to prevent
any possible explosions in the event that the fabricator neglects
to provide internal venting. This hole shall be located as close
as possible to the weld bead joining the two steel pieces and the
edge of the hole shall be not more than 0.5 in. [12 mm] from
the edge of the weld bead. Where internal venting is not
possible, external vents shall be provided with one vent hole in
each side of each intersection. The vent openings shall be a
minimum of   3 ⁄ 8  in. [1 cm] in diameter or 25 % of the diameter
of the pipe that is used, whichever is larger (see  Fig. 8 ) and
shall be located as described above.
12.4  Figs. 9-12  show most of the conditions encountered
with tubular product assemblies. The venting shall open
wherever possible. This is the most desirable situation. A
minimum vent opening of 25 to 30 % of the cross-sectional
area of tubular structure shall be speciﬁed where full-open
venting is not possible. For small cross sections, larger percent
vent openings are recommended. See attached drawings for
speciﬁc recommendations. In box sections (see  Fig. 9 ) where
gusset plates are used, the gusset plates shall be clipped at the
four corners. In addition, a center hole shall be provided so that
the cumulative area of the vent holes meets the recommended
minimum. Gusset plates shall not be spaced closer than 36 in.
[914 mm] apart. In the case of columns with end plates (see
Fig. 10 ) where the end plate must be closed, the shaft of the
column shall be vented. The vent opening shall be a half circle
with its diameter at the base plate ( D ,  Fig. 10 ). This is much
superior to putting a hole with the circumference of the hole<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>15. Galvanized Steel in Concrete
15.1 Galvanized steel can be placed in direct contact with
concrete as the galvanized coating forms an excellent bond
with the concrete materials. When embedding steel parts in
concrete, the highest quality system is produced when all of the
steel parts are coated with the same corrosion protection
system. If there are galvanized parts in concrete near steel parts
with no corrosion protection, there can be active corrosion cells
whenever moisture is present. This will lessen the corrosion
protection offered by the galvanized coating. The highest
quality system contains all galvanized steel parts.
15.2 Galvanized steel parts when placed in concrete are
normally passivated either by natural weathering prior to
placement, by applying a passivation coating after the hot-dip
galvanizing process, or, effectively, by the presence of more
than 100 PPM of chromate in the concrete mix. When no
passivation layer is on the surface of the galvanized coating
and no chromates are in the concrete, there is a slight chance of
a reaction between the zinc metal and the concrete water
solution. The reaction between zinc metal and concrete water
solution can release small quantities of hydrogen gas bubbles.
When the concrete cover is designed to be thin and the surface
area of the galvanized part in the concrete is large, these
escaping gas bubbles could cause rough concrete surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13. Moving Parts
13.1 When a galvanized assembly incorporates moving
parts (such as drop handles, shackles, and shafts) a radial
clearance of not less than   1 ⁄ 16  in. [1.59 mm] must be allowed to
ensure full freedom of movement following galvanizing.
13.2 Moving parts such as handles or hinges should be
galvanized separately and assembled after galvanizing. It may
be necessary to post heat these parts in order to have them
function freely. This heating may cause discoloration of the
galvanized coating near the heated area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>14. Marking for Identiﬁcation
14.1 Paint is not removed by pickling and must not be used
when marking for identiﬁcation material to be galvanized.
14.2 Satisfactory identiﬁcation may be provided by welding
the identifying marks on the material, by embossing the
identifying marks on a steel tag of no less than No. 12 gage
(0.105 in. [2.69 mm]) and securing to the material with a heavy
wire such as No. 9 gage (0.148 in. [3.76 mm]), or by die
stamping the identifying marks into the material with charac-
ters   1 ⁄ 2  in. [12.7 mm] high and a minimum of   1 ⁄ 32  in. [0.79 mm]
deep.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

walls of the holes. To accommodate the thickness of the
galvanized coating on the bolt, the clearance hole may need to
be reamed to remove excess galvanized coating so that the
galvanized bolt will ﬁt in the clearance hole. The ﬁt of the
bearing connection clearance hole should be checked before
the galvanized part is shipped to the job site.
16.6 For slip-critical connections, clearance holes in hot-dip
galvanized parts shall be oversized holes. The dimensions of
oversized holes are listed in AISC  Steel Construction Manual ,
Section 16.2, page 20, Table 3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16. Galvanized Nuts, Bolts, Clearance Holes, and Tapped
Holes in Galvanized Products
16.1 Oversize tapping or retapping of nuts and tapped holes
is required when the bolt or male thread is galvanized. While
tapping or retapping after galvanizing results in uncoated
female threads, the zinc coating on the engaged male thread
will retard corrosion of both components.
16.2 Refer to the sections on dimensions of zinc-coated nuts
in Speciﬁcation  A563 .
16.3 Manufacturers or speciﬁers are cautioned to consider
the plus tolerance that has been taken on the nominal pitch
diameter of the bolt when establishing the degree of oversize
tapping of the nut that is required for proper ﬁt.
16.4 Hot-formed heading or bending may cause develop-
ment of a scale that requires an extended time of pickling to
remove. Should this occur on screws, scale removal prior to
threading is desirable in order to avoid overpickling of the
threaded area.
16.5 For bearing connections, clearance holes in hot-dip
galvanized steel parts shall be standard clearance holes in
accordance with the American Institute of Steel Construction
(AISC)  Steel Construction Manual , Section 16.2, page 20,
Table 3.1. Due to the thickness of some hot-dip galvanized
coatings, there may be a ﬁt issue with galvanized bolts in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should be aware that the hot-dip galvanizing process uses
chemical cleaning to prepare the surfaces for coating and this
may alter the critical dimensions. In addition the hot-dip
galvanized coating can increase the base steel material thick-
ness from 2.0 to over 10.0 thousandths of an inch [50 to over
250 micrometres] depending on the steel chemistry as de-
scribed in Section  3 . This should be accounted for in the critical
dimension design. Re-machining or otherwise reprocessing of
critical dimensions after hot-dip galvanizing may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
