<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical
committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has
the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in
liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This second edition of ISO 13628-4 has been updated by users and manufacturers of subsea wellheads and trees.
Particular attention was paid to making it an auditable standard. It is intended for worldwide application in the
petroleum industry. It is not intended to replace sound engineering judgement. It is necessary that users of this
part of ISO 13628 be aware that additional or different requirements can better suit the demands of a particular
service environment, the regulations of a jurisdictional authority or other scenarios not specifically addressed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A major effort in developing this second edition was a study of the risks and benefits of penetrations in subsea
wellheads. All previous editions of both this part of ISO 13628 and its parallel API document  Specification for
Subsea Wellhead and Christmas Tree Equipment  (Specification 17D) prohibited wellhead penetrations. However,
that prohibition was axiomatic. In developing this second edition, the workgroup used qualitative risk analysis
techniques and found that the original insight was correct: subsea wellheads with penetrations are more than
twice as likely to develop leaks over their life as those without penetrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The catalyst for examining this portion of the original editions of the API and ISO standards was the phenomenon
of casing pressure and its monitoring in subsea wells. The report generated by the aforementioned ris<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k analysis has become API 17 TR3 and API RP 90. The workgroup encourages the use of these documents when
developing designs and operating practices for subsea wells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care has also been taken to address the evolving issue of using external hydrostatic pressure in design. The
original versions of both API 17D and ISO 13628-4 were adopted at a time when the effects of that parameter
were relatively small. The industry’s move into greater water depths has prompted a consideration of that aspect
in this version of this part of ISO 13628. The high-level view is that it is not appropriate to use external hydrostatic
pressure to augment the applications for which a component can be used. For example, this part of ISO 13628
does not allow the use of a subsea tree rated for 69 MPa (10 000 psi) installed in 2 438 m (8 000 ft) of water on a
well that has a shut-in tubing pressure greater than 69 MPa (10 000 psi). See 5.1.2.1.1 for further guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design considerations involved in using external hydrostatic pressure are only currently becoming fully
understood. If a user or fabricator desires to explore these possibilities, it is recommended that a thorough review
of the forthcoming American Petroleum Institute technical bulletin on the topic be carefully studied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The overall objective of this part of ISO 13628 is to define clear and unambiguous requirements that facilitate
international standardization in order to enable safe and economic development of offshore oil and gas fields by
the use of subsea wellhead and tree equipment. It is written in a manner that allows the use of a wide variety of
technology, from well established to state-of-the-art. The contributors to this update do not wish to restrict or deter
the development of new technology. However, the user of this part of ISO 13628 is encouraged to closely
examine standard interfaces and the reuse of intervention systems and tools in the interests of minimizing life-
cycle costs and increasing reliability through the use of proven interfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important that users of this part of ISO 13628 be aware that further or differing requirements can be needed
for individual applications. This part of ISO 13628 is not intended to inhibit a vendor from offering, or the purchaser
from accepting, alternative equipment or engineering solutions for the individual application. This can be
particularly applicable where there is innovative or developing technology. Where an alternative is offered, it is the
responsibility of the vendor to identify any variations from this part of ISO 13628 and provide details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 13628 provides specifications for subsea wellheads, mudline wellheads, drill-through mudline
wellheads and both vertical and horizontal subsea trees. It specifies the associated tooling necessary to handle,
test and install the equipment. It also specifies the areas of design, material, welding, quality control (including
factory acceptance testing), marking, storing and shipping for both individual sub-assemblies (used to build
complete subsea tree assemblies) and complete subsea tree assemblies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The user is responsible for ensuring subsea equipment meets any additional requirements of governmental
regulations for the country in which it is installed. This is outside the scope of this part of ISO 13628.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In making the material selections, the purchaser should also consider the various environmental factors and
production variables listed in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.5 Material classes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is the responsibility of the end user to specify materials of construction for pressure-containing and pressure–
controlling equipment. Material classes AA-HH as defined in Table 1 shall be used to indicate the material of
those equipment components. Guidelines for choosing material class based on the retained fluid constituents and
operating conditions are given in Annex M.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Product specification levels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guidelines for selecting an appropriate product specification level (PSL) are provided in Annex M. The PSL of an
assembled system of wellhead or tree equipment shall be determined by the lowest PSL of any pressure-
containing or -controlling component in the assembly. Structural components and other non-pressure-containing/-
controlling parts of equipment manufactured to this part of ISO 13628 are not defined by PSL requirements but by
the manufacturer’s specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All pressure-containing components of equipment manufactured to this part of ISO 13628 shall comply with the
requirements of PSL 2, PSL 3, or PSL 3G as established in ISO 10423. Pressure-controlling components shall
comply with the requirements of PSL 2, PSL 3, or PSL 3G as specified in 5.4 and ISO 10423, except where
additions or modifications are noted within this part of ISO 13628. These PSL designations define different levels of
requirements for material qualification, testing, and documentation. PSL 3G does not necessarily imply that an
assembly shall be gas-tested beyond the component/subassembly level (such as individual valves, chokes, tubing
hangers, etc.). The purchaser shall specify whether it is required to gas-test an upper-level assembly manufactured
to PSL 3G (such as a VXT or HXT assembly) as an integral unit at FAT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Design requirements and criteria found in this part of ISO 13628 are based on rated working pressure and
external loads relevant for installation, testing and normal operations. Additional design requirements due to
drilling-riser- or workover-riser-imparted loads should be considered by the manufacturer, and overall operating
limits documented. ISO 13628-7 specifies design requirements for the workover riser and includes additional
operational conditions, such as extreme and accidental events (vessel drive-off, drift-off or motion-compensator
lock-up). These load conditions shall be considered for qualifying the equipment; see 5.1.7. The purchaser should

lines or chemical injection lines, pass through a cavity, such as the tree/tubing-hanger cavity, equipment bounding
that cavity shall be designed for the maximum pressure in any of the lines, unless a means is provided to monitor
and relieve the cavity pressure in the event of a leak in any of those lines; see 7.9.1 and 9.2.7 for additional
information. In addition, the effects of external loads (i.e. bending moments, tension), ambient hydrostatic loads
and fatigue shall be considered. For the purpose of this part of ISO 13628, pressure ratings shall be interpreted as
rated working pressure (3.1.41).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Seal designs should consider conditions where deep water can result in reverse pressure acting on the seal due

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.3.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Equipment shall be constructed with materials (metallics and non-metallics) suitable for its respective material
classification in accordance with Table 1. Table 1 does not define all factors within the wellhead environment, but
provides material classes for various levels of service conditions and relative corrosivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Material selection is the ultimate responsibility of the user as he has the knowledge of the production environment
as well as control over the injected treatment chemicals. The user may specify the service conditions and injection
chemicals, asking the supplier to recommend materials for his review and approval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Material requirements shall comply with Table 1. All pressure-containing components shall be treated as “bodies”
for determining material trim requirements from Table 1. However, in this part of ISO 13628, other wellbore-
pressure boundary-penetration equipment, such as grease and bleeder fittings, shall be treated as “stems” as set
forth in Table 1. Metal seals shall be treated as pressure-controlling parts with regards to Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Structural strength and fatigue strength shall be evaluated in this part of ISO 13628. ASME  BPVC , Section VIII,
Division 2, Appendix 5, or other recognized standards may be used when calculating fatigue. Localized bearing-
stress values are beyond the scope of this part of ISO 13628. The effects of external loads (i.e. bending moment,
tensions, etc.) on the assembly or components are not explicitly addressed in this part of ISO 13628 or in
ISO 10423. As equipment covered by this part of ISO 13628 are exposed to external loads, ISO 13628-7 may be
used to define the structural strength design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Closure bolting and critical bolting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Closure bolting (pressure-containing) and critical bolting (high-load bearing) require a preload to a high percent of
material yield strength as noted below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Closure bolting of all 6BX and 17SS flanges shall be made up using a method that has been shown to result in a
stress range between 67 % and 73 % of the bolt’s material yield stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This stress range should result in a preload in excess of the separation force at test pressure while avoiding
excessive stress beyond 83 % of the bolt material’s yield strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Closure bolting manufactured from carbon or alloy steel, when used in submerged service, shall be limited to
321 HBN (Rockwell “C” 35) maximum due to concerns with hydrogen embrittlement when connected to cathodic
protection. Closure bolting for material classes AA-HH that is covered by insulation shall be treated as exposed
bolting in accordance with ISO 15156 (all parts).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The maximum allowable tensile stress for closure bolting shall be determined considering initial bolt-up, rated
working pressure and hydrostatic test pressure conditions. Bolting stresses, based on the root area of the thread,
shall not exceed the limits given in ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Primary structural components<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Primary structural components, such as guidebases, shall be designed in accordance with accepted industry
practices and documented in accordance with 5.1.5. A safety/design factor of 1,5 or more based on the minimum
material yield strength shall be used in the design calculations; other recognized industry codes may be used. It
should be noted that many codes already include safety factors. Alternatively, an FEA may be used to
demonstrate that applied loads do not result in deformation to such an extent that prevents meeting any other
performance requirement. As an alternative, a design validation load test of 1,5 times its rated capacity may be
substituted for design analysis. The component shall sustain the test loading without deformation to such an
extent that any other performance requirement is affected and the test documents shall be retained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

high strength, corrosion resistance and resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. Materials that have shown this
susceptibility include martensitic stainless steels and the more highly alloyed steels having yield strengths over
900 MPa (131 000 psi). Other materials subject to this phenomenon are hardened, low-alloy steels, particularly
with hardness levels greater than Rockwell “C” 35 [with yield strength exceeding 900 MPa (131 000 psi)],
precipitation-hardened nickel-copper alloys and some high-strength titanium alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.7.1
Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum validation test procedures that shall be used to qualify product designs in accordance with Table 3
are defined in 3.5.1.7. The manufacturer shall define additional validation tests that are applicable and
demonstrate that this validation testing can be correlated with the intended service life and/or operating conditions
in accordance with the purchaser requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.7.2
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prototype equipment (or first article) and fixtures used to qualify designs using these validation procedures shall
be representative of production models in terms of design, production dimensions/tolerances, intended
manufacturing processes, deflections and materials. If a product design undergoes any changes in
fit-form-function or material, the manufacturer shall document the impact of such changes on the performance of
the product. A design that undergoes a substantive change becomes a new design requiring retesting. A
substantive change is a change that affects the performance of the product in the intended service condition. A
substantive change is considered as any change from the previously qualified configuration or material selection
that can affect performance of the product or intended service. This shall be recorded and the manufacturer shall
justify whether or not re-qualification is required. This may include changes in fit-form-function or material. A
change in material might not require retesting if the suitability of the new material can be substantiated by other
means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Fit, when defined as the geometric relationship between parts, includes the tolerance criteria used during the
design of a part and mating parts. Fit, when defined as a state of being adjusted to, or shaped for, includes the tolerance
criteria used during the design of a seal and its mating parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For items with primary and secondary independent seal mechanisms, the seal mechanisms shall be independently
verified. Equipment should be qualified with the minimal lubricants required for assembly unless the lubricants can
be replenished when the equipment is in service or is provided for service in a sealed chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Pressure-cycling tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 3 lists equipment that shall be subjected to repetitive hydrostatic (or gas, if applicable) pressure-cycling
tests simulating start-up and shutdown pressure cycling that occurs in long-term field service. For these
hydrostatic cycling tests, the equipment shall be alternately pressurized to the full rated working pressure and
then fully depressurized until the specified number of pressure cycles has been completed. No holding period is
required for each pressure cycle. A standard hydrostatic (or gas, if applicable) test (see 5.4) shall be performed
before and after the hydrostatic pressure cycling test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.7.5
Load testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manufacturer’s rated load capacities for equipment in accordance with this part of ISO 13628 shall be verified
by both validation testing and engineering analysis. The equipment shall be loaded to the rated capacity to the
number of cycles in accordance with Table 3 during the test without deformation to such an extent that any other
performance requirement is affected (unless otherwise specified). Engineering analysis shall be conducted using
techniques and programmes that comply with documented industry practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See 5.1.3.3 for load-testing of pressure-controlling components, and 5.1.3.6 for load-testing of primary structural
components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Temperature cycling tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Validation tests shall be performed at a test temperature at or beyond the range of the rated operating
temperature classification while at RWP or load condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 3 lists equipment that shall be subjected to repetitive temperature cycling tests simulating start-up and
shutdown temperature cycling that occur in long-term field service. For these temperature cycling tests, the
equipment shall be alternately heated and cooled to the upper and lower temperature extremes of its rated
operating temperature classification as defined in 5.1.2.2. During temperature cycling, rated working pressure
shall be applied to the equipment at the temperature extremes with no leaks beyond the acceptance criteria
established in ISO 10423. As an alternative to testing, manufacturer shall provide other objective evidence,
consistent with documented industry practice, that the equipment will meet performance requirements at both
temperature extremes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Life-cycle/endurance testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Life-cycle/endurance testing, such as make-break tests on connectors and operational testing of valves, chokes,
and actuators, is intended to evaluate long-term wear characteristics of the equipment being tested. Such tests
may be conducted at a temperature specified by the manufacturer and documented as appropriate for that
product and rating. Table 3 lists equipment that shall be subjected to extended life-cycle/endurance testing to
simulate long-term field service. For these life-cycle/endurance tests, the equipment shall be subjected to
operational cycles in accordance with the manufacturer’s performance specifications (i.e. make-up to full
torque/break-out, open/close under full rated working pressure). Connectors, including stabs, shall be subjected to
a full disconnect/lift as part of the cycle. Additional specifications for life-cycle/endurance testing of the
components listed in Table 3 can be found in the equipment-specific clauses covering these items (Clauses 6 to

General design requirements for subsea trees and tubing hangers<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Clause 6 provides specific requirements for the equipment covered in Clauses 7 and 9. Subsea tree assembly
configurations vary depending on wellhead type, service, well shut-in pressure, water depth, reservoir parameters,
environmental factors and operational requirements. As such, the subsea tree configuration requirements,
including the location and quantity of USVs are not specified in Clause 6. As a minimum, the barrier philosophy in
accordance with ISO 13628-1 shall be met. The number of potential leak paths should be minimized during
system design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Equipment that is used in the assembly of the subsea tree, but which is not covered in Clauses 6, 7, and 9, shall
comply with the manufacturer’s written specifications. Purchaser and manufacturer should agree on any additional
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

33<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2 Handling and installation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Structural analysis should be performed by the user to ensure that structural failure does not occur at a point
below the tree re-entry spool and that the tree can be left in a safe condition in the event of a drive-off before the
tree running tool/EDP can be disconnected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design of the subsea tree assembly should consider the ease of handling and installation. All equipment
assemblies should be balanced within 1°. Consideration should be given to the submerged condition of this
equipment, including buoyancy or weighted modules removed after installation. The use of balance weights
should be minimized to keep shipping weight to a minimum and the location of balance weights should be
carefully chosen so that observation/access by diver/ROV is not compromised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3 Orientation and alignment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design should pay particular attention to the orientation and alignment between equipment packages. The
manufacturer shall conduct tolerance and stack-up analysis to ensure that trees will engage tubing hangers,
wellheads and guidebases; that tree running tools will engage re-entry spools; that caps will engage re-entry
spools, etc. These studies shall take into account external influences, such as flowline forces, temperature,
currents, riser offsets, etc. Equipment shall be suitably aligned and orientated before stab subs enter their sealing
pockets. Where feasible during factory acceptance testing, calculations should be verified by realistic testing of
interfaces that will be engaged remotely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.4 Rating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The PSL designation, pressure rating, temperature rating and material class assigned to the subsea tree
assembly shall be determined by the minimum rating of any single component used in the assembly of the subsea
tree that is normally exposed to wellbore fluid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.5 Interchangeability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Components and sub-assemblies for different arrangements of subsea tree configurations should be
interchangeable if functional requirements permit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EXAMPLES
Change-out of tree connectors to suit different wellhead profiles, change-out of wing-valve arrangements for
different services, such as production, injection, etc., and the interchangeability of spares.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Interchangeability between mating trees, tubing hangers, caps, tool interfaces, etc., shall be assured by the
design and dimensional control. It is recommended that items that are engaged subsea be interfaced with a
mating item or a fixture. Integration testing is outside the scope of this part of ISO 13628.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.6 Safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Testing is one of the most dangerous operations conducted on oilfield equipment. A pressure test intentionally
exposes the equipment to a higher stored energy state than it sees in normal field operation to ensure that the
design is sound, that materials have no significant flaws and that the equipment has been properly assembled.
Normal personnel protective equipment does not provide protection in the event of a high-volume pressure
release. The following are some recommended minimum practices to consider to improve personnel safety.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Safe job analysis should be performed before any pressure and load testing is performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  When a component or assembly is pressure-tested, protective barriers should be utilized, personnel should
be kept out of hazardous areas, and appropriate stand-off distances should be established. This is especially
important the first time a new piece of equipment is tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Venting of trapped air prior to hydrostatic testing is essential to minimize stored energy potential. The
designer should take this into consideration when locating test/vent ports and when specifying the orientation
of the equipment during test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

D ESIGN AND  O PERATION OF  S UBSEA  P RODUCTION  S YSTEMS ,   P ART  4:   S UBSEA  W ELLHEAD AND  T REE  E QUIPMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Where practical, minimize the volume of stored pressure energy by applying higher pressure tests to smaller
sub-assemblies versus testing full assemblies at one time. Or, make use of other energy-reduction methods
such as volume-reducing devices in non-functional areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Controlled methods should be specified for verifying and confirming that test pressures have been completely
vented/bled down.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EXAMPLE
Specifying multiple venting points, requiring all valves to be fully opened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Gas tests should always be performed only after hydrostatic testing and never at a pressure above the
working pressure rating of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Gas tests should be performed only while equipment is submerged to the maximum water depth possible in
the test pit/chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Consideration should be given to safe ways for test personnel to verify leakage, such as using remote
pressure recorders, cameras, mirrors/periscopes, drip cloths/paper, etc., to look for drips/bubbles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  The use of ballistics calculations have proven useful in establishing requirements for, and types of, shielding
devices and safe work zones for test personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Pressure testing tools can fail just like the equipment being tested. Test equipment should be under a
preventive maintenance program, since test flanges, clamps, hoses, etc., are exposed to more extreme
pressure loads than any other equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  As pressure-test hose lines always cross safety barriers, they should be secured/staked with a mechanical
constraint to prevent whipping in the event that a hose or end fitting fails. Consider burying pressure lines to
prevent damage in high-traffic areas from fork lifts, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safe access for personnel to equipment packages during testing, inspection, maintenance, preparation for
installation or other tasks should be considered as part of the design. Where necessary, access devices should
be furnished. Access devices should include a warning label stating that a fall-arrest device should be used where
personnel are required to work on top of equipment packages. When assemblies are stacked, the access devices
should be positioned to facilitate safe transfer from one assembly to the other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(injection) flow path (bore) shall be defined as the production master valve. The inboard valve on the bore into the
annulus below the tubing hanger shall be defined as the annulus master valve. A horizontal subsea tree shall
have one or more master valves on each of the above bores. At least one valve in each of the above bores shall
be an actuated, fail-closed valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3 Wing valves, vertical tree<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A wing valve is a valve in the subsea tree assembly that controls either the production (injection) or annulus flow
path and is not in the vertical bore of the tree. The side outlet for production (injection) shall have at least one
wing valve. The annulus flow path of the subsea tree shall have at least one wing valve (depending on tree<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

intervention requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.4 Wing valves, horizontal tree<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The horizontal subsea tree shall have a wing valve downstream (upstream – injection) of the master valve in both
the production (injection) flow path and the annulus flow path with respect to operational/process and/or well
intervention requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.5 Swab closures, vertical and horizontal tree<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any bore that passes through the subsea tree assembly that can be used in workover operations shall be
equipped with at least two swab closures. The swab closure is a device that allows vertical access into the tree
but is not open during production flow. Swab closures may be caps, stabs, tubing plugs or valves. The removal or
opening of the swab closure shall not result in any diametrical restriction through the production bore of the tree or
tubing hanger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Swab valves may be either manual or actuated. When actuated, they shall be operable only from the workover
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annulus access valves and/or workover valves are considered forms of swab closures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.6 Crossover valves<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A crossover valve is an optional valve that, when opened, allows communication between the annulus and
production tree paths, which are normally isolated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.7 Tree assembly pressure closures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 13628 is concerned only with the pressure-closure requirements contained within the subsea tree
assembly. Other industry-recognized pressure closures contained in the total system, such as downhole SCSSVs
or flowline valves, are beyond the scope of this part of ISO 13628. It is not intended that multiple pressure closure
requirements of the subsea tree assembly replace the need for other system pressure closures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.8 Production (injection) and annulus flow paths<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum requirement for valving in the production (injection) and annulus flowpaths to maintain the subsea
tree as a barrier element, is one actuated, fail-closed master valve in the production (injection) bore and one
actuated, fail-closed master valve in the annulus bore. Other valves as described in 6.2 may be added when
required by legislation or project requirements with respect to operational/process and/or well-intervention
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The annulus flow path shall be designed to allow for the management of casing pressure in the production
annulus and the ability to circulate during workover and well-control situations with consideration given to reducing
the risk of plugging.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A schematic for a typical vertical dual-bore subsea tree is illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 2 illustrates vertical trees
with tubing heads. Figure 3 illustrates horizontal subsea trees.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.9 Production and annulus bore penetrations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There shall be at least two fail-closed pressure closures, one of which shall be an actuated, fail-closed valve, for
any penetration leading into the path of the tree or tubing head. The master valve may be used as one of the
barriers for conduit penetrations downstream of the master valve. There shall be at least one testable pressure
closure between the wellhead and any penetration leading into the annulus path of the tree or tubing head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Any remotely operated closure device, including control-line couplers that are designed to prevent the ingress of
seawater, used in the SCSSV control line circuit shall be designed such that it does not interfere with the closure
of the SCSSV. Connections threaded directly into a tree body or wing-valve block for SCSSV control line
penetrations are prohibited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Two fail-closed valves are required for all chemical-injection lines that pass through the tubing hanger.
Flow-closed check valves are acceptable as one of the fail-closed valves, for lines with a diameter of 25,4 mm
(1,00 in) or smaller. At least one of the fail-closed valves shall be an actuated, fail-closed valve. The left side of
Figure 5 illustrates typical subsea tree valving for the above. The check valve may be inboard or outboard of the
fail-closed valve. Flanges, clamp hubs or OECs, as applicable, meeting the requirements of Clause 7 shall be
used to provide connections for the penetrations to the tree. Threaded connections going directly into a tree body
or wing-valve block for injection line penetrations when located inboard of the two closure devices are prohibited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.12 Pressure monitoring/test lines and internal control lines<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At least one pressure-controlling closure shall be used on all pressure-monitoring/test lines that pass into or
through either the tree or tubing head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rated working pressure of any hydraulic control line that has the potential for wellbore communication shall be
equal to or greater than the working pressure of the tree. Threaded connections going directly into a tree body or
wing valve block for injection-line penetrations, when located inboard of the two closure devices, are prohibited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On lines such as connector cavity-test lines, manual isolation valves are acceptable closure devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.13 Compensating barrier<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where a compensating barrier is used to exclude seawater from the actuator and to balance hydrostatic pressure,
it s h all be sized to accommodate a minimum of 120 % of the swept volume. A means, such as check valves,
should be included in the circuit to prevent hydraulic lock. A relief device shall be included in this circuit to
eliminate the chance that the failure of an actuator seal can affect the performance of the remaining valves. The
manufacturer shall document the compensation fill procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.14 Downhole hydraulic control line penetrations for intelligent well completions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At least one pressure-controlling closure shall be used in all hydraulic control lines that penetrate through the tree
and tubing head and that are used to operate downhole, intelligent, well-completion systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Manual valves (diver-/ROV-/ROT-operated) or remotely operated fail-closed valves are acceptable closing
devices for intelligent well-control systems that are operated by a hydraulic power source that is connected to the
tree only by a diver/ROV/ROT during a well intervention.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Remotely operated fail-closed valves are acceptable closure devices for intelligent well-control systems that are
operated remotely through the production control umbilical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Closure devices should be kept in the closed position at all times except while the intelligent well-control system is
being operated. When a control pod is used to operate the intelligent well-control system, the intelligent well-
control functions shall be vented through a hydraulic circuit other than the one(s) used to vent fluid/pressure from
other control functions on the tree, including the SCSSV.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermal expansion of the hydraulic fluid in the intelligent well-control lines should be considered in the design and
operation of the intelligent well-control system. Intelligent well-control line circuits should be designed to have a
RWP that is greater than the well shut-in pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flanges, clamp hubs or OECs, as applicable, meeting the requirements of Clause 7 shall be used to provide
connections for the intelligent well-control penetrations to the tree. Threaded connections going directly into a tree
body or wing-valve block for intelligent well-control line penetrations are prohibited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Check valves should not be used anywhere in the intelligent well control circuit if their closure could prevent the
intelligent well control from being operated properly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

guidebase (CGB, PGB, GRA, tree frame, etc.), wellhead and tubing hanger interfaces. See Clause 5 for testing
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of the different subsea tree configurations, components can be directly exposed to wellbore fluid in some
instances or serve as a second barrier in others. To that end, Table 4 is provided as a pictorial representation to
clarify where the components are located and what hydrostatic test pressures are required with respect to body,
interface, and lockdown retention testing. Detailed test requirements for each element/location are described in

shall be type 6BX flanges as defined in ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Standard flanges for subsea completions with maximum working pressures of 69 MPa (10 000 psi) or 103,5 MPa
(15 000 psi) shall be type 6BX flanges as defined in ISO 10423. ISO-type flanges for subsea completions may be
either integral, blind or welding neck flanges. Threaded flanges, as defined in ISO 10423, shall not be used on
subsea completion equipment handling produced fluids, except as specified in 7.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Segmented flanges shall not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Swivel flanges are often used to facilitate subsea flowline connections that are made up underwater. Type 17SV
flanges, as defined herein, have been developed as the standard swivel-flange design for subsea completions in
the sizes and working pressures given in Table 5. Type 17SV swivel flanges are designed to mate with standard
ISO-type 17SS and type 6BX flanges of the same size and pressure rating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>All flanges used on subsea completions equipment shall be of the ring-joint type designed for face-to-face make-
up. The connection make-up force and external loads shall react primarily on the raised face of the flange.
Therefore, at least one of the flanges in a connection shall have a raised face.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All flanged connections that are made up underwater in accordance with the manufacturer’s written specification
shall be equipped with a means to vent any trapped fluids. Type SBX ring gaskets, as shown in Table 6, are an
acceptable means for venting type 6BX, 17SS, or 17SV flanges. Type SBX or ISO 10423-type BX ring gaskets,
are acceptable for 6BX, 17SS or 17SV flanges made up in air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other proprietary flange and seal designs that eliminate the trapped fluid problem have been developed and these
are, therefore, well suited for underwater make-up. These proprietary flange and seal designs shall comply with
7.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Trapped fluid can also interfere with the proper make-up of studs or bolts installed into blind holes underwater.
Means shall be provided for venting such trapped fluid from beneath the studs (such as holes or grooves in the
threaded hole and/or the stud).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

for subsea completions) rather than type R or RX gaskets. In addition, type 17SS flanges shall be designed with
raised faces for rigid face-to-face make-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>34,5 MPa (5 000 psi) type 17SS flanges shall be used for all 52 mm (2  1/16  in) through 279 mm (11 in) subsea-

Bore and wall thickness: The bore diameter,  J L , shall not exceed the values given in Table 9. The specified
bore shall not result in a weld-end wall thickness less than 87,5 % of the wall thickness of the pipe to which
the flange is being attached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Weld end preparation: Dimensions for weld end preparation shall conform to Figure 8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Taper: When the thickness at the welding end is at least 2,3 mm (0,09 in) greater than that of the pipe, and
the additional thickness decreases the ID, the flange shall be taper-bored from the weld end at a slope not
exceeding 3 to 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is not intended in this part of ISO 13628 that Type 17SS welding neck flanges be welded to wellheads or tree

the raised face of the flange.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the BX-150 and BX-149 ring-groove profiles, the flange’s raised face profile can come very close to the heat-
affected zone (HAZ) created at the outermost diameter of the CRA weld overlay during the finish machining
process of the flange, which can cause inspection problems. The alternate rough/finish machine profile illustrated
in Figure 7 may be used to avoid HAZ interface problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Swivel flanges — Type 17S for working pressures 34,5 MPa (5 000 psi) or 69 MPa (10 000 psi)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2.5.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Type 17SV flanges are multiple-piece assemblies in which the flange rim is free to rotate relative to the flange hub.
A retainer groove is provided on the neck of the hub to allow installation of a snap wire of sufficient diameter to
hold the ring on the hub during storage, handling and installation. Type 17SV flanges may be used on subsea
completion equipment where it is difficult or impossible to rotate either of the flange hubs to align the mating bolt
holes. Type 17SV flanges mate with standard types 6BX and 17SS flanges of the same size and pressure rating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Type 17SV swivel flanges are of the ring-joint type and are designed for face-to-face make-up. The connection
make-up force and external loads shall react primarily on the raised face of the flange.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Flange faces shall be fully machined. The nut bearing surface shall be parallel to the flange gasket face within 1°.
The back face may be fully machined or spot faced at the bolt holes. The thickness of type 17SS flanges and
type 17SV hubs and swivel rings after facing shall meet the dimensions of Tables 7, 8, and 11 through 14, as
applicable. The thickness of type 6BX flanges shall meet the requirements of ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2.5.4
Gaskets<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Types 6BX, 17SS and 17SV flanges in subsea completion equipment shall use types BX or SBX gaskets in
accordance with 7.6. If these flanges are made up underwater in accordance with the manufacturer’s written
specification, they shall use internally cross-drilled type SBX ring gaskets to prevent fluid entrapment between the
gasket and the ring groove during flange make-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2.5.5
Corrosion-resistant ring grooves<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All end and outlet flanges used on subsea completions shall be manufactured from, or inlaid with, corrosion-
resistant materials with proven seawater resistance under the specified operating conditions. The chosen material
shall also be resistant to corrosion from the internal fluid. Corrosion-resistant inlaid BX ring grooves shall comply
with ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to application of the overlay, preparation of the BX ring grooves shall conform to the dimensions of Table 10
as applicable, or other weld preparations may be employed where the strength of the overlay materials equals or
exceeds the strength of the base material and volumetric NDE is performed on the weld metal and fusion zone
with the same acceptance criteria as is used for the base metal. The overlay material shall be compatible in
accordance with the manufacturer’s written specification with well fluid, inhibition fluid, injection fluids, etc., and
with both the base metal of the flange and the ring-gasket material (welding, galling and dissimilar metals
corrosion).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2.5.6
Flange materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flange materials shall conform to the requirements in Clause 5 as applicable and materials with a minimum yield
strength of 517 MPa (75 000 psi) shall be used for type 17SV flanges for 69 MPa (10 000 psi) rated working

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Threaded connections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Loose-threaded flanges and other threaded end and outlet connections shall not be used on subsea completion
equipment, except for tubing hangers, that handles produced fluid. Threaded flanges may be used on non-
production connections, such as injection piping, provided there is an isolation valve and either a bolted flange or
a clamp hub connection on the tree side of the threaded flange. Integral threaded connections, such as instrument
connections, test ports, and injection/monitor connections, may be used in sizes up to 25,4 mm (1,00 in), provided
they are used in conjunction with the appropriate rated working pressure defined in Table 2 and ISO 10423 and
are located downstream of the first wing valve. If threaded connections are used upstream of the first wing valve,
there shall be an isolation valve and either a bolted flange, clamp hub or welded connections as defined in
7.20.2.6 on the tree side of the threaded connection. Threaded bleeder/grease/injection fittings shall be allowed
upstream of the first wing valve without the isolation valve and flange/clamp hub if at least two pressure barriers
between the produced fluid and the external environment are provided. The sealing areas shall be made of
corrosion-resistant materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Threaded connections used on subsea equipment covered by this part of ISO 13628 shall comply with the
requirements of 5.1.2.1.7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Other end connectors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of other non-standard end connectors, such as misalignment connectors, non-ISO flanges, ball joints,
articulated jumper assemblies or instrument/monitor flanges is allowable in subsea completion equipment if these
connectors have been designed, documented and tested in accordance with the requirements established in
Clause 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials for OECs shall meet the requirements of 5.2 and 5.3. If the connector’s primary seals are not metal-to-
metal, redundant seals shall be provided. OECs used on subsea completion equipment shall have seal surfaces
that engage metal-to-metal seals and shall be inlaid with a corrosion-resistant material that is compatible with well
fluids, seawater, etc. Overlays are not required if the base material is a corrosion-resistant material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Selection of stud, nut and bolting materials and coatings/platings should consider seawater-induced chloride
stress corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue. Hydrogen embrittlement induced by cathodic protection systems
should be considered. Consideration should be given to the effect of coatings on the cathodic protection systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some high-strength bolting materials might not be suitable for service in a seawater environment. Refer to 5.1.3.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.2 ISO studs and nuts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements for studs and nuts apply only to those used in end and outlet connections. Such studs and nuts
used on subsea completion equipment covered by this part of ISO 13628 shall comply with ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.3 Other studs, nuts and bolting<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.5 Make-up torque requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Make-up requirements shall comply with 5.1.3.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Studs, nuts and other closure bolting for subsea service are often manufactured with anti-corrosion
coatings/platings which can dramatically affect the stud-to-nut friction factor. Manufacturers shall document
recommended make-up tension (or torque) for their fasteners using tables, similar to the one in Annex G.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of calibrated torque or bolt-tensioning equipment is recommended to ensure accurate make-up tension.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Ring gaskets<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In 7.6 are covered type SBX ring gaskets for use in ISO types 6BX, 17SS, and 17SV flanged connections, and
ISO 13533 clamp connections used in subsea completion equipment. Type SBX gaskets are vented to prevent
pressure lock when connections are made up underwater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Connections that are not made up underwater may use non-vented type BX gaskets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other proprietary gaskets shall conform to the manufacturer’s written specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although positioning of ring gaskets in their mating grooves is often a problem when making up flanges/clamp
hubs on horizontal bores underwater, grease shall not be used to hold ring gaskets in position during make-up,
since grease can interfere with proper make-up of the gasket. Likewise, the practice of tack welding rods to the
OD of seal rings (to simplify positioning of the ring during make-up) shall not be used on gaskets for subsea
ser v ice. Instead, gasket installation tools should be used if assistance is required to retain the gasket in position
during make up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Pressure passage hole<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each BX gaskets shall have one pressure passage hole drilled through its height as shown in ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Type BX ring gaskets are not suitable for connections that are made up underwater since fluid trapped in the ring
groove can interfere with proper make up. Type SBX vented ring gaskets shall be used in place of type BX
gaskets on ISO type flange connections made up underwater in accordance with the manufacturer’s written
specification. Type SBX ring gaskets shall conform to Table 6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If other types of end connectors are used on equipment that is made up underwater in accordance with the
manufacturer’s written specification, then means shall be provided to vent trapped pressure between the gasket
and the connector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.6.3.2
Coatings and platings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thickness of coatings and platings used on ISO ring gaskets to aid seal engagement while minimizing galling
shall not exceed 0,01 mm (0,000 5 in). The use of coatings that can be harmful to the environment or galvanically
active should be avoided. Local legislation should be checked for coatings deemed hazardous.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7 Completion guidebase<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The completion guidebase (CGB) is similar in function to a permanent guidebase used on a subsea wellhead. The
CGB attaches to either the conductor housing (after the PGB is removed), or is attached to the tubing head
connector (in the same way a tree guide frame is attached to the subsea tree connector). It provides the same
guidance for the drilling and completion equipment (BOP, production tree, running tools), and also provides
landing and structural support for ancillary equipment, such as remote OEC flowline connections. The CGB
provides guidance of the BOP and subsea tree onto the subsea wellhead or tubing head using guideline or
guidelineless methods. It also shall not interfere with BOP stack installation. Consideration shall be given to
required ROV access and cuttings disposal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guidance and orientation with other subsea equipment shall conform with 7.15.2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guidance on design and associated load testing shall conform to the requirements in 5.1.3.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8.1.1
Equipment covered<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In 7.8 are covered the tree and tubing head connectors that attach the tree or tubing head to the subsea wellhead.
In addition, tubing heads are also covered in 7.8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8.1.2
Tree/tubing head spool connectors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Three types of tree/spool connectors are commonly used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  hydraulic remote operated;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  mechanical remote actuated;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  mechanical diver/ROV operated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All connectors shall be designated by size, pressure rating and the profile type of the subsea wellhead to which
they will be attached (see Table 15). Tree/spool connectors shall conform to maximum standard pressure ratings
of 34,5 MPa (5 000 psi), 69 MPa (10 000 psi) or 103,5 MPa (15 000 psi), as applicable. Body proof testing shall
be conducted at 1,5 times the pressure rating. The design and installed preload should give consideration to
possible higher pressure from an SCSSV seal-sub leakage in the gallery inside the tree connector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tree connector may be a separate unit or may be integral with the XT valve block.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.9 Tree stab/seal subs for vertical tree<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stab subs and seal subs provide pressure-containing or pressure-controlling conduits between two remotely
mated subsea components within the tree/tubing head envelope (valve block to tubing hanger, for example).
Stab/seal subs are used on the production (injection) bore, annulus bore, hydraulic couplers, SCSSV control lines
and downhole chemical-injection lines. The housing for electrical penetrator(s) shall also be treated as a stab sub
with respect to the design requirements in 7.9. Stab/seal subs shall be considered pressure-containing if their
failure to seal as intended results in a release of wellbore fluid to the environment. Stab/seal subs shall be
considered pressure-controlling if at least one additional seal barrier exists between the stab/seal sub and the
environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stab subs and seal subs in the production and annulus bore should conform to standard maximum pressure
ratings of 34,5 MPa (5 000 psi), 69 MPa (10 000 psi) or 103,5 MPa (15 000 psi) as covered by this part of
ISO 13628. The effects of pressure acting externally on stabs and seal subs shall also be considered in their
design up to the tree pressure rating, pressure rating of any seal sub in the annulus envelope outside the seal
stab, or the hyperbaric pressure rating, whichever is greatest. Stab subs or seal subs used to conduct SCSSV
control fluid or injected chemicals shall be rated to a working pressure equal to or greater than the SCSSV control
pressure or injection pressure, respectively, whichever is the higher, and be limited to 17,2 MPa (2 500 psi) plus
the RWP of the tree. Proof testing shall be at 1,0 times the stab/seal sub pressure rating if the stab/seal sub is
pressure-controlling, and 1,5 times the stab/seal sub pressure rating if the stab/seal sub is pressure-containing.
Working-pressure tests shall be at the pressure rating of the seal sub and its fluid passage. Galleries outboard the
stab/seal sub shall be tested to the highest pressure rated stab/seal sub in that gallery, unless a means to vent
the gallery is provided, in which case the gallery test shall be at the working pressure rating of the interface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Actuators<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10.2.2.1 Equipment covered<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In 7.10.2.2 are addressed mechanical and hydraulic actuators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10.2.2.2 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following requirements apply to the design of subsea valve actuators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Design shall consider marine growth, fouling, corrosion, hydraulic operating fluid and, if exposed, the well
stream fluid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Subsea actuator opening and closing force shall be sufficient to operate the subsea valve when the valve is
at the most severe design operating conditions without exceeding 90 % of the hydraulic operating pressure
as defined in 7.10.2.2.2 c). This requirement is intended to ensure that the actuator is adequately designed to
operate with the hydraulic power source at FAT and SIT without the pressure (ambient external and hydraulic
pressure head) associated with water depth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Subsea actuators covered by this part of ISO 13628 shall be designed by the manufacturer to meet the
hydraulic control pressure rating in accordance with the manufacturer’s specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In addition to the requirement in 7.10.2.2.2 c), the subsea actuator shall be designed to control the subsea
valve when the valve is at its most severe design condition and at the hydraulic pressure(s) associated with
the most severe intended operating sequence of the valve(s) that are connected to a common supply
umbilical. This implies that the actuator shall be able to ensure that fail-closed (or fail-open or fail-in-place)
valves retain their fail (reset) position, and can subsequently respond to a command to move the valve to its
actuated position, over the range of hydraulic supply pressure created by a severe operating sequence due
to extremely long offsets (between the hydraulic supply source and the actuator), accumulator supply
drawdown or multiple valve/function operations, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10.2.2.3 Manual actuators<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following requirements apply to manual actuators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The design of the manual actuation mechanism shall take into consideration the ability of divers, ADSs and/or
ROVs, for operations. Manual valves shall be operable by divers and/or ROVs. The valve shall be protected
from over-torquing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Manufacturers of manual actuators or overrides for subsea valves shall document maintenance requirements,
number of turns to open, operating torque, maximum allowable torque or appropriate linear force to actuate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Valves shall be turned in the counter-clockwise direction to open and the clockwise direction to close as
viewed from the end of the stem for fail-close valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Intervention fixtures for manual valve actuators shall comply with the requirements of 13628-8 or ISO 13628-
9, as appropriate for the intended use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10.2.2.4 Hydraulic actuators<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following requirements apply to hydraulic actuators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Hydraulic actuators shall be designed for a specific valve or specific group of valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Hydraulic actuators shall have porting to facilitate flushing of the hydraulic cylinder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>API   S PECIFICATION  17D,   ISO   13628-4
77<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Hydraulic actuators shall be designed to operate without damage to the valve or actuator (to such an extent
that prevents meeting any other performance requirement), when hydraulic actuation pressure (within its
rated working pressure) is either applied or vented under any valve bore pressure conditions or stoppage of
the valve bore sealing mechanism at any intermediate position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The design of the actuator shall consider the effects of external hydrostatic pressure at the manufacturer’s
maximum rated water depth and the RWP of the valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Manual overrides, if provided, shall be in accordance with the following requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  A rotation-type override shall open the valve with a counter-clockwise rotation as viewed from the end of
the stem on fail closed valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  A push-pull-type override for fail-closed valve shall open the valve with a push on the override.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
For fail-open valves, the manufacturers shall document the method and procedures for override.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Position indicators shall be incorporated on all actuators unless otherwise agreed with purchaser. They shall
clearly show valve position (open/close and full travel) for observation by diver/ROV. Where the actuator
incorporates ROV override, consideration should be given to visibility of the position indicator from the
working ROV.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
The actuator fail-safe mechanism shall be designed and verified to provide a minimum mean spring life of
5 000 cycles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Actuator manufacturer shall document design and operating parameters, as listed in Table 16.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Valve/hydraulic actuator assembly<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10.2.3.1 Closing/opening force<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The subsea valve and hydraulic actuator assembly design shall utilize valve bore pressure and/or spring force to
assist closing of the fail-to-close position valve (or opening for a fail-to-open position valve).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10.2.3.2 Actuator protection from wellbore pressure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Means shall be provided to prevent overpressuring of the actuator piston and compensation chambers, in the
event that well bore pressure leaks into the actuator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10.2.3.3 Water depth rating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Manufacturer shall specify the maximum water depth rating of the valve/actuator assembly. Subsea valve and
actuator assemblies designated as fail-closed (open) shall be designed and fabricated to be capable of fully
closing (opening) the valve at the maximum rated water depth under all of the following conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
from 0,10 MPa absolute (14,7 psia) to maximum working pressure of the valve in the valve bore;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
differential pressure equal to the rated bore pressure across the valve bore sealing mechanism at the time of
operation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
external pressure on the valve/actuator assembly at the maximum rated water depth using seawater specific
gravity of 1,03;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
no hydraulic assistance in the closing (opening) direction of the actuator other than hydrostatic pressure at
the operating depth;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
for hydraulic actuators, 0,69 MPa (100 psi) plus seawater ambient hydrostatic pressure at the maximum rated
depth of the assembly acting on the actuator piston in the opening (closing) direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Other actuator performance criteria may be specified by the manufacturer, such as wire/coiled tubing shearing
design criteria, but these shall be considered separately from the above fundamental set of criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The maximum water depth rating is calculated using the above set of “extreme worst case” conditions for the
purpose of standard reference, but does not necessarily represent operating limitation. Additional information relating to
operating water depth for specific applications can be provided and agreed between manufacturer and user as being more
representative of likely field conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10.3 Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials shall conform to 5.2. Seal surfaces that engage metal-to-metal seals shall be inlaid with a corrosion-
resistant material that is compatible with well fluids, seawater, etc. Overlays are not required if the base material is
compatible with well fluids, seawater, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For forged material used for pressure-containing and high-load-bearing parts, forging practices, heat treatment
and test coupon (QTC or prolongation) requirements should meet those of API RP 6HT. In addition, the test
coupon shall accompany the material it qualifies through all thermal processing, excluding stress relief.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Hydraulic actuator hydrostatic shell test:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each hydraulic actuator cylinder and piston shall be subjected to a hydrostatic test to demonstrate structural
integrity. The test pressure shall be a minimum of 1,5 times the hydraulic RWP of the actuator. No visible leakage
shall be allowed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Minimum hold period for actuator hydrostatic test is 3 min.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Actuator operational test:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The actuator shall be tested for proper operation by stroking the actuator from the fully closed position to the fully
open position, a minimum of three times. The actuator shall operate smoothly in both directions in accordance
with the manufacturer’s written specification. Test media for hydraulic actuators shall be specified by the
manufacturer. Cycling prior to further testing followed by low pressure testing in the next step confirms that the
seals were not damaged by the high-pressure test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Hydraulic actuator seal test:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The actuator seals shall be pressure-tested in two steps by applying pressures of 0,2 times the hydraulic RWP
and a minimum of 1,0 times the hydraulic RWP of the actuator. No seal leakage shall be allowed. The test media
shall be specified by the manufacturer. The minimum test duration for each test pressure shall be 3 min. The test
period shall not begin until the test pressure has been reached and has stabilized. The test gauge pressure
reading and time at the beginning and at the end of each pressure holding period shall be recorded. The low-
pressure test is not applicable to flow-by-type actuators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vertical and horizontal trees use internally and externally attached tree caps. When internal caps are used, an
external debris cap or cover may be installed to protect sealing surfaces and hydraulic couplers. Hydraulic
couplers may be incorporated in the tree cap. These may be integral with the cap or externally attached. The
design and manufacture of control couplers/connectors are addressed in 7.20.2.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Pressure-containing tree cap<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An externally attached pressure-containing tree cap provides protection to the re-entry interface and hydraulic
couplers and provides an additional sealing barrier between tree wellbore(s) and the environment. The cap may
also perform the function of mating the control system hydraulic couplers. An internally attached pressure-
containing tree cap provides an additional pressure barrier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The design should consider protection of actuators and critical components from dropped objects, trawl boards,
etc. when applicable. Design and associated load testing shall conform to the requirements in 5.1.3.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tree-guidebase should have a guidance structure that interfaces with the CGB or posts from the PGB (GRA),
to provide initial orientation and alignment. It shall be designed to provide alignment to protect seals, control line
stabs and seal surfaces from damage in accordance with the manufacturer’s written specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.15.2 Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.15.2.1
Guidance and orientation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For guideline configurations, interfacing shall conform to the dimensions shown in Figure 9 a), unless the
orientation system requires tighter tolerances. Guide-post funnels are typically fabricated from 273 mm OD  ×  13
mm wall (10  3/4  in OD  ×  0,5 in wall) pipe or tubulars. Spatial orientation (heading (yaw) and vertical tilt (pitch-
sway) and fixed X-Y-Z position) tolerance is typically  ±  0,5° when mated with the guide posts. Where guidance
and orientation is dependent on guide posts, alternative means of orienting the tree running tool during surface
installation/testing shall be considered to prevent damage to seal bores during installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For guidelineless configurations, a re-entry funnel may surround the wellhead or tubing head looking upward
(funnel-up) or may be configured in concert with matching funnel equipment on the tree connector and
subsequently landed over the wellhead/tubing head (funnel down). Funnel geometry usually involves one (or
more) diagonal cone(s) and a centre cylinder frame to provide alignment between mating components/structures.
The outermost diameter of the diagonal cone should be no less than 1,5 times the diameter of the component it is
capturing. The diagonal cone’s angle should be no shallower than 40° with respect to horizontal. Typically the
cone angle is 45°. Once captured, the cone(s) and inner cylinder should be designed to allow for equipment re-
entry at tilt angles up to 3° (from vertical) in any orientation, and subsequently assist in righting the captured
component to vertical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Portions of the re-entry cone may be scalloped out to accommodate the guidelineless re-entry of adjacent
equipment whose capture funnel can intersect with the main funnel(s) because of space constraints. This is
acceptable, although it takes away from the re-entry properties of the funnel in the scalloped-out area. Its practice
should be carried out with sound engineering judgement comparing operational limits lost versus size and mass
(weight) gained. Ideally, scalloped funnels should be minimized or covered wherever practical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since funnel-up re-entry designs are typically cylindrical and conical in nature, horizontal resting pads or a beam
structure should be incorporated in the frame’s design to provide a sound, flat surface that can firmly sit on spider
beams to support or suspend the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When spatial orientation is required, funnel-up funnels and capture equipment may also feature Y-slots and
orienting pins. The upper portion of the Y-slot should be wide enough to capture mating pins within  ±  7,5° of true
orientation. The Y-slot should then taper down to a width commensurate with the pin to provide orientation to
within  ±  0,5° (similar to the angular orientation provided by guide posts and funnels). Typically, there are two or
four orienting pins, each with a minimum diameter of 101,6 mm (4,0 in) in diameter [Figure 9 b)]. Other orientation
methods, such as orienting helixes or indexing devices (ratchets, etc.) are also acceptable. Whatever the orienting
method, it is necessary that the design allow for the 3° tilt re-entry requirement with enough play to accommodate
this gimballing effect unimpeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Funnel-down orientation methods include helixes, indexing devices or circumferential alignment pins/posts.
Orientation should initially allow a wide enough capture within  ±  7,5° of true orientation, then refine the alignment
down to an orientation to within  ±  0,5°. Whatever the orienting method, it is necessary that the design allow for the
3° tilt re-entry requirement with enough play to accommodate this gimballing effect unimpeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.20.2.2
Size and pressure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All pipe/tubing/hose shall be 6,0 mm (0,25 in) diameter, or larger. Sizes and pressure ratings of individual tubing
runs shall be determined to suit the functions being operated. Consideration shall be given to preventing
restrictions in the control tubing that can cause undesirable pressure drops across the system. Injection lines,
downhole hydraulic, connector/gasket seals test lines, pressure monitor lines or any line that by design is exposed
to wellbore fluids shall be rated at the working pressure of the tree. SCSSV lines shall be rated at the specified
SCSSV operating pressure (see 5.1.2.1.1 and 9.2.7 for additional information).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.20.2.3
Optical cables and cable penetrations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Optical fibres shall be routed inside fluid-filled conduits; typically a fluid-filled hose for flying-lead or short-cable
applications, and a metal tube for longer umbilical applications. Optical terminations shall include qualified
penetrations to prevent fluid leakage from these conduits. Optical penetrations into pressure-containing cavities or
piping systems shall be qualified for the full differential pressure across the penetration. Optical fibres run in flui d -

<<HEADING level=3>>7.20.2.4
Envelope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All pipe/tubing/hose/electric or optical cable shall be within the envelope defined by the guide frames of the tree,
running/retrieving tool or the flowline base.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.20.2.5
Routing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The routing of all conduits (pipe/tubing/hose/electric or optical cable) shall be carefully planned and conduits
should be supported and protected to minimize damage during testing, installation/retrieval and normal operations
of the subsea tree. Free spans shall be avoided and, where necessary, conduits shall be supported and/or
protected by trays/covers. The bend radius of cold-bent tubing shall not exceed the requirements of ISO 15156
(all parts) for cold-working. Cold bends shall be in accordance with ANSI/ASME B31.3. Tubing running to
hydraulic tree connectors, running tool connectors and flowline connectors shall be accessible to divers/ROV/ROT,
such that it can be disconnected, vented or cut, in order to release locked-in fluid and allow mechanical override.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Electrical cables should be routed such that any water entering the compensated hoses moves away from the end
terminations by gravity. Electrical signal cables shall be screened/shielded to avoid cross talk and other
interferences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.20.2.6
Small bore tubing and connections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydraulic couplers, end fittings and couplers shall meet or exceed requirements of the existing piping code used
for the piping/tubing/hose design in 7.20.2.1. Small-bore [less than 25,4 mm (1,0 in) ID] tubing runs should be
planned so as to use the minimum number of fittings or weld joints. Welding may be used to join tubes at the
manufacturer’s discretion. Fittings and socket welds may be used on all small-bore tubing that does not penetrate
the wellbore. Fittings and socket welds may be used on small-bore tubing that penetrates the wellbore (for
example, chemical injection or SCSSV) if they are outboard of two isolation devices, one of which is remotely
operated. Connections on small-bore tubing that penetrates the wellbore inboard of the two isolation devices shall
be full-penetration butt welds as specified in 5.3.1. Tubing and hose fittings shall be tested to verify that they are
not isolated from the cathodic protection system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quality requirements for small-bore tubing and connections shall be to the manufacturer’s written specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The coupling stab/receiver plate assembly shall be designed to withstand the rated working pressure applied
simultaneously in every control path without deforming to the extent that any other performance requirement is
affected in accordance with the manufacturer’s written specification. In addition, when non-pressure
balanced-control couplers are used, the manufacturer shall determine and document the rated water depth at
which coupler plate/junction plate can decouple the control couplers without deformation damage to the plate
assemblies with zero pressure inside the couplers. The manufacturer shall determine and document the force
required for decoupling at the rated water depth with zero pressure inside the couplers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Proprietary coupler stab and receiver-plate designs shall meet the test requirements in 7.20.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.20.2.7
Electrical connectors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Electrical connection interfaces made up subsea shall prevent the ingress of water or external contaminants. The
retrievable half of conductive-type electrical connectors should contain seals, primary compensation chambers,
penetrators, springs, etc. The design of the non-retrievable half should consider the effects of corrosion,
calcareous growth, cathodic protection, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.20.2.8
Optical connectors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Optical-connection interfaces made up subsea shall feature pressure-compensated chambers in which the final
optical-fibre connections are engaged. The configuration shall prevent the ingress of water or external
contaminants that can potentially interfere with the optical fibre engagement. Optical connectors should ideally
include an automatic mechanism to wipe the face of the fibres prior to final engagement of the mating fibres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Control line stabs/couplers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a minimum, control line stabs for the SCSSV, production master valve(s), production wing valve, and annulus
master valve shall be designed so as not to trap pressure when the control stabs are separated except where
allowed in 9.2.9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Both vented and non-vented control stabs shall be designed to minimize seawater ingress when
connected/disconnected. They shall be capable of disconnection at the rated internal working pressure, without
detrimental effects to the seal interface. The half containing the seals shall be located in the retrievable
assemblies. In addition to the internal working pressure, the control stabs shall be designed to withstand external
hydrostatic pressure at manufacturer’s rated water depth. Stabs shall be capable of sealing at all pressures within
their rating, in both the mated and un-mated (non-vented type) condition, except as noted in 7.20.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Venting control stab connections are primarily intended as a well control feature of a subsea tree when the tree is
controlled by direct or a piloted hydraulic control system. Subsea tree interface designs with individual hydraulic control lines
often feature poppet connections to protect the line from debris and seawater ingress. If the control stab connection were
separated during a severe damage or emergency disconnect event before hydraulic line pressure can be bled down, the
individual stab’s poppet can trap hydraulic control line pressure behind the poppet, preventing the above mentioned fail-closed
safety devices from closing. The venting control stab requirement is intended to circumvent the trapped pressure possibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The venting control stab requirement is not intended for other control system configurations or their internal
interface connections providing a fail-safe vent feature is included to allow fail-closed safety devices to close. ISO
13628-6/API 17F provides guidance on proper avoidance of trapped hydraulic pressure situations for these
control systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.20.2.10 Alignment/orientation of receiver plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Multi-port hydraulic receiver plates, as used at the control pod, tree cap, tree running tool, etc., shall have an
alignment system to ensure correct alignment of hydraulic couplers prior to engagement of their seals. The stab’s
couplers shall be mounted in a manner to accommodate any misalignment during make-up. The alignment shall
also not allow miscommunication between umbilical lines and tree plumbing, i.e. shall align in one orientation only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>After assembly, all tubing runs and hydraulically actuated equipment shall be flushed to meet the cleanliness
requirements of SAE/AS 4059. The class of cleanliness shall be as agreed between the manufacturer and
purchaser. Final flushing operations shall use a hydraulic fluid compatible with the fluid being used in the field
operations. Equipment shall be supplied filled with hydraulic fluid. Fittings, hydraulic couplings, etc., shall be
blanked off after completion of flushing/testing to prevent particle contamination during storage and retrieval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Specific requirements — Subsea wellhead<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.1
Clause 8 describes subsea wellhead systems that are normally run from floating drilling rigs. It
establishes standards and specifications for this equipment. The subsea wellhead system supports and seals
casing strings. It also supports the BOP stack during drilling, and the subsea tree and possibly the tubing hanger
after completion. The subsea wellhead system is installed at or near the mudline.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2
All pressure-containing and pressure-controlling parts included as part of the subsea wellhead
equipment shall be designed to meet all of the requirements of ISO   15156 (all parts). These parts include<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  wellhead housing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  casing hanger bodies;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  annulus seal assemblies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.3
The following parts or features are excluded from ISO   15156 (all parts) requirements:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  lock rings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  load rings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  load shoulders;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  suspension equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  bore protectors and wear bushings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.4
Additionally, life-of-well parameters shall be included in design considerations, including contributions
from the drilling, testing, completion and production phases of well operations. While the codes governing the
structural capacity of the wellhead system ensure reliability in the short-term, this is insufficient to ensure integrity
for long-term production applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Further evaluation is required for the following issues, which affect long-term reliability:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  cyclic external loads;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  internal pressure cycle loads and displacements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  thermal loads and gradients;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  general corrosion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  stress corrosion cracking (due to hydrogen, H 2 S or chlorides).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

D ESIGN AND  O PERATION OF  S UBSEA  P RODUCTION  S YSTEMS ,   P ART  4:   S UBSEA  W ELLHEAD AND  T REE  E QUIPMENT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These issues may require assessment by fatigue analysis, fracture mechanics evaluation, structural evaluation
due to thermal loading, or structural evaluation with reduced capacity due to corrosion allowance. While cathodic
protection systems are often utilized for production wells to reduce corrosion, this can increase the possibility for
stress corrosion cracking due to the release of free hydrogen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Temporary guidebase<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The TGB when used provides a guide template for drilling the conductor hole and stabbing the conductor pipe. It
compensates for misalignment from irregular ocean-bottom conditions and may provide a support base for the
PGB. If used together with a PGB, a cone-and-gimbal arrangement compensates for angular misalignment
between the TGB and the PGB due to the seabed topography and the verticality of the well. For guideline
systems, it also establishes the initial anchor point for the guidelines. It may also include a provision for
suspending a foundation sleeve to support unconsolidated surface soils. The TGB might not always be used, as
in the case of template completions or satellite structure (foundation and/or protective structure) completions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A TGB may also serve as a mudmat if the drilling of the conductor hole is performed by jetting operations. In this
instance, it serves a physical stop to assure that the wellhead stays a fixed distance above the sea floor and
subsequently serves as a temporary foundation, enhancing the bearing load capacity in unconsolidated or under-
consolidated surface soils. The increased bearing capacity is used to support the weight of the conductor
(preventing it from sinking) until the next section of hole is drilled and the surface pipe is sufficiently landed and
cemented in place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Provisions for the design and associated load testing shall conform to the requirements in 5.1.3.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.2 Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.2.1
Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following loads shall be considered and documented by the manufacturer when designing the TGB:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  ballast;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  weight of conductor pipe;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  weight of PGB assembly;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Hanging or suspension loads;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  soil reaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The TGB shall be capable of supporting, as a minimum, a static load of 780   kN (175   000   lbf) on the interface with
the PGB while the TGB is supported at four locations, equally spaced 90° ±  2° apart and a minimum of 1 575   mm
(62   in) from the centre (radial measure). Recommendations for lifting pad eyes are outlined in Annex K.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.2.2

<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements for dimensions are as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The TGB minimum bearing area shall be 7 m 2  (75 ft 2 ). This area may be augmented with weld-on or bolt-on
extensions to compensate for soil strengths and anticipated loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
TGB should pass through a 5 m (16,4 ft) square opening or as specified by the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
TGB shall provide four guideline anchor points in position to match the guide posts on the PGB.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Together with the PGB, the TGB shall allow a minimum angular misalignment of 5° between the conductor
pipe and the temporary guidebase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
TGB shall provide a minimum storage volume of 2 m 3  (70,6   ft 3 ) for ballast material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Permanent guidebase<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The PGB attaches to the conductor housing and provides guidance for the drilling and completion equipment
(surface casing, BOP, production tree, running tools). The PGB provides entry into the well prior to installation of
the wellhead housing and BOP. After the wellhead housing installation, the PGB provides guidance of the BOP,
subsea tree or tubing head onto the wellhead housing using guideline or guidelineless methods. It may establish
structural support and final alignment for the wellhead system and provides a seat and lock down for the
conductor housing. PGBs can be built as a single piece or split into two pieces to ease handling and installation.
Optionally, they may include provisions for conductor-pipe hang-off, retrieval and to transfer flowline loads. The
PGB may be retrieved after drilling is complete and replaced by a PGB carrying flowline connection/manifold
equipment. Alternatively, the PGB installed for drilling may carry flowline connection/manifold equipment. In either
case, the equipment shall not interfere with the BOP stack installation. Consideration shall be given to required
ROV access and cuttings disposal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A PGB using a re-entry funnel for guidelineless equipment guidance is often referred to as a guidelineless re-entry
assembly or GRA. The re-entry funnel may be on the GRA housing looking upward (funnel-up) or may be
configured in concert with matching funnel equipment on the subsea equipment subsequently landed in the GRA
(funnel down). Funnel geometry usually involves one (or more) diagonal cone(s) and a centre cylinder frame to
provide alignment between mating components/structures. The outermost diameter of the diagonal cone should
be no less than 1,5   times the diameter of the component it is capturing. The diagonal cone’s angle should be no
shallower than 40° with respect to horizontal. Typically the cone angle is 45°. Once captured, the GRA’s cone(s)
and inner cylinder should be designed to allow for equipment re-entry at tilt angles up to 3° from vertical in any
orientation, and subsequently assist in righting the captured component to vertical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Portions of the re-entry cone may be scalloped out to accommodate the guidelineless re-entry of adjacent
equipment whose capture funnel can intersect with the main funnel(s) because of space constraints. This is
acceptable, although it takes away from the re-entry properties of the funnel in the scalloped-out area. Its practice
should be carried out with sound engineering judgement comparing operational limits lost versus size and weight
gained. Ideally, scalloped funnels should be minimized or covered wherever practical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>GRAs also may include provisions for conductor-pipe hang-off. If so, since GRAs are typically cylindrical and
conical in nature, horizontal resting pads or a beam structure should be incorporated in the frame’s design to
provide a sound flat surface that can firmly sit on spider beams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When spatial orientation is required, the funnel-up funnels and capture equipment may also feature Y-slots and
orienting pins. The upper portion of the Y-slot should be wide enough to capture mating pins within  ±  7,5° of true
orientation. The Y-slot should then taper down to a width commensurate with the pin to provide orientation to
within  ±  0,5° (similar to the angular orientation provided by guide posts and funnels). Typically, there are two or
four orienting pins, each with a minimum diameter of 101,6   mm (4,00   in) in diameter. Other orientation methods,
such as orienting helixes or indexing devices (ratchets, etc.) are also acceptable. Whatever the orienting method,
it is necessary that the design allow for the 3° tilt re-entry requirement with enough play to accommodate this
gimballing effect unimpeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Funnel-down funnels do not easily accommodate Y-slots and orienting pins. Alternate orientation methods such
as orientation helixes or indexing devices may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>PGB/GRAs should not impede the flowby required for cementing, jetting ops., etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

When used with the TGB, the PGB (GRA) shall allow a minimum angular misalignment of 5° between a
762 mm (30 in) conductor pipe and the TGB. For other conductor pipe sizes, the manufacturer shall
document the misalignment capability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Guide posts shall be field-replaceable without welding, using either diver, ROV or remote tooling. The locking
mechanism should not inadvertently release due to snagging wires, cables, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Guide posts can be either slotted or non-slotted. Slotted guide posts are required when used with a TGB, if
the guidelines are not disconnected from the TGB. For slotted guide posts, provisions shall be made to insert
guidelines of at least 19   mm (3/4   in) OD into the post with retainers at the top and at or near the bottom of the
post.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Provisions shall be made to attach guidelines to the top of the guide posts. The guidelines shall be capable of
being released and re-established. This may be by the use of diver, ROV or remote tooling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The PGB (GRA) should contain a feature that facilitates the orientation between the PGB (GRA) and the
conductor housing. The orientation device may allow the installation of the guidebase in multiple-orientation
positions to suit rig heading. The orientation device may also provide an anti-rotation feature to resist the
loads defined in 8.3.2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
When specified, the PGB (GRA) shall contain grouting funnels for cement top-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
When specified, the PGB (GRA) shall contain seals and a structure to deflect seabed and cement-port gases
(which can form hydrates) from entering the BOP, subsea tree or tubing head connector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Guidelineless equipment shall not reduce the release angle of the BOP, tree or tubing head connector. The

<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The conductor housing attaches to the top of the conductor pipe to form the basic foundation of a subsea well.
The housing typically has a means of attaching to the PGB (GRA), which can also provide a means for anti-

profile. The external profile of the conductor housing shall be compatible with supporting the conductor pipe in the
rotary table and/or at the spider beams in the moonpool. Cement return passageways may be incorporated in the
conductor housing/PGB (GRA) assembly to allow directing cement and mud returns either below the PGB (GRA)

<<HEADING level=3>>8.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The subsea casing hanger is installed on top of each casing string and supports the string when landed in the
wellhead housing. It is configured to run through the drilling riser and subsea BOP stack, land in the subsea
wellhead, and support the required casing load. It shall have provisions for an annulus seal assembly and support
loads generated by BOP test pressures above the hanger and loads due to subsequent casing strings. Means
shall be provided to transfer casing load and test pressure load to the wellhead housing or to the previous casing
hanger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A pup joint of casing should be installed on the hanger in the shop. This reduces the risk of damage during
handling and later make-up in the field. API threaded connections should follow ISO 10426 (all parts) for make-up
requirements when connecting the pup joint to the hanger. Sufficient length shall be provided on both the hanger
and the pup joint for tonging. Proprietary thread connection should be made up in accordance with the
manufacturer’s written specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For the purposes of this provision, API Spec 5CT is equivalent to ISO 10426 (all parts).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Subsea casing hangers shall be treated as pressure-controlling equipment as defined in ISO 10423. In some
cases, a casing string may be suspended in a submudline landing ring that is included as part of another casing
string below the wellhead. Submudline casing hangers suspended from submudline landing rings shall meet the

<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  rigidize and prevent vertical movement of the casing hanger and annulus seal assembly, thereby improving
the long-term sealing integrity of the annulus seal assembly;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  resist greater upward loads than the lockdown device on the annulus seal assembly is capable of resisting,
such as thermal expansion loads of the production casing string;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  isolate the uppermost annulus seal assembly from the annulus between the production tubing and the
production casing hanger;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  provide a sealing interface to a subsea tree, tubing hanger or tubing head;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  provide a lockdown profile for the tubing hanger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lockdown bushings shall be treated as pressure-controlling equipment as defined in ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lockdown bushing may be configured to run in open water and/or through the drilling/completion riser and
subsea BOP. The lockdown bushing shall be designed such that it is retrievable through the drilling/completion
riser and subsea BOP.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirement for using a lockdown bushing is dependent on the design of the casing hanger and annulus seal
assembly, the project specific loading conditions and the interface to the subsea tree, tubing hanger or tubing
head. When the wellhead and tree systems are provided by different manufacturers, the user is responsible for
interfacing with the subsea wellhead and tree system manufacturers to determine whether a lockdown bushing is
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The function of the corrosion cap is to protect the subsea wellhead from contamination by debris, marine growth
and corrosion. These caps usually are non-pressure-containing and lock onto the external profile of the wellhead
housing. If a pressure retaining cap is utilized, means shall be provided for sensing and relieving pressure prior to
releasing the cap. The cap is installed just prior to temporary abandonment of a well. It may be a design that
allows installation prior to, or after installation of, the tubing hanger. The cap may be required to have the facility
for injection of a corrosion inhibitor into the well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The corrosion cap may be run with a dedicated tool or by ROV. Consideration shall be given to the length of time
the cap is expected to be on the wellhead with respect to corrosion of the cap itself and the provision of cathodic
protection. Due consideration shall also be given to the method of inhibiting the well, especially where personnel
can be exposed to inhibitor chemicals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.11 Running, retrieving and testing tools<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tools for running, retrieving and for testing all subsea wellhead components, including guidance equipment,

Annex H.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.12 Trawl protective structure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An over-trawlable protection structure shall be provided when requested by the user. The structure may serve a
dual purpose:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  external protection to foreign objects against being dropped/dragged or snagged;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  internal corrosion protection of seal surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.13 Wellhead inclination and orientation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For ease of current and future operations, the conductor should be as close to vertical as possible. An inclination
of 0,5° or less helps to ensure that future completion scenarios are possible. An inclination of between 0,5° and
1,0° can restrict options for tiebacks, well completion and re-entry, but can be safely drilled by making some
adjustments to rig position. Readings of more than 1° can lead to damage due to drill-pipe key seating between
the casing hanger and flex joint, even with rig position adjustments; and an angle greater than 1,25° can severely
restrict future operations. Additional guidance can be obtained by consulting the manufacturer following a
discussion with the user on intended future well activities. In any event, the actual inclination and azimuth of the
wellhead (for example 0,4°, with top of wellhead leaning toward 258° from true north) shall be recorded in the job
report and well file.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_155>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API   S PECIFICATION  17D,   ISO   13628-4
145<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical considerations when determining the acceptable inclination are as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  performance capabilities of equipment and tooling;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  subsequent operations that will be performed: Do they involve a subsea tree, template, tieback to surface for
a platform, or floating production facility;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  size and configuration of subsea test tree, if a horizontal tree will be used;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  length of tubing hanger, tieback, etc.;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  water depth, currents and sea states, in general, which can increase the sensitivity to being off vertical;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  well re-entry methods and frequency of re-entry;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  record keeping, likelihood that someone will check the slope indicator records in future before re-entering the
well;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  relative angle between marine riser and bop/wellhead;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  whether angle of wellhead can change over time;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  uncertainty of angle measurements, now and in the future;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  allowable angles, which can be different for installation and retrieval; generally retrieval is more difficult
because tension increases drag when not aligned;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  likely increase in wear/key seating on bore surfaces and tools as inclination increases;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  ability to migrate rig position to align the riser with the wellhead.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.14 Submudline casing hanger and seal assemblies<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.14.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Submudline casing hangers provide a suspension point for additional intermediate casing strings that cannot be
accommodated by a standard conductor or wellhead housings. Submudline casing hanger seal assemblies
provide pressure isolation between the submudline landing ring and submudline casing hanger. Submudline
landing rings are integrally incorporated into the casing string below a subsea wellhead or low-pressure housing.
Submudline casing hangers suspend the next casing string, landing on and transferring their loads to the landing
ring. Load limits and pressure ratings for the landing ring, the submudline casing hanger and seal assembly shall
be defined by the manufacturer. The user should define the material, interface and design-load requirements of
the casing strings that incorporate the submudline landing ring and casing hanger in the well design. Submudline
seal assemblies are actuated by various methods, including torque, weight and/or hydraulic pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.14.2 Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Submudline landing rings and casing hangers are integral parts of casing strings. They are, therefore, specifically
excluded from the design requirements and pressure rating methods assigned to like components in Clause 8.
Design requirements and allowable stresses for these components are provided in 10.1.2 dealing with mudline
suspension equipment. These allowable stresses are in keeping with current industry practice for safe working
pressures for casing. Equipment ratings should remain the same regardless of their location in the casing string.
Submudline landing rings and casing hangers should not be subjected to the rated working pressure nor test
pressure associated with the low-pressure or high-pressure wellhead housing when a landing ring is placed
directly below these housings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Specific requirements — Subsea tubing hanger system<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tubing-hanger system is comprised of a tubing-suspension device called a tubing hanger and an associated
tubing-hanger running tool and, in certain cases, an orientation joint. This part of ISO 13628 is limited to tubing
hangers that are landed in a wellhead, tubing head or horizontal tree. A tubing annulus seal is effected between
the tubing hanger of the casing hanger, the tubing head or the horizontal tree, and the hanger is locked in place. It
is designed to provide a means for making a pressure-tight connection between the tubing string(s), tubing
annulus and the corresponding subsea tree or tubing-hanger running tool bores. It may also provide a continuous
means of communication or control of SCSSVs, electrical transducers and/or other downhole devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are three basic types of tubing hangers:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
concentric;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
eccentric (those that require orientation to align multiple tubing bores or control ports);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
horizontal tree type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See Annex D for representative illustrations of these tubing hanger types.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are two types of orientation systems:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  active (rotary) type, requiring the rotation of the running string by the application of torque at the surface, until
it locates an orientation device that orients the hanger relative to the wellhead/tubing head/horizontal tree;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  passive (linear) type, uses downward or upward motion of the running string to engage a pin or key in an
orientation device that automatically orients the hanger relative to the wellhead/tubing head/horizontal tree.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2 Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The OD of the tubing hanger system shall be compatible with the ID of the BOP stack and marine riser system
being used. Particular attention shall be given to the design of the lock and seal mechanisms to minimize the risk
of their hanging up during installation or retrieval. The design should keep diameters to the minimum and
minimize the length of large diameters in order to ease running and retrieving of the tubing-hanger system through
the ball/flex joint. The operating procedures should advise the limiting ball/flex-joint angle for running and
retrieving of the tubing hanger system. The design of tubing hanger systems shall comply with 5.1. Irrespective of
orientation system, the seals shall not engage in the sealing bore until the orientation is complete. Typical
orientation devices are keys that engage slots in the BOP connector, orienting bushings/cams temporarily
installed in the BOP connector, orienting bushings/cams permanently installed in the tubing head or horizontal
tree body and extending pins in the BOP stack used in conjunction with a camming profile on the running tool or
orientation joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The orientation joint is outside the scope of this part of ISO 13628.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On concentric tubing-hanger systems and horizontal trees, annulus access may be through an outlet below the
tubing hanger in the tubing head or horizontal tree body. Where it is through the hanger and into the tree
connector cavity area, provision shall be provided for sealing off the annulus bore by the use of a check valve,
sliding sleeve or similar device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>API   S PECIFICATION  17D,   ISO   13628-4
147<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tubing hanger running tool may be mechanically or hydraulically actuated. On hydraulically actuated designs,
the running tool shall be of a “fail-as-is” design, so that in the event of loss of control pressure, it shall not result in
the release of the tubing hanger from its running tool. There shall be positive indication that the running tool is
correctly attached to the tubing hanger before supporting the weight of the tubing string. It is a requirement to
effect release of the hydraulic running tool from the tubing hanger in the event of lost hydraulic control pressure.
The top of the running tool/orientation joint shall interface with the completion riser, tubing strings or drill pipe as
specified by the manufacturer. On horizontal tree applications, the top of the running tool/extension joint shall
interface with the tieback string or subsea test tree.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.2 Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a minimum, the following loads shall be considered and documented by the manufacturer when designing the

utilized as permanent pressure barriers. Crown plugs shall meet the general design criteria, material and testing
requirements of an internal tree cap as stated in 7.12 and Tables 4 and 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.7 Rated working pressure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tubing hanger shall have a rated working pressure of either 34,5 MPa (5 000 psi), 69 MPa (10 000 psi), or
103,5 MPa (15 000 psi) . This rating shall be exclusive of the tubing connection(s) at the bottom of the hanger.
Any operating control or injection passage through the tubing hanger body shall have a minimum pressure rating
equal to 1,0 times RWP, up to a pressure rating equal to 1,0 times RWP plus 17,2 MPa (2 500 psi).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rated working pressure of the tubing hanger shall be equal to the tree pressure rating of either 34,5 MPa

<<PARAGRAPH>>There shall be a minimum of two seal barriers between the SCSSV and chemical-injection control-line stabs of the
tubing hanger and the environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On vertical tree applications, SCSSV control-line stabs in the tubing hanger shall be designed so as to vent
control pressure when the tree is removed. The SCSSV control stab shall be designed to minimize the ingress of
debris and seawater when the tree is removed. The pressure rating of the control line stabs shall be the same as
or greater than the SCSSV control pressure and shall be selected from 9.2.7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On horizontal tree applications, the horizontal SCSSV control line stab may contain an integral coupler with
poppet check valve or other valve type for the purpose of isolating the wellbore completion fluid from the control-

<<HEADING level=3>>10 Specific requirements — Mudline suspension equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.1.1
Clause 10 covers drilling and completion equipment used to suspend the casing weight at or near the
mudline, to provide pressure control and to provide annulus access to the surface wellhead. Mudline equipment is
used when drilling with a bottom-supported rig or platform and provides for drilling, abandonment and tiebacks to
either a platform or subsea completion. Mudline landing rings and hangers can sometimes be used as part of the
casing string below a subsea wellhead. Such parts shall comply with the requirements of 8.14.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mudline casing hangers, casing hanger running tools (landing subs), casing hanger landing rings, and tieback
tools (tieback subs) are, in fact, an integral part of the casing strings. They are therefore specifically excluded from
the design requirements and pressure rating methods assigned to like components in ISO 10423 and Clause 8,
and specifically given the design requirements and allowable stresses in 10.1 through 10.5. These allowable
stresses are in keeping with current industry practice for safe working pressures for casing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mudline equipment typically involves proprietary profiles/configurations and/or ISO standard connections. The
tools used for installation, retrieval and testing are typically task-specific and remotely operated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.1.2
The technical content of Clause 10 provides equipment-specific requirements for performance,
design, material and testing. Specific mudline suspension equipment used during drilling and/or run as part of the
casing string includes the following; see Figure E.1:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  landing rings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  casing hangers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  casing hanger running tools (landing subs);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  tieback adapters (tieback subs);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  abandonment caps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.1.3
Major components of mudline suspension equipment used during drilling and/or run as part of the
casing string are designated as pressure-controlling parts as defined in ISO 10423. For quality control purposes,
these components shall be treated as “casing and tubing hanger mandrels” as set forth in ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specific mudline conversion equipment for subsea completions includes the following; see Figure E.2:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  mudline conversion equipment (with space-out adjustment);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  tubing head assemblies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.1.1.5
Major components of mudline-conversion equipment shall be designated as either pressure-
containing or pressure-controlling parts using the definitions set forth in ISO 10423. Components designated as
pressure-containing parts shall be treated as “bodies” in ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>High-pressure risers and accessory tools used with mudline equipment, such as brush and cleanout tools, cap
running tools, etc., are beyond the scope of this part of ISO 13628.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The general design requirements for mudline equipment shall comply with 5.1. If specific requirements for mudline
equipment in Cause 10 differ from the general requirements stated in 5.1, these specific requirements shall take
precedence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1.2.2
Rated working pressure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For each piece of mudline equipment, a rated working pressure shall be determined in accordance with Table 34
and Annex E, or by proof testing as specified in ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rated working pressure shall be inclusive of the pressure capacity of the end connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a  Stresses given in this table shall be determined in accordance with the definitions and methods presented in
Annex E. The designer shall consider the effects of stresses beyond the yield point on non-integral connections,
such as threaded connections and latch profiles, where progressive distortion can result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b  Bending stresses in this method are limited to values lower than are permitted by the ASME method for
secondary stresses, since this table provides a limit-based method with inherently higher safety margins. An
alternative method is included in Annex E to permit higher secondary stresses while controlling membrane
stresses to the traditional, more conservative limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A rated running capacity shall be determined for each piece of mudline suspension equipment in the load path
between the top connection of the running tool and the lower connection of the hanger that is run as part of the
casing string. The rated running capacity is defined as the maximum weight that can be run below the mudline
component. Rated running capacity is not the same as joint strength, ultimate tensile strength or proof test load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.1 Description<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.1.1
Mudline casing hangers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mudline casing hangers typically provide the following functions and features within the mudline suspension
system:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  support casing weight at mudline;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  support casing weight of subsequent strings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  allow annulus access to the surface wellhead;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  allow for mud/cement flowby while running and landing in previous hanger;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  allow attachment of running tool, tieback riser sub and/or subsea conversion equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  provide for reciprocating the casing string during cementing operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.1.2
End connections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The casing hanger and running tool are normally installed with casing extensions made up to both ends. Normally,
the running tool (landing sub) extension has a pin-by-box casing nipple extension, and the casing hanger has a
pin-by-pin casing extension. The assembly of casing extensions, running tool and casing hanger shall be done
prior to shipment to the rig. This allows the handling and running of the casing-hanger assembly as just another
piece of casing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.1.3
Landing shoulders<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Landing shoulders on casing hangers are typically one of two following types:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  fixed support rings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  non-fixed or expanding/contracting latch rings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fixed support ring lands on a bevelled landing shoulder (usually 45°) in the landing ring or previous casing
hanger. Flowby porting for mud and cement passage and adequate bearing capacity is maintained on this landing
ring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The non-fixed support ring has an expanding/contracting latching load ring that locates in the appropriate landing
groove. In some cases during cementing operations, the casing is reciprocated a short distance above the hanger
seat. Therefore, the non-fixed landing rings typically do not have permanent lockdown mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Internal profiles<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The internal profiles of mudline casing hangers serve these functions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  lock and seal running tool (landing sub) and tieback adapters;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  seat subsequent casing hangers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  seat tubing hanger (optional).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lock and seal mechanism for the running tool and tieback adapters is usually the upper internal profile of the
mudline casing hanger. The locking profile may be a thread or an internal locking groove for a cam-actuated
locking mechanism. The running tool is usually designed to release with right-hand rotation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wash ports may be incorporated as necessary into each landing sub or casing hanger to give a washout flow rate,
without cutting out the port area. After the casing hanger has been landed and cemented, the wash ports are
opened. After flushing out the casing riser annulus, the wash ports are closed. The purpose of washing out the
casing riser area is to ensure that excessive cement has been removed from the casing hanger/running tool
connection area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Major components of mudline conversion equipment shall be treated as pressure-controlling parts as defined in
ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6.2 Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mudline conversions typically provide limited structural support, centralization and pressure control for preparing a
well drilled with mudline hangers for a subsea completion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lower end of mudline conversion equipment shall provide a load shoulder (or threaded) and sealing interface
for at least two tieback adapters and casing strings. The conversion may also provide a centralizing and load-
bearing feature to provide structural integrity to transfer applied loads to the surface casing or conductor pipe. The
mudline conversion hardware also shall feature the necessary adjustment capability to accommodate the spacing
between the mudline wellhead casing hangers, the surface pipe end and the subsea completion hardware.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The upper end of mudline conversion equipment shall feature a tubing-head assembly to interface with a high-
pressure completion riser, the subsea tubing hanger and subsea tree. The tubing head also interfaces with the
tubing hanger/wear bushing, riser testing plug equipment and an annulus access connection to one or more of the
annular spaces between the casing strings/tieback adapters below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care shall be exercised when specifying  in situ  testing of mudline conversion equipment such that the suspension
equipment does not see higher pressures than pressure rating for the well’s casing, the tieback adapter, or the
casing strings installed above and below the casing hanger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The casing riser string that attaches to the tubing head is often the defining requirement for pressure rating and
equipment size for a mudline conversion system. Usually, this riser string has a thicker wall and/or is made from
the higher-strength materials required to withstand both internal pressure and external environmental loads. The
riser also has to feature a tensioning point, similar to floating drilling risers, to assist in resisting environmental
conditions. Therefore, careful weighing of drift diameter, NACE or non-NACE service, connector size and strength
and material availability shall be examined versus the well’s requirements and environment to determine suitability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bodies of mudline conversion tubing-head assemblies shall be treated as pressure-containing parts as defined in
ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6.3 Rated working pressure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RWP for the tubing-head assembly pressure boundary shall be based on the RWP of the casing riser used to
complete the well and install tubing strings. Selection of the rated working pressure should consider the maximum
expected SCSSV operating pressure; see 5.1.2.1.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6.4 Factory acceptance testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All tubing-head assemblies shall be hydrostatically tested prior to shipment from the manufacturer’s facility. They
shall be tested to the requirements of this part of ISO 13628 with the addition that the tests (including PSL 2) shall
have a secondary holding period of not less than 15 min. The hydrostatic test is performed to verify the pressure
integrity of the housing pressure boundary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The overall hydrostatic body test pressure shall be determined by the lesser of either the rated working pressure
of the tubing head’s body or the high-pressure casing-string riser’s pressure rating; as defined in Annex E. Typical
pressure ratings for the tubing head assembly are listed in Table 35.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.7 Tubing hanger system — Mudline conversion equipment for subsea completions<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11 Specific requirements — Drill-through mudline suspension equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Clause 11 describes drill-through mudline suspension equipment that is normally run from a bottom-supported
drilling rig. Drill-through mudline suspension equipment is used when it is anticipated that the well will be drilled
and completed without suspending the well and nippling down the surface BOP, and culminating in a subsea
completion interface for installing a subsea tree. Drill-through equipment is a hybrid between mudline wellhead
and subsea wellhead technology. The equipment is configured in such a way, starting with individual mudline
casing hangers and risers and then switching over to a special casing hanger that has a housing that can
accommodate the casing hanger(s), annulus seal assembly(s) and tubing hanger when installed, such that no
conversion equipment is required for subsea completion. The casing-hanger housing is typically a 346 mm (13 5/8
in) size. The riser back to the surface typically has a pressure rating that meets or exceeds the pressure rating for
all of the casing hangers, seal assemblies and tubing hanger installed afterwards into the hybrid casing hanger
housing. Figure F.1 illustrates a typical drill-through mudline suspension arrangement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All pressure-containing and pressure-controlling parts included as part of the drill-through mudline suspension
equipment shall be designed to meet all of the requirements of the specified material class and ISO 15156 (all
parts) for the casing-hanger housing, and all of the components installed inside it. Mudline suspension hardware
external to the hybrid housing may be non-NACE depending on the surface-casing design. The innermost casing
riser string that attaches to the hybrid casing-hanger housing is often the defining requirement for pressure rating
and equipment size for a drill-through system. Usually, this riser string has a thicker wall and/or is made from the
higher-strength materials required to achieve a higher-than-average pressure rating. Therefore, careful
consideration of drift diameter, NACE or non-NACE service, connector size and strength and material availability
shall be done versus the well’s requirements to determine the suitability of such a system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For the purposes of this provision, NACE MR0175 is equivalent to ISO 15156 (all parts).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.3 Hybrid casing hanger housing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hybrid casing-hanger housing lands inside the last mudline suspension casing-hanger landing ring. It
provides pressure integrity for the well, suspends the intermediate and subsequent casing strings, the tubing
hanger when installed and transfers external loads back into the surface casing hanger. Internally, it has a landing
shoulder for the subsequent hangers and an internal profile for a running/tie-back tool. The subsea tree attaches
and seals to the upper connection after the drilling phase is complete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.4 Internal drill-through mudline casing hangers<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal drill-through mudline casing hangers are installed on top of each casing string and support the string
when landed in the hybrid casing hanger housing. They are configured to run through the surface BOP stack and
high-pressure drilling riser, land inside the hybrid casing hanger housing and support the required casing load.
They shall have provisions for an annulus seal assembly and support loads generated by BOP test pressures
above the hanger and loads due to subsequent casing strings. Means shall be provided to transfer casing load
and test-pressure load to the hybrid casing-hanger housing or to the previous casing hanger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An external flowby area allows for returns to flow past the hanger during cementing operations and is designed to
minimize pressure drop, while passing as large a particle size as possible. A pup joint of casing should be
installed on the hanger in the shop. This reduces the risk of damage during handling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bodies of internal drill-through mudline casing hangers shall be treated as pressure-controlling parts as defined in
ISO 10423.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Vertical subsea trees<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vertical subsea trees are installed either on the wellhead or on a tubing head, after the subsea tubing-hanger has
been installed through the drilling BOP stack and landed and locked into the wellhead or tubing head. The
production flow path is through the valves mounted in the vertical bore(s) and either out of the top of the tree
during workover and testing [in special applications production (injection) may be via the top of the tree] and
during production (injection) via the production outlet that branches off the vertical bore.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The subsea tree may have a concentric bore or may have multiple bores. Annulus access may be through one of
the tree bores or it may be through a side outlet in the tubing head, below the tubing hanger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The production outlet may be at 90° to the production bore or may be angled to best suit flow requirements. In
TFL trees, the outlets are swept in at 15° maximum to the production bore to facilitate the passage of pump down

Horizontal subsea trees<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Several options are available for horizontal tree arrangements. These offer different benefits for installation,
retrieval and maintenance. These are addressed for information only. No attempt is made within this part of
ISO 13628 to evaluate or recommend an option.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Horizontal subsea trees may be installed after drilling and installation of the complete wellhead system and prior
to installation of the tubing completion and tubing hanger. For this mode of operation, the BOP is installed on top
of the horizontal subsea tree and the tubing hanger and tubing completion is run through the BOP and landed off
on a landing shoulder in the bore of the horizontal subsea tree. The production flow path exits horizontally through
a branch bore in the tubing hanger between seals and connects to the aligned production outlet. A typical tree of
this type is illustrated in Figure B.1. The arrangement shown in Figure B.1 requires that the tubing completion be
retrieved prior to retrieving the tree. The arrangement also includes a pressure-containing internal tree cap above
the tubing hanger to provide a second barrier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In an alternative arrangement, the tubing hanger and internal tree cap are combined into a single extended tubing
hanger system suspended in the horizontal tree. It doubles up on the number of isolation plugs and annular seals
for barrier protection and features a debris cap that can also serve as a back-up locking mechanism for the tubing
hanger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A guidelineless version of the horizontal tree, which is typically a funnel down arrangement, is shown in Figure B.2.
The extended neck on top of the tree is required for clearance for the BOP’s re-entry funnel and “swallow” of its
connector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A third configuration, generally referred to as the “drill-through” horizontal tree, allows the installation of the
horizontal tree immediately after the wellhead housing is landed. This system allows carryout out the drilling and
installation of casing strings through the horizontal tree, minimizing the number of times it is necessary to run and
retrieve the BOP stack. In this configuration, the diameter of the tree-bore protector and tubing-hanger orientation
system should drift the casing hanger and seal assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Horizontal trees may also be used with mudline suspension equipment and drill-through mudline suspension
equipment and may, additionally, be configured for artificial lift completions, such as electric submersible pumps
or hydraulic submersible pumps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Horizontal subsea trees use many of the same items of equipment as vertical trees. However, equipment that

Subsea wellhead<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The subsea wellhead is normally run from a floating drilling rig and is located at the mudline. It supports the
casing strings and seals off the annuli between them. It is used in conjunction with a subsea BOP stack that locks
and seals to the high-pressure wellhead housing. The subsea tree locks and seals to the high-pressure housing
after drilling is complete. Figure C.1 illustrates the items of equipment used in a subsea wellhead.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Subsea wellhead systems can be run with a TGB/PGB (guideline) TGB/GRA (guidelineless) or without
(guidelineless), and can incorporate alternative means of orientation, if required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Subsea tubing hanger<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Subsea tubing hangers are located in the wellhead, tubing head (wellhead conversion assembly) or horizontal
tree.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>They suspend the tubing, seal off the production and provide sealing pockets for the production and control stabs
as a minimum. Horizontal trees also have annular seals for the horizontal side outlets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubing hangers having multiple bores require orientating relative to the PGB to ensure that the tree engages with
the tubing hanger when installed. It is normal to orientate tubing hangers with horizontal production outlets to give
a smooth flow passage between the tubing hanger and horizontal tree. Concentric tubing hangers do not
necessarily require orientation, unless required as a consequence of providing downhole instrumentation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After installation, the tubing hanger is locked into the mating wellhead, tubing head, etc., to resist the force due to
pressure in the production casing and to resist thermal expansion. Lock mechanisms may be mechanically or
hydraulically actuated depending on water depth and specific project requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Mudline suspension and conversion systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mudline suspension equipment is used to suspend casing weight at or near to the mudline, to provide pressure
control and to provide annulus access to the surface wellhead. Mudline equipment is used when drilling with a
bottom-supported rig or platform and provides for drilling, abandonment, platform tieback completion and subsea
completion. During drilling/workover operations, the BOP is located at the surface. The casing annuli are not
sealed at the mudline suspension; therefore, it is necessary to install mudline conversion equipment prior to
installing a tubing completion and subsea tree.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tieback adapters, mudline conversion equipment and tubing heads are used to provide a preparation to accept
the tubing hanger and a profile to which a subsea tree can be locked and sealed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Major items of equipment used with mudline equipment are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  landing and elevation ring;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  casing hangers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  casing hanger running tools and tieback adapters;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>E.2 Calculation of pressure ratings for mudline suspension equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of this annex is to define methods for calculating rated working pressure and test pressure for
mudline equipment that are consistent with accepted engineering practice. Mudline equipment design is a unique
combination of tubular goods and hanger equipment and, therefore, it is not intended that these methods and
allowable stresses be applied to any other type of equipment. Fatigue analysis, thermal expansion considerations
and allowable values for localized bearing stress are beyond the scope of these rated working pressure
calculations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As an alternative to the method presented in this annex, the designer may use the rules in ASME  BPVC ,
Section IX, [13] , Annex 4, modified in accordance with ISO 10423. In this case, bending stresses in wall-section
discontinuities can be treated as secondary stresses. However, when using this alternative method, the
calculation for the rated working pressure shall be made in combination with loads applied by the rated running
capacity (if applicable) and the rated hanging capacity as well as thermal loads. The designer shall ensure that
strains resulting from these higher allowable stresses do not impair the function of the component, particularly in
seal areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>E.2.2 Determination of applied loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For each component that is considered in the rating, the most highly stressed region in the component when
subjected to the worst case combination of internal pressure and pressure end load shall be established. In
performing this assessment, bending and axial loads other than those induced by the pressure end caps and
threaded end connections required for imposition of pressure end load may be ignored. Specifically, it is not
necessary to consider axial or bending loads caused by the connection of the component to other pieces of
equipment in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In establishing the most highly stressed region of the component, considerable care shall be used to ensure that
loads applied through any casing threads which are machined into the component are included. The presence of
threads cut into the wall of a component and the pressure end loads imparted to the main body of the component
through these threads results in local bending stress which shall be considered. The general shape of the main<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_193>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API   S PECIFICATION  17D,   ISO   13628-4
183<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>body of the component may also result in section bending stress, especially when pressure end load is added.
These shape effects shall also be considered when determining the loads on the component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2.3 Determination of stresses<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the location of the highest stress for any given component and loading condition have been determined, the
stress distribution across the critical section shall be linearized to establish the membrane stress,  S m , the local
bending stress,  S b , and peak stress,  F , in the section; see Figure E.3 (see ISO 13625). The linearization operation
shall be performed on each component of stress. The individual linearized components shall then be used to
calculate a von Mises equivalent stress through the cross-section. The von Mises equivalent stress or distortion
energy stress,  S e , shall be calculated as given in Equation (E.1):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

are the component shear stresses at a point;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>subscripts  x, y   and  z  refer to the global coordinate system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The linearization operation can be done by hand calculation but it is more often done using a computer program.
If a computer program or FEA post-processing program is used, caution shall be used to verify that the program is
calculating the linearization stresses correctly. A check on computer output is highly recommended. One such
simple check for FEA post-processing programs is to construct an FEA model of a simple beam in four-point
bending. This model should be analysed for plane strain conditions and should have a beam depth made up of at
least five elements. The linearized von Mises stress through the centre section of such a beam should produce no
von Mises membrane stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The von Mises stress values of interest in the cross section of the component being studied are the linearized
membrane (net section) stress, and the linearized local bending stress as shown in Figure E.3. These values
consider the multiaxial stress condition at a point since they are von Mises equivalent stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2.4 Allowable stress levels for working and test conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The allowable stress levels for test and working conditions are based on percentages of membrane-plus-bending
and membrane-only stress required to yield the material. For the case of the stresses used in this, the local
membrane and bending stress calculated in E.2.3 shall be considered primary stresses since they are the
s tresses required to provide static equilibrium of the section with the applied pressure and end loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to understand what allowable levels should be used for this case, the limiting situation of full section
yielding shall be defined. Assuming the simple case of a rectangular beam and an elastic/perfectly plastic material,
a plot of limiting membrane-plus-bending versus membrane-only stress can be made (see ASME  BPVC ,
Section III [9]  and ASME  BPVC , Section VIII [12] . Figure E.4 shows the limiting values of various combinations of
membrane-plus-bending and membrane-only stresses normalized using the minimum specified material yield
strength,  S Y . The limit stress ratio for membrane only is 1,0 and for bending only the limit is 1,5. If a membrane
stress less than 2/3  S Y  is added to a large bending stress, the membrane-plus-bending stress ratio may exceed
1,5. This is due to the stiffening effect of the membrane stress and shifting of the beam’s neutral axis. This
increase in bending capacity when axial load is applied is generally ignored.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

normal design stress limit given in Reference [12]. It should be mentioned that the membrane stress limit for the
conversion-equipment operating condition is more conservative than that for suspension equipment. This is to
account for the fact that the suspension equipment is used in service as a part of the casing string. Casing string
components typically have higher allowable stress limits than completion or production equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Drill-through mudline suspension systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Drill-through mudline suspension equipment is used to suspend casing weight at or near to the mudline and to
provide pressure control. Drill-through mudline suspension equipment is used when drilling with a bottom-
supported rig when it is anticipated that the well can be completed subsea. During drilling, workover and
completion operations, the BOP is located at the surface. The system differs from mudline suspension in that the
surface casing is suspended from a wellhead housing and subsequent casing strings use wellhead-like hangers
and annulus seal assemblies. The hangers have positive landing shoulders; therefore their OD is normally too
large to allow running them through casing tiebacks. It is usual to use risers having a pressure rating and bore
equivalent to the surface BOP for the installation of casing hangers, seal assemblies, internal abandonment caps
and tubing hangers. The wellhead housing contains the necessary profile for locking down the tubing hanger and
has an external profile to which the subsea tree can be locked; therefore drill-through mudline requires no
conversion equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Successful use of ISO (API) bolted flanged connections require knowledge of their capabilities and careful
assembly. This annex provides the provisions for assembly and bolt make-up for type 6BX integral, welding neck
and blind flanges as defined in ISO 10423 and type 17SS integral, welding neck and blind flanges as defined in
this part of ISO 13628.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.1.2 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An assembly procedure and recommended make-up tension of bolting for bolted flanged connections is defined.
Its purpose is to ensure structural integrity and control of leak-tightness for the ISO (API) bolted flanged
connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.1.3 Recommended bolting make-up tension/torque<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Standard closure bolting shall be made up to a minimum between 67 % to 73 % of the minimum material yield
strength to ensure gasket seating during make-up and increase face-to-face contact preload in excessive of
separation forces at rated working pressure. Standard bolting materials, such as ASTM A193/A193M grades B7
and B16, and ASTM A320/320M grades L7 and L43, are defined as having a material yield strength of 725 MPa
(105 000 psi) for diameters up to and including 63,5 mm (2,5 in). Larger-diameter bolts up to 177,8 mm (7 in)
have a material yield strength of 655 MPa (95 000 psi). CRA bolting, such as ASTM A453/A453M class D (grade
660), has a material yield strength of 725 MPa (105 000 psi) for all sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Low-strength closure bolting, such as ASTM A193/A193M grade B7M and ASTM A320/320M grade L7M, shall be
made up to a minimum between 67 % to 73 % of the minimum specified yield strength to ensure gasket seating
during make-up and to increase face-to-face contact preload in excessive of separation forces at rated working
pressure. Low-strength bolting is defined as having a material yield strength of 550 MPa (80 000 psi).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tables G.1 and G.3 provide torque values for ASTM A193/A193M grades B7 and B16, and ASTM A320/320M
grades L7 and L43. Tables G.2 and G.4 provide torque values for ASTM A193/A193M grade B7M, and
ASTM A320/320M grade 7M bolting material, These tables provide calculated torque values based on the
material yield strengths listed in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subclause and PTFE-coated bolts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some factors that affect the relationship between nut torque and bolt tension stress are the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  thread pitch, pitch diameter and thread form;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  surface finish of thread faces and nut bearing surface area;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  degree of parallelism of nut-bearing area with flange face;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  type of lubrication or coating of the threads (the friction factor associated with lubricants or coatings can vary
up to 20 %), and nut-bearing surface area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be recognized that torque applied to a nut is only one of several ways to approximate tension and stress
in a fastener. The main requirement is to reach the applied tension stress range listed in this subclause and to
achieve gasket seating and hub face-to-face make-up. Lubricants, surface finishes, gasket hardness, etc., may
greatly influence the accuracy of actual bolt tension by applying torque. Therefore, the torque values listed in
Tables G.1 to G.4 are provided only as an informative guide, and should be verified by the manufacturer using
qualified bolting procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.2 Guidelines for assembly<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.2.1  In troduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leak-free bolted flanged connections are the result of many selections/activities having been made/performed
within a relatively narrow band of acceptable limits. One of these activities essential to leak-free performance is
the connection assembly process. The provisions outlined in Annex G cover the assembly elements essential for
consistent leak-tight performance of ISO (API) flanged connections. Written procedures, incorporating the
features of these provisions shall be developed for use by the qualified connection assemblers. The applied
torque/tension in the written procedures shall be qualified for some relevant bolt sizes with actual material, coating
and lubrication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
There are many ways to assemble an ISO (API) bolted flanged connection and Annex G is intended to provide
provisions to those responsible for preparing bolted flanged connection assembly (make-up) procedures or for qualifying
bolted flange connection assembler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
The types of bolt-up tools and load control techniques covered by Annex G are not intended to exclude or limit
other tools and techniques that are certified to produce an equivalent or better bolt preload scatter value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3
The use of qualified assembly procedures and qualified assemblers is analogous to the general requirements for
welds, where use of qualified welding procedures and qualification of welders is present industry practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.2.2 Examination of “working” surfaces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All flange “working” surfaces should be cleaned and examined before assembly. A non-abrasive cloth may be
used to clean all working surfaces to remove grease, preservation coatings and dirt. “Working” surfaces are
intended to have metal-to-metal contact during make-up, hence any painting on a flange’s working surfaces
should be removed. Adherent coatings, such a PTFE or plating, are acceptable on the flange working surfaces.
Greases shall not be applied on gaskets or grooves during make-up. Light oils may be used if galling or fretting is
a concern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examine the ring groove surfaces of both connection flanges for appropriate surface finish and for damage to
surface finish, such as scratches, nicks, gouges and burrs. Indications running radially in the outer ring groove
(leak path) are of particular concern. Unacceptable scratches and dents in the groove and flange face require re-
machining. Correct any radial defect in the groove that exceeds the depth of serrations. The defects may be
removed by lightly polishing with a fine abrasive “wet or dry” paper around the gasket seat circumference. Ensure
that the rework area blends in uniformly and avoid local polishing of the defect. Report any questionable
imperfections for appropriate disposition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A new gasket shall be used whenever a flange is opened and re-made. Check the gasket contact surfaces of both
surfaces for any mechanical damage and for surface roughness. Reject damaged or questionable gaskets.
Gaskets may be reused for testing purpose. A new gasket shall always be used for final assembly. If required,
light oil can be used to lubricate the gasket during seating. Take care that no solid particles are present in the
lubricant. Report any questionable results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examine stud and nut threads for deformation and damage, such as rust, corrosion, cracks and burrs. Previously
used bolts should be thoroughly cleaned (such as wire brushing) before being reused. Inspect studs that have
been subjected to high-cycle external loading with an appropriate NDE technique. Replace questionable parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examine nut-bearing surfaces of flanges for scores, burrs, galling marks etc.; remove protrusions, spot face if
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.2.3 Alignment of mating surfaces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ensure that flanges are aligned both axially and rotationally to the design plane within specified tolerances. Be
sure that any pipe or other connection that affects the alignment is properly supported. The use of bolt load to
achieve flange alignment is not permitted. There should be just sufficient gap to insert the gasket in case of
horizontal assembly. The flange faces should be aligned within 0,5 mm per each 200 mm (0,02 in per each
7,875 in) measured across any diameter (0,15°), and flange bolt holes should be aligned within 3 mm (0,12 in)
offset; see Figure G.1. Report any questionable misalignment or use of excessive loads to align the flanges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.2.4 Installation of BX gaskets<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Check that the BX/SBX gasket complies with specified ring number and material specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Position the gasket such that it is concentric with the groove, taking suitable measures to ensure that it is
adequately supported during the positioning process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ensure that the gasket remains in place during the assembly process. Do not use grease to keep the gasket in
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.2.5 Installation of bolts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Verify compliance with bolt and nut specifications for the following: material grades, coating, diameter, length of
bolts and nut thickness equal to the bolt diameter (heavy hex series nut).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nut thread and nut-bearing surface should be lubricated in accordance to the qualified procedure when torque
tools are used. Ensure that the lubricant is chemically compatible with the bolt/nut materials and the exposed
environment. Particular care should be taken to avoid lubricant chemistry that can result in stress corrosion
cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Install bolts and nuts hand-tight, then manual torque to 100 N·m (75 ft-lbs) but not exceeding 15 % of target
torque. If nuts do not hand-tighten, check for cause and make necessary corrections. If not, final target torque is
applied immediately. It is recommended to take measures to temporarily seal off the flange faces to avoid foreign
particle ingress into the gap between the flange-raised faces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nuts shall engage the threads for the full depth of the nut. Corrosion of excess thread can hinder joint
disassembly. A practice that facilities connection disassembly is to fully engage the nut on one end (with no part
of the bolt projecting beyond the nut) so that all excess length is located on the opposite end. The excess threads
should not project more than 13 mm (0,5 in) beyond the nut, unless required for use of hydraulic tensioners.
Hydraulic bolt tensioners require excess thread length of about one bolt diameter for engagement of a pull
adapter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.2.6 Tightening of the bolts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Calibrated tools shall be used. Use the selected tightening method, tighten the connection using load-increment
rounds of 30 %, 60 %, then 100 % of the specified make-up torque value, in addition to using the crisscross
tightening-sequence pattern as shown in Figure G.2. Do not tighten the connection while it is subject to pressure
or mechanical loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Check that the flange-face gap at the raised face is closed all around the circumference of the connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bolt tension (or torque) should be rechecked after a flange (or bolted clamp) has been subjected to the initial
hydrostatic pressure tests (body test or rated working pressure test). In some instances, the bolting can undergo
some minor yielding during the test. Retighten the bolts, as necessary, to 100 % of the make-up tension (torque)
in a crisscross pattern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.2.7 Connection disassembly<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a significant number of bolts is loosened in rotational order, the elastic recovery of the clamped parts can
result in excessive loads on the relatively few remaining bolts, making further disassembly difficult and sometimes
causing galling between the nut and bolt, which can seriously affect safe disassembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Always check, never take for granted, that the connection has been de-pressurized. Ensure that there are no
built-in loads in the connection due to restraints. Loosen bolts in the order of a crisscross pattern (see Figure G.2)
as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Start with loosening the nuts to 60 % of the target torque in a cross pattern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Check the gap around the circumference and loosen nuts in the order required to accomplish a reasonably
uniform gap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Loosen the nuts to 30 % of the target torque.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
If the gap around the circumference is reasonably uniform, proceed with nut removal on a rotational basis. If
the gap around the circumference is not reasonably uniform, make the appropriate adjustments by selective
loosening before proceeding with nut removal on a rotational basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Remove bolts and nuts. Before bolts can be reused, they shall be cleaned and NDE examined. If gaskets are
reused for testing purpose, marks should be placed on the gaskets to ensure that new gaskets are used for
the final assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.2.8 Records<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Manufacturers shall document recommended make-up tension (or torque) as a part of the end connection
assembly record for each assembled connection. A typical record is provided in Table G.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Screening tests for material compatibility<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>J.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As reservoirs and environment become more complex and subject to acute temperature changes, injection of
chemical additives into remote subsea completions is done to refine the fluid-flow properties of wellbore fluids and
inhibit the formation of precipitates and crystalline structures that can block fluid flow. These additives are often
proprietary mixtures formulated specifically to deal with specific wellbore fluid properties. This annex is presented
as a means to provide a standardized set of procedures to verify the additive’s compatibility with materials
associated with the subsea completion hardware to screen for adverse results that can<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
degrade or erode the metallic and non-metallic materials used for pressure containment and sealing
mechanisms;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
degrade the overall design life of the subsea hardware.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Listed in this annex are three levels of screening. Level 1 identifies possible chemical and or physical changes in
selected materials. Level 1 is intended to provide general information that can be published by either chemical
suppliers and/or manufacturers. Level 2 looks for chemical and/or physical changes in non-metallic materials,
such as swelling, when the material resides in a confined space. Level 2 testing also uses more specific
concentrations and operating conditions defined by the end user for a particular application. Level 2 results are
likely to be proprietary and project-specific and might not necessarily be directly comparable to other published
level 2 data. Level 3 is an in-depth test to determine the useful operating life of non-metallic materials in the
presence of the additive using accelerated-life-estimation testing procedures based on the Arrhenius principle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>J.4.1 Life estimation and ageing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To approximate the life of a non-metallic material for use in a severe service environment, tests should be
conducted in the specific environment under accelerated temperature and/or pressure conditions. Without some
type of accelerated testing, it can be difficult to quantify the service life of an elastomeric component. Elevated
temperature and/or pressure testing can provide a useful method for estimating non-metallic material capabilities
under realistic conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Life estimation testing may be considered as the best estimate of long-term service life to evaluate the long-term
performance of a non-metallic material in a severe service environment. The basic technique involves collecting
time-to-failure data at elevated temperatures (higher than the maximum anticipated service temperature) and
plotting the results on semi-log graph paper. The vertical scale is the log of the time to failure and the horizontal
scale is the reciprocal of the absolute temperature (see API TR 6J1, Figure 1, for a typical life estimation plot).
Alternately, the time to failure at the service temperature also can be calculated from the appropriate
mathematical equations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain precautions should be exercised when performing accelerated temperature and/or pressure tests. It
should be verified experimentally that the failure mechanism (and activation energy) does not change with
elevated temperatures or pressures. In addition, it shall be recognized that gas diffusion can occur through an
elastomer seal at an accelerated rate and this shall be properly accounted for if this is used as failure criteria. It
also may be helpful to test a non-metallic material with known field performance as a reference for comparison;
see level 2 tests. Stagnant fluids and gases can give better or worse life estimation than if the fluids are
periodically refreshed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Pad eye bolt hole,   D H<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The clearance between the shackle bolt and the pad eye hole,  D H , should not exceed 6 % of the shackle bolt
diameter,  B , as given in Equation (K.1). The tightness of this clearance ensures that contact stress between the
pin and the hole is not excessive. Ensure that the 6 % clearance is after taking into account the tolerances on the
shackle hole, bolt and the coating thickness on the shackle bolt and the hole in the pad eye.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(K.1)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reducing the difference below 6 % reduces the diametrical clearance, making it more difficult to line up the
shackle and the pad eye hole to insert the bolt. Tighter manufacturing clearances are then required to ensure
adequate clearance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pad eye bolt holes should be drilled or machined. Flame-cut holes are not acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>K.2.3.3
Pad eye thickness,  t<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pad eye thickness,  t , should not be less than 75 % of the shackle jaw width,  A , as given by Equation (K.2);

between the pad eye and the shackle jaw, adding cheek plates or increasing the pad eye thickness minimizes the clearance. It
is acceptable to increase the thickness to a “standard” plate thickness of 50,80 mm (2,0 in ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pad eye thickness should not exceed 90 % of the shackle jaw width,  A , to provide adequate clearance for
fitting the shackle over the pad eye, as given in Equation (K.3):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Pad eye maximum radius,  R<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pad eye design should allow free movement of the shackle and sling termination without fouling the pad eye.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, the radius,  R , of the pad eye is taken as 1,75 to 2 times the pad eye bolt hole diameter,  D H . See K.3.3
for stress calculations with respect to  R . A value of  R  greater than 2,0 may be used in case the calculated value of
the tear-out stress exceeds the material yield strength, provided this does not cause a clearance issue for the wire
rope with the thimble inside the shackle eye. (See K.3.3.3.2 for tear-out stress calculation.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>K.2.4 Other design considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other design requirements are as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Pad eyes should not protrude outside the boundaries of the host structure and should, as far as possible, be
designed to avoid damage from other equipment; see DNV 2.7-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Lifting points should be positioned to preclude, as far as possible, the risk of slings fouling against the host
structure or its cargo during normal use; see DNV 2.7-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  To prevent lateral bending moments, the pad eyes should be aligned with the sling to the centre of lift. In
other words, the sling load should be in the plane of the pad eye’s plate; see DNV 2.7-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  In some instances, the sling arrangement and its resultant positioning of the pad eye can locate the pad eye
along a “weaker” moment-of-inertia plane of the structural member to which the pad eye is affixed. (Structural
I-beams and H-beams are especially susceptible.) It is necessary to pay special attention to locate these<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_225>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API   S PECIFICATION  17D,   ISO   13628-4
215<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>weaker orientations and reinforce the structural beam with stiffener webs, plates, doubler saddles, etc., as
appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  In some instances, fillet-welded cheek plates are used to fill up the space between the pad eye and the
shackle-jaw width. The thickness associated with these cheek plates should not be taken into account when
calculating the pad eye tear-out stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  To avoid deformation during welding of the structural member to which the pad eye is being affixed (in cases
where the pad eye thickness is more than 6,35 mm (0,25 in) greater than the structural member cross-
sectional thickness), reinforcement such as stiffeners, plates, doubler saddles, etc. may be utilized, as
appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  Pad eyes should be located such that sufficient access is maintained for NDE of the pad eye welds and load
proof testing; see 5.3.2 and 5.4.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

DNV Marine Operations (VMO), Part 2, Chapter 5), or industry-recognized standards specified by the end user, provided that all
important loads, like special loads (for example, tugger line loads, wind loads, etc.), dynamic loads (for example, type of vessel, rigging
arrangement, etc.), skew loads (for example, fabrication tolerances of lift points, multi-hook lifting, etc.) are properly calculated and
documented and the environmental conditions clearly stated. For this part of ISO 13628, the minimum safety factor (S.F.) for shackles
and wire rope shall be 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For immersion (subsea) lifts, pad eyes and other lifting gear/equipment should be designed for a minimum load amplification factor
of 2,0 (see API RP 2A-WSD, section 2.4.2.C). Extreme hydrodynamic forces/conditions or size and type of vessel utilized may dictate
that higher LAFs, i.e. greater than 2,0, are required. See DNV Marine Operations (VMO), Part 2, Chapter 6, “Subsea operations” for

(informative)
Hyperbaric testing guidelines<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table L.1 lists subsea equipment that should be subjected to hyperbaric (external) pressure testing to validate
performance under installed (water-depth) conditions. The hyperbaric test pressure should be based on the
maximum rated water depth specified by the manufacturer for the equipment. If agreed between the purchaser
and manufacturer, the hyperbaric test medium should be maintained at 4 °C ± 5 °C (40 °F ± 10 °F) throughout the
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For static components the functional cycles specified in Table L.1 should be internal pressure cycles from rated
working pressure to fully depressurized (atmospheric pressure), while continuously subjected to external
hyperbaric pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For equipment with moving parts, the functional cycles specified in Table L.1 should be dynamic operation cycles
(see 5.1.7.7), such that full operating motion of the equipment is achieved.  E.g., for valves and chokes, a cycle
should consist of starting from the fully closed position, applying a differential bore pressure of RWP, then
actuating open under differential pressure and stroking to the full open position with bore pressure vented to
atmospheric.  The specified number of cycles should be completed with the equipment continuously subjected to
external hyperbaric pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the hyperbaric functional cycles, leakage should not exceed that specified in ISO 10423, Annex F, for PR2.
A single internal hydrostatic test (see 5.4) should be performed for acceptance after all hyperbaric functional
cycles have been completed and hyperbaric conditions depressurized to atmospheric pressure.  Hold time should
be 15 minutes minimum.  Leakage should not exceed the acceptance criteria for hold periods specified in
ISO 10423, Annex F, for PR2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If agreed between the manufacturer and purchaser, the hyperbaric functional test cycles may be in addition to life-
cycle endurance testing and temperature cycling, such as that specified in ISO 10423, Annex F, for PR2. For
example, a valve and actuator assembly may be subjected to a total of 400 functional cycles, of which 200 are
hyperbaric as  described  in this annex, and 200 are as described in ISO 10423, Annex F,  PR2, including 20
cycles at maximum rated temperature and at minimum rated temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SAFETY PRECAUTIONS — It is imperative that a means of monitoring and relieving pressure within the
hyperbaric test chamber be utilized, such that the rated working pressure of the chamber cannot be
exceeded. If pressure applied to equipment internally (bore pressure) or to actuation mechanisms could
exceed the rated working pressure of the test chamber, a safety system must be in place and be capable
of immediately venting that applied pressure and the chamber pressure in the event that a leak occurs
from the equipment being tested.  The number of pressure connections inside the chamber should be
minimized and all connections must be verified prior to installation in the chamber.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Annex M
(informative)
Purchasing guidelines<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex M provides recommended guidelines for inquiry and purchase of equipment covered by this part of
ISO 13628. Annex M is informative; however users may, by agreement between the interested parties, consider
the provisions to be either requirements or guidelines. This is especially the case when determining PSL.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.2 Typical wellhead and tree configurations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of typical wellhead and tree configurations are shown in Annexes A through F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.3 Product specification levels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>PSLs are defined in 5.2 and 5.3, and in ISO 10423. PSLs apply to pressure-containing and pressure-controlling
parts and assembled equipment as defined in this part of ISO 13628. Determination of the PSL is the
responsibility of the purchaser. Selection of PSL can depend on whether equipment is primary or secondary
equipment, as defined in ISO 10423. For this part of ISO 13628 primary equipment shall include, as a minimum,
the tubing head/high-pressure housing, the first two actuated (master and/or wing) valves downstream of the
tubing hanger, the lower tree connector, and any other flowline or isolation valve in direct communication with the
well bore upstream of the second actuated valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following are recommendations for selection, summarized by the decision tree in Figure M.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  PSL 2: recommended for general (non-sour) service at working pressure 34,5 MPa (5 000 psi) and below;
recommended for secondary equipment for working pressure of 69 MPa (10 000 psi) or below;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  PSL 3: recommended for primary equipment in sour service, all working pressures, and general service
above pressures of 34,5 MPa (5 000 psi); recommended for primary and secondary equipment, sour
or general service, for pressures above 69 MPa (10 000 psi) or for maximum temperature ratings
above 121 °C (250 °F).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other considerations that can lead the user to consider PSL 3 over PSL 2 include water depth,
composition of retained or injected fluids, field infrastructure, difficulty of intervention, acceptance of
risk, sensitivity of environment, and useful field life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  PSL 3G:same recommendations as for PSL 3, with additional considerations for wells that are gas producers,
have a high gas/oil ratio or are used for gas injection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>M.4 Material class<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Material-class manufacturing requirements are given in ISO 10423 and in Table 1. Material class shall be
determined by the purchaser with consideration to the various environmental factors and production variables
listed below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) pressure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) temperature;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) composition of produced or injected fluid, particularly H 2 S, CO 2 , and chlorides;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) pH of water phase or brine;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) exposure to salt water during installation or operation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
use of inhibitors for scale, paraffin, corrosion or other reasons;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) possibility of acidizing and concentration of acidizing solutions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) anticipated production rates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

sand production and other potential for erosion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
anticipated service life;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) future operations that can affect pressure, temperature or fluid content;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
risk analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion, stress-corrosion cracking (SCC), erosion-corrosion, and sulfide stress cracking (SSC) are all
influenced by the interaction of the environmental factors and the production variables. Other factors not listed can
also influence fluid corrosivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purchaser shall determine whether materials shall meet ISO 15156 (all parts) for the sour service
environment. ISO 15156 (all parts) addresses metallic material requirements to prevent stress cracking within
ISO 15156-specified environmental conditions, but does not address all aspects of corrosion resistance.
Consideration shall also be given to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, which is related generally to corrosion
in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For the purposes of this provision, NACE MR0175 is equivalent to ISO 15156 (all parts).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.5 Data sheets<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.5.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>M.5 provides suggested data sheets that can be used for enquiry and purchase of subsea wellhead and tree
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Interactive electronic forms of the data sheets can be accessed by clicking where indicated on the line immediately
below the subclause heading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The data sheets are designed to perform three functions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
assist the purchaser in deciding what he wants;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
assist the purchaser in communicating his particular needs and requirements, as well as information on the
well environment, to the manufacturer for his use in designing and producing equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
facilitate the communication regarding purchaser requirements, relative to the supplier’s options and/or
capabilities such that a common understanding is agreed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A copy of the data sheets should be completed as accurately as possible. The typical configurations should be
referred to, as required, to select the required equipment. The decision tree in Figure M.1, together with its
instructions, provides the recommended practice as to which PSL each piece of equipment should be
manufactured. A copy of the data sheet should then be attached to the purchase order or request for proposal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Data sheets from ISO 10423, Annex A, may also be useful in selecting specific wellhead equipment components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(informative)
Use of the API Monogram by Licensees<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The API Monogram Program allows an API Licensee to apply the API Monogram to products. The API Monogram
Program delivers significant value to the international oil and gas industry by linking the verification of an
organization's quality management system with the demonstrated ability to meet specific product specification
requirements. The use of the Monogram on products constitutes a representation and warranty by the Licensee to
purchasers of the products that, on the date indicated, the products were produced in accordance with a verified
quality management system and in accordance with an API product specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When used in conjunction with the requirements of the API License Agreement, API Q1, in its entirety, defines the
requirements for those organizations who wish to voluntarily obtain an API license to provide API monogrammed
products in accordance with an API product specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API Monogram Program licenses are issued only after an on-site audit has verified that the Licensee conforms to
the requirements described in API Q1 in total,  and the requirements of an API product specification.
Customers/users are requested to  report to API all problems with API monogrammed products. The effectiveness
of the API Monogram Program can be strengthened by customers/users reporting problems encountered with API
monogrammed products. A nonconformance may be reported using the API Nonconformance Reporting System
available at https://ncr.api.org. API solicits information on new product that is found to be nonconforming with API
specified requirements, as well as field failures (or malfunctions), which are judged to be caused by either
specification deficiencies or nonconformities with API specified requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex sets forth the API Monogram Program requirements necessary for a supplier to consistently produce
products in accordance with API specified requirements. For information on becoming an API Monogram
Licensee, please contact API, Certification Programs, 1220 L Street, N. W., Washington, D.C. 20005 or call 202-
962-4791 or by email at  certification@api.org .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>N.3.2 Monogrammed Product ⎯ Conformance with API Q1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When an API-licensed organization is providing an API monogrammed product, conformance with API specified
requirements, described in API Q1, including Annex A, is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N.3.3 Application of the API Monogram<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each Licensee shall control the application of the API Monogram in accordance with the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Each Licensee shall develop and maintain an API Monogram marking procedure that documents the
marking/monogramming requirements specified by the API product specification to be used for application of the
API Monogram by the Licensee. The marking procedure shall define the location(s) where the Licensee shall
apply the API Monogram and require that the Licensee's license number and date of manufacture be marked on
monogrammed products in conjunction with the API Monogram. At a minimum, the date of manufacture shall be
two digits representing the month and two digits representing the year (e.g. 05-07 for May 2007) unless otherwise
stipulated in the applicable API product specification. Where there are no API product specification marking
requirements, the Licensee shall define the location(s) where this information is applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The API Monogram may be applied at any time appropriate during the production process but shall be removed
in accordance with the Licensee’s API Monogram marking procedure if the product is subsequently found to be
nonconforming with API specified requirements. Products that do not conform to API specified requirements shall
not bear the API Monogram.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Only an API Licensee may apply the API Monogram and its license number to API monogrammable products.
For certain manufacturing processes or types of products, alternative API Monogram marking procedures may be
acceptable.  The current API requirements for Monogram marking are detailed in the API Policy Document,

<<HEADING level=3>>N.3.4 Records<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Records required by API product specifications shall be retained for a minimum of five years or for the period of
time specified within the product specification if greater than five years. Records specified to demonstrate
achievement of the effective operation of the quality system shall be maintained for a minimum of five years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N.3.5 Quality Program Changes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any proposed change to the Licensee’s quality program to a degree requiring changes to the quality manual shall
be submitted to API for acceptance prior to incorporation into the Licensee's quality program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N.3.6   Use of the API Monogram in Advertising<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Licensee shall not use the API Monogram on letterheads or in any advertising (including company-sponsored web
sites) without an express statement of fact describing the scope of Licensee’s authorization (license number).
The Licensee should contact API for guidance on the use of the API Monogram other than on products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
