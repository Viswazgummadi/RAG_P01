<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2 GTAW-P<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When used for root pass welding of single-sided joints, GTAW-P shall be performed with the same make and model
of equipment using the same program settings as those used in the procedure qualifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The need to specify the make and model, program, equipment settings, and pulse waveform is based upon the effects
these variables have on welding arc performance, especially sidewall fusion and out-of-position welding. Studies have shown
considerable variation in arc characteristics when one make or model of welding system is compared to another. This variation can
lead to welding defects, some of which may be very difficult to detect by radiography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3 GMAW-S<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of GMAW-S shall be limited as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The process shall not be used for branch connections, nozzle-to-shell welds, or socket welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) GMAW-S may be used for root pass welding on piping. Root pass welding with GMAW-S for other applications is
permitted, provided the root pass is completely removed from the backside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The fill and cap passes for butt or fillet welds may be welded with this process, provided the thickness of any
member does not exceed  3 / 8  in. (9.5 mm) and vertical welding is performed with uphill progression.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) For vertical welding, the root pass and second pass progression for a material of any thickness may be either
uphill or downhill.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Variations of GMAW-S shall have the same limitations as outlined above. Proposals to use GMAW-S variations
without back purging shall be approved by the owner’s engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4 GMAW-P<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>GMAW-P may be used for any material thickness in any position. Welding shall be performed with the same make
and model of welding equipment and using the same program settings as those used in the procedure qualification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   It is recommended that whenever the welding system is changed or the settings on existing equipment significantly
altered, that the fabricator verify weld properties. The extent of verification or testing should be as agreed between the purchaser
and fabricator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.5 FCAW<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.5.1  Self-shielding FCAW (FCAW-S) may be used only for welding carbon steel structural items. The following
guidelines and restrictions apply:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) electrode types identified by the consumable manufacturer for multi-pass application should be used,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) only electrode classifications which have specified minimum impact test requirements should be used,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) FCAW-S shall not be used with other welding processes without qualifying the specific combination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.5.2  FCAW with external gas shielding (FCAW-G) may be used for either groove or fillet welds for pressure
boundary or structural welding.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5.3  For procedures requiring either impact or hardness testing, it is advisable to review weld metal properties
with the consumable manufacturer to ensure the original qualified properties continue to be met. When rutile type (i.e.
E71T-1 type) consumables are used as-welded or in the postweld heat treated (PWHT’d) condition with impact<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

supporting PQRs with impact test results meeting the minimum design code requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Welding consumables, including those for FCAW, are routinely used in situations not addressed by the testing
requirements in AWS/ASME welding specifications. A periodic review with the manufacturer is good practice to ensure minor
variations that occur over time with FCAW consumable formulations (e.g. raw material and microalloying changes) do not
adversely affect the ability of these products to perform as intended. Small changes in microalloying additions can have significant
effects on properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.5.4  Welding consumables shall be limited to the ASME/AWS classification used in the PQR.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.5.5  For welding pressure-containing equipment wall thickness in excess of  3 / 8  in. (9.5 mm), the diffusible

SFA/A5.26M),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) welding consumables shall be limited to the classification and the manufacturer’s trade name used in the PQR,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) only filler materials having classifications with specified minimum impact test requirements should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.7 SAW<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.7.1  SAW procedures shall be requalified whenever the welding flux is changed from one manufacturer’s trade
name to another. Equivalence under ASME  BPVC  Section II, Part C, or AWS filler metal specifications shall not be
considered adequate for substitution without requalification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   It is recognized that fluxes having the same classification can be very different in their composition. However, nominal
flux composition is not included in AWS or ASME specifications/codes and flux suppliers do not normally provide this information.
Differences among fluxes of the same classification can result in different and unanticipated weld properties when these fluxes are
used interchangeably over the range of variables typically stated in weld procedure specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.7.2  Manually held (semiautomatic) SAW is not permitted for welding pressure-containing parts, unless approved
by the purchaser.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The use of dissimilar metal welds (carbon or low-alloy to austenitic stainless steel) in services corrosive to carbon
and low-alloy steel should be carefully evaluated. Failures have been reported due to hydrogen charging of zones exhibiting
high hardness adjacent to the fusion line. It is unclear whether the charging is due to corrosion of the carbon or low-alloy
steel alone or accelerated due to the presence of a galvanic couple. In addition, carbon or low-alloy to austenitic stainless
steel welds might be susceptible to brittle fracture at service temperatures below –20 °F (–29 °C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For quenched and tempered or normalized and tempered materials, the PWHT holding temperature shall be at least 25 °F (15 °C) below the
original tempering temperature of the base metal, unless the fabricator demonstrates that mechanical properties can be achieved at a higher
PWHT temperature and holding time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) For Type CA6NM material, a double tempering heat treatment is required. Initial heat treatment at 1225  ° F to 1275  ° F, followed by air cooling
to ambient temperature, and second heat treatment at 1100  ° F to 1150  ° F and air cooling to ambient temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) For Type 321 and Type 347 materials, postweld thermal stabilization may be specified at 1600  ° F to 1650  ° F for two to four hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) For 9 % Ni, the entire vessel, assembly, or plate must be at the PWHT holding temperature at the same time. The cooling rate from the
holding temperature shall not be less than 300  ° F (167  ° C) per hour down to a temperature of 600  ° F (315  ° C). A local or partial PWHT
cannot be used since this results in portions of the structure being in the embrittlement range of 600  ° F to 1000  ° F (315  ° C to 540  ° C) for
extended periods of time, thereby impairing material toughness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1.1  Weld overlays shall be deposited with a minimum of two layers. Machine or automated single-layer overlays
are permitted when approved by the purchaser.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1.2  ESW is permitted for weld overlay applications, provided that the following conditions are met.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The procedure qualification demonstrates that metallographic examination of overlay cross sections; as required
for hard-facing overlay per ASME  BPVC  Section IX, QW-453, Note 8; indicates that at least 5 % penetration has
been achieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The welding procedure production tests required by the purchaser include metallographic examination of overlay
cross sections to verify that the overlay penetrated into the base metal with no lack of fusion present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) After welding and PWHT, spot UT is performed. For vessels, perform UT on at least four strips, approximately
3.2 in. (80 mm) wide, along the full length of the shell and one (1) strip approximately 3.2 in. (80 mm) wide across
each head on weld overlay. UT shall meet the requirements of ASTM 578, Level C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1.3  Overlap of adjacent weld beads shall be considered an essential variable and shall be the same in production
as that used to qualify the weld overlay procedure.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1.4  The PQR chemical analysis shall report all elements for which specific values are given for the consumable in
ASME  BPVC  Section II, Part C/AWS filler metal specifications.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1.5  Production weld overlay shall have the chemical composition checked using either:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— a physical sample (e.g. drillings, chips) removed for quantitative analysis; or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— a portable spectrograph or portable X-ray fluorescence machine approved by the purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.6  All elements specified for the production overlay chemical composition shall be analyzed and reported, except
for carbon and nitrogen when using the X-ray fluorescence method. When carbon and nitrogen are specified, a
physical sample is required for quantitative analysis. Alternatively, an optical emission spectrometer may be used to
check all required elements, including carbon and nitrogen. Specified elements/acceptance requirements for
production overlay and back cladding are found for the particular alloy(s) in B.3 through B.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.7  By separate specification, the purchaser shall establish the method of measurement and requirements for the
extent of ferrite and chemical composition checks on production welds. The frequency of sampling for production
overlay shall be specified by the purchaser. If PWHT will be performed, the ferrite measurements shall be taken prior
to PWHT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1.8  For the SAW, alloy additions made from the flux shall require approval by the purchaser.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1.9  All overlays shall be 100% liquid penetrant examined. If the item is PWHT, this examination shall be
performed after PWHT.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1.10  Consumables for commonly used overlay systems are shown in Table B.1. The purchaser shall approve
other systems.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.11  When PWHT of the base metal is required, PWHT does not have to be performed for welding attachments to
the overlay/clad when the actual overlay/clad thickness is  3 / 16  in. (4.8 mm) or greater. When the overlay/clad is less
than  3 / 16  in. (4.8 mm) thick, a specially qualified WPS shall be provided to verify that the attachment weld does not
affect the base material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   This requirement may be waived for P-No. 1 materials when PWHT is a requirement due to material thickness and not
for process reasons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1.12  Electrode nominal diameter and ASME/AWS classification shall be considered essential variables.<<HEADING_END>>
