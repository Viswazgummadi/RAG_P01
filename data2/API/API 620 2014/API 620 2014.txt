<<PARAGRAPH>>The API Downstream Segment has prepared this standard to cover large, field-assembled storage tanks of the type
described in 1.2 that contain petroleum intermediates (gases or vapors) and finished products, as well as other liquid
products commonly handled and stored by the various branches of the industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rules presented in this standard cannot cover all details of design and construction because of the variety of tank
sizes and shapes that may be constructed. Where complete rules for a specific design are not given, the intent is for
the Manufacturer—subject to the approval of the Purchaser’s authorized representative—to provide design and
construction details that are as safe as those which would otherwise be provided by this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Manufacturer of a low-pressure storage tank that will bear the API 620 nameplate shall ensure that the tank is
constructed in accordance with the requirements of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rules presented in this standard are further intended to ensure that the application of the nameplate shall be
subject to the approval of a qualified inspector who has made the checks and inspections that are prescribed for the

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.1
design pressure
The maximum positive gauge pressure permissible at the top of a tank when the tank is in operation. It is the basis for
the pressure setting of the safety-relieving devices on the tank. The design pressure is synonymous with the nominal
pressure rating for the tank as referred to in this standard (see 5.3.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.2
maximum allowable stress value
The maximum unit stress permitted to be used in the design formulas given or provided for in this standard for the

<<HEADING level=3>>SECTION 4—MATERIALS<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1 Material Specifications<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials used in the construction of API 620 tanks shall comply with the specifications in this section (see Annexes
Q, R, and S for specific material requirements). Material produced to specifications other than those listed in this
section may be used if the material is certified to meet all the requirements of a material specification listed in this
section and that its use is approved by the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.2 Materials That Cannot Be Completely Identified<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any plate materials or tubular products on hand that cannot be completely identified with a specification listed in this
standard, by records satisfactory to the inspector, may be used to construct tanks according to the rules of this
standard if the material passes the test prescribed in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.3 Accessory Pressure Parts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All accessory pressure parts, such as pipe fittings, valves, flanges, nozzles, welding necks, welding caps, manhole
frames, and covers, shall be made from materials provided for in this standard or in any accepted ANSI standard that
covers the particular part. These parts shall be marked with the name or trademark of the manufacturer and any other
markings that are required by the applicable standards. Such markings shall be considered the manufacturer’s
guarantee that the product complies with the material specifications and standards indicated and is suitable for
service at the rating indicated. The intent of this paragraph will have been met if, in lieu of the detailed marking on the
part itself, the accessory pressure parts have been marked in any permanent or temporary manner that serves to
identify the part with the manufacturer’s written listing of the particular items and if this listing is available for
examination by the inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.4 Small Parts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cast, forged, or rolled parts of small size (which are ordinarily carried in stock and for which mill test reports or
certificates are not customarily furnished) may be used if, in the opinion of the inspector, they are suitable for the
purpose intended and that, if such parts are to be welded, they are of welding grade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.1  All plates that are subject to pressure-imposed membrane stress or are otherwise important to the structural
integrity of a tank, including bottom plates welded to the cylindrical sidewall of flat-bottom tanks, shall conform to
specifications selected to provide a high order of resistance to brittle fracture at the lowest temperature to which the
metal in the walls of the tank is expected to fall on the coldest days of record for the locality where the tank is to be
installed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.2  In all cases, the Purchaser shall specify the design metal temperature, and the plates used for the tank shall
conform to one or more of the specifications listed in Table 4-1 as being acceptable for use at that temperature (refer
to 4.2.5 for impact testing requirements). Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this paragraph and in
4.2.2, the design metal temperature for materials in contact with nonrefrigerated fluids shall be assumed to be 15 °F
above the lowest one-day mean ambient temperature for the locality involved, as determined from Figure 4-1. For
locations not covered by Figure 4-1, authentic meteorological data shall be used. Where no such data are available,
the Purchaser shall estimate the temperature from the most reliable information at hand. Where special means, such
as covering the outside of the tank with insulation or heating the tank contents, are provided to ensure that the
temperature of the tank walls never falls to within 15 °F of the lowest one day mean ambient temperature, the design<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4-2
API S TANDARD  620<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>metal temperature may be set at a higher level that can be justified by computations or by actual temperature data on
comparable existing tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.1.3  Unless exempted per 4.2.2, notch toughness of specially designed plate flanges and cover plates shall be
evaluated using governing thickness in Table 4-1. (See 4.3.6.3 for definition of governing thickness.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2 Low-stress Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following design criteria, relative to the use of Table 4-1, apply when the actual stress under design conditions
does not exceed one-third of the allowable tensile stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Consideration of the design metal temperature is not required in selecting material from Table 4-1 for tank
components that are not in contact with the liquid or vapor being stored and are not designed to contain the
contents of an inner tank (see Q.2.4 and R.2.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The design metal temperature may be increased by 30 °F in selecting material from Table 4-1 for tank
components conforming to any of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i. components exposed to the vapor from the liquid or vapor being stored and are not designed to contain the
contents of the inner tank;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii. components located within, but not welded directly to, a primary liquid container, a secondary liquid container, or
a warm product vapor container (see R.2.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Excluding bottom plates welded to the cylindrical sidewall of flat-bottom tanks, the plates of a non-refrigerated flat-
bottom tank, counterbalanced in accordance with 5.11.2, may be constructed of any material selected from Table
4-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3 Plate Specifications<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4 Plate Manufacture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4.1  All material for plates shall be made using the open-hearth, electric-furnace, or basic-oxygen process.
Universal mill plates shall not be used. All plates for pressure parts, with the exception of those whose thicknesses
are established by the requirements of Table 5-6, shall be ordered on the basis of edge thickness to ensure that the
plates furnished from the mill will not underrun the specified thickness by more than 0.01 inch. This stipulation shall
not be construed to prohibit the use of plates purchased based on weight if it is established by actual measurements
(taken at a multiplicity of points along the edges of the plates) that the minimum thicknesses of the plates do not
underrun the required design thickness by more than 0.01 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.4.2  Subject to the Purchaser’s approval, thermo-mechanical-control-process (TMCP) plates (plates produced
by a mechanical-thermal rolling process designed to enhance notch toughness) may alternatively be used where
heat treated plates are normally required by Table 4-1 (note 1) because of thickness over 1½ inch. In this case, each
TMCP plate-as-rolled shall receive Charpy V-notch impact energy testing in accordance with 4.2.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.5 Impact Test Requirements for Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.5.1  Table 4-1 provides exemption and impact testing requirements of plates for various grades for given
thickness range and design metal temperature. Any material listed in Table 4-1 may be used for any thickness and
temperature provided the material meets impact test requirements as specified in 4.2.5 and Table 4-3 and welding
procedure requirements specified in 6.7. When the plate is not exempted from impact testing per Table 4-1 or 4.2.2,
each plate shall be impact tested; plate refers to the unit plate rolled from a slab or directly from an ingot. The ASTM
A370, Type A, Charpy V-notch test shall be used. The long dimension of the specimen shall be parallel to the
direction of the expected maximum stress. When the coincident stresses are approximately equal, the specimens
shall be taken transverse to the final direction of the plate rolling. The minimum energy absorption values of Table 4-3
shall be satisfied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1 Scope of Rules<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rules presented in this standard are intended to establish approved engineering practices for low-pressure
storage tanks constructed of any shape within the scope of 1.2 and to provide the fundamental rules for design and
testing, which can serve as a sufficient basis for an inspector to judge the safety of any vessel and improve the
application of the API 620 nameplate. Where these rules do not cover all details of design and construction, the
Manufacturer, subject to the approval of the inspector, shall provide details of design and construction that will be as
safe as those provided by this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2 Pressure Chambers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For tanks that consist of two or more independent pressure chambers and have a roof, bottom, or other elements in
common, each pressure part shall be designed for the most severe combination of pressure or vacuum that can be
experienced under the specified operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3 Avoidance of Pockets<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank walls shall be shaped to avoid any pockets on the inside where gases may become trapped when the liquid
level is being raised or on the outside where rainwater may collect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.4 Volume of Vapor Space<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The volume of the vapor space above the high liquid design level upon which the nominal capacity is based shall be
not less than 2 % of the total liquid capacity (see 3.2.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.5 Tests of New Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a tank is of a new design and has (a) an unusual shape or (b) large branches or openings that may make the
stress system around these locations in the tank wall unsymmetrical to a degree that, in the judgment of the designer,
does not permit computation with a satisfactory assurance of safety, the tank shall be subjected to a proof test, and
strain-gauge surveys shall be made as provided in 7.24.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Operating Temperature<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The temperature of the liquids, vapor, or gases stored in, or entering, these tanks shall not exceed 250 °F (see 1.2.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Pressures Used in Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1 Above Maximum Liquid Level<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1.1  Tank components, including those above the maximum liquid level, subjected principally to gas pressure
shall be designed for the following.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A pressure not less than the relief valves’ set pressure. The maximum positive gauge pressure shall be
understood to be the nominal pressure rating for the tank (sometimes called the design pressure) and shall not
exceed 15 lbf/in. 2  gauge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The maximum partial vacuum (also called the design vacuum) when the inflow of air (or another gas or vapor)
through the vacuum relief valves is at the tank design maximum in-breathing flow rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1.2  If the maximum liquid level is below the top of the roof but the tank will be filled to the top of the roof during
the hydrostatic test as provided in 7.18.4, the tank shall be designed for both maximum liquid-level conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1.3  A suitable margin shall be provided between the operating pressure in the gas or vapor space and the relief
valve’s set pressure. This margin allows for pressure increases caused by variations in temperature, atmospheric
pressure, or other factors that affect the pressure in the gas or vapor space.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1.4  The set pressure of the vacuum relief valve shall limit the vacuum pressure accumulation in the tank to the
design vacuum pressure.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2 Below Maximum Liquid Level<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All pressure containing elements of the tank below the maximum liquid level shall be designed for the most severe
combination of gas pressure (or partial vacuum) and static liquid head affecting the element.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.3 Weight for Liquid Storage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The weight for liquid storage shall be assumed to be the weight per ft 3  of the specified liquid contents at 60 °F. When
the minimum weight is less than 48 lb/ft 3 , the provisions of 5.5.7 shall be followed. This minimum weight does not
apply to tanks used for gas storage only, or used for refrigerated liquid storage as discussed in Annexes Q and R.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.1 Individual Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)  dead load ( D L ):  the weight of the tank or tank component, including any insulation, lining, or corrosion allowance

<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
snow ( S   ):  The ground snow load (lb/ft 2 ) shall be determined from ASCE 7 Figure 7-1 or Table 7-1 unless the
ground snow load is specified by the Purchaser. The design uniform roof snow load shall be 0.84 times the ground
snow load. Alternately, the design uniform roof snow load shall be determined from the ground snow load in
accordance with ASCE 7 or a national standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
stored liquid ( P l  ):  gauge pressure (lb/in. 2 ) resulting from the liquid head of the liquid with the density given in
5.3.3. All liquid levels from empty to the maximum liquid level shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

determined from ASCE 7-05, Figure 6-1, multiplied by  ¥I ; or 2) the 3-sec gust design wind speed
determined from ASCE 7-10 for risk category specified by the Purchaser (typically risk category 2
applies—Figure 26.5-1b) multiplied by 0.78; or 3) the 3-sec gust design wind speed specified by the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For tank components exposed to wind up to 80 ft above ground, the design wind pressures normal to
the tank’s outside surface shall be the pressures below, multiplied by  ( V /120) 2 . For tank components
located more than 80 ft above ground, use ASCE 7 to determine wind pressures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.1  The maximum tensile stresses in the outside walls of a tank, as determined for any of the loadings listed in
5.4 or any concurrent combination of such loadings that is expected to be encountered in the specified operation,
shall not exceed the applicable stress values determined in accordance with provisions described in 5.5.3.2 and
5.5.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.2  If both the meridional and latitudinal unit forces,  T 1  and  T 2 , are tensile or if one force is tensile and the other
is zero, the computed tensile stress,  S tc , shall not exceed the applicable value given in Table 5-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.3  If the meridional force,  T 1 , is tensile and the coexistent latitudinal unit force,  T 2 , is compressive or if  T 2  is
tensile and  T 1  is compressive, the computed tensile stress,  s tc , shall not exceed a value of the allowable tensile
stress,  s ta , obtained by multiplying the applicable stress value given in Table 5-1 by the appropriate value of  N
obtained from Figure 5-1 for the value of compressive stress ( s c  =  s cc ) and the co-related ratio of ( t  –  c )/ R  involved.
However, in cases where the unit force acting in compression does not exceed 5 % of the coexistent tensile unit force
acting perpendicular to it, the designer has the option of permitting a tensile stress of the magnitude specified in
5.5.3.2 instead of complying strictly with the provisions of this paragraph, (see F.1 for examples illustrating the
determination of allowable tensile stress values,  s ta , in accordance with this paragraph). In no event shall the value of
s ta  exceed the product of the applicable joint efficiency for tension as given in Table 5-2 and the allowable stress for
simple tension shown in Table 5-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.4 Maximum Compressive Stresses<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.4.1  Except as provided in 5.12.4.3 for the compression-ring region, the maximum compressive stresses in the
outside walls of a tank, as determined for any of the loadings listed in 5.4 or any concurrent combination of loadings
expected to be encountered in the specified operation, shall not exceed the applicable stress values determined in
accordance with the provisions described in 5.5.4.2 through 5.5.4.8. These rules do not purport to apply when the
circumferential stress on a cylindrical wall is compressive (as in a cylinder acted upon by external pressure).
However, values of  S cs  computed as in 5.5.4.2, with   R   equal  R 1  when the compressive unit force is latitudinal or to  R 2
when the compressive unit force is meridional, in some degree form the basis for the rules given in 5.5.4.3, 5.5.4.4,
and 5.5.4.5, which apply to walls of double curvature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

All pertinent modifications and limitations of specifications required by 4.2. through 4.6 shall be complied with.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
Except for those cases where additional factors or limitations are applied as indicated by references to Notes 4, 6, 10, and 12, the
allowable tensile stress values given in this table for materials other than bolting steel are the lesser of (a) 30% of the specified minimum ultimate
tensile strength for the material or (b) 60 % of the specified minimum yield point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3
Except when a joint efficiency factor is already reflected in the specified allowable stress value, as indicated by the references to Note
10, or where the value of  N  determined in accordance with 5.5.3.3. is less than the applicable joint efficiency given in Table 5-2 (and, therefore,
effects a greater reduction in allowable stress than would the pertinent join efficiency factor, if applied), the specified stress values for welds in
tension shall be multiplied by the applicable joint efficiency factor,  E , given in Table 5-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 4
Stress values for structural quality steels include a quality factor of 0.92.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 5
Plates and pipe shall not be used in thickness greater than  3 / 4  in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 6
Stress values are limited to those for steel that has an ultimate tensile strength of only 55,000 lbf/in. 2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Less than or equal to 2 1 / 2  in. thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 8
Less than or equal to 1 1 / 2  in. thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 9
Stress values for fusion-welded pipe include a welded-joint efficiency factor of 0.80 (see 5.23.3). Only straight-seam pipe shall be
used; the use of spiral-seam pipe is prohibited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 10
Stress values for castings include a quality factor of 0.80.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 11
See 5.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 12
Allowable stress based on Section VIII of the  ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code  multiplied by the ratio of the design stress

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1  See 5.26 and 7.15 for examination requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2  Regardless of any values given in this column, the efficiency for lap-welded joints between plates with surfaces of double curvature that
have a compressive stress across the joint from a negative value of  P g  or other external loading may be taken as unity; such compressive stress
shall not exceed 700 lbf/in. 2 . For all other lap-welded joints, the joint efficiency factor must be applied to the allowable compressive stress,  S ca . The
efficiency for full-penetration butt-welded joints, which are in compression across the entire thickness of the connected plates, may be taken as
unity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3  All main butt-welded joints (see 5.26.4.2) shall be completely radiographed or ultrasonically examined as specified in 5.26 and nozzle
and reinforcement attachment welding shall be examined by the magnetic-particle method as specified in 7.15.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 4  Thickness limitations do not apply to flat bottoms supported uniformly on a foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 5  For the purposes of this table, a circumferential or latitudinal joins shall be considered subject to the same requirements and limitations
as are longitudinal or meridional joints when such a circumferential or latitudinal joint is located (a) in a spherical, tori spherical or ellipsoidal shape
or in any other surface of double curvature, (b) at the junction between a conical or dished roof (or bottom) and cylindrical sidewalls, as considered
in 5.12.3 or (c) at a similar juncture at either end of a transition section or reducer as shown in Figure 5-9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of  N  and the value of  t/R  associated with the compressive unit stress and reading the value of  s c  that corresponds to
that point. The value of   s c   will be the limiting value of  s ca  for the given conditions. (See F-1 for examples illustrating the
determination of allowable compressive stress values in accordance with this paragraph.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.4.6
When a local axial compressive buckling stress in a cylindrical shell is primarily due to a moment in the
cylinder, then the allowable longitudinal compressive stress  S cs  or  s ca , as specified in 5.5.4.2 or 5.5.4.3, may be
increased by 20 %. If the shell bending is due to wind (tank full or empty) or due to earthquake (tank empty), then in
addition to the above allowed 20 % increase, the allowable buckling stress due to a moment can be increased an
additional  1 / 3 . For tanks full or partially full of liquid and for an earthquake induced longitudinal compressive stress, the
allowable compression stress need not be limited for biaxial stress as otherwise may be required by Figure 5-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For seismic design, the tank full is usually the worst case. For wind loading, the tank empty and with internal pressure
is usually the worst case for local, bending induced compressive stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.4.7
The allowable compressive stresses previously specified in 5.5.4 are predicated on butt-welded
construction. If one or more of the main joints across which the compressive force acts are of the lap-welded type, the
allowable compressive stress will be determined according to 5.5.4, but subject to the limitations of 5.12.2 and
Table 5-2 (including Note 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.4.8
Cylindrical shells can be checked for wind buckling to determine if there is the need for intermediate wind
girders using the rules of 5.10.6. If the transition between the roof or bottom is a curved knuckle section (5.12.3) then
1 / 3  of the knuckle height shall be included as part of the unstiffened shell height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.5
Maximum Shearing Stresses<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The maximum shearing stresses in welds used for attaching manways and nozzles and their reinforcements or other
attachments to the walls of a tank and in sections of manway or nozzle necks that serve as reinforcement attachment
shall not exceed 80 % of the value of the applicable maximum allowable tensile stress,  S ts , given in Table 5-1 for the
kind of material involved. Such maximum shearing stresses are permissible only where the loading is applied in a
direction perpendicular to the length of the weld and must be reduced where the loading is applied differently (see
5.16.8.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.6
Maximum Allowable Stresses for Wind or Earthquake Loadings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The maximum allowable stresses for design loadings combined with wind or earthquake loadings shall not exceed
133 % of the stress permitted for the design loading condition; except as allowed in Annex L, this stress shall not
exceed 80 % of the specified minimum yield strength for carbon steel. For stainless steel and aluminum, see Q.3.3.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.7
Allowable Stress for Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stresses for hydrostatic and hydrostatic-pneumatic tests shall not exceed 130 % of the allowable design tensile stress
or 125 % of the allowable design compressive stress except as modified in 5.12.4.3. Calculations are required for
product density less than 48 lb/ft 3  to verify test stresses will not exceed these limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Maximum Allowable Stress Values for Structural Members and Bolts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.1
Subject to the provisions of 5.6.5, the maximum stresses in internal or external diaphragms, webs, trusses,
columns, and other framing, as determined for any of the loadings listed in 5.4 or any concurrent combination of such
loadings expected to be encountered in the specified operation, shall not exceed the applicable allowable stresses

<<HEADING level=3>>5.9 Procedure for Designing Tank Walls<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.1 Free-body Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Free-body analysis denotes a design procedure that determines the magnitude and direction of the forces that must
be exerted by the walls of a tank, at the level selected for analysis, to hold in static equilibrium the portion of the tank
and its contents above or below the selected level as a free-body, as if it were isolated from the remaining portions of
the tank by a horizontal plane cutting the walls of the tank at the level under consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.2 Levels of Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Free-body analyses shall be made at successive levels from the top to the bottom of the tank for the purpose of
determining the magnitude and character of the meridional and longitudinal unit forces that will exist in the walls of the
tank at critical levels under all the various combinations of gas pressure (or partial vacuum) and liquid head to be
encountered in service, which may have a controlling effect on the design. Several analyses may be necessary at a
given level of the tank to establish the governing conditions of gas pressure and liquid head for that level. The
thicknesses required in the main walls of the tank shall then be computed by the applicable procedures given in
5.10.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.3 Tank Shape and Capacity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The analyses in 5.9.2 provide the exact shape and overall dimensions needed for the desired capacity of the tank.
Except for the more common shapes such as spheres and cylinders, the determination of optimum shapes and sizes
is frequently a trial-and-error procedure requiring considerable experience and judgment. As a further preliminary to
making the free-body analyses (see 5.9.2) of tanks that will be provided with internal ties, diaphragms, trusses, or
other members subject to pressure-imposed loads, studies must be made to establish the preferred arrangement of
the members and the magnitude and nature of the loads they must carry under the various conditions of gas pressure
and liquid level that will be encountered in operation (see 5.13).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.4 Flat Bottoms of Cylindrical Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.4.1  Flat bottoms of cylindrical tanks that are uniformly supported on a ringwall, grade, or concrete-slab
foundation are pressure-resisting membranes but are considered nonstressed because of support from the

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Footnote 16 is also applicable to Equation (1), Equation (2), and Equation (3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18  Equation (2), Equation (5), and Equation (9) have been derived from a summation of the normal-to-surface components of the  T 1
and  T 2  forces acting on a unit area of the tank wall subjected only to pressure  P . To be technically correct, the normal-to-surface
components of other loads, such as metal, snow or insulation, should be added to or subtracted from  P . For the usual internal
design pressure, these added loads are small compared with  P  and can be mooted without significant error. Where the pressure
P  is relatively small, as in the case of a partial vacuum loading, the other load components can have a substantial effect on the
calculated  T 2  force and resultant thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Equation (3) and Equation (6) are correct only when  P  is the free-body pressure without the normal-to-surface components of
other loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The example in F.3 calculates the required roof thicknesses under a small vacuum by considering the metal, insulation and snow
loads in Equation (1) through Equation (5). The designer should note that if these loads had been omitted, the calculated
thicknesses would have been much less than the correct values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In Equation (1), Equation (4), Equation (8), and Equation (10),  W  is intended to include loads of insignificant value, such as metal
weight. At points away from the vertical centerline of the roof, the value of  T 2  is required for the thickness calculations of Equation
(18), Equation (20), and Equation (22) and the value of  P  in Equation (2), Equation (5), and Equation (9) must be modified by the
normal components of the added loads for the correction determination of  T 2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.10.2.2  Positive values of  T 1  and  T 2  indicate tensile forces; negative values indicate compressive forces.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.2.3  Free-body analyses shall be made at the level of each horizontal joint in the sidewalls, roof, and bottom of
the tank and at any intermediate levels at which the center of curvature changes significantly. The maximum total
pressure (liquid head plus gas pressure) that can exist at a given level will not necessarily be the governing condition
for that level. Sufficient analyses shall be made at each level to determine the combination of liquid head and gas
pressure (or partial vacuum) that, in conjunction with the allowable tensile and compressive stresses, will control the
design at that level. A tank may normally be operated at a fixed height of liquid contents, but the tank must be made
safe for any conditions that might develop in filling or emptying the tank. This will necessitate a particularly careful
investigation of sidewalls of double curvature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.2.4  Mathematically exact instead of approximate values of  R 1  and  R 2  should be used in computations for
ellipsoidal roofs and bottoms. The values for a point at a horizontal distance,  x , from the vertical axis of a roof or
bottom in which the length of the horizontal semiaxis,  a , is two times the length of the vertical semiaxis,  b , may be
determined by multiplying length a by the appropriate factor selected from Table 5-5. Values for ellipsoidal shapes of
other proportions may be computed using the following formulas:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

thus isolating more than one free-body at that level, the formulas given in 5.10.2.1 and 5.10.2.5 apply only to the
central free-body whose walls continue across and are pierced by the axis of revolution. (An example of the kind of
plane described would be one passed through the bottom of the tank shown in Figure 5-4, Panel c, just a short
distance below the lower ends of the internal ties.) The meridional and latitudinal unit forces acting along the edges of
the annular free-body or bodies lying outside of the central free-body must be computed from formulas developed
especially for the particular shape of free-body cross section involved. This standard cannot provide formulas for all
shapes of cross sections and conditions of loading that might be used at these locations; however, for a toroidal
segment that rests directly on its foundation (see 5.11.1) and has a constant meridional radius,  R 1 , such as is used in
the outer portion of the bottom of the tanks shown in Figure 5-4, Panel c, applicable equations for the meridional and

different thicknesses until one is found for which the simultaneous values of the computed tension stress,  s tc , and the

<<PARAGRAPH>>foregoing provisions, if the unit force acting in compression in the case described does not exceed 5 % of the
coexistent tensile unit force acting perpendicular to it, the designer has the option of determining the thickness
required for this condition by using the method specified in 5.10.3.2 instead of complying strictly with the provisions of
this paragraph. The value of the joint efficiency factor,  E , will not enter into this determination unless the magnitude of
the allowable tensile stress,  s ta , is governed by the product  ES ts   as provided in 5.5.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.3.5  If the unit forces  T 1  and  T 2  are both negative but of unequal magnitude for the governing condition of

previous steps (if the value has not been finally established earlier in the procedure). The values of  s cc  shall be
computed for both  T 1  and   T 2  and checked to see that they satisfy the requirements of 5.5.4.4 and 5.5.4.6. If the
tentative thickness does not satisfy these requirements, the necessary adjustments shall be made in the thickness

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.3.6  The procedure described in 5.10.3.5 is for the condition in which biaxial compression with unit forces of
unequal magnitude is governing. In many cases, however, a tentative thickness will have been previously established
by other design conditions and will need to be checked only for the external pressure or partial vacuum condition. In
such cases, the designer has only to compute the values of  s cc  for both  T 1  and   T 2  and then check to see that these
satisfy the requirements of 5.5.4.4, as specified in Step 6. (See F.3 for examples illustrating the application of

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.5.2  This standard does not contain provisions for the design of cylindrical sidewalls that are subject to partial
internal vacuum in tanks constructed for the storage of gases or vapors alone. However, cylindrical sidewalls of
vertical tanks designed in accordance with these rules for storing liquids (with the thickness of upper courses not less
than specified in 5.10.4 for the tank size involved and with increasing thickness from top to bottom as required for the
combined gas and liquid loadings) may be safely subjected to a partial vacuum in the gas or vapor space not
exceeding 1 ounce per square in. with the operating liquid level in the tank at any stage from full to empty. The
vacuum relief valve or valves shall be set to open at a smaller partial vacuum so that the 1-ounce partial vacuum will

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A 3-sec gust design wind velocity,  V , of 120 mph which imposes a dynamic pressure of 25.6 lbf/ft 2 . The velocity is increased by
10 % for either a height above the ground or a gust factor. The pressure is thus increased to 31 lbf/ft 2 . An additional 5 lbf/ft 2  is
added for internal vacuum. This pressure is intended by these rules to be the result of a 120 miles per hour 3-sec wind gust at
approximately 33 ft above the ground.  H 1  may be modified for other wind velocities, as specified by the Purchaser, by
multiplying the formula by (120/ V ) 2 . When a design wind pressure, rather than a wind velocity, is stated by the Purchaser, the
preceding increase factors should be added, unless they are contained within the design wind pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.10.6.3  If the height of the transposed sidewall is greater than the maximum height,  H 1 , an intermediate girder is
required.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For equal stability above and below the intermediate wind girder, the latter should be located at the mid-height of
the transposed sidewall. The location of the girder on the actual sidewall should be at the same course and

<<HEADING level=3>>5.10.6.6  The required minimum section modulus, in inches cubed, of the intermediate wind girder shall be
determined by the equation:<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   This equation is based on a 3 sec gust wind velocity of 120 miles per hour. If specified by the Purchaser, other wind

the tank sidewall which are used for the 120 mile per hour 3 sec gust design wind velocity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.6.7  Where the use of a transposed sidewall permits the intermediate wind girder to be located at a height less
than  H 1  calculated by the formula in 5.10.6.1, the spacing to the mid-height of the transposed sidewall, transposed to
the height of the actual sidewall, may be substituted for  H 1  in the calculation for minimum section modulus if the girder
is attached at the transposed location.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.6.8  The section modulus of the intermediate wind girder shall be based upon the properties of the attached

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.6.9  Intermediate stiffeners extending a maximum of 6 in. from the outside of the sidewall are permitted without
need for an opening in the stiffener when the nominal stairway width is at least 24 in. For greater outward extensions
of a stiffener, the stairway shall be increased in width to provide a minimum clearance of 18 in. between the outside of
the stiffener and the handrail of the stairway, subject to the approval of the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the foundation will absorb the weight of the tank contents without significant movement, the liquid head may be
neglected in computing the internal pressure,  P , acting on the bottom and in computing the unit forces,  T 1  and  T 2 , in
the bottom. Under these conditions, the unit forces in the bottom of the tank may be computed considering that  P  in

<<HEADING level=3>>5.11.2 Flat-bottom Tanks with Counterbalance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In tanks that have cylindrical sidewalls and flat bottoms, the uplift that results from the pressure acting on the
underside of the roof combined with the effect of design wind pressure, or seismic loads if specified, must not exceed
the weight of the sidewalls plus the weight of that portion of the roof that is carried by the sidewalls when no uplifts
exists unless the excess is counteracted by a counterbalancing structure such as a concrete ringwall, a slab
foundation, or another structural system. The means for accomplishing this shall be a matter of agreement between
the Manufacturer and the Purchaser. Similar precautions must be taken with flat-bottomed tanks of other shapes. All
weights used in such computations shall be based on net thicknesses of the materials, exclusive of corrosion
allowance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11.2.2 Counterbalancing Structure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The counterbalancing structure, which may be a foundation or support system, shall be designed to resist uplift
calculated as described in 5.11.2 based on 1.25 times the internal design pressure plus the wind load on the shell and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Flat-bottom Tanks without Counterbalancing Weight<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The detailed design of flat-bottom tanks without counterbalancing weight shall be a matter of agreement between the
Manufacturer and the Purchaser and shall satisfy the following conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The bottom of a flat-bottom tank shall be designed to remain flat during all design and test conditions. When the
flat-bottom tank is designed without anchoring the shell to the counterbalancing weight, the bottom will be
designed to carry all the weight and pressure forces distributed on the bottom and to transfer the uplift forces from
the sidewall through the bottom plates. The uplift forces will be obtained from a free-body analysis as specified in
5.9 and 5.10. These forces shall be determined for the tank (deducting any specified corrosion allowance) for both
a full and an empty condition and shall include uplift from design wind velocity. The largest values will be used for
design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The bottom plates in the flat-bottom tank shall be designed as a strength member to span between main structural
members (for example, grillage beams or other structural members) and transfer the distributed pressure and
liquid-weight forces to these main structural members.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) When the bottom plate is a bending strength member, single-fillet lap joints are not permitted in the bottom plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Adequate provision shall be made at the sidewall to transfer the uplift forces from the shell to the shear-carrying
elements in the bottom structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Consideration shall be given to protecting all bottom structural elements from environmental corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Anchorage shall be provided for resistance to wind and seismic forces and shall be designed in accordance with
5.11.2.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11.4

<<HEADING level=3>>5.12.1 Design Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design rules in this section do not cover the junction between a conical reducer and cylindrical sidewalls except
as indicated on Figure 5-9, Panel b. However, the provisions of this section shall be observed at such a juncture if the
angle formed is nonreentrant. (See 5.18.3 for design of reentrant junctures.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12.2 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the roof or bottom of a pressure tank is a cone or partial sphere (or nearly so) and is attached to cylindrical
sidewalls, the membrane stresses in the roof or bottom pull inward on the periphery of the sidewalls. This pull results
in circumferential compressive forces at the juncture, which may be resisted either by a knuckle curvature in the roof
or bottom or by a limited zone at the juncture of the intersecting roof or bottom plates and sidewall plates,
supplemented in some cases by an angle, a rectangular bar, or a horizontally disposed ring girder. All longitudinal and
meridional joints in a knuckle region, or between those portions of plates that are considered to participate 20  in
resisting compressive forces in a compression-ring region, and all radial joints in a compression-ring angle, bar, or
girder shall be butt-welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12.3 Knuckle Regions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.3.1  If a curved knuckle is provided, a ring girder or other form of compression ring shall not be used in
connection with it, and there shall be no sudden changes in the direction of a meridional line at any point. In addition,
the radius of curvature of the knuckle in a meridional plane shall be not less than 6 %, and preferably not less than
12 %, of the diameter of the sidewalls. Subject to the provisions of 5.12.3.2, the thickness of the knuckle at all points
shall satisfy the requirements of 5.10. Use of a knuckle radius as small as 6 % of the sidewall diameter will frequently
require an excessively heavy thickness for the knuckle region. The thickness requirement for such a region will be
found more reasonable if a larger knuckle radius is used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.3.2  The designer should recognize that applying the equations in 5.10.2 to levels immediately above and
below a point where two surfaces of differing meridional curvature have a common meridional tangent (for example,
at the juncture between the knuckle region and the spherically dished portion of a tori spherical roof) will result in the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>20  If, for manufacturing reasons, it is uneconomical or impractical to use butt-welded longitudinal or meridional joints for a distance
on either side of the juncture as computed using Equation (24) and Equation (25) and the thickness of the plates involved does
not exceed the applicable limits for lap joints as set forth in Table 5-2, the joints may be lap-welded provided that the plates
jointed in this way are not given credit for contributing to the net cross-sectional area provided for resisting compressive forces
in the compression-ring region. In such a case, however, computation of (a) force  Q  from Equation (26), (b) the width of the
horizontal projection (see 5.12.5) and (c) the centroid of the composite corner compression region (see 5.12.5) shall be made
as though these plates did actually participate in resisting the compressive force.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.12.5 Details of Compression-ring Regions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.5.1  If the force  Q  is negative, indicating compression, then the horizontal projection of the effective
compression-ring region shall have a width in a radial direction not less than 0.015 times the horizontal radius of the
tank wall at the level of the juncture between the roof or bottom and the sidewalls; if the projected width does not meet
this requirement, appropriate corrective measures shall be applied as specified in this section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.5.2  Whenever the magnitude of the circumferential force  Q  determined in accordance with 5.12.4 is such that
the area required by Equation (27) is not provided in a compression-ring region with plates of the minimum
thicknesses established by the requirements of 5.10 or when  Q  is compressive and the horizontal projection of the
width,  w h , is less than specified in 5.12.5.1, the compression-ring region shall be reinforced by (a) thickening the roof
or bottom and sidewall plates as required to provide a compression-ring region having the necessary cross-sectional
area and width as determined on the basis of the thicker plates, 22  (b) adding an angle, a rectangular bar, or a
horizontally disposed ring girder at the juncture of the roof or bottom and sidewalls plates, or (c) using a combination
of these alternatives. This additional area shall be arranged so that the centroid of the cross-sectional area of the
composite corner compression region lies ideally in the horizontal plane of the corner formed by the two members. In
no case shall the centroid be off the plane by more than 1.5 times the average thickness of the two members
intersecting at the corner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.5.3  Such an angle, bar, or ring girder, if used, may be located either inside or outside the tank (see Figure 5-6)
and shall have a cross section with dimensions that satisfy the following conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The cross-sectional area within the limit of  w c  or  w h  makes up the deficiency between the area  A c  required by
Equation (27) and the cross-sectional area provided by the compression-ring region in the walls of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The horizontal width of the angle, bar, or ring girder is not less than 0.015 times the horizontal radius,  R c , of the
tank wall at the level of the juncture of the roof or bottom and the sidewalls except that when the cross-sectional
area to be added in an angle or bar is not more than one-half the total area required by Equation (27), the
foregoing width requirement for this member may be disregarded if the horizontal projection of the width,  w h , of the
participating roof or bottom plates alone is equal to or greater than 0.015 R c  or, with an angle or bar located on the
outside of a tank, the sum of the projection of the width,  w h , and the horizontal width of the added angle or bar is
equal to or greater than 0.015 R c .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) When bracing must be provided as specified in 5.12.5.8, the moment of inertia of the cross section around a
horizontal axis shall be not less than that required by Equation (28).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.5.4  When the vertical leg of an angle ring or a vertical flange of a ring girder is located on the sidewall of the
tank, it may be built into the sidewall if its thickness is not less than that of the adjourning wall plates. If this
construction is not used, the leg, edge, or flange of the compression ring next to the tank shall make good contact with
the wall of the tank around the entire circumference and shall be attached thereto along both the top and bottom
edges by continuous fillet welds except as provided in 5.12.5.5. These welds shall be sufficiently sized to transmit to
the compression-ring angle, bar, or girder that portion of the total circumferential force,  Q , which must be carried
thereby, assuming in the case of welds separated by the width of a leg or flange of a structural member as shown in
Figure 5-6, details a and h, that only the weld nearest the roof or bottom is effective. In no event, however, shall the
size of any weld along either edge of a compression ring be less than the thickness of the thinner of the two parts
joined or  1 / 4  in. (whichever is smaller), nor shall the size of the corner welds between the shell and a girder bar, such
as shown in Figure 5-6, details d and e, be less than the applicable weld sizes in Table 5-8. The part thicknesses and
weld sizes in Table 5-8 relate to dimensions in the as-welded condition before the deduction of corrosion allowances;
with this exception, all other part thicknesses and weld sizes referred to in this paragraph relate to dimensions after
the deduction of corrosion allowance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>22  Note that unless the effect of the unit forces  T 2  and  T 2 s  on the resulting increments in width of participating plate may be safely
neglected, the use of thicker plates involves recomputing not only  T h  and  w c , but also   Q  and  A  for the increased plate thickness;
hence, the design of the compression-ring-region in this case becomes a trial-and-error procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.5.7  If a compression ring on either the inside or outside of a tank is shaped in such a way that liquid may be
trapped, it shall be provided with adequate drain holes uniformly distributed along its length. Similarly, if a
compression ring on the inside of a tank is shaped in such a way that gas would be trapped on the underside when
the tank is being filled with liquid, adequate vent holes shall be provided along its length. Where feasible, such drain

<<HEADING level=3>>5.13.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions of 5.13.2 through 5.13.5 are limited to a discussion of the basic requirements and principles involved.
For reasons that will appear obvious, specific design formulas cannot be included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.13.2 Basic Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.2.1  Wherever the shape selected for a tank is such that the tank, or some portion thereof, would tend to
assume an appreciably different shape under certain conditions of loading or whenever the shape is such that it is not
feasible or economical to design the walls themselves to carry the entire loads imposed by all possible combinations
of gas and liquid loadings that may be encountered in service, suitable internal ties, columns, trusses, or other
structural members shall be provided in the tank to preserve its shape and to carry the forces that are not carried
directly by the walls of the tank. Other structural members may be needed on the outside of a tank to support or partly
support the weight of the tank and its contents, and these shall be provided as required. All such internal and external
members shall be designed in accordance with good structural engineering practices, using stresses as specified in
5.6. They shall be arranged and distributed in or on the tank and connected to the walls of the tank (in cases where
such connections are needed) in such a way that reactions will not cause excessive localized or secondary stresses
in the walls of the tank. When these members are rigidly attached to the wall of a tank by welding, the stresses in the
member at the point of attachment shall be limited to the stress value permitted in the wall of the tank (see Annex D).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.13.2.2  In no event shall the nominal thickness, including the corrosion allowance, if any, of any part of any internal
framing be less than 0.17 in.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.2.3  If any structural members (such as girders at node circles), tank accessories, or other internals are placed
to form gas pockets inside a tank, adequate and suitably located vent holes shall be provided so that these spaces
will vent freely when the liquid level is raised beyond them. Similarly, if any such members, accessories, or other
internals are shaped to hold liquid above them when the tank is being emptied, they shall be provided with adequate<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>and suitably located drain holes. These vent and drain holes shall be not smaller than  3 / 4  inches in diameter and shall
be distributed along the member.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.13.3 Simple Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some cases the forces acting on structural members are statically determinate; in other cases, they are statically
indeterminate. The external columns that are often used for supporting a spherical tank are an example of the
statically determinate class of members. If the columns are vertical, the force acting on each column is simply the
combined weight of the tank and its contents divided by the number of columns. If the columns are inclined, this
quotient must be divided by the cosine of the angle each column makes with the vertical to obtain the force acting in
each column.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To cite another case, where internal framing is needed inside a tank only to support the weight of the roof and such
loads (including external pressure load, if any) as may be superimposed upon it, the procedure for designing such
framing is more or less straightforward, involving only a few assumptions. In other cases, however, whenever the
internal framing serves to supplement the load-carrying capacity of the walls of the tank, the design procedure is
more complex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.13.4 Complex Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.4.1  The design rules in this standard do not cover specific requirements for designing the internal framing in all
the various shapes of tanks that might be constructed, but an outline of the procedure used in the design of internal
framing for one special shape of tank, as shown in Figure 5-4, Panel c, should serve to illustrate the general method
of attack. In such a system of internal framing, the magnitude of the forces in the tension members, which tie the ring
girders under the roof node circles to the respective girders above the bottom node circles, are determined by static,
assuming for the purpose of a preliminary analysis that these tension members are replaced by a cylindrical shell if
the members are vertical or by a conical frustum if the members are inclined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.4.2  Under these assumed conditions, the vertical components of the  T 1  (meridional) unit forces in the roof
plates at their juncture with the cylinder or frustum are transmitted directly to the cylinder or frustum so that an upper
ring girder is unnecessary in this hypothetical case if (a) the horizontal components of the  T 1  unit forces in the roof or
wall plates on opposite sides of the juncture balance each other in the case of the cylindrical tie or (b) the difference
between them is balanced by the horizontal components of the unit forces in the top of the frustum in the case of the
conical tie.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.4.3  Similarly, at the lower end of the cylinder or frustum, the summation of the vertical components of the
f or ces must be in balance with the vertical components of the forces in the cylinder or frustum, and the summation of
the horizontal components of the forces acting at the juncture must be zero. Furthermore, the total vertical force
acting along the edges of the top of the cylinder or frustum must equal the total vertical force acting along the edges of
the bottom of the cylinder or frustum. In other words, the general layout of the tank must be such that the upward gas
pressure over a predetermined portion of the roof is balanced by the downward gas pressure over a predetermined
portion of the bottom without undue elastic stressing or straining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.4.4  If the horizontal forces at the node circles are not otherwise in equilibrium, ring girders must be provided at
these circles. The girders must be designed to carry the unbalanced components—either in tension or compression,
as the case may be.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.4.5  Having satisfied the conditions of static equilibrium using a hypothetical cylinder or frustum for a tie, the
designer must consider and provide for the real conditions where the cylinder or frustum is approximated by a number
of uniformly spaced structural members, each of which, in addition to its primary function as a tie, serves also as a
column to support its assigned portion of the roof and external loads. The torsional and vertical moments in the ring
girders at the node circles must be provided for, keeping in mind that relatively small variations from the nominal  T 1
(meridional) roof forces will greatly reduce, if not completely offset, the torsional moments in the girders.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.13.5 Internal Meridional Stiffeners<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.5.1  When curved meridional trusses or ribs are fastened to the sidewalls of a tank to prevent the  T 1
(meridional) compressive forces from buckling the sidewalls, the distribution of meridional forces between the
sidewalls and trusses or ribs is to a degree indeterminate if the foundation support for the overhanging portions of the
sidewalls is so uniformly distributed around the tank that there is no greater foundation-bearing intensity against the
tank wall beneath the trusses or ribs. In this case, the total meridional forces that the sidewalls and trusses or ribs
must carry, acting together, at any given level in the tank may be computed from Equation (1) in 5.10.2.1, assuming
for the purposes of these computations only that the cross-sectional area of the trusses or ribs is distributed uniformly
along the circumference of the sidewalls as an added sidewall thickness. In other words, the value of  F  in Equation (1)
may be taken as not including the forces in these trusses or ribs, and the hypothetical value of the meridional unit
force computed using Equation (1) may be regarded as the summation of all meridional forces acting on the
composite section of sidewalls and trusses or ribs at the level under consideration divided by the circumference of the
tank at that level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.5.2  The net cross-sectional area of metal (exclusive of corrosion allowance) required per inch of tank
circumference to resist these forces may then be determined by dividing the hypothetical value of the meridional unit
forces acting on the composite section by allowable compressive stress. This area must then be apportioned
between the sidewalls and the trusses of ribs, by trial-and-error computations, in such a way that (a) sufficient
material is placed in the trusses or ribs to enable them to serve their intended function of preventing buckling of the
sidewalls in a vertical direction (the trusses or ribs must also be proportioned and distributed around the
circumference of the tank so that they will serve this function) and (b) sufficient thickness is provided in the sidewalls
to enable them to withstand not only their share of the meridional unit forces but also the entire latitudinal unit force  T 2
as computed by the following equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>T 2  =  R 2 ( P  –  T 1 / R 1 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this equation,  T 1  is the meridional unit force assumed to be actually carried by the sidewalls and is obtained by
multiplying the hypothetical value of the meridional unit forces acting on the composite section by the ratio of the
sidewall cross-sectional area to the composite cross-sectional area at the level in question. Other variables used in
the foregoing equation are defined in 5.10.1, and the thickness provided to resist this force  T 2  must satisfy all of the
requirements of 5.10.3 that involve this force.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.5.3  No such uniform distribution of forces on the composite section of sidewalls and trusses or ribs actually
occurs. However, the assumption of uniform distribution of 5.13.5.1 and 5.13.5.2 will give safe designs if the principles
outlined are observed and the eccentricity of loading on the trusses or ribs is taken into account. (New designs shall
be proved by strain-gauge surveys.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.13.5.4  In the case of a tank whose foundations and supports are designed and arranged so that the weight of the
overhanging portions of the tank and its contents is transferred entirely to the trusses or ribs and from there to the
foundations, the total vertical load on each truss or rib is determinate. The stress system in the tank wall is analogous
to that in a large horizontal pipeline supported entirely on ring girders. In the latter case, design stresses comparable
to those permitted in 5.13.5.2 may be used insofar as sidewall thicknesses are governed by forces acting in a
meridional direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.14 Shapes, Locations, and Maximum Sizes of Wall Openings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.14.1  The term opening as used in this section, 5.16, 5.17, and 5.18 refers to the hole cut in a tank wall to
accommodate a nozzle, manway, or other connection (rather than just the bore of the connection) except when the
wall of a connection extends through the tank wall and is attached to it with sufficient weld within the tank wall
thickness to develop the strength in tension of that section of the wall of the connection which lies within the tank wall
thickness (that is, the strength of an area equal to twice the product of the nozzle wall thickness and the tank wall
thickness) in addition to whatever welding is required at this location for reinforcement attachment. In the latter case,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_72>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5-38
API S TANDARD  620<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>when the wall of a connection is attached to the tank wall in this way, opening refers to the figure formed by the
imaginary line of intersection between the inside surface of the connection and the surface of the tank wall extended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.14.2  In all cases, requirements concerning openings shall be understood to refer to dimensions that apply to the
corroded condition. Unless otherwise specified, dimensions of openings generally refer to measurements taken along
the chord of the tank wall curvature if the wall is curved in the direction involved; however, when there is more than
approximately a 2 % difference between the length of chord and the length of the arc that is subtends in the tank wall,
the measurement shall be taken along the arc of the tank wall curvature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.14.3  The rules in this section shall also apply to openings in cylindrical shells that are adjacent to a relatively flat
bottom; as an alternative, the insert plate or reinforcing plate may extend to and intersect the bottom-to-shell joint at
approximately 90°. Stress-relieving requirements do not apply to the weld to the bottom or annular plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.14.4  All manholes, nozzle connections, or other connections in the sidewalls, roofs, or bottoms of tanks
constructed under these rules shall be circular, elliptical, 24  or obround  25  in shape. Where elliptical or obround
connections are employed, the long dimensions shall not exceed twice the short dimension, as measured along the
outer surface of the tank; if the connection is in an area of unequal meridional and latitudinal stresses in the tank wall,
the long dimension shall preferably coincide with the direction of the greater stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.14.5  Each opening in the walls of a tank shall be located so that the distance between the outer edge of its
reinforcement  26  and any line of significant discontinuity in the curvature of the tank walls (such as the juncture
between two nodes in a noded surface, the juncture between a dished or conical roof or bottom and cylindrical
sidewalls, or the juncture between a roof or bottom and cylindrical sidewalls, or the juncture between a roof or bottom
knuckle and other portions of the tank) is not less than 6 in. or (if this be larger) eight times the nominal thickness
(including corrosion allowance; if any) of the wall plate containing the opening, except as permitted by 5.14.3. No part
of the attachment for any openings shall be located closer than the larger of these distances to any part of the
attachment for any lugs, columns, skirts, or other members attached to the tank for supporting the tank itself or for
supporting important loads that are carried by the tank. When any two adjacent openings are reinforced
independently of each other, they shall be spaced so that the distance between the edges of their respective
reinforcements will not at any point be less than the larger of the foregoing specified distances (see 5.17).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.14.6  Each opening shall be located so that any attachments and reinforcements will be, or may readily be made,
fully accessible for inspection and repair on both the outside and inside of the tank except in the case of connections
that for compelling reasons must be located on the underside of a tank bottom resting directly on the tank foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.14.7  Properly reinforced openings may be of any size  27  that can be located on the tank to comply with the
requirements of 5.14.5 and 5.14.6 except that in no event shall the inside diameter (after allowing for corrosion) of any
opening  28  other than those considered in 5.18 exceed 1.5 times the least radius of curvature in that portion of the
tank wall in which the opening is located.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.14.8  Large openings shall be given special consideration (see 5.16.7 and 5.18). In the case of large openings
which have attachments that require shop stress relief (see 5.25.1), shipping clearances, affecting the maximum size
of assembly that can be shipped, may control the size of the opening that can be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>24  An opening made for a pipe or nozzle of circular cross section whose axis is not perpendicular to the tank wall shall be treated
as an elliptical opening for design purposes.
25  An obround figure is one that is formed by two parallel sides and semi-circular ends.
26  The term edge or reinforcement means the edge, or toe, or the outermost weld that attaches the reinforcing pad to the wall of
the tank. In the case of an opening that is not provided with a reinforcing pad, it means the neck of the nozzle or other
connection extending from the opening to the tank wall.
27  Although no minimum size is prescribed, it is recommended that no nozzle smaller than  3 / 4  in. pipe be used on a tank
constructed according to these rules.
28  In the case of elliptical or obround openings, the dimension of the opening in any given direction shall meet this requirement
with respect to the radius of curvature of the tank wall in that direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.16 Reinforcement of Single Openings<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements of this paragraph are illustrated in Figure 5-7 and Figure 5-8. See 5.21.1.2, 5.21.1.3, 5.21.2.7, and
5.21.2.8 for provisions concerning reinforcement of openings in cover plates for nozzles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.2 Basic Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All openings in the walls of tanks constructed according to these rules and all openings for branch connections  29<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>from nozzle necks welded to the tank wall shall be fully reinforced with the exception of the exclusions covered in
5.16.2.1 and 5.16.2.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.2.1  Single openings in tanks do not require reinforcement other than that which is inherent in their construction
for the following conditions:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) 3 in., or less, pipe size welded connections in tank walls  3 / 8  in. or less;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) 2 in., or less, pipe size welded connections in tank walls over  3 / 8  in.;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) threaded connections in which the hole in the tank wall is not greater than 2 in. pipe size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.2.2  The reinforcement required for openings in tank walls for external pressure conditions need be only 50 %
of that required in 5.16.5 where  t  has been determined for external pressure conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.2.3  The requirements for full reinforcement shall not be construed as requiring that a special reinforcing pad be
provided where the necessary reinforcing metal is available in the nozzle neck or elsewhere around the opening as
permitted by these rules. The amount of reinforcement required, the limiting dimensions within which metal may be
considered to be effective as reinforcement, and the strength of the welding required for attaching the reinforcement
are defined in 5.16.3. Reinforcement shall be provided in the specified amount and shall be distributed and attached
to the wall of the tank in such a way that the requirements are satisfied for all paths of potential failures through the
opening extended in either a meridional or latitudinal direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.2.4  The maximum amount of reinforcement will be needed in a plane that is perpendicular to the direction of
principal wall stress passed through the opening at the point where the centerline of the connection intersects the wall of
the tank; for obround openings, that same amount must be provided along the entire length of the parallel sides of the
opening between the planes passing through the respective centers of the semicircular ends. However, these planes
may not be the controlling sections with respect to possible failure through the opening, inasmuch as failure might occur
along another path (in the case of a cylindrical wall, parallel to, but somewhat removed from, the aforesaid planes) by a
combination of a tensile failure of the tank wall and shearing or tensile failure of the attachment welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>29  The design rule in this section make no mention of openings for branch connections from nozzle necks, but the provisions shall
be understood to apply to openings of this type. For this purpose, the term  tank wall  shall refer to the neck of the main nozzle to
which the branch connection is attached, and the term  nozzle wall  shall refer to the wall of the branch connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.3 Size and Shape of Area of Reinforcement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.3.1  The area of reinforcement for a given cross section of an opening shall be understood to be that area in a
plane normal to the surface of the tank and passing through the section under consideration within which available
metal may be deemed effective for reinforcing the opening. For surfaces that have straight elements, such as
cylinders and cones, the areas of reinforcement will be rectangular in shape as indicated by lines GH, HK, GJ, and JK
in Figure 5-7; however, on surfaces that are curved in two directions, the lines GH and JK shall follow the contour of
the tank surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.3.2  The maximum length of the area of reinforcement shall be the greater of the following limiting distances on
each side of the axis of the opening, measured along the outside surface of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A distance equal to the diameter of the opening after corrosion; in the case of non circular openings, a distance
equal to the corresponding clear dimension is substituted for the diameter of the opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A distance equal to the radius of the opening after corrosion plus the thickness of the nozzle wall plus the
thickness of the tank wall, all taken in the corroded condition; in the case of non circular openings, a distance
equal to the corresponding half chord is substituted for the radius of the opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.3.3  The maximum width of the area of reinforcement, measured radially as applicable from either the inner or
outer surface of the tank wall, or both, shall be not more than the smaller of the two following distances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A distance equal to 2.5 times the nominal thickness of the tank wall less the corrosion allowance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A distance equal to 2.5 times the nominal thickness of the nozzle wall less its corrosion allowance plus the
thickness of any additional reinforcement inside or outside the tank wall less its corrosion allowance if the
reinforcement considered is inside the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.3.4  If the areas of reinforcement computed for two or more adjacent openings overlap, the openings shall be
reinforced as provided in 5.17.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.4 Metal Considered to Have Reinforcing Value<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.4.1  Subject to the provisions of 5.16.7, the metal within the limits of the area of reinforcement as described in
5.16.4.2 and 5.16.4.3 may be considered to act as reinforcement.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.4.2  Metal thickness in the tank wall in excess of that required by 5.10 for 100 % joint efficiency may be
considered to act as reinforcement when the entire opening is in solid plate or in excess of that required for the
applicable design joint efficiency when any part of the opening passes through a joint that lies in approximately the
same meridional or latitudinal direction 30  as the cross section of the opening for which the reinforcement
requirements are being computed. In no case does this include any metal provided for corrosion allowance. If desired,
the wall thickness may be arbitrarily increased to make additional amounts of excess thickness available for
reinforcement in the tank wall instead of adding reinforcement locally in the form of reinforcing pads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.4.3  All other metal attached to the tank wall in conformance with 5.16.8 may be considered to act as
reinforcement, including those portions of fusion welds and the nozzle wall that remain available for reinforcement of
the opening after deducting applicable corrosion allowances and allowing for the thickness of nozzle wall needed to
satisfy minimum thickness and strength requirements for the nozzle wall itself (see 5.19).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>30 If part of the opening passes through a joint whose direction is approximately perpendicular to the cross section under
consideration, the presence of the joint may be ignored in the computations for this cross section but must be taken into account
in computations for reinforcement requirements along cross sections parallel to this joint (see 5.16.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.5 Reinforcement Required<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.5.1  The total cross-sectional area of the reinforcement provided at any section through an opening and within
the limits of the area of reinforcement as defined in 5.16.3 shall be not less than the value computed by the following
equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A r   = ( d  + 2 c )(t –  c )( E ´)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A r   is the area, in square inches, to be provided in the reinforcement of the section under consideration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d
is the inside clear dimension, in inches, across the opening at the section under consideration before
deducting the applicable corrosion allowance (see 5.14.1);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c
is the corrosion allowance, in inches, for the part under consideration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t
is the thickness, in inches, required by 5.10 for the particular area of the tank wall in which the opening is
located for resisting the unit forces that act in a direction perpendicular to the cross section under
consideration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E´
is the factor whose value shall be equal to the efficiency,  E , of the main joints along the edges of the tank
wall plate containing the opening that are approximately parallel to the cross section under consideration
where the opening is in solid plate or passes only through a joint that is substantially perpendicular to this
cross section; and whose value shall be 1.00 where any part of the opening passes through a joint that is
approximately parallel to the cross section under consideration (for values of  E , see Table 5-2). The value of
E´ , when not taken as unity, shall be expressed as a decimal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.5.2  Consideration must be given to the reinforcement requirements for cross sections in both meridional and
latitudinal directions, particularly on noncircular openings that have appreciable differences between their maximum
dimensions in these two directions (see 5.16.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.5.3  The equation in 5.16.5.1 assumes that all of the materials considered as reinforcement will have ultimate
tensile strengths not less than the ultimate minimum tensile strength specified for the material in the tank wall. If some
portion (such as the nozzle neck, if it is constructed of pipe) or all of the reinforcement material does not conform to
this assumption, additional reinforcement shall be provided to fully compensate for the lower ultimate tensile strength;
in no case shall any credit be taken for the additional strength of any material of a tensile strength higher than that of
the tank wall to be reinforced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.6 Distribution of Reinforcement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reinforcement shall be distributed so that the strength of the reinforcement in each and every plane that constitutes a
path of potential failure, as mentioned in 5.16.2, will be at least equal to the total load perpendicular to the same plane
that would have been carried by the metal removed from the net wall thickness needed for that region of the tank if
the metal had remained in the tank wall. The strength of the reinforcement is computed by multiplying the cross-
sectional area of the reinforcing material provided within the area of reinforcement in that plane by the maximum
allowable unit stress value for the reinforcement material (this value shall not exceed the allowable unit stress for the
tank wall). In addition, the reinforcement shall preferably be shaped in section and welded to the tank wall in such a
way that stress intensifications in the tank wall at the edges of the reinforcement will be kept as low as feasible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.7 Distribution of Reinforcement for Large Openings<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.7.1  The rules previously given for the reinforcement of openings are primarily intended for openings not larger
than the following sizes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For surfaces that have a radius of curvature of 30 in. or less, the inside diameter (width or length) of the openings
shall not exceed the radius of curvature of the surface in which the opening is located, nor shall it exceed 20 inches in
any case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) For surfaces whose least radius of curvature is over 30 in., the inside diameter (width or length) of the openings
shall not exceed  2 / 3  the least radius of curvature of the surface in which the opening is located, nor shall it exceed
40 in. in any case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.7.2  Openings larger than those just described, but still within the limits specified in 5.14.7, shall be given
special consideration; except as otherwise provided in 5.18, the reinforcement shall meet all of the requirements
previously given. In addition, special attention shall be given to placing the major portion of the reinforcement as close
as practicable to the edge of the opening while still providing a reasonably gradual transition in contour from the
thickness of the tank wall to the maximum thickness of the reinforcement. Wherever practicable, about  2 / 3  of the
required reinforcement shall be placed within a distance extending  1 / 4  of the dimension d (as defined in 5.16.5) on
each side of the opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.7.3  Fillet welds may be ground to concave contour, and the inside corners of the tank wall or nozzle neck along
the edges of the opening shall be rounded to a generous radius to reduce stress concentrations. Reinforcement may
sometimes be more advantageously obtained by inserting a thicker plate or plates in that portion of the wall of the
tank where the nozzle is located. However, when this is done, consideration shall be given to whether it would
introduce an objectionable degree of restraint that might affect adjoining plates. The degree to which these and other
measures should be used will depend on the particular application and the severity of the intended service. In
extreme cases, appropriate proof testing may be advisable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.8 Strength Required In Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.8.1  The reinforcement shall be attached using a method that develops the full strength required of the
reinforcement at the centerline of the opening and provides adequate protection against failure that might occur in a
plane (referred to herein as the critical plane) that is somewhat removed from the center of the opening as a result of
tensile failure of the tank wall in combination with shearing or tensile failure of the reinforcement attachment (see
5.16.2.4). To this end, the welds and other parts of the assembly that serve as reinforcement attachment shall be
properly located to transmit the stresses to the reinforcement, taking credit for only those portions of the attachment
that lie beyond the critical plane—i.e., on the side of the plane opposite the center of the opening. Similarly, the
strength of the attachment between any two parts of attached reinforcement beyond the critical plane shall be at least
equal to the strength required in tension of the attached part or parts (see F.5 for examples illustrating the computation
of reinforcement).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Although the location of the critical plane may be determined analytically in most cases, it is not essential that it be
determined analytically for the purposes of this section; the intent of the requirements in this section will be satisfied if (a) the critical
plane is assumed to be located as specified in Item 1 or 2 of this note and (b) sufficient welding and other attachments are provided
beyond the plane (that is, on the side of the plane opposite the center of the opening) to develop the strength of the attached
reinforcement required at the centerline of the opening. Attachment welds shall be made continuous around the entire periphery of
the opening and reinforcement without any material reduction in size along the portions not credited as effective attachment in the
computation. The critical plane locations to be assumed according to Item a of this note shall be established from a consideration
of the relative magnitude of the coincident biaxial stresses in the tank wall and the shape of the opening as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) For an opening in a spherical surface or in a surface of some other shape where neither of the principal biaxial stresses is less
than 75 % of the other, the critical plane shall be one that is perpendicular to the direction of the tank wall stress for which the
reinforcement is being investigated; for a round or elliptical opening, the critical plane shall pass through the center of the
opening; for an obround opening, it shall pass through the center of one of the semicircular ends if a transverse section of the
opening is being analyzed or coincides with the lengthwise centerline of the opening if a section in this direction is being
analyzed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_82>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5-48
API S TANDARD  620<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) For an opening in a cylindrical or conical surface or in a surface of some other shape where one of the principal biaxial
stresses is less than 75 % of the other, the critical plane shall be one that is parallel to the plane described in Item 1 for the shape
of opening involved but is located halfway between that plane and the edge of the opening (see Annex F).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.8.2  The strength of welds that attach the reinforcement shall be the strength in shear or tension depending on
the possible mode of failure of the weld. When either shear or tension stress may be considered, the computations
resulting in the lesser strength shall govern. Plug welds, wherever applicable, may be included in the strength of the
attachment welding in conformance with 5.24. The thickness of the nozzle wall after corrosion may be included in the
shear strength of the reinforcement attachment when the nozzle extends through the tank wall and is attached to it
with a weld within the tank wall thickness that is sufficient to develop its strength in shear, which may not require full
penetration through the tank wall. Some of the attachment welding may be placed outside the limits of the area of
reinforcement as defined in 5.16.3; although it is not credited as reinforcement, this welding may nevertheless be
counted as attachment welding if it qualifies in other respects. Lengths of curved fillet welds shall be determined on
the basis of their inner dimensions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.8.3  In addition to complying with the rules for attachment welding given in this standard, the following
requirements shall be met.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The joint efficiencies of butt-welds shall be in accordance with 5.23 except that no credit shall be taken for
radiographing unless the attachment welding itself can be and is properly radiographed. The strength of butt-
welds shall be computed on the area in shear, wherever applicable, or the area in tension using the following
stress values multiplied by the joint efficiency:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) when the load is perpendicular to the weld, the applicable tension or shear stress values for plate or forged steel
given in Table 5-1 or specified in 5.5.5;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) when the load is parallel to the weld, 75 % of the applicable tension or shear stress values for plates or forged
steel given in Table 5-1 or specified in 5.5.5;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) for combined perpendicular and parallel loadings around the openings, 87.5 % of the applicable tension or
shear stress values for plate or forged steel given in Table 5-1 or specified in 5.5.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The strength of fillet welds shall be computed by multiplying the area of the minimum section through the throat of
the weld by the applicable allowable stress value determined by combining the following factors: 80 % for shear
strength of weld metal; an efficiency factor of approximately 85 %; and a load factor of 100 % for perpendicular
loading, 75 % for parallel loading, or 87.5 % for combined perpendicular and parallel loading:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) when the load is perpendicular to the weld, 70 % of the applicable tension stress value for plate or forged steel
given in Table 5-1;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) when the load is parallel to the weld, 50 % of the applicable tension stress value for plate or forged steel given
in Table 5-1;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) for combined perpendicular and parallel loadings around openings, 60 % of the applicable tension stress value
for plate or forged steel given in Table 5-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.9 Minimum Dimensions of Attachment Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.9.1  Supplementing the requirements of 5.16.8, the dimensions of reinforcement attachment welds shall comply
with the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) where the thickness of the thinner of two parts being joined is  3 / 4  in. or less, exclusive of corrosion allowance, the
dimensions of the welds shall be not less than the requirements indicated in Figure 5-8;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

welds shall be not less than the requirements indicated in Figure 5-8 using a value of  3 / 4  in. for  t min .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.16.9.2  Fittings shown in Figure 5-8, Panels s-2, t-2, u-2, and v, that do not exceed 3 in. pipe size may be attached
by welds that are exempt from size requirements other than those required by 5.16.8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.9.3  For fittings attached as shown in Figure 5-8, Panel u-3, the depth of the groove weld,  t 5 , shall be not less
than the thickness of Schedule 160 pipe (see ASME B36.10M).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.16.10 Telltale Holes in Reinforcing Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Except for nozzles located on the underside of a tank bottom that rests directly on the tank grade  31  and nozzles with
reinforcements that are too narrow to permit compliance with the following provisions, single-thickness reinforcing
plates and saddle flanges or integral reinforcing pads on manholes or nozzles attached to the outside of a tank shall
be provided with at least one telltale hole with a maximum actual diameter of  3 / 8  in. that shall be tapped for a
preliminary compressed-air and solution-film test for soundness of attachment welds around the manhole or nozzle
and its reinforcement both inside and outside the tank. These telltale holes shall be left open when the tank is in
service. The surface of the reinforcing plate, saddle flange, or pad adjacent to the tank wall shall be relieved slightly
by grinding to be reasonably certain that the test pressure will extend entirely around the nozzle even though the
reinforcement may be drawn tightly against the tank wall by the welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.17 Reinforcement of Multiple Openings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.17.1  When either of the following conditions occurs for two or more adjacent openings, the opening shall be
provided with a combined reinforcement whose strength shall equal the combined strength of the reinforcement that
would be required by 5.16 for the separate openings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The distance between the centers of any two adjacent openings is less than two times their average diameter so
that their required areas of reinforcement overlap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Any two adjacent openings are spaced so that if they are reinforced separately, the distance between the outer
edges, or toes, of their reinforcing plate fillet welds (see Footnote 24) or insert welds is (1) less than 6 in. at any
point, or if this be larger, (2) eight times the nominal thickness of the fillet weld around the thicker reinforcing plate
or eight times the nominal thickness of the insert butt-weld  32  for an insert-type connection. In no case shall any
portion of a cross section be considered to apply to more than one opening, that is, to be evaluated more than
once in a combined area. Curved sections that form the outer boundary of a combined reinforcement shall be
connected by straight lines, large-radius reverse curves tangent to the curved sections, or a combination of these
two elements; in no case shall there be any re-entrant angles therein.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.17.2  When two or more adjacent openings will be provided with a combined reinforcement, the minimum distance
between the centers of any two of these openings shall preferably be at least 1.5 times their average diameter, and
the area of reinforcement between them shall be at least equal to 50 % of the total required for these two openings on
the cross section being considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.17.3  When two adjacent openings, as considered under 5.17.2, have a distance between centers less than 1 1 / 3
times their average diameter, no credit for reinforcement shall be given for any of the metal between these two
openings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>31  Even in this case, telltale holes should be provided and attachment welds should be tested before the bottom plates are placed
in position on the tank grade.
32  Where the periphery weld has been stress-relieved before the welding of the adjacent shell joint, the spacing may be reduced to
6 in. from the longitudinal or meridional joints or 3 in. from circumferential or latitudinal joint provided that in either case the
spacing is not less than 2 1 / 2  times the shell thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Large openings and reducers of the types illustrated in Figure 5-9, which are centrally located in the roof or bottom of
a tank with the axis of the connected cylindrical neck coincident with the axis of revolution of the tank, are not limited
as to size and need not be reinforced in accordance with 5.16 if the design of the neck extending from the opening or
reducer, the regions of the roof or bottom around the opening, and the transition section between the roof or bottom
and the neck meet all applicable requirement of 5.10 and the additional requirements specified in this section. In the
case of reducers, the design of the region where the large end meets cylindrical sidewalls shall conform to the
requirements of 5.12. A design procedure similar to that specified in 5.12 shall also be used for the region around the
large end of a conical transition section that connects to the horizontally disposed surfaces of a roof or bottom instead
of to the sidewalls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.18.2 Nomenclature<<HEADING_END>>

P v  is defined as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P v   is the maximum unbalanced pressure, in lbf/in. 2 , on the convex side of the plate during operation; however,
if the pressure is 15 lbf/in. 2  or less,  P v  shall be 15 lbf/in. 2  or 25 % more than the maximum possible
unbalanced pressure, whichever is the smaller.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum thickness shall be as calculated plus corrosion allowance or  1 / 2  in. plus corrosion allowance, whichever
is greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Moreover, if the net plate thickness,  t   –  c , determined previously in this paragraph, is found to be less than or equal to
0.01 times the inside diameter of the cover-plate flange, a check computation shall be made to determine the
thickness required by Equation (44). The plate shall be made not less than the thickness computed using the

<<HEADING level=3>>5.22 Permitted Types of Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.22.1 Definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.22.1.1  The information in 5.22.1.2 through 5.22.1.6 covers fusion-welded joints permitted by this standard. (See
Table 5-2 for limitations of joints.)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.22.1.2  Terms relating to weld joints shall be as defined in Section IX of the ASME  Code  and the following.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) An angle joint is one located between two members located in intersecting planes between zero (a butt joint) and
90° (a corner joint).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A slot weld is the same as a plug weld except that it is made through an elongated hole that has semicircular
ends. Fillet-welded holes should not be construed as a plug or slot weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.22.1.3  The reverse side of a double-welded butt joint shall be prepared by chipping, grinding, or melting-out to
ensure sound metal at the base of the weld metal first deposited before weld metal is applied from the reverse side.
This operation shall be done to ensure complete penetration and proper fusion in the final weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The proceeding requirements of this section are not intended to apply to any welding procedure by which proper fusion
and complete penetration are otherwise obtained and by which unacceptable defects at the base of the weld are avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.22.1.4  If the backing strips for single-welded joints are not removed, all ends of strips abutting (including a T-
junction) shall be joined with a full-penetration weld. A backing strip need not be removed after the weld is completed
unless the joint is to be radiographed and the backing-strip image would interfere with interpretation of the resultant
radiographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.22.1.5  Double and single lap-joints shall have full-fillet welds, the size of which is equal to the thinner member
joined. The surface overlap shall be not less than four times the thickness of the thinner plate, with a 1 in. minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.22.1.6  When full-penetration welds are specified for the circumferential joints of diametrical transitions, angle
joints 30 degrees or less meet this requirement. All other requirements for a butt-welded joint apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.22.2 Size of Weld<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.22.2.1 Groove Weld<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The size of a groove weld is determined by the joint penetration, which is the depth of chamfering plus the root
penetration when root penetration is specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.22.2.2 Fillet Weld<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.22.3  For equal-leg fillet welds, the leg length of the largest isosceles right triangle that can be inscribed within the
fillet-weld cross section determines the size of the weld. For unequal-leg fillet welds, the leg length of the largest right
triangle that can be inscribed within the fillet-weld cross section determines the size of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.22.4 Throat of a Fillet Weld<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The throat of a fillet weld is the shortest distance from the root of the fillet weld to its face. For a convex fillet weld, the
hypotenuse of the triangle which has the greatest area that can be inscribed within the fillet-weld cross section is
con sid ered the face.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.22.5 Heads Convex to Pressure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heads convex to pressure for the purpose of sealing manways may be attached to the manway neck using single full-
fillet lap joints without plugs in accordance with Figure 5-8, Panel w, and the limitations of Table 5-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.23 Welded Joint Efficiency<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.23.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The efficiency of a welded joint is a joint efficiency factor used in design computation or in computations that relate the
strengths of welded structures. The joint efficiency factor is based on the assumption that the welds may contain
defects within the limits permitted by these rules or may otherwise be of a quality somewhat below that of the parent
material. Permissible joint efficiency factors are given in Table 5-2, where the factor is expressed as a percent; in
computations it is expressed as a decimal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of butt-welded joints and full-fillet lap-welded joints, the joint efficiency factor is assumed to exist between
the working strength of the joint and the working strength of the solid plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of fillet welds evaluated as specified in 5.16.8.3, Item b, plug welds, and other attachment welding, the
joint efficiency factor is assumed to exist between the working strength of the area of weld involved in the
computations and the working strength of the same area of solid parent metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.23.2 Maximum Joint Efficiencies<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The maximum joint efficiencies permitted in the design of tanks or tank parts fabricated by an arc-welding process
and the limitations on the use of the various types of these joints are given in Table 5-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.23.3 Welded Pipe Joint Efficiencies<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The allowable unit tensile stress values given in Table 5-1 for welded steel pipe reflect a welded joint efficiency factor of
0.80 for the longitudinal joints in that material. No further reduction for joint efficiency needs to be made in those joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The low-pressure operating conditions for which these tanks are used will often make the thickness of pipe materials,
as determined by the cylindrical shell formula, of little significance; the girth joints that are subject to piping strains,
including even moderate temperature effects, may be the controlling factor. The joint efficiencies for such girth joints
shall be taken from Table 5-2, but in applying these efficiencies to the allowable stress values in Table 5-1 for welded
pipe, allowance may be made for the fact that the allowable values already reflect a joint efficiency factor of 0.80, as
stated in this paragraph.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.24 Plug Welds and Slot Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.24.1  Plug welds and slot welds may be used in conjunction with other forms of welds for joints in structural
attachments and in reinforcements around openings. They shall be sized and spaced properly to carry their portion of
the load but shall not in any case be considered to take more than 30 % of the total load to be transmitted by the joint
of which they form a part.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5. 24 .2  The diameter of plug-weld holes and the width of slot-weld holes in members whose thickness is  1 / 2  in. or
less shall be not less than  3 / 4  in.; for members more than  1 / 2  inches in thickness, the diameter, or width, of such holes
shall be not less than the thickness of the member through which the hole is cut plus  1 / 4  in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.24.3  Except as otherwise provided in 5.24.2, the diameter, or width, of the holes shall not exceed twice the
thickness of the member through which the hole is cut plus  1 / 4  in. In no case, however, does the dimension need to be
greater 2 1 / 4  in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_96>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5-62
API S TANDARD  620<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.24.4  Plug-weld and slot-weld holes shall be completely filled with weld metal when the thickness of the member
through which the hole is cut is  5 / 16  in. or less. For thicker members, the holes shall be filled to a depth of at least one-
half the thickness of the member or one-third the hole diameter, or width, whichever is greater, but in no case shall
they be filled less than  5 / 16  in. Fillet-welded holes are not considered to be plug welds or slot welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.24.5  The effective shearing area of plug welds shall be considered to be the area of a circle whose diameter is  1 / 4  in.
less than the diameter of the hole at the fraying surface. The effective shearing area of the semicircular ends of slot
welds shall be computed on a comparable basis, and the effective area between the centers of the semicircular ends
shall be taken as the product of the distance between such centers and a width that is  1 / 4  in. less than the width of the
slot at the fraying surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.25 Stress Relieving   33<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.25.1 Definition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stress-relief heat treatment is the uniform heating of a structure or portion of a structure to a sufficient temperature
below the critical range to relieve the major portion of the residual stresses, followed by uniform cooling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.25.2 Field Stress Relief<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A tank built according to the rules of this standard is not usually thermally field stress relieved after erection because
its size and weight do not permit adequate support at the temperature required for stress relieving. When a tank is not
to be field stress relieved, the field-welding procedure shall be one that (a) has been proven satisfactory by
experience or adequate experiments and (b) will minimize locked-up residual stresses, which are thought to be one of
the main causes of cracking in or adjacent to welds (see 6.19 and H.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.25.3 Wall Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank sections that have a nominal thickness of wall plate greater than 1 1 / 4  in. 34  at any nozzle or other welded
attachment and nozzle necks whose thickness at any welded joint therein exceeds ( D  + 50)/120 shall be thermally
stress relieved after welding. Thickness of compression rings as defined in 5.12 (examples shown in Figure 5-6) are
not considered in the determination of thermal stress relief requirements. In this formula diameters less than 20 in.
shall be assumed to be 20 in. When thermal stress relief cannot be applied to welded assemblies of these parts after
erection, all such assemblies, particularly around openings and support attachments, shall be made in the shop and
shall be thermally stress relieved before shipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.25.4 Fillet-weld Attachments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirement of 5.25.3 does not apply to fillet welds used for small nozzle or lug attachments when the welds have
a size that is a) no greater than  1 / 2  in. for welds on a flat surface or circumferential welds on a cylindrical or conical
surface or b) no greater than  3 / 8  in. for longitudinal welds on surfaces of the latter two shapes or for any welds on
surfaces that have double curvature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.26 Radiographic/Ultrasonic Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.26.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examination for the quality of butt welds where required by 5.26 shall be made using either the radiographic method
specified in 7.15.1 or alternatively, by agreement between the Purchaser and the Manufacturer, using ultrasonic<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>33  Any proposed application of stress-relieving requirements and the procedures to be followed in each case should be agreed
upon by the Purchaser and the Manufacturer. Peening may be done if it is part of the welding procedure and is approved by the
Purchaser (see 6.7 and 6.10).
34  For P-1 materials, the 1 1 / 4  in. thickness may be increased to 1 1 / 2  in., provided that a minimum preheat temperature of 200 ° F is
maintained during welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>examination in lieu of radiography as specified in 7.15.3.1. When the term “examination” is used in 5.26, it shall be
understood to refer to radiographic or ultrasonic examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Ultrasonic testing (UT) and radiography (RT) are complementary methods. UT can detect some types of flaws better
than RT and vice versa. Therefore, the acceptance criteria provided in API 620 for the two methods differ. In the case of RT, all
weld flaws require characterization as their type (e.g., crack, incomplete fusion, rounded indication, etc.) and acceptance criteria
vary according to the characterization. RT acceptance criteria in API 620 are based on definitions of good workmanship. In the
case of UT, flaw characterization by type or shape is not required (except for results of supplemental MT/PT). Rather the sizing of
both the length and height of flaws is emphasized. The UT acceptance criteria provided in Annex U are based on fracture
mechanics and assume that any flaw may have crack-like characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.26.2 Definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiography is the process of passing electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays or Gamma rays through an object
and obtaining a record of its soundness upon a sensitized film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic examination is a method of detecting imperfections in material by passing ultrasonic waves through the
material and interpreting the reflected and/or diffracted waves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.26.3 Examination Required by Wall Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Complete examination is required for all butt joints having complete penetration and complete fusion wherever the
thinner of the plates or the tank-wall thicknesses at the joint exceed 1 1 / 4  in. and the joint is subjected to tension stress
greater than 0.1 times the specified minimum tensile strength of the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.26.4 Examination Required for Joint Efficiency<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.26.4.1  The increased joint efficiency allowed in Table 5-2 for completely radiographed joints in a tank or tank
sections may be used in the design calculations if the conditions described in 5.26.4.2 and 5.26.4.3 are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.26.4.2  Main joints (all longitudinal and circumferential joints in the tank wall or meridional and latitudinal joints in
walls of double curvature) are of the butt-welded type except for nozzle, manhole, and support attachment welds to
the tank wall, which need not be of the butt-welded type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.26.4.3  All butt-welded joints described in 5.26.4.2 are examined throughout their length, as prescribed in 7.15,
except under the following conditions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When parts of tanks do not require complete examination (see 5.26.3). In this case, circumferential joints in
cylindrical or conical surfaces need to be prepared and examined for a distance of only 3 in. on each side of any
intersection with a longitudinal joint. All joints in a spherical, torispherical, or ellipsoidal shape or in any other
surface of double curvature shall be considered longitudinal joints. For similar reasons, the juncture without a
knuckle between a conical or dished roof or bottom, and cylindrical sidewalls and the circumferential joints without
a knuckle at either or both ends of a transition section shown in Figure 5-9 shall be examined if the adjacent
longitudinal joints are to receive credit for being radiographed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) When welded butt joints in nozzle necks do not require complete examination (see 5.26.3). This provision applies
to their fabrication and is not necessarily the form of attachment to the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.26.5 Insert Style Shell Openings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When shell openings (nozzles, manways, flush-type nozzles and flush-type cleanout doors) are installed using an
insert style detail, the butt-weld joint around the periphery of the insert plate shall be examined as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For an insert plate that does not extend over the full height of a shell course, the butt-welded joint around the
periphery of an insert plate shall be fully examined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_98>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5-64
API S TANDARD  620<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) For an insert plate that extends over the full height of a shell course, the butt-welded joints of the insert plate shall
be examined to the extent required of main joints (longitudinal and circumferential joints in the tank wall or
meridional and latitudinal joints in walls of double curvature) for other plates in the same course.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.26.6 Exemptions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spot or full examination is not mandatory on tank bottoms that are uniformly supported throughout (for example,
concrete slab or compacted sand) or on components that are not subject to tension stresses greater than 0.1 times
the minimum tensile strength of the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.27.1 Cylindrical-sidewall, Flat-bottom Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.27.1.1  A low-pressure tank of this configuration may have flush-type connections at the lower edge of the shell.
These connections can be made flush with the flat bottom under the conditions described 5.27.1.2 through 5.27.1.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.27.1.2  The design pressure for the gas vapor space of the tank shall not exceed 2 lbf/in. 2  gauge.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.27.1.3  The sidewall uplift from the internal design and test pressures, wind, and earthquake loads shall be
counteracted, as noted in 5.11.2, in such a manner that no uplift will occur at the cylindrical sidewall, flat-bottom junction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.27.1.4  The longitudinal or meridional membrane stress in the cylindrical sidewall at the top of the opening for the
flush-type connection shall not exceed  1 / 10  of the circumferential design stress in the lowest sidewall course that
contains the opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.27.2 Dimensions and Details<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>sidewall, the transition piece, and the bottom reinforcing plate shall meet the impact test requirements of 4.2.5 at
design metal temperatures for the respective thickness involved. Notch toughness evaluation for the bolting flange
and the nozzle neck attached to the bolting flange shall be based on the governing thickness as defined in 4.3.6.3 and
used in Figure 4-2. Additionally, the yield strength and tensile strength of the sidewall plate in the flush-type shell
connection and the sidewall reinforcing plate shall be equal to or greater than the yield strength and tensile strength of
the adjacent sidewall of the lowest shell course plate material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.27.6 Connection Transition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nozzle transition between the flush connection in the shell and the circular pipe flange shall be designed in a
manner consistent with the rules given in this standard. Where the rules do not cover all details of design and
construction, the Manufacturer shall provide details of design and construction that will be as safe as those provided
by the rules of this standard (see 5.1.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.27.7 Anchorage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where anchoring devices are used to resist the sidewall uplift, they shall be spaced so that they will be located
immediately adjacent to each side of the reinforcing plates around the opening, while still providing the required
anchorage for the tank sidewall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.27.8 Allowance for Sidewall or Piping Movement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adequate provision shall be made for free movement of connected piping to minimize thrusts and moments applied to
the sidewall connection. Allowance shall be made for the rotation of the sidewall connection caused by the restraint of
the tank bottom to the sidewall expansion from stress and temperature as well as for thermal and elastic movement of
the piping. In double-wall tanks, any insulation or other material shall not restrain or tend to increase the movement of
the sidewall connection. The rotation of the sidewall connection is illustrated in Figure 5-14.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.27.9 Foundation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The foundation in the area of a flush-type connection shall be prepared to support the bottom reinforcing plate of the
connection. The foundation for a tank that rests on a concrete ringwall shall provide a uniform support for the bottom
r e inforcing plate as well as the remaining bottom plate under the tank sidewall. Different methods of supporting the
bo ttom reinforcing plate under a flush-type connection are shown in Figure 5-14.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.27.10 Nozzle Spacing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flush-type connections may be installed using a common reinforcing pad. However, when this type of construction is
employed, the minimum distance between nozzle centerlines shall be not less than 1.5( b 1  +  b 2  + 2.5) in. or 2 ft,
whichever is greater. The dimensions  b 1  and  b 2  shall be obtained from Table 5-10, Column 3, for the respective
nominal flange sizes. Adjacent sidewall flush-type connections that do not share a common reinforcing plate shall
have at least a 36 in. clearance between adjacent edges of their reinforcing pads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.27.11 Weld Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All longitudinal butt-welds in the nozzle neck and transition piece if any, and the first circumferential butt-weld in the
neck closest to sidewall, excluding neck to flange weld shall receive 100% radiographic examination. The nozzle-to-
tank sidewall and reinforcing plate welds and the sidewall-to-bottom reinforcing plate welds shall be examined their
entire length using magnetic-particle examination. This magnetic-particle examination shall be performed on the root
pass, on every  1 / 2  in. of deposited weld metal while the weld is being made, and on the completed weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>SECTION 6—FABRICATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section covers details in fabrication practices that are considered essential in constructing large, welded tanks
designed according to the rules in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Workmanship<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  All work of fabricating API 620 tanks shall be done in accordance with this standard and with the permissible
alternatives specified in the Purchaser’s inquiry or order. The workmanship and finish shall be first class in every
respect and subject to the closest inspection by the Manufacturer’s inspector, whether or not the Purchaser waives
any part of the inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2  When material requires straightening, the work shall be done by pressing or another non injurious method
prior to any layout or shaping. Heating or hammering is not permissible unless the material is heated to a forging
temperature during straightening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Cutting Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1  Plates, edges of heads, and other parts may be cut to shape and size by mechanical means such as
machining, shearing, and grinding or by gas or arc cutting. After gas or arc cutting, all slag and detrimental
discoloration of material that has been molten shall be removed by mechanical means before further fabrication or
use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2  All holes made in the tank wall, the edges of which are not to be fused by welds, should preferably be tool-cut.
If openings are manually flame-cut, the edges to remain unwelded shall be tool-cut or ground smooth (see Figure 5-8
for finish of unwelded exposed edges).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Forming Sidewall Sections and Roof and Bottom Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.1 Cylindrical Side Wall Sections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 6-1 for steel tanks and Figure 6-2 for aluminum tanks provide criteria for shaping of cylindrical sidewalls to the
curvature of the tank prior to installation in the tank. Shaping of plates concurrently with installation in the tank shell is
permitted if the diameter exceeds the limits in Figure 6-1 (for steel tanks) and Figure 6-2 (for aluminum tanks) or if the
Manufacturer’s alternate procedure for any diameter has been accepted by the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.2 Roof and Bottom Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If curved, roof and bottom plates shall be formed to the required shape by any process that will not unduly impair the
mechanical properties of the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5 Dimensional Tolerances<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank walls subject to membrane stresses that are more than  1 / 3  of the allowable design stress under service
conditions shall conform to the tolerances described in 6.5.2 through 6.5.6. The number and frequency of
measurements are left to the judgement of the Manufacturer in order to produce an acceptable tank. Outer walls of
d ouble-wall tanks (see Annex Q and Annex R) that contain insulation and are not in contact with the design liquid are
excluded. These tolerances may be waived or modified by agreement between the Purchaser and the Manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.7.4  The stress-relieving requirements in the procedures to be followed in each case should be agreed upon
between the Manufacturer and the Purchaser. Peening may be done if it is part of the welding procedure and is
approved by the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.8 Qualification of Welders<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.8.1  All welders assigned to manual or semi-automatic arc welding, and welding operators assigned to machine
welding, shall have successfully passed the tests conducted by the fabricator, or Manufacturer, as prescribed for
welder qualification in Section IX of the  ASME   Code . Tests conducted by one Manufacturer shall not qualify a welder
or welding operator to do work for any other Manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.8.2  The Manufacturer shall assign each welder or welding operator an identifying number, letter, or symbol.
Except for all lap-welded roof seams and flange-to-neck joints, this identifying mark shall be stamped, either by hand
or machine, on all tanks adjacent to and at intervals of not more than 3 ft along the welds made by a welder or welding
operator; alternatively, the Manufacturer may keep a record of welders employed on each joint and shell-opening joint
and omit the stamping. If such a record is kept, it shall be maintained until tests are completed and shall be available
to the inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.8.3  The Manufacturer shall maintain a record of the welders employed, showing the date and result of tests and
the identification mark assigned to each. These records shall be certified by the Manufacturer and shall be accessible
to the inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.9 Matching Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.9.1  The plates that are being welded shall be accurately matched and retained in position during the welding
operation. Tack welds may be used to hold the plate edges in line if the requirements of 6.9.1.1 through 6.9.1.4 are
followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.9.1.1  The tack welds in butt joints to be welded manually are removed before welding.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.9.1.2  The tack welds in butt joints to be machine welded by a process that will re-melt the tack welds shall be
thoroughly cleaned of all welding slag and examined for soundness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.9.1.3  Tack welds in lap and fillet welded joints need not be removed if they are sound and the subsequently
applied weld beads are thoroughly fused into the tack welds.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6-6
API S TANDARD  620<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.9.1.4  Tack welds, whether removed or left in place, shall be made using a fillet-weld or butt-weld procedure
qualified in accordance with Section IX of the  ASME   Code . Tack welds to be left in place shall be made by welders
qualified in accordance with Section IX of the  ASME Code  and shall be examined visually for defects; if welds are
found to be defective, they shall be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.9.2  During assembly of the plates and subject to agreement between the Manufacturer and the Purchaser, the
welded joints in adjoining segments, which abut at a common transverse joint from opposite sides, need not be
staggered unless specified by the Purchaser. When specified, the stagger should be at least five times the plate
thickness of the thicker course.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.10 Cleaning Surfaces to be Welded<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.10.1  Immediately before any welding operation, the surface to be welded or to which weld metal is to be applied
shall be cleaned thoroughly of all scale, slag, grease, and any oxide that would lower the quality of the deposited weld
metal. A light oxide film resulting from flame cutting is not considered detrimental.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.10.2  On all multilayer welding, each layer of weld metal shall be cleaned of slag and other deposits before the next
layer is applied.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.10.3  The reverse side of double welded butt joints shall be prepared by chipping, grinding, or melting out to
ensure sound metal at the base of the weld metal first deposited before weld metal is applied from the reverse side.
This operation shall be done to ensure complete penetration and proper fusion in the final weld. When melting out is
done, particular care shall be exercised to prevent contamination of the melted area by foreign materials, especially
carbon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The proceeding requirements of this section are not intended to apply to any welding procedure by which proper fusion
and complete penetration are otherwise obtained and by which unacceptable defects at the base of the weld are avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.10.4  Cast steel surfaces to be welded must first be machined or chipped to remove foundry scale and to expose
sound metal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.11 Weather Conditions for Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No welding of any kind shall be done (a) when the surfaces to be welded are wet from rain, snow, or ice, (b) when rain
or snow is falling on such surfaces, or (c) during periods of high winds, unless the welder and work are properly
shielded. Preheat shall be applied when the metal temperature is below the temperature required by Table 6-2. In that
case the base metal shall be heated to at least the temperature indicated in Table 6-2 within 3 in. of the place where
welding is to be started and maintained 3 in. ahead of the arc. Material P-Numbers and Groups shall be as
designated in ASME IX, Table QW-422 or in API 620, 6.7.2 for materials not listed in Table QW-422.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.12.1  Butt joints shall have complete joint penetration and complete fusion for the full length of the weld and shall
be free from undercuts, overlaps, or abrupt ridges or valleys. To ensure that the weld grooves are completely filled so
that the surface of the weld metal at any point does not fall below the surface of the adjoining plate, weld metal may
be built up as reinforcement on each side of the plate. The thickness of the reinforcement on each side of the plate
shall not exceed the thickness listed in Table 6-3, but the reinforcement need not be removed except when it exceeds
the permissible thickness or when required in 7.15.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.12.2  When a single-welded butt joint is made by using a backing strip that is left in place (see Table 5-2), the
requirement for reinforcement applies to only the side opposite the backing strip.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.13 Merging Weld With Plate Surface<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The edges of the weld shall merge smoothly with the surface of the plate without a sharp angle. Maximum permissible
weld undercut is  1 / 64  in. for longitudinal or meridional butt joints, similarly oriented permanent attachments,
attachment welds for nozzles, manholds, flush-type openings, and the inside shell-to-flat bottom welds. For
circumferential and latitudinal butt joints, similarly oriented permanent attachments, and annular ring butt joints, the
maximum permissible undercutting is  1 / 32  in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.14 Aligning of Main Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Particular care shall be taken in matching up the edges of all plates within the tolerances of offset as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) for plates  1 / 4  inch in thickness and less,  1 / 16  in.;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) for plates over  1 / 4  inch in thickness, 25 % of the plate thickness or  1 / 8  in., whichever is smaller.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.15 Repairing Defects in Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Defects in welds shall be chipped, melted out, or machined out until sound metal is reached on all sides. Subject to
the approval of the inspector, the resulting cavity shall be filled with the weld metal and retested<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.16 Matching Plates of Unequal Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For plates over  1 / 2 -in. thick in the sidewalls, roof, or bottom of a tank, if the thickness of two adjacent plates that are
to be butt-welded together differ by more than  1 / 8  in., the thicker plate shall be trimmed to a smooth taper that
extends for a distance at least four times the offset between the abutting surfaces so that the adjoining edges will
be of approximately the same thickness. The length of the required taper may include the width of the weld (see

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.18.2  Parts of a tank that require stress relief according to the rules in 5.25 shall be stress relieved in an enclosed
furnace before shipment from the fabricators’ shops. The procedure used shall be as outlined in 6.18.2.1 through
6.18.2.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.18.2.1  The temperature of the furnace shall not exceed 600 °F at the time the part or section of the tank is placed
in it.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.18.2.2  The rate of heating in excess of 600 °F shall be not more than 400 °F per hour divided by the maximum
metal thickness, in   inches, of the wall plate being heated, but in no case shall it be more than 400 °F per hour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.18.2.3  During the heating period, the temperature throughout the portion of the tank being heated shall not vary
more than 250 °F within any 15-ft interval of length and when at the hold temperature not more than 150 °F
throughout the portion of the tank being heated. A minimum temperature of 1100 °F (except as permitted in 6.18.2.5)
shall be maintained for a period of one hour per in. of metal thickness (maximum metal thickness of the tank wall
plates affected). During the heating and holding periods, the furnace atmosphere shall be controlled to avoid
excessive oxidation of the surface of the material being treated. The furnace shall be designed to prevent direct
impingement of the flame on the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.18.2.4  At temperatures over 600 °F, cooling shall be done in a closed furnace or cooling chamber at a rate not
greater than 500 °F per hour divided by the maximum metal thickness, in   in. of the plates affected; in no case shall the
rate be more than 500 °F per hour. At temperatures of 600 °F and below, the material may be cooled in still air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.18.2.5  When stress relieving at a temperature of 1100 °F is impracticable, it is permissible to carry out the stress-
relieving operation at lower temperatures for longer time periods in accordance with Table 6-4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.19 Peening Field Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.19.1  A tank fabricated according to these rules that is too large to be completely assembled and welded in a shop
may be transported in sections and assembled in the field. Welds made after assembly in the field may require a
special welding procedure in accordance with 5.25, and mechanical peening as described in Annex I may then be
used on the field welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.19.2  Peening of welds is not considered as effective as thermal stress relief and is not to be substituted for
thermal stress relief where the thermal stress relief is mandatory under the provision of 5.25.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>35  Gaps of this kind may require removal of part of the adjoining plate to give proper widths. Full consideration should be given to
radiographic and magnetic-particle methods of examination as well as to the thermal stress relief or peening of these welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

examined in longitudinal or meridional joints and in equivalent circumferential or latitudinal joints as defined in Table 5-
2, Note 5, shall conform to the requirements of 7.17.3.2 through 7.17.3.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.17.3.2  At least one spot shall be examined from the first 10 ft of completed joint of each type and thickness  36<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>welded by each welder or welding operator. Thereafter, without regard to the number of welders or welding operators
involved, one additional spot shall be examined for each additional 50 ft—or remaining fractional part of this length—
of each type and thickness of welded longitudinal, meridional, or equivalent joint subject to examination. The
inspector shall designate the locations of all spots that are to be examined, of which at least 25 % of the selected
spots shall be at junctions of meridional and latitudinal joints with a minimum of two such intersections per tank (see
7.15.6.2), both under the foregoing provisions and the provisions of 7.17.3.4. Such spots need not have any regularity
of spacing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.17.3.3  If more than one welding procedure is used or if more than one welder or welding operator does the
welding, at least one spot shall be examined for each procedure and for each welder or welding operator. Any spot
examined may coincidentally represent one procedure, one welder or welding operator, and one interval of 50 ft of
joint length. The same welder or welding operator may or may not weld both sides of the same butt joints; therefore, it
is permissible to test the work of two welders or welding operators with one spot examination if they weld opposite
sides of the same butt joint. When a spot of this type is rejected, further tests shall determine whether one or both
welders or welding operators were at fault.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.17.3.4  Whenever spot examination is required for circumferential or latitudinal joints other than those considered
in 7.17.3.2 and 7.17.3.3, one spot shall be examined from the first 10 ft of completed joint of each type and thickness
(see Footnote 36) welded by each welder or welding operator if not already done on other joints for the same welder
or welding operator on the same structure. Thereafter, without regard to the number of welders or welding operators
working, one additional spot shall be examined in each additional 100 ft (approximately) and any remaining fraction
thereof of each type and thickness of welded circumferential or latitudinal joints of the kind considered in 7.17.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>36  This is based on the thickness of the thinner plate at the joint. For the purpose of this application, plates shall be considered of
the same thickness when the difference in the specified or design thickness does not exceed  1 / 8  in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.17.4 Spot-examination Retests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.17.4.1  When a spot has been examined at any location selected in accordance with 7.17.2 and the welding does
not comply with the standards prescribed in 7.15.1.3 for radiographic examination, or Annex U for ultrasonic
examination, two additional spots shall be examined in the same seam at locations to be selected by the inspector—
one on each side of the original spot—to determine the limits of the potentially deficient welding. If any welding is
found at either spot that fails to comply with the minimum quality requirements in 7.15.1.3 radiographic examination,
or Annex U for ultrasonic examination, additional spots nearby shall be examined until the limits of unacceptable
welding are determined. In addition, the inspector may require that an additional spot be examined at one location
selected by the inspector in each seam not previously examined on which the same operator has welded. If any
additional spot fails to comply with the minimum quality requirements, the limits of unacceptable welding shall be
determined as in the original examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.17.4.2  All welding within the limit for spot examination found to be below the standards required in 7.15.1.3 for
radiographic examination, or Annex U for ultrasonic examination, shall be rejected. The rejected weld shall be
removed and the joint shall be rewelded, or at the Manufacturer’s option, the entire unit of weld represented shall be
completely examined and only the defective welding need be corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18 Standard Hydrostatic and Pneumatic Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After erection is completed and stress relieving, radiographic examinations, or other similar operations, as may be
required, are performed, each tank shall satisfactorily pass a series of hydrostatic and pneumatic tests as prescribed
in 7.18.2 through 7.18.6. Whenever a solution film is specified in this section to be applied to welding, linseed oil or
another equivalent material for disclosing air leakage may be substituted. In freezing weather, linseed oil or a similarly
suitable material shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.2 Test Preliminaries<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.2.1  Before water is introduced into the tank, the preliminary operations described in 7.18.2.2 through 7.18.2.6
shall be performed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.2.2  The attachment welding around all openings and their reinforcements in the walls of the tank shall be
examined by the magnetic-particle method both inside and outside the tank. When the underside of a tank bottom
rests directly on the tank grade (and is not accessible after erection), such examination of welding on the underside of
the bottom and subsequent air testing may be omitted. However, such examination and testing of any openings in the
bottom plates shall be done before these plates are placed in position on the tank grade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.2.3  Following the examination specified in 7.18.2.2, air at a pressure of 15 lbf/in. 2  gauge (or, if the parts
involved cannot safely withstand this pressure, as near this pressure as the parts should safely withstand) shall be
introduced between the tank wall and the reinforcing plate, saddle flange, or integral reinforcing pad on each opening,
using the telltale holes specified in 5.16.10. While each space is subject to the pressure, a solution film shall be
applied to all attachment welding around the reinforcement, both inside and outside the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.2.4  In cases in which the bottom of the tank rests directly on the tank grade (preventing access to the
underside of the bottom of the tank), all joints between the bottom plates shall be tested on the inside of the tank by
applying a solution film to the joints and pulling a partial vacuum of at least 3 lbf/in. 2  gauge by means of a vacuum box
with a transparent top. As an alternate to vacuum box testing, a suitable tracer gas and compatible detector can be
used to test the integrity of welded bottom joints for their entire length if an appropriate tracer gas testing procedure
has been reviewed and approved by the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.2.5  Tanks with anchors shall be grouted (if required by design) and anchor retainers shall be attached.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.2.6  After all the welding has been examined and tested and all defective welding disclosed by such
examination and testing has been repaired and retested, the tank shall be filled with air to a pressure of 2 lbf/in. 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>gauge or one-half the pressure  P g  for which the vapor space at the top of the tank is designed, whichever pressure is
smaller. A solution film shall be applied to all joints in the tank wall above the high liquid (capacity) design level. If any
leaks appear, the defects shall be removed and rewelded, and the applicable preliminary tightness tests specified
shall be repeated. When anchors are not provided near the boundary of contact to hold down a dished tank bottom
resting directly on the tank grade, the bottom at this boundary may be rise slightly off the foundation during the
tightness test when air pressure is in the tank. In this case, sand shall be tamped firmly under the bottom to fill the gap
formed while the tank is under pressure (see 7.18.8).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.3 Combination Hydrostatic-pneumatic Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.3.1  Tanks that have not been designed to be filled with liquid to a test level higher than their specified capacity
level (see 5.3.1.2) shall be subjected to combination hydrostatic-pneumatic pressure tests in accordance with the
procedure described in 7.18.3.2 through 7.18.3.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.3.2  After the preliminary tightness tests specified in 7.18.2 have been completed, the pressure-vacuum relief
valve or valves shall be blinded off. With the top vented to the atmosphere to prevent accumulation of pressure, the
tank shall be filled with water to its high liquid (capacity) design level (see 7.18.7). Tank anchor retainers shall be
adjusted to a uniform tightness after the tank is filled with water. If the pressure-vacuum valve or valves are not
available at the time of the test, the tank connections may be blinded off and the test procedure continued by
agreement between the Purchaser and the Manufacturer. With the vents at the top of the tank closed, air shall be
injected slowly into the top of the tank until the pressure in the vapor space is about one-half the pressure  P g , for
which this space is designed. The air pressure shall be increased slowly until the pressure in the vapor space is 1.25
times the pressure,  P g , for which the space is designed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.3.3  An air test introduces some hazard. In view of the large amount of air that will be present in the tank during
this test, no one should be permitted to go near the tank while pressure is being applied for the first time during this
test. While the pressure in the tank exceeds the pressure for which the vapor space is designed, the inspections
should be made at a reasonable distance from the tank using field glasses as required for close-up observation of
particular areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.3.4  As the pressure is being increased, the tank shall be inspected for signs of distress. The maximum test
pressure of 1.25 times the vapor space design pressure shall be held for at least one hour, after which the pressure
shall be released slowly and the blinds shall be removed from the pressure-vacuum relief valves. The operation of the
relief valves shall then be checked by injecting air into the top of the tank until the pressure in the vapor space equals
the pressure,  P g , for which this space is designed, at which time the relief valves shall start to release air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.3.5  While this latter pressure is held, a solution film shall be applied to all of the welding involved above the
high liquid (capacity) design level for which the tank is designed. A prior vacuum box check may be substituted for the
close visual with solution-film examination. The solution-film examination shall still be made, above the liquid level, on
all welds around openings, all piping joints, and the compression ring welds to the roof and shell, except the prior
vacuum box is permitted for any listed below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Continuous double lap roof to compression ring welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Shell to compression ring welds, continuous inside and outside, and applying a thickened upper shell ring detail

<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.4 Complete Hydrostatic Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.4.1  Tanks that have been designed and constructed to be filled with liquid to the top of the roof (see 5.3.1.2)
shall be subjected to full hydrostatic tests in accordance with the procedure prescribed in 7.18.4.2 and 7.18.4.4, in lieu
of the procedure specified in 7.18.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.4.2  Following the test preliminaries called for in 7.18.2, the pressure-vacuum relief valve or valves shall be
blinded off; with the top of the tank vented to the atmosphere, the tank shall be filled with water to the top of the roof
(see 7.18.7) while allowing all air to escape to prevent the accumulation of pressure. If the pressure-vacuum relief
valve or valves are not available at the time of the test, the tank connections may be blinded off and the test
procedure continued by agreement between the Purchaser and the Manufacturer. The vents used during water filling
of the tank shall then be closed, and the pressure in the tank shall be increased slowly until the hydrostatic pressure
under the topmost point in the roof is 1.25 times the pressure,  P g , which the vapor space is designed to withstand
when in operation with the tank filled to its specified high liquid (capacity) level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.4.3  This test procedure shall be held for at least one hour. The hydrostatic pressure under the topmost point in
the roof shall then be reduced to the pressure,  P g , for which the vapor space is designed and shall be held at this level
for a sufficient time to permit close visual inspection of all joints in the walls of the tank and all welding around
manways, nozzles and other connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.4.4  The tank shall then be vented to atmosphere, the water level shall be lowered below the inlets to the
pressure-relief valves, and the blinds shall be removed from the relief valves. The operation of the relief valves shall
then be checked by injecting air into the top of the tank until the pressure in the vapor space equals the pressure,  P g ,
for which this space is designed, at which time the relief valves shall start to release air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.5 Partial-vacuum Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.5.1  Following the tests specified in 7.18.3 (or in 7.18.4) where this latter procedure has been used), the
pressure in the vapor space of the tank shall be released and a manometer shall be connected to this space. The
ability of the upper part of the tank to withstand the partial vacuum for which it is designed and the operation of the
vacuum-relief valve or valves on the tank shall then be checked by withdrawing water from the tank, with all vents
closed, until the design partial vacuum is developed at the top of the tank and by observing the differential pressure at
which the valve or valves start to open. The vacuum-relief valve or valves must be of a size and be set to open at a
partial vacuum closer to the external atmospheric pressure than the partial vacuum for which the tank is designed.
The partial vacuum in the tank should never exceed the design value (see Annex K).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.5.2  After completing 7.18.5.1, the withdrawal of water from the tank shall be continued, with the vents closed
and without exceeding the specified maximum partial vacuum in the top of the tank, until the level in the tank reaches
one-half the high liquid (capacity) level for which the tank is designed. Alternatively, to speed up the withdrawal of
water to the degree thought expedient, the vents may either be kept closed and air pressure not exceeding  P g  at the
top of the tank applied, or the vents may be opened during most of this interval if in either procedure they are closed
long enough before the level in the tank reaches half height for the specified partial vacuum to be developed by the
time the level of the water reaches half height. 37  Air shall then be again injected into the tank until the pressure above
the water level equals the pressure,  P g , for which the vapor space at the top of the tank is designed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.5.3  Careful observation shall be made under all of the specified conditions of loading, as well as with
atmospheric pressure above the surface of the water when the level is at half height, to determine whether any
appreciable changes occur in the shape of the tank (see 7.18.8). In the case of a vertical tank with cylindrical<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>37  These provisions presuppose that an ejector or vacuum pump is not available for drawing a partial vacuum on the tank.
However, if such equipment is available, it may be used; vents may be opened during the entire period while the water level is
being lowered; and the sequence of the vacuum and pressure test may be reversed if either the tank Manufacturer or the
Purchaser so selects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>sidewalls, no tests are required with the water level at half height; in this case, the tests specified in 7.18.5.4 shall be
applied immediately after the first vacuum test specified in 7.18.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.18.5.4  The water remaining in the tank shall then be withdrawn and when the tank is substantially empty, a
vacuum test comparable to that specified in 7.18.5.1, except with regard to the level of water in tank, shall be applied
to the tank. After this, air shall again be injected into the tank until the pressure in the tank equals the pressure,  P g , for
which the vapor space at the top of the tank is designed. Observations shall be made, both with the specified partial
vacuum and with the vapor space design pressure above the surface of the water, to determine whether any
appreciable changes in the shape of the tank occur under either condition of loading. In the case of a tank whose
dished bottom rests directly on the tank grade, if the bottom rises slightly off the foundation during the pressure test,
sand shall be tamped firmly under the bottom to fill the gap formed while the tank is under pressure (see 7.18.2.6 and
7.18.8).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.6 Visual Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Upon completion of all the foregoing tests, the pressure in the tank shall be released and a thorough visual inspection
shall be made of both the inside and outside of the tank, giving particular attention to all internal ties, braces, trusses,
and their attachments to the walls of the tank. Anchors shall be checked for snug tightness and adjusted if required.
Anchor threads shall be fouled by peening or tack welding to prevent loosening. In lieu of thread fouling, double nuts
may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.7 Rate of Water Filling and Water Temperature<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rate at which water is introduced into a tank for a hydrostatic test shall not exceed 3 ft of depth per hour. The
foundation, venting equipment, or other conditions may limit the water filling to a lower rate. Pressure shall not be
applied above the surface of the water before the tank and its contents are at about the same temperature. The
temperature of the water used in the tests should be not less than 60 °F whenever practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.8 Changes in Tank Shape<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If in any of the foregoing tests there is an excessive rise of the bottom of the tank around the boundary of contact with
grade, or off its foundations, or if any of the specified conditions of test loading cause other appreciable changes in
the shape of the tank, the design shall be reviewed and means shall be provided in the tank for holding the shape
within permissible limits under all conditions of loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 .18.9 Additional Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tests prescribed in 7.18 are believed to be sufficient for most tanks constructed according to these rules; if, in the
opinion of the designer, additional tests are needed to investigate the safety of a tank under certain other conditions of
loading, as determined from the design computations, these tests shall be made on the tank involved in addition to
the tests specified in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.18.10 Tanks Subject to Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of tanks that are subject to corrosion on some or all of their wall plates or on internal ties, braces, or other
members that carry pressure-imposed loads, the test specified in 7.18.3 (or the test specified in 7.18.4, if applicable)
should be repeated periodically during the lives of the tanks as the metal added for corrosion allowance disappears.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.19 Proof Tests for Establishing Allowable Working Pressures<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.19.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because pressures in liquid storage tanks built according to these rules vary quite markedly from the tops to the
bottoms of the tanks, proof testing of these tanks presents problems not usually encountered in the construction of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_126>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7-12
API S TANDARD  620<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>unfired pressure vessels–especially where the parts under investigation are located near the bottoms of the tanks.
The principal difficulty is devising a test or series of tests that will reliably establish the working pressure that can be
permitted on the part of the unproven design without, at the same time, imposing hazardous conditions on other parts
located at higher levels in the tank. Another possible complication is that, because of the large volumetric capacities
of these tanks, it may not be practicable to completely remove all pressure loading from the part under investigation in
order to obtain strain-gauge readings under no-load conditions after successive increments of pressure have been
applied in the test procedure. Also, in the case of tanks designed for storing only gases or vapors, water cannot be
used as a testing medium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.19.2 Use of Design Rules<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design rules and formulas given in the design section of these rules will be found to cover all of the more common
designs of vertical tanks, shapes of openings, and so forth. The absence of a standard proof-test procedure will not
greatly affect the usefulness of these rules. Whether a standard proof-test procedure can be devised that will be
applicable to all shapes, sizes and types of tanks that might be constructed under these rules is not known, but it is
recognized that in special cases a Manufacturer may be able to propose a proof-test procedure that would be
satisfactory for a particular tank (see 7.19.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.19.3 Developing Proof Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.19.3.1  Pending development of an approved standard proof-test procedure, whenever a Manufacturer desires to
construct a tank that will be marked as specified in 8.1 and embodies any features that should be proof-tested
because of the provisions of 5.1.5 and 5.13.5.3 or any other provisions of these rules that call for proof test or strain-
gauge surveys, the Manufacturer shall develop specifications for an appropriate proof-test procedure for the tank and
obtain approval from the Purchaser or the Purchaser’s agent, preferably before starting fabrication of the tank. Such
specifications shall cover all important details of the proposed proof-test procedure, including but not necessarily
limited to a description of how the tank would be prepared for the test, how the test loadings would be applied, what
medium would be used for the test, the increments in which the loadings would be applied, what kind of data would be
taken, how the test results would be interpreted, and the basis upon which allowable working pressures would be
established for the part or parts under investigation. In seeking approval of such a test, the Manufacturer shall furnish
full information concerning the general construction of the proposed tank, the design and location of the part or parts
of uncertain strength, the conditions of loading to which the tank would be subjected in service, and other pertinent
matters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.19.3.2  In case the Purchaser or the Purchaser’s agent does not approve a special proof-test procedure, the tank
in question shall not be marked as specified in 8.1, nor shall a tank be so marked after failing to satisfactorily pass a
special proof test that has been so approved, unless the tank is strengthened in a manner acceptable to the inspector
and is then retested and satisfactorily passes the second proof test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.20 Test Gauges<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.20.1  An indicating gauge shall be connected directly to the topmost part of the roof on the tank under test. In the
case of a tank which is designed for the storage of gases or vapors alone and is to be tested only with air, the gauge
may be connected to the tank at some lower level. If the indicating gauge is not readily visible to the operator who is
controlling the pressure applied, an additional indicating gauge shall be provided where it will be visible to the
operator throughout the test. Means shall be provided to ensure that the required test pressure will not be exceeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.20.2  A recording gauge shall also be used on each tank, and a record shall be kept of the pressures during all
stages of the tests. This gauge shall be connected either to the piping that leads to the indicating gauge or directly to
the tank at a point near the indicating gauge connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.20.3  Indicating gauges used during the tests shall be calibrated against a standard deadweight tester before the
tests are started.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.20.4  If at any time during a test there is reason to believe that a gauge is in error, its calibration shall be checked.
If the gauge is in error, it should preferably be adjusted to read correctly, or a calibration curve may be made to
indicate the correct pressures for the readings indicated by the gauge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.20.5  In all cases in which a gauge is mounted at a level lower than its connection to the tank or lower than some
part of the piping that leads to the gauge, suitable precautions shall be taken to prevent accumulation of any static
head of condensed moisture (or water from other sources) in the piping leads above the level of the gauge. Not
preventing this would result in erroneous readings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Division of Responsibility<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise agreed upon, when a tank is fabricated by one organization and erected by another, the erection
Manufacturer shall be considered as having the primary responsibility. The Manufacturer shall make certain that the
materials used in the fabrication of the components and in the construction of the tank are in accordance with all
applicable requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Manufacturer’s Report and Certificate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3.1  Upon completion of all tests, examinations, and inspections on each tank, the Manufacturer shall prepare a
report summarizing all the data on the tank, including foundations (if they are within the Manufacturer’s scope of
responsibility) and shall attach to the report all drawings and charts as required by other paragraphs in this section of
the rules (see 7.13 and Annex M).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3.2  The Manufacturer shall furnish and fill out a certificate for each tank (such as that shown in Annex M), attesting
that the tank has been constructed according to the rules in this standard. This certificate shall be signed by the
Manufacturer and the Purchaser’s inspector. This certificate, together with the nameplate or markings placed on the
tank, shall guarantee that the Manufacturer has complied with all applicable requirements of these rules.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.3.3  If the Purchaser so requests, the Manufacturer shall attach to the report copies of the records of the

<<HEADING level=3>>SECTION 9—PRESSURE- AND VACUUM-RELIEVING DEVICES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Manufacturer or Purchaser shall equip tanks constructed within the pressure limits of these rules with pressure-
relieving and emergency vacuum-relieving valves, or other equivalent permissible devices, as a means of
safeguarding the storage and adjacent equipment involved (see 9.6.1.2 and Annex N).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2 Pressure-relieving Devices<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.1  Tanks shall be protected by automatic pressure-relieving devices that will prevent the pressure at the top of
the tank from rising more than 10 % above the maximum positive gauge pressure except as provided in 9.2.2 (see
Annex K).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.2  Where an additional hazard can be created by the exposure of the tank to accidental fire or another
unexpected source of heat external to the tank, supplemental pressure-relieving devices shall be installed. These
devices shall be capable of preventing the pressure from rising more than 20 % above the maximum positive gauge
pressure. A single pressure-relieving valve may be used if it satisfies the requirements of this paragraph and 9.2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.3  Vacuum-relieving devices shall be installed to permit the entry of air (or other gas or vapor is so designed) to
avoid collapse of the tank wall if this could occur under natural operating conditions. These devices shall be located
on the tank so that they will never be sealed off by the contents of the tank. Their size and pressure (or vacuum)
setting shall be such that the partial vacuum developed in the tank at the maximum specified rate of air (or gas) inflow
will not exceed the partial vacuum for which the tank is required to be designed (see 5.10.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3 Construction of Devices<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure- and vacuum-relieving valves shall be constructed of materials that are not subject to excessive corrosion
for the intended service or subject to sticking at the seat or moving parts under any climatic conditions for which they
are supplied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4 Means of Venting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The applicable rules of 5.4 in API 2000 shall govern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5 Liquid Relief Valves<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A tank, which is likely to operate completely filled with liquid, shall be equipped with one or more liquid relief valves at
the top of the roof, unless otherwise protected against overpressure. When such valves are, in effect, supplementary
relief devices, they may be set at a pressure not greater than 1.25 times the design pressure. Because the relief valve
at the pump, which provides the inflow of liquid to the tank, is set at a pressure greater than 1.25 times the design
pressure of any tank that may be built under these rules, provision should be made for preventing overfilling of the
tank by a self-closing float valve, by some practicable pilot-valve control, or by any other proven device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6 Marking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.1 Safety and Relief Valves<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.6.1.1  Each safety and relief valve  1 / 2 -in. pipe size and larger shall be plainly marked by the manufacturer with the
required data in such a way that the marking will not be obliterated in service. Smaller valves are exempted from
marking requirements. The marking may be placed on the valve or on a plate or plates securely fastened to the valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9-2
API S TANDARD  620<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Valves may be marked with the required data stamped, etched, impressed, or cast on the valve or nameplate. The
marking shall include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) name or identifying trademark of the manufacturer;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Manufacturer’s design or type number;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) size of valve (pipe size of the valve inlet);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) set pressure, in lbf/in. 2  gauge;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) full open pressure, in lbf/in. 2  gauge;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
capacity of valve, in ft 3  or air  39  per minute (60°F and 14.7 lbf/in. 2  absolute), see 9.6.1.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.6.1.2  In many installations of tanks constructed according to these rules, the safety- or relief-valve inlet pressure is
so low in relation to the outlet pressure that valve capacities predicted on acoustic velocity of flow through the
discharge area of the valve (the usual basis for establishing safety-valve ratings) are not attainable. For valves that
handle light hydrocarbons or vapors, the condition described will exist if the ratio of the absolute pressure at the valve
outlet to the absolute pressure at the valve inlet (set pressure in lbf/in. 2  gauge times 1.10, plus atmospheric pressure)
exceeds a value of approximately 0.6: in such cases, formulas of the type given in Section VIII, Appendix 11, of the
ASME  Code  are not appropriate for computing safety- or relief-valve capacity conversions. Where this condition
exists, the valve manufacturer should be consulted concerning the size of the valve or valves required for the desired
capacity in terms of the specific gas or vapor to be handled, the set pressure to be employed, and the pressure to be
imposed on the outlet of the valve. If atmospheric pressure in the locality where the valve is to be used differs
materially from 14.7 lbf/in. 2  absolute, its normal value should be given in the inquiry to the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.2 Liquid Relief Valves<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each liquid relief valve shall be marked with the following data:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) name or identifying trademark of the manufacturer;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Manufacturer’s design or type number;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) size of valve, in inches (pipe size of inlet);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) set pressure, in lbf/in. 2  gauge;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) full open pressure, in lbf/in. 2  gauge;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
relieving capacity, in ft 3  of water (see Footnote 16) per minute at 70 °F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7 Pressure Setting of Safety Devices<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.1  Except as provided in 9.5 for certain liquid relief valves, the pressure setting of a pressure-relieving device
shall in no case exceed the maximum pressure that can exist at the level where the device is located when the
pressure at the top of the tank equals the nominal pressure rating for the tank (see 5.3.1) and the liquid contained in
the tank is at the maximum design level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.2  Vacuum-relieving devices shall be set to open at such a pressure or partial vacuum that the partial vacuum in
the tank cannot exceed that for which the tank is designed when the inflow of air (or other gas or vapor) through the
device is at its maximum specified rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>39  I n addition, the manufacturer may indicate the corresponding capacity in other fluids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(informative)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>Suggested Practice Regarding Foundations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.1
Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The practices suggested in this section are intended only to supply information to those who are not fully conversant
with the foundation problems of important structures. These practices are in no sense to be taken literally in providing
the best design for any particular site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The experienced judgment of a competent engineer is needed to pass on any but well-proven sites in any locality,
barring only the possibility of spot variations. For this reason, the minimum checks of subgrade included in this
section will usually prove worthwhile. Such checks may even be superfluous when a qualified geologist has passed
on the general area or where the measured settlement of existing structures around the proposed sites, which
produce a similar type of loading, confirms the load-bearing capacity to be selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No set of rules can cover all possible combinations of subgrade loading conditions. Types of subgrade structures and
the final design of the finished installation may be affected by groundwater or local climatic changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many large vertical storage tanks have been built with cylindrical shells and flat bottoms that rest directly on simply
prepared subgrade. In the case of unequal settlement, a releveling of the tank and subgrade has forestalled failure.
However, for tanks that have formed bottom plates, such as may be built according to this standard, uniformity of
support and avoidance of excessive settlement are much more important than they are in the case of flat-bottom,
vertical storage tanks. Hence, sites for erection of tanks constructed according to the rules of this standard shall be
chosen only after careful consideration and evaluation of the bearing properties of the soil at the locations involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For a low-pressure tank in the large sizes covered by this standard, the nature of the subgrade can be of prime
importance. Many industrial plants that require such storage are located near large streams, where the areas to be
built on are alluvial deposits. These deposits are usually interspersed with gravel and sand, all affected by previous
changes in the course of the stream, so that both the character and depth of the composite layers have no uniformity.
T he recommendations made in this section will therefore omit any reference to rock or even shales and hardpan
(cemented gravel) for direct support of masonry footings. Long-standing practices for such conditions are well known.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For large tanks that will rest on or near grade level, proper grade preparation can have an important bearing on
bottom corrosion. Tanks erected on poorly drained grades in direct contact with corrosive soils or on heterogeneous
mixtures of different types of soils are subject to electrolytic attack on the bottom side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assuming that soil-bearing conditions have been determined to be adequate, the simplest form of foundation is a
sand pad laid directly on the earth. All loam or organic material shall be removed and replaced with suitable well
compacted material. Often a satisfactory fill material is available at the site. If not, bank run gravel is excellent and is
readily compacted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The grade for the tank shall be elevated slightly above the surrounding terrain to ensure complete drainage from
beneath the entire bottom of the tank. Sufficient berm shall be provided to prevent washing away and weathering
under the tank bottom. The berm width shall be at least 5 ft. Weathering can be minimized if the berm is subsequently
protected with trap rock, gravel, or an asphaltic flashing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nature of predictable settlement may determine the choice of the kind of support for large field-assembled tanks

<<PARAGRAPH>>Except in the case of tanks founded on solid rock, hardpan, or similar substances, some amount of settlement is
bound to take place. Every reasonable precaution shall be taken to ensure that the settlement will be kept to an
acceptable minimum and that any settlement which does occur will be as uniform as possible. Large, and perhaps
even moderate, irregularities in settlement may lead to an unbalancing of the loading conditions assumed in the
design and possibly to serious distortion of important elements of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For those locations where the use of piling is the only logical procedure, the piling design factors would be well known
to the engineer charged with making the decision for the contractor or owner. Competent guidance may be needed in
choosing between a pile that depends on skin friction alone or mainly on end bearing with small credit for lateral
support in combination with skin friction for part of the length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.3 Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The designer of these large tanks shall supply the data on superimposed loadings to be assumed for the foundation
design or, if there are no foundations, for direct loading on the subgrade. A slab or mat may be provided to support the
superstructure and shall be considered to distribute the load more evenly over a lower natural subgrade compared
with merely stripping, leveling, and rolling the existing grade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Foundations and subgrade shall safely carry the weight of the tank and its contents when the tank is filled with water
to the highest level required for a hydrostatic test or other water-loading operations, even though the tank itself may
be designed for some lesser density of liquid. However, in cases where the character of the soil justifies it and a
competent soil expert advises it, allowance may be made for the relatively short duration and intermittent nature of the
water loadings if suitable account is taken of all such loadings that may be expected to occur during the life of the
tank, including not only those loadings that are incidental to periodic repetitions of the hydrostatic test in accordance
with 7.18 but also water-filling operations for gas-freeing purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For simple spheroids or tanks of similar design, in which the distribution of the imposed weights shifts because the
liquid level in combination with the vapor pressure may change the shape of the tank, the designer shall consider the
possibility of such a change.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.4 Soil-bearing Values<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bearing values selected shall be conservative on the assumption that suitable field tests will be made if borings or
test pits, or both, do not give satisfactory information on the depth required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Determination of the allowable maximum soil-bearing value shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.5 Investigation of Subgrade<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On actual tank sites to be used, test borings or test pits, or both, may be made at the direction of a competent
engineer who will specify the number and location. They need not be equally spaced but should be laid out to uncover
possible weak spots.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Test borings, where required, shall be carried to sufficient depths to disclose any deep-lying soft or insufficiently
consolidated strata beneath the surface. If such strata is discovered, its effects on the bearing properties at the
surface of the grade shall be carefully evaluated, giving due consideration to the loaded-area size effect of the total
area loaded by the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, test loadings of subgrade at the bottom of test pits need be resorted to only when such heavy loading as
may be imposed by footings for major column supports for spheres or similarly elevated low-pressure tanks is
specified. Results may be deceptive if average load-bearing capacity over a considerable area is wanted. All field
data shall be recorded with maps, and copies shall be supplied to all engineers concerned with design, erection, and
later operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>C.8.2  The lowest footing course shall be bedded directly against the sides of the excavation when the sides are self-

the general contours. Bulldozers, scrapers, and crane-bucket discharge may be used if they are kept completely clear
of the pedestals and walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Particular attention shall be given to surface regrading around the finished structure to permit efficient erection of the
superstructure and to provide proper drainage that is consistent with the records of local weather conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The finished grade under a flat-bottom tank shall be crowned from the periphery to the center. A slope of 1 inch in 10
ft is suggested as a minimum. This crown will partly compensate for slight settlement, which is likely to be greater at
the center; it will also aid in draining and cleaning the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.11 Inspection during the Hydrostatic Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a final check on the adequacy of the foundations and subgrade, the Purchaser shall take level readings with
surveyor’s instruments around the entire periphery of the tank before water is introduced into the tank for the
hydrostatic test. The readings shall be continued at reasonable intervals during the entire filling operation and shall be
plotted promptly in suitable form to indicate whether any undue or uneven settlement is occurring. The results of
these observations shall be reported to the tank erector and the Purchaser’s engineering representative. If at any time
any questionable amount or rate of settlement does occur, further filling of the tank shall be stopped until a decision is
reached as to what, if any, corrective measures are needed. Reference points on a tank or its foundations for use in
making such observations shall be selected with care to ensure that the readings accurately reflect settlement of the
subgrade and are not affected by possible changes in the shape of the tank walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a minor amount of settlement is observed during the course of the filling operation and still continues after a tank is
filled to the highest level required in the hydrostatic test, the water level in the tank shall not be lowered until further
settlement has substantially ceased or a decision is reached that it might be unsafe to hold the water at that level any
longer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In no event, however, shall the water test be used as a planned means of soil compaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Suggested Practice Regarding Supporting Structures<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a tank is supported on columns, a supporting ring or skirt, brackets, or comparable members, it will have
concentrated loads imposed on its walls in the region where the supports are attached. When tanks of certain shapes
are subject to internal pressure, secondary stresses may exist in the wall adjacent to the attachment of such supports
that are lower than when the tank is filled with liquid before any pressure is imposed other than that caused by the
static head. Methods for calculating the forces involved are not given in this standard because they involve so many
variables that depend on the size, shape, and weight of the tank; the temperature of service; the internal pressure; the
arrangement of the supporting structure; and the piping attached to the tank as installed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2
Details of Supporting Structures<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.1
The details of supports shall conform to good structural practice, bearing in mind the considerations described
in D.2.2 through D.2.5 (see 5.13 and the  Steel Construction Manual ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D.2.2
All supports shall be designed to prevent excessive localized stresses by temperature changes in the tank or
deformations produced by variations in the pressure and liquid-level conditions within the tank. Any arrangement of
the structure that does not permit a reasonably free expansion and contraction of the tank walls will tend to weaken
the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D.2.3
External stays and ring girders or certain internal framing may exert a stiffening effect on the tank wall where
exterior supporting members of the tank are to be attached. This stiffening effect may be beneficial or harmful,
depending on the operating temperature and the location of the stiffening members.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D.2.4
In many cases it is preferable to use details that permit continuous welds which extend completely around the
periphery of the attachment and avoid intermittent or dead-end welds at which there may be local stress
concentration. A thicker wall plate at the support may serve to reduce secondary stresses, and if desired, a complete
ring of thicker wall plates may be installed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D.2.5
When forces acting on a tank wall at the attachment areas for supports of any kind can produce high bending
stresses, and thicker wall plates do not seem appropriate, an oval or circular reinforcing plate may be used. The
attachment of such reinforcing plates shall be designed to minimize flexing of the plate under forces normal to the
surface of the tank wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Suggested Practice Regarding Attached Structures (Internal and External)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some tanks constructed according to the rules of this standard may have internal structural bracing. Should these or
their attachments fail, severe damage to the tank would result. The designer shall keep this possible hazard in mind
and shall design such members and their attachments with sufficient strength and due allowance for corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2
Cautionary Suggestions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2.1
Cautionary suggestions, which shall be considered in the design of internal and external structures, are
described in E.2.2 through E.2.5.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2.2
Where the structures are connected to the tank wall, details shall be provided that will prevent excessive
localized tensile stress outward from the wall face because of the connection.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2.3
If platforms or stairways have separate supports, they shall preferably rest on top of the supports instead of
hanging by bolts or rods.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E.2.4
If corrosion is expected, additional metal shall be provided. The corrosion allowance does not have to be the
same as in the tank wall if the supports and structures can be readily and economically replaced without replacing the
entire tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E.2.5
Corrosion-resistant metals may be used in the fabrication of the structural supports, but whenever the
supports are attached by welding, the parts joined shall be weldable. These welds shall not introduce any
o bj ectionable conditions at or near the attachment, including hard or brittle zones, or both, or differences in electrical
potential that might result in electrolytic corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Determination of Allowable Stress Values for Biaxial Tension and Compression<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.1.1
Example 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.1.1.1
Given Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this example, an area of tank wall is constructed of ASTM A131, Grade B, steel plate that is  3 / 4  in. thick and has
fully radiographed, double-welded butt joints. The wall is subject to tension in a latitudinal direction and to
compression in a meridional direction. The values of  R 1  and  R 2  at the point under consideration are 60 in. and 315 in.,
respectively. A corrosion allowance of  1 / 16  in. is required. The computed (meridional) compressive stress,  s cc , in the
net thickness after deduction of the corrosion allowance is 3400 lbf/in. 2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.1.1.2
Problem<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The problem is this example is to find the maximum allowable (latitudinal) tensile stress value for the given conditions,
in conformance with the provisions of 5.5.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.1.1.3
Solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since the compressive stress is meridional, the governing value of   R   in this situation is  R 2 , or 315 in. Then,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 5-1 shall be entered in the text at a value of ( t  –  c )/ R  = 0.00218. The ordinate shall be proceeded along
vertically from this point to its intersection with the horizontal line for  s c  = 3400 lbf/in. 2 , and the value of  N  should be
read at this intersection. In the case under consideration,  N  = 0.867. As determined from Table 5-1, the maximum
allowable tensile stress value,  S ts , for ASTM A131, Grade B, Steel plate in simple tension is 16,000 lbf/in. 2 . Therefore,
the maximum allowable tensile stress,  s ta , for the conditions cited in this example is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>s ta  =  NS ts<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>= (0.867) (16,000)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>= 13,870 lbf/in. 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An efficiency factor need not be applied to this value because  E  for fully radiographed, double-welded butt joints
exceeds the value of  N  as determined in the foregoing procedure. However, if the joints were spot radiographed—not
fully radiographed—butt joints,  E  would have a value of only 85 %. In this case, the net allowable tensile stress,  ES ts ,
would be only 0.85  ×  16,000 = 13,600 lbf/in. 2  determined from Figure 5-1, would govern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively,  s ta  could be determined by entering the computed value of  M  in Figure F-1 and obtaining the allowable
coexistent value of  N . For this particular example, the value of  S cs  would be 15,000 lbf/in. 2 . Hence,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of line 0-A and that an extrapolation of the  N  curves would be required to determine the value of  N . Since such an
extension or extrapolation of the  N  curves is not permissible, no coexistent tensile stress is permissible under the
conditions cited in this example. In fact, the compressive stress of 4600 lbf/in. 2  greatly exceeds the allowable stress,
S cs , of 2840 lbf/in. 2  for simple compression for the thickness-to-radius ratio involved. Consequently, either the
thickness must be increased or the shape of the wall must be changed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The value  N  =  s tc / S ts  = 8000/16,500 = 0.485 shall be computed. The ( t  –  c )/ R  value of 0.00415 shall be entered at the
bottom of Figure 5-1 in the text. The ordinate shall be proceeded along vertically at this value, noting that the  N  curves
would have to be extrapolated to the left of line 0-A to intersect with the vertical line that represents the ( t  –  c )/ R  value
of 0.00415. Since no extrapolation is permitted to the left of line 0-A, the intersection of this vertical line with line 0-A
yields a value on the left ordinate scale of 7500 lbf/in. 2 , which represents the maximum allowable compressive stress,
s ca , for this particular value of ( t  –  c )/ R . A higher value of tensile stress is permissible, since the allowable coexistent
value of  N  equals 0.65. Thus, in this particular example, the allowable compressive stress is governed by the ( t  –  c )/ R
value rather than by the coexistent tensile stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>As determined from Table 5-1, the maximum allowable tensile stress value,  S ts , for ASTM A442, Grade 55, steel plate
in simple tension is 16,500 lbf/in. 2 . Since the compressive stress is latitudinal, the governing value of   R   in this situation
is  R 1 , or 75 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A series of four or five different plate thicknesses should be assumed, covering the range in which the required
thickness will probably be found. The values of ( t  –  c )/ R ,  s c ,   s t , and  N  shall be computed and tabulated for each of the
assumed thicknesses, as shown in Table F-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The values of  s c  shall be plotted on Figure F-2  40  at the respective values of ( t  –  c )/ R  associated with them, and a
smooth curve U-U shall be drawn that connects the points located in this manner. The  N  and ( t  –  c )/ R  points shall also
be plotted, and a smooth curve V-V shall be drawn to connect them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The intersection of these two curves represents the minimum ( t  –  c )/ R  value that will satisfy both the compressive
stress and tensile stress limitations involved in this example. At this point  s c  (which is equivalent to  s ca  in this problem)
equals 10,000 lbf/in. 2 ;  N  equals approximately 0.480; and ( t  –  c )/ R  equals 0.0067. The efficiency,  E , for the type of
joints involved is 85 %. Since this is greater than  N , the value of  s t  (or  s ta ) for the conditions under consideration is
equal to the value of  NS ts , or 0.480  ×  16,500 = 7920 lbf/in. 2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>F.2.2 Example 2<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.2.2.1 Given Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this example, an elemental area of tank wall is constructed of ASTM A516, Grade 55, steel plate subjected to a
meridional unit force,  T 1 , of 2620 lbf/in. tension and a latitudinal unit force,  T 2 , of 2880 lbf/in. compression. The
meridional radius of curvature,  R 1 , is 132 in., and the length of the normal from the surface to the axis of revolution,
R 2 , is 409 in. The joints in the wall are spot-radiographed, double-welded butt joints, and no corrosion allowance is
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.2.2.2 Problem<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The problem in this example is to graphically find the minimum thickness of tank wall required for the given conditions
(see 5.10.3.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.2.2.3 Solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As determined from Table 5-1, the maximum, allowable tensile stress value,  S ts , for ASTM A516, Grade 55, steel plate
in simple tension is 16,500 lbf/in. 2 . Since the compressive stress is latitudinal, the governing value of   R   for this
situation is  R 1 , or 132 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A series of four or five different plate thicknesses shall be assumed, covering the range in which the required
thickness will probably be found. The values of ( t  –  c )/ R ,  s c ,   s t , and  N  shall be computed and tabulated for each
assumed thickness, as shown in Table F-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The value of  s c  shall be plotted on Figure F-2 at the respective values of ( t  –  c )/ R  associated with them, and a smooth
curve W-W shall be drawn between the points located in this manner. The  N  and ( t  –  c )/ R  points shall also be plotted,
and a smooth curve X-X shall be drawn to connect them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These two curves intersect each other on the left-hand side of line A-A. The use of values represented by points in
this area is prohibited. All values of  N  in the vicinity of these two curves are well below the efficiency,  E , of the type of
joints involved; thus, the allowable compressive stress is obviously the critical factor in this problem. A point must be
found where the computed compressive stress, represented by points on the curve W-W, does not exceed the
allowable compressive stress. This will be at the intersection of curve W-W and line A-A, where  s c  = 6300. This value
is the allowable compressive stress,  s ca , for the conditions given in this example. Therefore,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This value is the minimum required thickness. The computed tensile stress for this thickness is only 2620 ÷ 0.457 =
5730 lbf/in. 2 , whereas the values of  N  at the intersection of curve W-W and line A-A indicates that a tensile stress of
16,500  ×  0.72 = 11,880 lbf/in. 2  would have been permissible. Thus, the plate at this level will not be stressed to its
fullest potential for tensile loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>F.3 Determination of Minimum Required Thicknesses for Walls Subject to Biaxial
Compression from Meridional and Latitudinal Unit Forces<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.3.1 Given Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this example, the tank used to store liquid has a dome-shaped, self-supporting roof with varying values for  R 1  and
R 2 . The size and vacuum settings of the vacuum-relieving devices are such that the partial vacuum developed in the
tank at the maximum air inflow is 0.40 lbf/in. 2  gauge (see 5.3.1). The roof is covered with insulation weighing 2 lb/ft 2 .
The design requirements include a live snow load of 25 lb/ft 2  on the horizontal projection of the surface of the roof,
which has a slope of 30° or less with the horizontal and a  1 / 16  in. corrosion allowance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.3.2 Problem<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The problem in this example is to find the required plate thicknesses for the vacuum and external loading (a) at the
center of the roof, where  R 1  =  R 2  = 1200 in. and (b) at a radial distance of 12.5 ft from the center of the roof, where  R 1
= 1117 in. and  R 2  = 1172 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.3.3 Solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.3.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure F-4 is a free-body sketch of the roof above the plane of the level under consideration. Specific values for the
variables used in this figure are as follows (see Figure 5-4 for typical free-body diagrams and 5.10.1 for definitions of
the other variables):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P
equals –0.40 lbf/in. 2  gauge, a negative value because of the internal vacuum;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W
is the sum of the weights of the steel plate, insulation load, and snow load.  W  must be given the same sign
as  P  in this case because it acts in the same direction as the pressure on the plane of the level under
consideration; therefore,   W  is negative (see 5.10.1 of the definition of  W );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F
equals zero because no ties, braces, supports, or other similar members are cut by the plane of the level
under consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.3.3.2 Finding the Thickness at the Center of the Roof<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a trial, a plate thickness of  27 / 32  in. (0.844 in.) at the center of the roof is assumed, including a  1 / 16  in. corrosion
allowance, which is equivalent to a unit weight of 34.4 lb/ft 2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

vapor space. The plate material is ASTM A131, Grade B, steel for thicknesses of  1 / 2  in. and less.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The top course of the butt-welded cylindrical sidewall is  1 / 4  in. thick. The roof is a conical shape with a 2:12 slope and
a  1 / 4  in. thickness with single full-fillet welded lap joints. The maximum design liquid level is 6 in. below the plane of

<<HEADING level=3>>F.4.2.2 Problem<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The problem in this example is to design the compression-ring region at the juncture of the roof and cylindrical
sidewall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.4.2.3 Solution<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>From Figure 5-5, tan  α  = 12/2 = 6.0. Hence,  α  = 80.54°, sin  α  = 0.9864, and cos  α  = 0.1643.   R c  =  R 3  = 37.5 ft = 450 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the edge of the roof,  R 2  = 450/0.1643 = 2740 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of the relatively low pressure, the weight of the roof plate is a practical factor. In view of the small difference
between the conical area of the roof and the projected area on a horizontal plane,  W , can be calculated with sufficient
accuracy by using the unit weight of 10.2 lb/ft 2  for the  1 / 4 -in. roof plate and the cross-sectional area of the tank at the
roof-sidewall juncture.  F  is zero because no internal or external ties, braces, diaphragms, trusses, columns, skirts, or
other structural supports are attached to the roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For practical purposes, in this example ( W  +  F )/ A t  = 10.2/144. W must be given a negative sign in this case because it
acts in the direction opposite from  P , and  P  is positive (see the definition of  W  in 5.10.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.1
Tank Groups Based on Corrosion Rate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All large low-pressure tanks of the type covered by this standard may be classified under one of the following general
groups based on corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Tanks in which corrosion rates may be definitely established by reason of accurate knowledge, available to the
designer, covering the chemical characteristics of whatever substances the tanks are to contain. Such knowledge
may, in the case of standard commercial products, be obtained from published sources or, whenever special
processes are involved, from reliable records compiled from results of previous observations by the user or others
under similar conditions of operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Tanks in which corrosion rates, although known to be relatively high, are either variable or indeterminate in
magnitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Tanks in which corrosion rates, although indeterminate, are known to be relatively low.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Tanks in which corrosion effects are known to be negligible or entirely absent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.2
Corrosion Allowance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.2.1
In cases in which the rate of corrosion is closely predictable, additional metal thickness over and above that
required for the initial operating conditions shall be provided and shall be at least equal to the expected corrosion loss
during the desired life of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.2.2
When corrosion effects are indeterminate before the tank is designed (although they are known to be inherent
to some degree in the service for which the tank is to be used), and when corrosion is incidental, localized, or variable
in rate and extent, the best judgement of the designer must be exercised in establishing reasonable maximum excess
tank wall thicknesses. For all tanks that come under this classification, a minimum corrosion allowance of  1 / 16  in. shall
be provided. This minimum allowance may, of course, be increased according to the judgement of the designer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.2.3
In all cases in which corrosion effects can be shown to be negligible or entirely absent, no excess thickness
need be provided.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.3
Service Conditions and Hydrogen-induced Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the service conditions might include the presence of hydrogen sulfide or other conditions that may promote
hydrogen-induced cracking effects, particularly near the bottom of the shell at the shell-to-bottom connections, care
shall be taken to ensure that the materials and details of construction of the tank are adequate to resist hydrogen-
induced cracking. The Purchaser shall consider restricting the sulphur content of the material to be stored through
thickness testing of the steel, laboratory surveillance tests, and the use of internal tank coatings to reduce the
possibility of hydrogen-induced cracking. The hardness of the welds contacting these environments, including the
heat-affected zones, shall be considered. The weld metal and adjacent heat-affected zone often contain a zone of
hardness that is well in excess of a value of 22 on the Rockwell C scale and could be expected to be more
susceptible to cracking than would unwelded metal. Any hardness criteria shall be a matter of agreement between the
Purchaser and the Manufacturer and shall be based on an evaluation of the expected hydrogen sulfide concentration
in the product, the possibility of moisture being present on the inside metal surface, and the strength and hardness
characteristics of base metal and weld metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Recommended Practice for Use of Preheat, Post-heat, and Stress Relief<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.1
Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The majority of tanks covered by this standard are usually not subjected to a conventional stress-relief post-heat
treatment after erection is completed. However, the very nature of these tanks and their expected service requires
that the utmost care be taken to obtain completed tanks that have the highest safety factor possible with regard to
notch toughness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thermal stress-relief treatment performed on pressure vessels is recognized as a means for reducing the
probability of brittle failures. Evidence is accumulating that shows the benefit of improving notch toughness by
metallurgical changes rather than by relief of residual stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.2
Thickness as it Affects Preheat and Post-heat Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Plate with thicknesses below  1 / 2  in. is reasonably notch tough. In most steels, when the plate thickness exceeds
3 / 4  in. to 1 in., notch toughness, particularly as welded, decreases sharply. The decrease in notch toughness can
be minimized by the conventional post-heat treatment and, in many steels, by preheat treatment. The benefits of
preheat treatment in steels  3 / 4  in.   to 1 in. thick have been demonstrated; similar benefits could be expected in
thicker steels, but sufficient experimental data are currently lacking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.3
Post-heat Treatment (Stress Relief)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The post-heat treatment now performed on pressure vessels is of established value, although the mechanism by
which the improvement is realized may be open to debate. Post-heat treatment of tank sections when the plate
thickness exceeds 1 1 / 4  in. is required as stated in 5.25. In special cases, the possibilities of post-heat treatment after
erection should be explored. Post-heating an insulated tank may be possible if an ample source of heat is readily
available and if the rigidity of the tank is adequate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the service conditions are expected to produce stress corrosion cracking, relief of stresses is necessary.
Preheat treatment has not been shown to be an adequate substitute for post-heat treatment when it is applied to
avoid stress corrosion cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.4
Preheat Treatment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many laboratory tests have shown preheat treatment of carbon steel to 300 °F to 400 °F to be the equivalent of the
post-heat treatment at no less than 1100 °F insofar as the physical properties of the weldment are concerned. 41,42<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some tests have indicated a slight advantage of the post-heat treatment. Most of the tests have been made on plates
3 / 4  in.   to 1 in. thick; results must be viewed with caution if preheating is applied appreciably beyond this thickness
range. However, for all practical purposes, improvement resulting from preheating is sufficiently well established so
that preheat should be considered for field fabrication of plates over  3 / 4 -in. thick whenever toughness of the tank is
highly desired and the thermal post-heat treatment is impractical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Preheating should be performed by heating and maintaining this heat in appreciable lengths of the joint to be welded,
preferably using a strip burner with a mild flame rather than a harsh flame such as that from a cutting torch. Electrical
strip heaters are available and have been found to be satisfactory. The preheat of 300 °F should be checked with a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Appendix I
(informative)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>Suggested Practice for Peening<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Peening is used to eliminate distortion in thin plates and to prevent cracking in thick plates when the weld is built up of
several layers of weld metal. Peening is intended to reduce the internal stresses introduced in welded structures
because the weld shrinks more than the relatively cold adjacent base metal. Proper peening strains the stressed weld
metal above its yield point and, in this manner, adjusts the stresses in proportion to the amount of flow caused by
peening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.2
Effective Peening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Effective peening occurs below the red-hot temperature. Peening is wasted when it occurs above a temperature at
which the weld metal begins to take on strength. The first two layers and the last layer of weld metal must not be
peened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To be effective, peening must move the weld metal. The shape, size, and hardness of peening tools are important.
Bruises and surface roughness of the weld metal caused by peening are not objectionable, since these are melted by
the deposition of subsequent layers of weld metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.3
Peening as an Alternative to Thermal Stress Relief<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When peening occurs as an alternative to thermal stress relief under permissible procedures, it shall be done
carefully to minimize distortion of the weldment. Some steels that are weldable have to be peened sufficiently to
temporarily create stresses in the reverse direction, which will disappear on cooling. These are the steels which get
so hard when they are cold that the metal is only burnished by the peening tool instead of being cold-worked. When
peening is done to avoid the formation of cracks on welds that are subsequently to be stress relieved, underpeening
may be satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.4
Factors Involved in Peening<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.4.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For peening to be acceptable or dependable as a means of stress relief, a thorough study must be made of all the
factors involved, including the type of steel, the thickness of the weld, and the thicknesses of successive layers of
welding (see 6.19.2). Two guides to satisfactory results are outlined in I.4.2 and I.4.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.4.2
Amount of Peening Necessary<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An approximation of the amount of peening that is necessary may be obtained by welding two small plates of a given
material and thickness, with one plate held rigidly and the other free to move as the weld shrinks. The peening required
to overcome the shrinkage gives a fair idea of the degree of peening that will be required in the actual operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.4.3
Measurements during Welding and Peening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Punch marks shall be made on opposite sides of the weld, and the distance between these marks shall be kept within
1 / 32  in. by peening during the welding of the seam. The initial measurement shall be made after two layers of weld
metal have been deposited. After the weld has been built up to a depth of 1 1 / 4  – 1 1 / 2  in., the likelihood of deviation in
the distance between punch marks is greatly reduced, since the stresses caused by shrinkage of the recently
deposited weld metal are more fully resisted by the cooler prior layers. Cracking of unpeened welds in ordinary steel
is most likely to occur at this point. If the peening has been done so that the deviation in distance between punch
marks is kept to a minimum up to this point, the same degree of peening for the remainder of the weld will protect the
weld from cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>K.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex attempts to outline a safe and reasonable practice to be used for the usual environment and operating
conditions. The many variables that must be considered in connection with tank venting problems make it
impracticable to set forth definite, simple rules. Engineering studies for any particular tank may show that it is
desirable to use either a larger or smaller venting capacity than that estimated in accordance with these rules.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>K.2
Determination of Required Capacity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The aggregate capacities required for any vent valves, pressure-relieving valves, and/or vacuum-relieving valves to
be provided should be determined as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For thermal breathing and product movement, the rules given in API 2000 shall be followed. The required capacity
as the result of the product movement into the tank given in API 2000, shall be multiplied by the ratio of the absolute
tank pressure to atmospheric pressure (14.7 lbf/in. 2  absolute).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) For supplemental safety pressure-relieving devices to take care of extra venting capacity required in case of
external fire exposure, the rules in API 2000 shall be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex provides minimum requirements for the design of welded storage tanks that may be subject to seismic
ground motion and are designed and constructed to the API 620 standard. These requirements represent accepted
practice for application to welded steel flat-bottom tanks supported at grade. This annex is based on the requirements
of API 650, Annex E and uses the same notations except as supplemented herein. The design procedures contained
in this annex are based on allowable stress design (ASD) methods<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All tanks designed and constructed to the requirements defined in 1.2 shall meet the requirements of API 650, Annex
E unless specifically modified or augmented herein. All of the requirements contained in API 650, Annex E are not
duplicated here, but are wholly incorporated by reference. Special provisions for tanks designed and constructed in
accordance with Annexes Q and R are included in this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Application to tanks supported on a framework elevated above grade is beyond the scope of this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design procedures are included for the consideration of the increased damping and increase in natural period of
vibration due to soil-structure interaction for mechanically anchored tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks located in regions where  S 1   is less than or equal to 0.04 and  S S  less than or equal to 0.15, or the peak ground
acceleration for the ground motion defined by the regulatory requirements is less than or equal to 0.05 g , need not be
designed for seismic forces; however, in these regions, tanks in SUG III shall comply with the freeboard requirements
of this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dynamic analysis methods incorporating fluid-structure and soil-structure interaction are permitted to be used in lieu
of the procedures contained in this annex with Purchaser approval and provided the design and construction details
are as safe as otherwise provided in this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions for outer tanks of double walled tank systems are limited to metallic outer tanks designed and
constructed in accordance with API 650 or API 620. Outer tanks designed and constructed of other materials such as

<<HEADING level=3>>L.4 Special Provisions for Tanks Requiring Performance Level Designs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>L.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section is applicable to refrigerated tanks built to API 620, Annex Q or Annex R with supplemental seismic
design methods addressing an operating level earthquake (OLE), sometimes referred to as OBE, a contingency level
earthquake (CLE), sometimes referred to as SSE, and an aftershock level earthquake (ALE) when required by API
625, regulations, or the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The performance basis objectives for the ground motions are as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) OLE—the tank system will remain operational with only minor repair required. The tank system should be capable
of withstanding multiple events with this ground motion without significant damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) CLE—the primary liquid container will survive and contain the liquid (with only minor leaks permitted) to protect the
public but extensive damage may occur and the tank system may not be repairable after this event. This is
assumed to be a singular event in the design life of the tank system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) ALE—the primary liquid container is assumed to be damaged by the CLE event and the secondary containment
system is containing the liquid. The secondary containment is intended to survive multiple aftershocks of the ALE
ground motion with minor damage and leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements of API 650, Annex E, and L.3 of this standard apply unless modified herein.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>L.4.2 Ground Motions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The definition of the ground motions to be used with the OLE, CLE and ALE events may vary depending on
regulations for the specific location. Within the U.S., ASCE 7 is required by most state building codes and Federal
Regulations 49  CFR  193 and NFPA 59A are the primary regulatory and standard documents for LNG storage tanks.
The user is referred to similar regulatory documents when the tank is located outside the U.S., for ground motion
definitions to be used with this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For Appendix Q and R tanks, the seismic design liquid level to be applied shall be as defined in API 625.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vertical earthquake shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A site-specific response spectrum is required for tanks located in regions where peak ground acceleration is greater
than 0.15 g  or   S s  is greater than 0.3 g  unless otherwise specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The exception in API 650, Section E.4.6.2 limiting the upper value of the spectral acceleration,  S a * under specific tank
configurations is not applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Current U.S. requirements are based on a response spectrum with 5 % damping. If the site specific regulations
require a different damping value, and a site-specific spectrum is not required, the following factors may be applied to
the impulsive spectral component to adjust the 5 % damped values to other values of damping. The convective
multiplier,  K , from API 650, Annex E is unchanged and equal to 1.5. Alternative adjustment factors to damping ratios
are permitted providing they are based on local geotechnical data and rational analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise defined by the governing local regulations, the ground motion to be applied to meet the OLE
performance criteria in L.4 shall be determined as part of a Purchaser - defined plant risk assessment considering
plant safety and loss of operability .  The OLE design liquid level coincident with the defined ground motion may be
defined as less than the Maximum NOL.
Determination of OBE ground motion from a plant safety and loss of operability risk assessment may consider the

<<PARAGRAPH>>As an alternate to a site specific response spectra for OBE, the Purchaser may specify OBE in terms of a factor times
a 475 year recurrence interval spectra. For example, 0.5 times the 475 year spectra. Note that the value of 0.5 times
the 475 year spectra in terms of recurrence interval and probability of exceedence varies with location.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the risk assessment targets the limits of elastic tank response and can tolerate limited permanent distortion
which does not affect the operability of the of the tank system, an OBE design liquid level consistent with tank
operations may be selected. For example, a design liquid level of 80 % of the maximum normal operating level may
be selected if the tank operates above the 80 % level for a small percent of time .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE  The thicknesses and widths (see Q.3.5.1) in this table are based on the foundation providing a uniform support under the full width of the
annular plate. Unless the foundation is properly compacted, particularly at the inside of a concrete ringwall, settlement will produce additional
stresses in the annular plate. The thickness of the annular bottom plates need not exceed the thickness of the first shell course. The minimum
thicknesses for annular bottom plates were derived based on a fatigue cycle life of 1000 cycles for steel tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>R.3.6.4  All fillet welds shall consist of a minimum of two passes. The ends of the fillet welds shall be 2 in. from the
rat hole (see Figure R-1), and these welds shall be deposited by starting 2 in. from the rat hole and welding away from
the rat hole. An acceptable alternative to stopping fillet welds 2 in. short of the rat hole would be to weld continuously
through the rat hole from one side of the stiffener to the opposite side. All craters in fillet welds shall be repaired by
back welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.3.6.5  Any joints between the adjacent sections of stiffening rings, as shown in Figure R-1, shall be made so that
the required moment of inertia of the combined ring-shell section is provided. Weld joints between adjacent sections
shall be made with full-thickness and full-penetration butt-welds. Stiffening-ring butt-welds may employ metal backing
strips. Backing strips and the associated welding shall be made in a manner that provides a smooth contour in the rat
hole and all other weld joints ends. All weld passes shall be started at the rat hole and other weld joint ends and shall
be completed by moving away from these ends. Passes shall be overlapped away from the edge to provide a smooth
continuous weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>R.6 Testing the Primary Liquid and Primary Vapor Containers<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions stated in R.6.2 through R.6.4 are testing requirements for the  primary liquid container . Provisions
stated in R.6.5 cover the pneumatic testing of the  warm product vapor container  (or when inner tank is not open top,
the  refrigerated temperature roof ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.2 General Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A thorough check for tightness and structural adequacy is essential for the  primary liquid container . Except as
permitted by R.6.6, the test shall be conducted after the entire tank is complete, but before the insulation is applied.
The hydrostatic test shall be performed by filling the tank with water to the design liquid level and applying an overload
air pressure of 1.25 times the pressure for which the vapor space is designed. The hydrostatic test shall not produce
a membrane tensile stress in any part of the tank exceeding 85 % of the minimum specified yield strength or 55% of
the minimum specified tensile strength of the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.3 Test Preliminaries<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.3.1  Before the tank is filled with water, the procedures described in R.5.9.1 through R.5.9.6 shall be completed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.4 Hydrostatic Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.4.1  The provisions described in R.5.9.1 through R.5.9.5 shall apply during and after water filling for the
hydrostatic test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.4.2  The tank shall be vented to the atmosphere when it is filled with or emptied of water.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.6.4.3  During water filling, the elevations of at least eight equidistant points at the bottom of the tank shell and on
top of the ringwall or slab shall be checked. Differential settlement, or uniform settlement of substantial magnitude,
requires an immediate stop to water filling. Any further filling with water will depend on an evaluation of the measured
settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>R-20
API S TANDARD  620<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.6.4.4  The tank shall be filled with water to the design liquid level. In the case of settlement, as stated in R.6.4.3, an
appropriate corrective action shall be taken before further filling or, alternatively the design liquid level shall be
reduced to the actual maximum test water level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.4.5  After the tank is filled with water and before the pneumatic test pressure is applied, anchor bolts or anchor
straps, if provided, shall be tightened against the hold-down brackets.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.4.6  All welds in the shell, including the corner weld between the shell and the bottom, shall be visually checked
for tightness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.5 Pneumatic Pressure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.6.5.1  An air pressure equal to 1.25 times the pressure for which the vapor space is designed shall be applied to
the enclosed space above the water level. In the case of a double-wall tank with an open-top inner tank, where the air
pressure acts against the outer tank and the inner tank is thus not stressed by the air pressure, the inner tank may be
emptied of water before the pneumatic pressure testing begins.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.5.2  The test pressure shall be held for 1 hour.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.5.3  The air pressure shall be reduced until the design pressure is reached.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.6.5.4  Above the water level, all welded joints shall be checked with a solution film. A prior vacuum box check may be
substituted for the solution-film examination of the welded joints. Above the water level, the solution-film examination
shall be made, of all welds around openings, all piping joints, and the compression ring welds to the roof and shell
except any listed below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Continuous double lap roof to compression ring welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Shell to compression ring welds, continuous inside and outside, and applying a thickened upper shell ring detail
similar to Figure 5-6, details f or f-1. The thickened upper shell ring shall be greater than half of the conical
compression ring thickness and greater than two times the adjacent shell ring thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Full fusion butt welded connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.6.5.5  The opening pressure or vacuum of the pressure relief and vacuum relief valves shall be checked by
pumping air above the water level and releasing the pressure, then partially withdrawing water from the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.5.6  After the tank has been emptied of water and is at atmospheric pressure, the anchorage, if provided, shall
be rechecked for tightness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.5.7  Air pressure equal to the design pressure shall be applied to the empty tank, and the anchorage, if provided,
and the foundation shall be checked for uplift.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.6.6 Temporary Openings after Hydrostatic Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.6.6.1  When approved by the Purchaser in writing, and only in the case of tanks which when complete have no
shell penetrations, it is permitted to restore by welding up to four temporary shell openings after the hydrostatic test in
accordance with the provisions of this section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.6.6.2  Each temporary opening shall be restored by the insertion of a shell plate that matches the thickness and
specification of adjacent shell material, and is welded into place with full fusion butt-welds. The insert plate shall be
round with diameter no less than 24 in. and no greater than 42 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.6.6.3  The insert plate weld shall not cross any shell seams and shall be at least the greater of 10 times the shell
thickness or 12 in. from any other weld in the shell including shell seams, shell-to-bottom weld or attachment welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>R.8.2 Uplift on Foundation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.8.2.1  The increased uplift described in R.8.2.2 and R.8.2.3 is intended to apply to the size of the ringwall and
foundation but not to the anchorage.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>R.8.2.2  For tanks with an internal design pressure less than 1 lbf/in. 2  gauge, the uplift shall be taken as the smaller
of the maximum uplift values computed under the following conditions:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The internal design pressure times 1.5 plus the design wind load on the shell and roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The internal design pressure plus 0.25 lbf/in. 2  gauge plus the design wind load on the shell and roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.8.2.3  For tanks with an internal design pressure of 1 lbf/in. 2  gauge and over, the uplift, if any, shall be calculated
under the combined conditions of 1.25 times the internal design condition plus the design wind load on the shell and
roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R.8.2.4  When the anchorage is designed to meet the requirements of R.3.7.4.2, the foundation should be designed
to resist the uplift that results from three times the design pressure with the tank full to the design liquid level. When
designing to any of the conditions of this paragraph, it is permissible to utilize friction between the soil and the vertical
face of the ringwall and all of the effective liquid weight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>S.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Special precautions must be observed to minimize the risk of damage to the corrosion resistance of stainless steel.
Stainless steel shall be handled in a manner that minimizes contact with iron or other types of steel during all phases
of fabrication, shipping, and construction. The following sections describe the major precautions that shall be
observed during fabrication and handling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>S.4.2 Storage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Storage should be under cover and removed from shop dirt, fumes, and pickling operations. If outside storage is
necessary, provisions shall be made for rainwater to drain and allow the material to dry. Stainless steel shall not be
stored in contact with carbon steel. Materials containing chlorides, including foods, beverages, oils, and greases, shall
not come in contact with stainless steel. Inadvertent contamination shall be removed by methods described in S.4.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>S.4.3 Thermal Cutting<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>S.4.3.1  Thermal cutting of stainless steel shall be by the iron powder burning carbon arc or the plasma-arc method.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S.4.3.2  Thermal cutting of stainless steel may leave a heat-affected zone and intergranular carbide precipitates.
This heat-affected zone may have reduced corrosion resistance unless removed by machining, grinding, or solution
annealing and quenching. The Purchaser shall specify if the heat-affected zone is to be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>S.4.4 Forming<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>S.4.4.1  Stainless steels shall be formed by a cold, warm, or hot forming procedure that is non-injurious to the
material.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>S.4.4.2  Stainless steels may be cold formed, providing the maximum strain produced by such forming does not
exceed 10% and control of forming spring-back is provided in the forming procedure.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S.4.4.3  Warm forming at 540 °C (1000 °F) to 650 °C (1200 °F) may cause intergranular carbide precipitation in 304,
316, and 317 grades of stainless steel. Unless stainless steel in this sensitized condition is acceptable for the service
of the equipment, it will be necessary to use 304L, 316L, or 317L grades or to solution anneal and quench after
forming. Warm forming shall be performed only with agreement of the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

technique that has been demonstrated to perform acceptably per U.4.3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>U.6.3.2  The dimensions of the flaw shall be defined by the rectangle that fully contains the area of the flaw. The
length ( l ) of the flaw shall be drawn parallel to the inside pressure-retaining surface of the component. The height ( h )
of the flaw shall be drawn normal to the inside pressure retaining surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>U.6.4 Flaw Categorization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the space between the surface and the flaw in the thru-thickness direction is less than one-half the measured height
of the flaw, then the flaw shall be categorized as a surface flaw with flaw height extending to the surface of the
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>U.6.5 Grouping of Multiple Flaws<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>U.6.5.1  Discontinuous flaws that are oriented primarily in parallel planes shall be considered to lie in a single plane if
the distance between the adjacent planes is equal to or less than 13 mm ( 1 / 2  in.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>U.6.5.2  If the space between two flaws, aligned along the axis of weld, is less than the length of the longer of the
two, the two flaws shall be considered a singular flaw.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>U.6.6 Flaw Acceptance Criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>U.6.6.1 Acceptance Criteria Tables<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flaw dimensions resulting after the application of the rules of U.6.3, U.6.4, and U.6.5 shall be evaluated for
acceptance using the applicable criteria of Table U-1 or U-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>U.6.6.2 Surface Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flaws characterized as surface flaws during the UT examination may or may not be surface connected. Therefore,
unless the UT data analysis confirms that the flaw is not surface connected, a supplemental surface examination (MT
or PT) shall be performed in accordance with 5.15.2 or 5.15.4 as applicable for all surface flaws. Any flaws detected
by MT or PT, and characterized as planar, are unacceptable, regardless of length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>U.7 Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All repaired areas, plus the lesser of 25 mm (1 in.) or  t  of the adjoining weld on each side of the repair, shall be
reinspected per this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>U.8 Flaw Documentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the data record prescribed by U.3.4, written documentation shall be produced for each unacceptable
flaw and those acceptable flaws that either exceed 50 % of reference level for amplitude based techniques or exceed
75 % of the acceptable length for non-amplitude techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>X.1.1  This annex covers materials, design, fabrication, erection, and testing requirements for aboveground, welded,
duplex stainless steel storage tanks constructed of material grades 2205 (UNS S31803), 2003 (UNS S32003), 2101
(UNS S32101), 2102 (UNS S82011), 2202 (UNS S32202), 2205 (UNS S32205), 2304 (UNS S32304), 255 (UNS
S32550), 255+ (UNS S32520), 2507 (UNS S32750), and Z100 (UNS S32760).This annex does not cover stainless
steel clad plate or strip lined construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X.1.2  This annex applies only to tanks in non-refrigerated services with a maximum design temperature limited as
given in 1.2.2 and a minimum design metal temperature equal to or higher than –40 °C (–40 °F). Ambient
temperature tanks (non-heated) shall have a design temperature of 40 °C (100 °F). It is cautioned that exothermic
reactions occurring inside unheated storage tanks can produce temperatures exceeding 40 °C (100 °F). For the
purposes of this annex, the design temperature shall be the maximum operating temperature as specified by the
Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.1.3  The minimum thicknesses in this annex do not contain any allowance for corrosion.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.1.4  This annex states only the requirements that differ from the basic rules in this standard. For requirements not
stated, the basic rules must be followed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.2 Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.2.1 Selection and Ordering<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.2.1.1  Materials shall be in accordance with Table X-1.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X.2.1.2  Specification of the type/grade of duplex   stainless steel depends on the service and environment to which it
will be exposed and the effects of fabrication processes. The Purchaser shall select the type/grade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X.2.1.3  External structural attachments may be carbon steels meeting the requirements of Section 4 of this
standard, providing any permanent attachments are protected from corrosion. (This does not include shell, roof, or
bottom openings and their reinforcement.) Carbon steel attachments (e.g., clips for scaffolding) shall not be welded
directly to any internal surface of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.2.2 Packaging<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Packaging duplex stainless steel for shipment is important to maintain its corrosion resistance. Precautions to protect
the surface of the material depend on the surface finish supplied and may vary among manufacturers. Standard
packaging methods may not be sufficient to protect the material from normal shipping damage. If the intended service
requires special precautions, the Purchaser shall specify special instructions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
