background on editions of API welded storage tank standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
atmospheric pressure
When referring to (vertical) tanks, the term “atmospheric pressure” usually means tanks designed to API 650,
although API 620 uses the term atmospheric pressure to describe tanks designed to withstand an internal pressure
not exceeding the weight of the roof plates. API 650 also provides for rules to design tanks for “higher internal
pressure” up to 2.5 lbf/in. 2  (18 kPa). API 653 uses the generic meaning for atmospheric pressure to describe tanks
designed to withstand an internal pressure up to, but not exceeding 2.5 lbf/in. 2  (18 kPa) gauge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4
authorized inspection agency
The inspection organization having jurisdiction for a given aboveground storage tank. It can be one of the following .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The inspection organization of an insurance company which is licensed or registered to and does write
aboveground storage tank insurance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) An owner or operator of one or more aboveground storage tank(s) who maintains an inspection organization for
activities relating only to his equipment and not for aboveground storage tanks intended for sale or resale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) An independent organization or individual under contract to and under the direction of an owner or operator and

this document, only atmospheric and low-pressure storage tanks are considered. Guidelines for inspection of
pressure vessels operating at pressures greater than 15 lbf/in 2  (103 kPa) gauge are covered in API 572.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1 Storage Tanks with Linings and/or Cathodic Protection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where internal corrosion is experienced or expected, tanks can be lined with a variety of corrosion resistant materials
such as coatings of epoxy or vinyl, fiberglass, poured or sprayed concrete, alloy steel, aluminum, rubber, lead,
synthetics such as HDPE or hypalon, and glass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See API 652 for provisions for the application of tank bottom linings to both existing and new storage tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cathodic protection systems are often provided for control of external bottom corrosion and, combined with internal
linings, may also be used to protect tank bottoms internally. See API 651 for design, maintenance, and monitoring
recommendations for such systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.2 Storage Tanks with Leak Detection Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unprotected storage tank bottoms may leak because of top-side or under-side corrosion or both. API 650, Appendix I,
provides design guidelines for leak detection and subgrade protection. Reference also API 306, API 307, API 315,
API 322, API 323, API 325, API 334, API 340, and API 341 for additional information on leak detection systems for

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Atmospheric Storage Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1 Construction, Materials, and Design Standards<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Atmospheric storage tanks are designed to operate with internal gas and vapor spaces at pressures close to
atmospheric pressure. Such tanks are usually constructed of carbon steel, alloy steel, aluminum or other metals,
depending on service. Additionally, some tanks are constructed of non-metallic materials such as reinforced concrete,
reinforced thermoset plastics, and wood. Some wooden tanks constructed to API 12E are still in service. Atmospheric
storage tanks are generally welded. Some riveted tanks constructed to API 12A and some bolted tanks constructed to
API 12B can also be found still in service. Information for the construction of atmospheric storage tanks is given in API
12A (withdrawn), API 12B, API 12C (the predecessor to API 650 and now withdrawn), API 12D, API 12E (withdrawn),
API 12F, API 650, API 620 and API 2000. API 625 covers the selection, design and construction of tank systems for
refrigerated liquefied gas storage on land. API 653 provides information pertaining to requirements for inspection,
repair, and reconstruction of aboveground storage tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2 Use of Atmospheric Storage Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Atmospheric storage tanks in the petroleum industry are normally used for fluids having a true vapor pressure that is
less than atmospheric pressure. Vapor pressure is the pressure on the surface of a confined liquid caused by the
vapors of that liquid. Vapor pressure increases with increasing temperature. Crude oil, heavy oils, gas oils, furnace
oils, naphtha, gasoline, and non-volatile chemicals are usually stored in atmospheric storage tanks. Many of these
tanks are protected by pressure-vacuum vents that limit the pressure difference between the tank vapor space and
the outside atmosphere to a few ounces per square inch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Non-petroleum industry uses of atmospheric tanks include storage of a variety of chemicals and other substances
operated in closed-loop systems not vented to atmosphere and with pressure control and relief devices as required.
These tanks may be designed and operated as low-pressure storage tanks per API 620. See 4.3 for additional
information on tanks operated at low pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Additional uses for atmospheric storage tanks can include liquid (both hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon) storage in
horizontal vessels, storage of process liquids or granular solids in skirt-supported or column-supported tanks with
elevated cone bottoms (non-flat bottom) and process water/liquids in open-top tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3 Types of Atmospheric Storage Tank Roofs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most common type of atmospheric storage tank is the fixed cone roof tank (see Figure 1). Fixed cone roof tanks
may typically be up to 300 ft (91.5 m) in diameter and 64 ft (19.5 m) in height (although larger diameter tanks have
been built, mostly outside the U.S.). These roofs are normally supported by internal structural rafters, girders and
columns but can be fully self-supporting in smaller diameters (typically, 60 ft [18.3 m] diameter or less). Geodesic
domes may be applied to any diameter tank without the need for internal supporting columns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The umbrella roof tank (shown in Figure 2) and the geodesic dome roof tank (shown in Figure 3) are variations of the
fixed roof tank. The umbrella roof has radially-arched segmental plates with integral framing support members
(usually without internal support columns). The aluminum dome utilizes the geometric properties of the geodesic
design and tubing members covered by aluminum sheeting for strength. In the steel dome roof tank shown in
Figure 4, the roof plates are usually formed with curved segments joined to be self-supporting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The floating-roof tank is another common type of atmospheric storage tank. The floating-roof tank is designed to
minimize filling and breathing losses by eliminating or minimizing the vapor space above the stored liquid. The shell
and bottom of this type of tank are similar to those of the fixed roof tanks, but in this case, the roof is designed to float
on the surface of the stored liquid. Older styles of floating roofs include single steel deck details without annular
pontoons as shown in Figure 5. This external floating roof type is not longer permitted under API 650, Appendix C.
Such roofs have no reserve buoyancy and are susceptible to sinking in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 5—Pan Type Floating-roof Tank<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annular-pontoon and double-deck roofs are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively. Some floating-roof tanks
have fixed aluminum geodesic dome roofs installed on top of the tank shell to reduce product vapor loss or to
eliminate the need to drain rainwater from the roof. These are considered internal floating roofs .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cross-sectional sketches showing important features of floating roofs are shown in Figure 8. Floating-roof sealing
systems are used to seal the space between the tank wall and the floating roof, typically with a mechanical seal. This
type of seal consists of a shoe which is a plate that is pressed against the tank wall by springs (or by counter-weights
in older designs) or other tensioning system, with a flexible vapor membrane attached between the shoe and the
floating-roof outer rim. Typical examples of this type of floating-roof seal are shown in Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure
11. One alternative seal detail occasionally still found in existing tanks is the tube seal shown in Figure 12. These
tubes are filled with solid foam, liquid, or air. Figure 13 and Figure 14 illustrate various pontoon roofs and seal details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another type of tank has both a fixed roof and an internal floating roof. The fixed roof is usually a supported cone or
dome (of steel or aluminum). The internal floating roof can be constructed of steel, aluminum, or other material, as
shown in Figure 14. Such tanks are usually built to alleviate weather-related concerns about the flotation of an
external floating roof, to reduce vapor emissions, or to prevent product contamination. An existing fixed roof tank often<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>can be modified by the installation of an internal floating roof. Cone roofs with an internal floating roof supported by
cables suspended from the fixed cone roof are a newer design that is being used (see Figure 13).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 650, Appendix H, classifies internal floating roofs into the following types .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Metallic internal floating roofs 10 , 11 , 12  have a peripheral rim above the liquid for buoyancy. These roofs are in full
contact with the liquid surface and are typically constructed of steel. See Figure 15.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Metallic open top bulk-headed internal floating roofs 11,12  have peripheral open-top bulk-headed compartments for
buoyancy. Distributed open-top bulk-headed compartments shall be used as required. These roofs are in full
contact with the liquid surface and are typically constructed of steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Metallic pontoon internal floating roofs have peripheral closed-top bulk-headed compartments for buoyancy.
Distributed closed-top bulk-headed compartments shall be used as required. These roofs are in full contact with
the liquid surface and are typically constructed of steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Metallic double-deck internal floating roofs have continuous closed top and bottom decks that contain bulk-
headed compartments for buoyancy. These roofs are in full contact with the liquid surface and are typically
constructed of steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Metallic internal floating roofs on floats have their deck above the liquid, supported by closed pontoon
compartments for buoyancy. These roof decks are not in full contact with the liquid surface and are typically
constructed of aluminum alloys or stainless steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other less commonly used atmospheric storage tank roof details include the lifter-type roof and the breather-type
roof. Lifter-type roofs prevent vapor losses from the tank by means of liquid or dry seals. Liquid-seal lifter roofs have a
skirt on the roof edge which fits into a trough filled with liquid. Dry-seal lifter roofs have a flexible membrane connected<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10  The purchaser is cautioned that this design does not have multiple floatation compartments necessary to meet the
requirements of H.4.2.1.3 in API 650.
11  These designs contain no closed buoyancy compartments, and are subject to flooding during sloshing or during application of
fire-fighting foam/water solution. Also, without bracing of the rim being provided by the pontoon top plate, design to resist
buckling of the rim must be evaluated.
12  If the floating roof is: a) a metallic pan roof with or without bulkheads, or b) a non-metallic roof with or without closed buoyancy
compartments, then the tank is considered a fixed-roof tank (i.e. having no internal floating roof) for the requirements of NFPA
30. See NFPA 30 for spacing restrictions on floating roof tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

limits as the tank is filled and emptied or when a change in temperature causes vaporization of the stored product.
These types of lifter-roof tanks are less commonly found in service today than in the past.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the breather-type roof, a number of methods are used to provide expansion space for vapors without using a loose
external roof. The plain breather-type tank (shown in Figure 16) has a flat roof that is essentially a flexible steel
membrane which is able to move up and down within rather narrow limits. The balloon-type roof (shown in Figure 18)
is a modification of the plain breather-type roof that is capable of a greater change of volume. A tank with a vapor-
dome roof (shown in Figure 17 and Figure 19) uses an added fixed dome with a flexible membrane attached to the
walls that is free to move up and down. This type of vapor roof may be designed to provide for any desired change in
volume. Vapor recovery systems may use this type of tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vapor recovery systems can be provided on several types of tanks such as a fixed cone roof like Figure 1, umbrella
roofs like Figure 2 and vapor dome roofs like Figure 17. Adjustment in relieve value settings will be required to
accommodate the operating parameters for the vapor recovery system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Small cylindrical tanks, usually with flat heads or end plates, can be used for the storage of small quantities of liquids
at atmospheric pressure. These tanks can be placed in either the vertical position or the horizontal position. A typical
horizontal tank is shown in Figure 20.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

spheroid tank types are commonly used. Tanks for this application are now typically constructed as spheres. Such
tanks are designed to withstand the vapor pressure that may be developed within a tank having no devices or means
to change or relieve the internal volume. As with atmospheric storage tanks, these tanks are provided with relief
valves to prevent pressures from rising above design values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks with a plain spherical roof and tanks with a noded spherical roof are shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22,
respectively; and cross-sectional view is shown in Figure 23. Figure 25 shows a spherical roof with a knuckle radius
or smooth transition at the intersection of the shell and top head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The spheroid uses elements of different radii, resulting in a somewhat flattened shape as shown in Figure 21. The
noded spheroid, shown in Figure 26, is used for larger volumes, and internal ties and supports help to distribute the
shell stresses. Figure 27 shows a cross-section of a noded spheroid. Noded spheroids are no longer constructed;
they have been replaced either by spheres or by vertical cylindrical storage tanks as referenced in API 620.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5 Reasons for Inspection and Causes of Deterioration<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Reasons for Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basic reasons for inspection are to determine the physical condition of the tank and to determine the type, rate,
and causes of damage mechanisms and associated deterioration. This information should be carefully documented
after each inspection (see Section 10 for a list of example documentation). The information and data gained from an
inspection contributes to the planning of future inspections, repairs, replacement, and yields a history that may form
the basis of a risk based inspection (RBI) assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The petroleum industry is committed to protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of its employees
and the public at large. Therefore, minimizing the incidence of leaking petroleum storage tanks is a high priority for the
industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2 Safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the primary reasons to conduct periodic scheduled inspections is to identify deficiencies that could result in a
process safety incident, such as loss of containment, which could lead to fire, toxic exposure, or other environmental
hazard. These deficiencies should be addressed immediately through evaluation, further inspection, or repair when
identified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3 Reliability and Efficient Operation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External inspections performed while the equipment is in operation using non-destructive techniques may reveal
important information without requiring entry into the tank. With such data, mechanical integrity can be maintained
and fitness for service or risk based inspection (RBI) evaluations can be performed, which can aid in maximizing the
period of operation without a shutdown. In addition, repair and replacement requirements can be planned and
estimated in advance of a shutdown to more effectively utilize downtime. These efforts can therefore contribute to
overall plant reliability by minimizing required downtime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.4 Regulatory Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Regulatory requirements typically cover only those conditions that affect safety and environmental concerns. In
general, regulatory bodies require the compliance with an industry standard or code, or adherence to Recognized
and Generally Accepted Good Engineering Practice (RAGAGEP) when performing any inspection and repair
activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_30>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>22
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 653 was developed to provide an industry standard for the inspection of above ground storage tanks. It has been
adopted by a number of regulatory and jurisdictional authorities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many regulatory groups (including OSHA in the United States) require that operating companies follow internal
procedures in addition to applicable codes and standards. Internal procedures regarding inspection of tanks should
encompass the requirements outlined in API 653 to help ensure compliance with many of the regulatory and
jurisdictional authorities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the United States, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has issued a revised Spill Prevention, Control, and
Countermeasures (SPCC) rule that covers most petroleum storage facilities. These regulations allow tank owners
and operators to use industry standards and practices to implement and ensure an effective storage tank integrity
program. Currently the most widely recognized tank inspection standards are API 653, API 12R1, STI SP001, and
EEMUA 159.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Regulatory requirements for emission sources (such as floating-roof seals and tank vents) should be considered
when establishing the inspection plans for tanks, as some environmental regulations may require intervals shorted
than those stipulated by API 653. In some cases, more frequent inspections or additional inspections of some
emission sources may be prudent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspections are an important part of avoiding failures, maintaining safety, and optimizing availability. Therefore it is
prudent to take a proactive approach towards storage tank inspection and maintenance to ensure continued integrity
of the assets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Deterioration of Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion is the prime cause for the deterioration of steel storage tanks and accessories. Locating and measuring the
extent of corrosion is a major reason for storage tank inspection. If left unchecked, tank deterioration can
progressively lead to failure which may have adverse effects such as endangering personnel, environmental and
property damage, and business interruptions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1 External Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Atmospheric corrosion can occur on all external parts of a tank. The type of tank, construction details, and
environmental conditions can all affect the location, extent, and severity of external corrosion. For example, a
sulfurous, acidic or marine atmosphere can damage protective coatings and increase the rate of corrosion. External
surfaces of the tank and auxiliary equipment will corrode more rapidly if they are not protected with paint or other
coatings where surfaces are in contact with moisture or the ground. Extended contact with water is likely to cause
localized corrosion. Such susceptible areas should be protected with coatings designed to withstand long-term
immersion. Inspections should target areas where tank construction details cause water or sediment to accumulate .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External corrosion of tank bottoms can be significant. The foundation material used for forming a pad that is directly in
contact with the steel bottom plates may contain materials that promote corrosion. For example, cinder may contain
sulfur compounds that become very corrosive in the presence of moisture. The presence of clay, wood, gravel, or
crushed stone as contaminants in a sand pad may cause pitting corrosion at each point of contact. Faulty pad
preparation or poor drainage may allow water to remain in contact with the tank bottom. If a tank previously leaked
corrosive fluid through its bottom, accumulation of the fluid underneath the tank can cause external corrosion of the
bottom plates. For tanks that are supported above grade, an improperly sealed ringwall, as shown in Figure 28, may
allow moisture to accumulate between the tank and the support, thereby accelerating corrosion. Asphalt-impregnated
fiberboard is not a recommended sealant for tanks sitting on concrete ringwall foundations. The lower tank shell can
become severely externally corroded near the grade line where soil movement has raised the grade level to cover the
lower portion of the shell. External corrosion also occurs when insulation absorbs ground or surface water by wicking
action, or when damaged or improperly sealed openings around nozzles and attachments allow water behind
insulation. Containment areas should be drained as soon as possible after water accumulates to minimize the
possibility of bottom or lower shell corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Riveted tanks are becoming increasingly rare in refinery and petrochemical plant operations, as they are difficult to
design, construct and maintain. However, some riveted tanks are still in service, and are included in inspection plans.
API 650 does not provide guidance for the construction of riveted tanks. Therefore, other design and construction
standards should be referenced. Riveted tanks have many niches where concentration cell corrosion can occur (see
8.2.9). Leaks at the seams of riveted tanks may cause failure of external coatings, allowing external corrosion to
develop.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2 Internal Corrosion / Deterioration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The occurrence of internal corrosion in a storage tank depends on the contents of the tank and its materials of
construction. API 571 is a primary resource document for damage mechanisms in the refining industry and provides
guidance as to the susceptibility, detection, and mitigation of most active mechanisms experienced in storage tanks.
Inspectors can consult this document when developing the inspection plan for a tank to ensure that proper inspection
and NDE is applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Crude oil and petroleum product tanks are usually constructed of carbon steel. Internal corrosion of these tanks in the
vapor space (i.e. above the liquid level) can be caused by hydrogen sulfide vapor, water vapor, oxygen, or any
combination of these. In the areas in contact with the stored liquid, corrosion is commonly caused by acid salts,
hydrogen sulfide or other sulfur compounds, dew point corrosion, or contaminated water that settles out and mixes
with solids on the bottom of the tank, typically referred to as bottom sediment and water (BS&W). Issues of stress
corrosion cracking can be of particular concern when the product is known to be corrosive to welds and other heat-
affected zones. Ethanol, DEA, and caustic products are just a few of the products that can contribute to this condition
when in contact with bare metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some cases, it is necessary to use linings (see API 652) that are more resistant to the stored fluid than are the
materials of construction. In some particularly corrosive services, it may be necessary to construct the tanks of a more
resistant material such as aluminum, stainless steels, or other alloys. These materials can experience deterioration
from less common mechanisms such as caustic stress corrosion cracking, acid erosion, flow erosion, electrolytic
reactions, and cyclic fatigue, among others.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Deterioration of Other than Flat Bottom and Non-steel Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks can be constructed of materials other than carbon steel. Aluminum, stainless steels and other alloys, wood,
and concrete tanks can occasionally be found in refineries, chemical plants, and terminals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks constructed of wood can rot unless they are adequately protected. They also can deteriorate from infestation
by insects such as termites. Unless kept continually moist, these tanks can shrink and may leak when refilled. If steel
bands are present, the bands can be subject to atmospheric corrosion and may loosen under repeated cycling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_32>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>24
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concrete tanks can be attacked by the tank contents, crack because of ground settling or temperature changes, or
spall due to atmospheric conditions, resulting in exposure of the steel reinforcement to further atmospheric corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks constructed of materials such as aluminum, stainless steels, and other alloys are usually used for special
purposes, such as food processing (for product purity), or because of product corrosion concerns. They are subject to
some of the same mechanical damage mechanisms as carbon steel tanks. In addition, external stress corrosion
cracking of stainless steel tanks may be a concern if chlorides that may be present in insulation get wet or enter the
insulation. Aluminum can be affected by impurities such as acids or mercury compounds in process streams or
wastewater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks can also be constructed of details that are not vertical, cylindrical, or flat bottomed. These tanks are usually
classified as horizontal (axis of tank is in horizontal plane), skirt-supported, or column-supported with cone bottoms
(with a vertical major axis). These latter tanks can be classified as bins or silos and very often hold granular or non-
petroleum liquids or solids such as grain, cement, process liquids, carbon black, coker fines, and similar materials.
Bins and silos, especially in granular product service, can suffer mechanical damage in operation including shell
deformation and fatigue (from agitators or vibrators). Due to moisture entrapment, horizontal tanks on saddle
supports can experience external corrosion at the saddle-to-tank interface. These areas are often inaccessible and
difficult to inspect with normal inspection methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is not possible to present all of the different or specific details that can be present in wooden tanks, concrete tanks,
or steel bins and silos in this document. Careful examination and assessment should be planned based on prior
inspection or similar service issues, type of construction details, and materials of construction. Structural integrity
assessment may require use of a qualified engineer familiar with the type of tank design and operation in question.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Leaks, Cracks, and Mechanical Deterioration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Storage tanks should be inspected for leaks (current or imminent) or defects to minimize or prevent loss; hazard to
personnel; pollution of air, ground water, and waterways; and damage to other equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Brittle fracture and sudden loss of the contents of a tank can result in injuries to personnel and extensive damage to
equipment in surrounding areas. Pollution of streams or waterways can result when such a tank failure occurs near a
waterway or is connected to one by a sewer or other flow channel. Figure 30 illustrates the complete loss of a tank
from brittle fracture. Proper design, fabrication, operation, inspection, and maintenance will minimize the probability of
brittle fracture. A detailed discussion of brittle fracture can be found in API 571. API 653, Section 5.3 provides a
procedure to assess the risk of tank failure due to brittle fracture and guidance for lowering the risk of brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leaks are primarily the result of corrosion but can occur at improperly welded or riveted joints, at pipe thread or
gasket connections or cover plates, or at crack-like flaws (including arc strikes on plates) in welds or in plate material.
Three-plate laps in lap-welded tank bottoms are particularly prone to defects that can lead to leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Crack-like flaws can result from a number of causes including deficiencies in design, fabrication, and maintenance.
The most likely points for crack-like flaws to occur are at the bottom-to-shell details, around nozzle connections, at
manholes, around rivet holes or around rivet heads, at welded brackets or supports, and at welded seams. The lower-
shell-to-sketch-plate or shell-to-bottom weld is especially critical because in relatively large or relatively hot tanks
there is a higher likelihood for this detail to develop a crack-like flaw due to high stresses. Potential for this occurrence
can be minimized by the use of thicker, butt-welded annular bottom plates, which are required by API 650 for higher
design stress tanks and for larger elevated temperature tanks (see API 650, Sections 5.5 and M.4.1, respectively).
Photographs of typical crack-like flaws in tanks are shown in Figure 29, Figure 31, and Figure 32. Other cracking
mechanisms are possible, including stress corrosion cracking (SCC).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many other types of mechanical deterioration can develop over the service life of a storage tank. If such deterioration
is discovered early through inspection, continued deterioration can be minimized and potential failures and leaks can
be prevented. Early detection of deterioration and conditions that cause deterioration permits cost-effective
maintenance and repair to be done on a scheduled basis, minimizing the risk of failure. Examples of such<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>deterioration can include severe service conditions like frequent fill/withdrawal cycling or elevated temperature (see
API 650, Appendix M) affecting the integrity of the shell-to-bottom weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Settlement of a tank due to soil movement under the tank or tank foundation can also cause mechanical deterioration.
Uniform settlement of the entire tank would not necessarily cause structural damage or be considered a serious
issue. Large or uneven amounts of settlement can cause nozzles with attached piping to become over-stressed and
possibly deformed or cracked, or may affect the normal operation of a floating roof. Significant amounts of uneven
settlement should be cause for concern and for further investigation. Edge settlement in tanks with cone-down
bottoms can trap BS&W, resulting in bottom and lower shell corrosion in this area. Soil and water can also be retained
against the external shell when such settlement is present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Deterioration and Failure of Auxiliary Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure-vacuum vents and flame arrestors can fail to operate for the following reasons:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the presence of fouling material or debris;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) corrosion between moving parts and guides or seats;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) deposit of foreign substances by birds or insects;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) formation of ice;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) accumulation of grit-blasting material;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
the covering of the vent opening with plastic or the plugging of vent openings with paint during painting operations
that is not subsequently removed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) tampering by unauthorized personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examination of tank venting devices should be included in a periodic inspection to ensure that their proper operation
and protection are maintained. API 576 provides information regarding inspection of pressure-relieving devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gauge float leakage can be caused by corrosion or cracking. Inoperative pulleys, bent or broken float tapes, or
plugged guides can cause float-type gauging devices to become inoperative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Equipment for draining water from floating roofs can be rendered inoperable by plugging or by mechanical damage
caused by debris, ice, or rotation of the floating roof. Drain piping, mechanical joints, and hoses can develop leaks
that will allow the tank contents either to leak from the roof drain system or allow water to flow into the tank. For single
deck floating roofs, leakage of the tank contents onto the floating roof may be sufficient to submerge or sink the roof.
Inoperative drains with installed plugs (or with closed valves) can cause enough rain water to accumulate on the roof
to sink a pontoon-type floating roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deterioration of auxiliary equipment—such as ladders, stairways, platforms, wind girders, and shell stiffeners—can
occur from corrosion, wind, and other external forces. Mechanical equipment such as mixers, swing line pontoons,
piping and swing joints, diffusers, jet nozzles and other flow direction details, baffles, rakes, and agitators can suffer
from deterioration due to corrosion, wear from flow erosion, and mechanical defects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 653, Annex C includes inspection checklists for many types of deterioration of storage tank auxiliary equipment
and other appurtenances. The tank inspector should be thoroughly familiar with these checklists.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 Inspection Plans<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An inspection plan is often developed and implemented for tanks within the scope API 653. An inspection plan should
contain the inspection tasks, scope of inspection, and schedule required to monitor damage mechanisms and assure
the mechanical integrity of the tank. The plan will typically:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) define the type(s) of inspection needed, e.g. external;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) identify the next inspection interval and date for each inspection type;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) describe the extent and locations of inspection and NDE;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) describe any surface cleaning requirements needed for inspection and examinations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
describe the requirements of any needed pressure or tightness test, e.g. type of test, test pressure, and duration;
and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) describe any required repairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other common details in an inspection plan include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— describing the types of damage mechanisms anticipated or experienced in the tank;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— defining the location of the damage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— defining any special access requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection plans for tanks can be maintained in spreadsheets, hard copy files and proprietary inspection software
databases. Proprietary software, typically used by inspection groups, often assists in inspection data analysis and
recordkeeping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Developing an Inspection Plan<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An inspection plan is often developed through the collaborative work of the inspector, engineer, corrosion specialist
and operations personnel. They should consider several pieces of information such as operating temperature ranges,
process fluid corrosive contaminant levels, material of construction, tank design and configuration, service changes
since the last inspection, and inspection/maintenance history. In addition, other information sources can be consulted,
including API and NACE publications, to obtain industry experience with similar services. All of this information
provides a basis for defining the types of damage and locations for its occurrence. Knowledge of the capabilities and
limitations of NDE techniques allows the proper choice of examination technique(s) to identify particular damage
mechanism in specific locations. Ongoing communication with operating personnel when process changes and/or
upsets occur that could affect damage mechanisms and rates are critical to keeping an inspection plan updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For tanks, inspection plans should address the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) locations for inspection;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) access requirements (scaffolding or other supports);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) types of NDE to be used;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) tank cleaning required;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) specific surface preparation required (including paint or coating removal);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection plans may be based upon various criteria but should include a risk assessment or fixed intervals as
defined in API 653.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1 Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) Plans<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.1  Inspection plans based upon an assessment of the risk associated with a tank failure (by determining the
likelihood of failure and the consequence of failure) is referred to as RBI. RBI may be used to determine inspection
intervals and the type and extent of future inspection/examinations. API 580 details the systematic evaluation of both
the likelihood of failure and consequence of failure for establishing RBI plans. API 653 outlines the requirements and
limitations for performing an RBI assessment for a storage tank. In addition, regulatory requirements in the applicable
jurisdiction should be considered to determine acceptability of using RBI for inspection planning and scheduling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.2  Identifying and evaluating potential damage mechanisms, current tank condition and the effectiveness of the
past inspections are important steps in assessing the likelihood of a tank failure. The likelihood assessment should
consider all forms of degradation that could reasonably be expected to affect tanks in any particular service.
Examples of those degradation mechanisms include: internal or external metal loss from an identified form of
corrosion (localized or general), all forms of cracking, including stress corrosion cracking (SCC) (from the inside or
outside surfaces of a tank), and any other forms of metallurgical, corrosion, or mechanical degradation, such as
fatigue, embrittlement, creep, etc. See API 571 for details of common degradation mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.3  Identifying and evaluating the process fluid(s) in the tank and the potential for injuries, loss of containment,
environmental impacts, and unit loss of production are important aspects in assessing the consequences associated
with a failure of tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1.4  Any RBI assessment should be thoroughly documented in accordance with API 580, defining all the factors
contributing to both the probability and consequence of a failure.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1.5  After an RBI assessment is conducted, the results may be used to establish the inspection plan and better
define the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the most appropriate inspection and NDE methods, tools, and techniques;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the extent of NDE (e.g. percentage or location of tank surface to examine);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the interval for internal, external, and on-stream inspections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the prevention and mitigation steps to reduce the probability and consequence of a failure (e.g. repairs,
operational procedures, cathodic protection, coatings, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2 Interval-based Inspection Plans<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection plans which are based upon the specific inspection intervals defined in API 653 are referred to as interval-
based. The interval for inspections is based upon a number of factors, including the corrosion rate and remaining life
calculations, applicable jurisdictional requirements and the judgment of the inspector, the tank engineer, or a
corrosion specialist. The governing factor in the inspection plan for many tanks is the maximum appropriate interval
for inspection of the floor, as most other components can be inspected externally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_38>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>30
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 Frequency and Extent of Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Frequency of Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 653 provides requirements for inspection frequency of tanks built to API 650 and its predecessor, API 12C. API
12R1 provides guidance for inspection frequency for tanks built to API 12B, API 12D, API 12F, and API 12P (oil and
gas production, treating, and processing services).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 653 provides criteria for condition based inspection and scheduling of tanks utilizing internal and external visual
inspection results and data from various NDE techniques (also refer to 6.2). API 653 also recognizes the use of
alternative inspection methodologies. For example, robotic inspection is one possible approach to perform an
assessment of the tank bottom and other internal components without personnel entry. The application of risk-based
inspection (RBI) procedures to determine inspection intervals may result in longer or shorter inspection intervals (refer
to 6.3, API 580, and API 581).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although inspections are normally scheduled on intervals ranging from monthly to 20 years or more, some
circumstances warrant immediate action to mitigate the potential for imminent hazards. For example, holes in the
liquid or vapor space of the tank may pose immediate hazards. These holes can release flammable vapors, leading to
serious incidents. Even without a substantial vapor release, the vapor space inside the tank may potentially be ignited
by nearby hot work, lightning or other causes, leading to very serious incidents. Holes in tanks should either be
immediately addressed or the tank should be taken out of service and the holes repaired .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In-service visual inspections are intended to be performed more frequently for early detection of changes or
deficiencies, and should be performed on tanks covered by API 653. In-service inspections should include checking
for corrosion, leaks, settlement, distortion, and determining the condition of the foundation, insulation systems, and
paint systems. Observations, especially of a change in condition, should be documented and reported to qualified
personnel, such as a tank specialist, for further assessment and evaluation. For example, indications of settlement
may prompt a formal settlement analysis and/or a structured monitoring program. The interval of an in-service
inspection should be based on experience and risk and should be determined by someone knowledgeable about the
tank and its operation. In no case should the interval of in-service visual inspections be less than that prescribed by
API 653.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After severe climatic events (e.g. high winds, high water, heavy rain or lightning strikes), it may be desirable to check
potentially affected components. These components include, but are not limited to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the external floating roofs for excessive water loads;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the foundation for deterioration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the external floating-roof deck and seals to see if they have been damaged;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the shell for evidence of deformation due to excessive loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After significant seismic events the tank, floating roof, and associated tank piping should be carefully inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If leakage is detected during an in-service inspection, a tank specialist should investigate to determine whether the
leakage is caused by internal or external corrosion or some other condition that can be corrected while the tank
remains in service. If the leak cannot be corrected with the tank in service, remedial steps should be taken as soon as
possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another aspect of inspection that is critical to safe operations is the inspection of floating roofs. In flammable liquid
service, the floating roof is critical to reducing the potential for tank fires and/or explosions. Steel annular pontoon or
double deck floating roofs are effective for this purpose. For internal floating roofs, the compartments should be
checked, whenever there is an out-of-service inspection, for possible leaks in the pontoons. For external floating<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_39>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES   FOR  A TMOSPHERIC   AND  L OW -P RESSURE  S TORAGE  T ANKS
31<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>roofs, the compartments should be inspected for leaks whenever there is an internal and an external inspection. The
compartments should be liquid tight so that vapors cannot cascade from one compartment to the other. The inspector
may want to note if the compartments are not vapor or liquid tight for owner/operator consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 650 encourages bottom leak protection for new tanks, including the use of release prevention barrier systems ,
cathodic protection, leak testing, etc. There are several different leak detection technologies or approaches, such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) volumetric/mass leak detection methods;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) acoustic emissions leak detection methods;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) soil-vapor monitoring leak detection methods;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) inventory control leak detection methods .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many of the technologies used in leak detection are identified in API 334. These control measures should be
inspected or tested periodically, as appropriate for the particular system and the risk involved. For example, external
cathodic protection systems should be tested for performance as recommended by API 651.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 2610 provides additional guidance regarding the inspection of tank appurtenances, accessories, and the
surrounding area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When applicable, inspectors should attempt to coordinate inspections while tanks are out of service for operational
issues. This scheduling often requires knowledge of internal inspection intervals, operating schedules, and operating
experience for the tank(s) involved. Internal inspection intervals may also be based on experience and risk as
determined by someone knowledgeable with the tank(s) and its operation. In no case should the frequency of these
inspections be less than that prescribed by API 653. This coordination requires knowledge of internal inspection
intervals and operating experience for the tanks involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To minimize cost and reduce the generation of wastes, every effort should be made to consider completing all
necessary maintenance when tanks are out of service for inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Condition-based Inspection Scheduling and Minimum Acceptable Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspections scheduled and performed based on the past, current, and expected future condition of a tank (and its
components) is defined as condition-based inspection. To meaningfully evaluate the condition of a storage tank, one
can evaluate the data from inspections and the limits of corrosion and other forms of deterioration that can safely be
tolerated. For thinning, the remaining life of the tank component (e.g. bottom, shell or nozzle neck) can be established
using the current thickness, the estimated measured corrosion rate, and the minimum acceptable thickness, The
corrosion rate and the remaining life can be calculated from the following equations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t previous  is the thickness at the same location as  t actual  measured during a previous inspection, in inches (mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For uniform corrosion, a corrosion rate can be estimated by plotting the metal thickness two or more inspections
against the inspection dates, as shown in Figure 33. An extension of the line drawn through the plotted points will
provide an estimation of the time at which the metal will reach minimum acceptable limit .  As small variation in
operating conditions, temperatures, cathode protection, and other factors occur, corrosion rates can vary. This should
be considered in estimating the time at which a minimum thickness will be reached. Most other forms of deterioration,
such as corrosion pitting, mechanical damage from wind, cracking of the tank metal, and operating failure of
accessories, do not take place at a steady rate; they are largely unpredictable. If the allowable limit of deterioration is
calculated, knowing how long the tank will take to reach that limit establishes the service interval and next inspection.
If the limit appears to be less than the desired service interval, repairs or replacements may be necessary prior to
putting the tank back into service. If that limit exceeds the desired interval, repairs may be postponed until the next
scheduled out-of-service inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The above methodology presents an approach for estimating corrosion rate at a particular point. API 653 permits the
application of empirical methods, statistical methods, or a combination of the two for estimating fitness-for-service
and/or repair requirements. Statistical methods permit more flexibility regarding data collection and data analysis than
empirical methods. With statistical methods, data from one or more inspections may be considered in a single
analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum acceptable thickness should be determined based on the requirements identified in the applicable
design standard (such as API 650, API 653, etc.). Additional factors that may need to be considered in order to
determine an appropriate future corrosion allowance or to apply an additional safety factor include, but are not limited
to ,  amount of information available on the tank; the type of service to the tank; the risk exposure given the contents
and location of the tank; the stresses the tank is subject to; the reliability of current inspection data; the type of
corrosion experienced; and the applicable regulatory requirements. For this reason, a storage tank engineer or tank
specialist should determine what the minimum acceptable thickness is for a given tank component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the minimum acceptable thickness has been reached (further thinning may pose an integrity issue), action
should be taken. The minimum acceptable metal thickness should be known for each tank and the methods of
calculating the minimum thickness, under any given set of conditions, should be well established. The limits of other
forms of deterioration usually will have to be determined based on good judgment, knowledge of all the conditions
involved, and engineering analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of the large number of variables affecting the minimum acceptable thickness and the great variety of sizes,
shapes, and methods of tank construction, it is not possible to provide pre-calculated minimum or retirement
thickness data in this document (see API 653 for further guidance). The preparation of retirement thickness tables is
possible for all tanks in a given facility, and it may be desirable to include this information in the tank records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Minimum acceptable thickness is calculated to withstand the product load, plus any internal (or external) pressure in
the tank, plus a design allowance. Methods for determining the thickness of components in new storage tanks are
given in the standards or codes to which the tank was constructed. Most of these standards are listed in Section 2. In
most cases, the new thickness includes some excess thickness. This excess thickness may be the result of any one
or all of the following factors:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) additional thickness added to the minimum acceptable thickness as a corrosion allowance;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) additional thickness resulting from using the closest, but larger, nominal plate thickness, rather than the exact
value calculated;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) additional thickness from deliberately setting the minimum acceptable thickness of plates for construction
purposes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`
`<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) additional thickness on the upper portions of shell courses not required for product loading at that level;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) additional thickness, available due to a change in tank service or a reduced operating fill height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The excess thickness described under item b above will normally be rather small; but with low corrosion rates, it can
provide additional useful service life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Newer tanks (tanks built to API 650, Seventh Edition or later) may have an original plate thickness based on the
specific gravity of the product to be stored or based on hydrostatic test requirements, whichever results in a thicker
plate. Tank bottoms resting on grade and the roofs of atmospheric storage tanks are subjected to practically no
membrane stresses from product loads. Bottom areas, away from the shell or annular ring, need to be only thick
enough to be leak tight and to meet the minimum acceptable thickness requirements specified in API 653. The roof
must also be thick enough to support its own weight plus the design live load. Roofs and bottoms are often
considerably thicker than necessary to withstand service stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_42>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>34
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pressure exerted on the sides of storage tanks by the weight of the liquid contained is greatest at the bottom and
uniformly decreases up the shell. Because of this uniform pressure decrease, the shell plates above the bottom
course may be thicker than needed for just product loading but this should be verified by calculation. For flat bottom
cylindrical tanks, see API 650 for shell thickness calculations. For tanks subject to external pressure loadings ,  the
required shell thickness should be calculated per Appendix V of API 650. The thickness required to withstand external
pressure loadings does not decrease as you move up the tank shell wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If corrosion should occur in the shell, excess thickness may be available such that a safe fill height evaluation will
result in the tank being able to remain in service longer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Storage tank shell plate thickness is normally calculated to contain a fluid of a desired specific gravity (usually water in
the case of atmospheric storage). If the actual service conditions are different from those contemplated in the
design—for example, a stored fluid with a lesser specific gravity, a lower vapor pressure, or both—the existing shell
courses may have excess thickness. Conversely, if the walls have corroded, it may be necessary to reduce the
allowable safe fill height of the tank or change the product stored to one with a lower specific gravity. Certain stored
products may have a specific gravity greater than 1.0 and the shell plate thickness would be designed accordingly
(the hydrostatic test condition will not control).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 653 provides methodology for determining minimum acceptable thickness (due to hydraulic loads only) for tank
plate in existing tanks. This methodology can be used for estimating a point at which a tank may require repair or
replacement or for scheduling the next inspection. The result will be a thickness that will be the minimum acceptable
for a particular location in the given tank. When that thickness is reached, repairs or replacement will be required. It
should be kept in mind that a pit, or a very small area corroded to the retirement thickness, does not weaken the plate
appreciably from the standpoint of resisting product loading but may result in a leak. Evaluation methods for such
localized areas are described in API 653. Pitting of bottoms may be the determining factor in establishing the next
internal inspection interval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For many parts of atmospheric storage tanks, neither the minimum acceptable thickness nor the methods for
calculating the thickness are given in the tank standards. Such parts include pontoons, swing lines, floating-roof drain
systems, nozzles, valves, and secondary structural members. Roof supports, wind girders, platforms, and stairways
are covered by rules in API 650 for atmospheric storage tanks and API 620 for low-pressure tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For structural members and parts, such as roof supports and platforms, normal accepted industry practice for
structural design (such as methods provided in the  Steel Construction Manual .  issued by the American Institute of
Steel Construction) can be used to calculate the allowable loads of members in the new condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For external piping, nozzles, and valves, the methods provided in API 570 and ASME standards can be used to
determine minimum acceptable thickness, inspections, and potential repairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Good engineering practice and inspection judgment is of great importance in determining the limits of deterioration,
regardless of whether it is from corrosion or from other reasons; standards and recommended practices provide
guidance but cannot substitute for knowledge and experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In northern or periodically wet climates, it is necessary to consider the climate when scheduling inspections. It is best
to assume the worst-case repair when estimating project time. Starting at the end of the weather window, work
backwards, allowing time for coating, repairs, inspection, cleaning, tank preparation, etc., in order to select a start
date. In the Arctic and sub-Arctic, cold weather coatings may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Structural integrity and leak avoidance should be a high priority when evaluating tank condition. Minimizing
environmental damage, along with the long-term savings from avoiding clean-up costs and negative public opinion
due to a tank failure or leak, can far exceed the savings from making only minimal repairs. Proper life cycle cost
analysis and/or risk-based inspection methodology (see 6.3) will help in making environmentally responsible and
cost-effective repair decisions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Similar Service Methodology for Establishing Tank Corrosion Rates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The internal inspection interval (i.e. operating interval) for atmospheric storage tanks, as defined in API 653, Section
4.4.5.1, is governed by the corrosion rate of the tank bottom. Similar service is an approach to estimating corrosion
rates using data from other historical tank inspection data. As required by API 653, the purpose of estimating rates is
to determine how long a storage tank can be operated without failure of the tank bottom due to corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar service is recognized within industry as a means of scheduling internal inspection intervals in API 510, API
570, and API 653, which uses corrosion rates as the basis for establishing inspection intervals. Similar service is a
simplistic approach to qualitative risk assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although measurement of bottom wall thicknesses during an internal inspection to calculate a corrosion rate is an
important means of establishing the next internal inspection interval, positively establishing the remaining bottom
thickness is based upon many factors such as the amount, quality, and extent of inspections. Often, multiple
inspection methods are utilized to establish the minimum floor thickness (i.e. magnetic flux leakage with follow-up
ultrasonic inspection) to ensure that the worst area(s) of soil-side corrosion have been detected. When an owner/user
chooses to apply similar service to estimate tank bottom product-side and soil-side corrosion rates, the owner/user
should consider the factors listed in Appendix B ,  Table B-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar service is an acceptable method for independently estimating corrosion rates and may be used in lieu of, or in
addition to, actual measurement of corrosion rates. Similar service has been found to be useful for prioritizing tank
inspection when no tank bottom inspection data is available for a tank that is in operation. Rather than taking a tank
out of service to establish corrosion rates, careful consideration of relevant similar service experience can be used to
determine appropriate inspection priorities. Similar service is also used to supplement an internal inspection by using
the data measurements of the internal inspection as an independent check on the anticipated corrosion rates. If there
is a high level of confidence in the results of similar service from extensive data collection and available historical
information, the extent of the internal inspection can often be limited by reducing the number of coupons required or
the percentage of the bottom scanned. Since tank bottom condition typically dictates internal inspection intervals, only
tank bottom corrosion is emphasized in this discussion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To use similar service it is generally appropriate to discuss the two aspects of tank bottom corrosion—product-side
and soil-side corrosion. The similar service should be examined independently for both the product-side and the soil-
side corrosion since the mechanisms and corrosion rates for each are independent of one another. As with any risk
assessment approach, the owner/user should assess the inspection effectiveness of tank bottom thickness data used
in the similar service assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar service evaluation of soil-side corrosion rates is typically only useful for tanks located on a given site. Any
given site may exhibit unique soil-side corrosion characteristics and extrapolating soil-side corrosion from one site to
another may not be appropriate. Soil-side corrosion data may vary from negligible to very aggressive pitting with rates
approaching 20 mils per year. The best source of soil-side corrosion rates comes from the examination of previously
inspected tank bottoms from the same site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Product-side corrosion is caused by the stored liquid. While many petroleum liquids have little to no corrosion, the
tanks often carry a “water bottom” (bottom sediment and water, or BS&W), a layer of water that separates from the
petroleum liquid. If the water is allowed to stand at the tank bottom or cannot be drained it may be corrosive and
cause product-side pitting and corrosion. For petroleum crude oil tanks, water bottoms are often very aggressive
sources of corrosion since the water contains various salts that increase corrosivity and are often stored at
temperatures above normal, which also increases corrosion rates. Again, previous tank inspections are a reliable
source of information about the nature of corrosion that occurs on the product-side of the tank bottom for that
particular service. Table B.2 in Appendix B is an example of applying similar service principles to the product-side of
the tank bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To summarize, the corrosion experience at a site or in areas of similar soil conditions can represent the soil-side
corrosion rates and be applied to a whole class of tanks. On the other hand, product-side corrosion rates can be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_44>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>36
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>estimated from similar service in stock or stored product conditions that does not necessarily have to come from the
local site. It should be noted that when using product-side corrosion rates from other sites, the owner/user should
review the operating practices at all sites to ensure that they are similar (e.g. water draw frequency, product
corrosivity, product temperature, etc . ). Together this data may be used to establish overall bottom corrosion rates and
set internal inspection intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Fitness-For-Service Evaluation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Among other types of refinery equipment, aboveground storage tanks can be evaluated to determine fitness for
continued service. API 579 provides fitness-for-service (FFS) evaluation criteria for tanks based on what is known or
can be determined about the tank from various inspections. Different levels of assessment are provided depending on
the information available for evaluation and resources (experience and money) available. FFS deals primarily with the
evaluation of defects and flaws such as corrosion, pitting, crack-like flaws, laminations, and distortions that can affect
remaining service life. Specific criteria for evaluating defects or flaws in tanks are also provided in API 579, Annex A,
Section A.6 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 Methods of Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Preparation for Inspections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before entering or re-entering any tank, appropriate safety precautions are necessary. These precautions are
discussed in detail in API 2015 and API 2016. Generally, such precautions include, but are not limited to, the
following .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Removal of hazardous gases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Removal of gas-generating, pyrophoric, or toxic residues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Isolation from any source of toxic or gas-generating fluids by the use of blinds or by disconnection/isolation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Assurance of an atmosphere that contains sufficient oxygen. Where applicable, OSHA rules for safe entry into
confined spaces should be followed (29  CFR  Part 1910.146).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Potential for collapse of either fixed or floating roofs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A tank should be sufficiently clean to allow adequate inspection. Tank cleaning methods will be dependent on the
amount of scale, sediment, solid product, or other foreign material that is present on the surfaces to be inspected. For
relatively clean product services, water-washing the internal surfaces may result in adequate cleanliness for
inspection but it may be necessary to grit-blast or high-pressure water-blast internal surfaces and weld seams to
achieve sufficient cleanliness for inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is advisable to make a visual inspection of overhead structural members, plate surfaces and all supports to ensure
that there are no loose rafters, large patches of loose scale, weakened support columns or brackets, or any other
object that might fall and cause personal injury. This visual inspection is also important to ensure that there is not a
significant amount of liquid being retained on the floating roof, which could cause an unexpected collapse and
become a hazard to personnel. To the extent possible, this overhead inspection should be conducted from the entry
point or other suitable observation points before working in the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All tools and equipment needed for tank inspection and personnel safety should be checked prior to inspection to
verify that they are in good working condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 1 lists some of the recommended tools for tank inspection. Those items listed in Table 2 should be available in
case they are needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to conducting internal or external inspection, the inspector should thoroughly review any available inspection

entry procedures). Personnel working inside the tank should also be kept informed when any other work close to the
tank or on the exterior of the tank, particularly on the roof, is to be performed during inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 External Inspection of an In-service Tank<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Much of an external inspection can be conducted while a tank is in service to minimize the length of time the tank will
need to be out of service. See API 653, Annex C for a detailed checklist of suggested items to be inspected while the
tank is in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.1 Ladder and Stairway Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ladders and stairways should be examined carefully for corroded or broken parts. The condition of the ladder (vertical
or rolling), stairway parts, and handrails may be checked by visual inspection and by sounding to determine whether
these parts are safe for continued use. Stairways and other access details (vertical ladders) should be evaluated per
OSHA recommendations as detailed in 29  CFR  Part 1910.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Large tanks may have intermediate support stairways. When concrete pedestals are used for such supports, they
should be checked for cracks, spalling, and other problems. A scraper can aid in determining the extent of any
concrete deterioration. Bolts set in the concrete should be examined carefully for corrosion at the point of contact,
where a rapid form of crevice corrosion can take place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ladder rungs and stair treads should be checked for wear and corrosion. In addition to loss of strength caused by
metal loss, the tread can become slippery when the surface is worn smooth. Bolts and rivets should be checked for
looseness, breakage, and excessive corrosion. Welded joints should be checked for cracks, undercut, lack of fusion,
erosion, and other defects. Handrails should be shaken to give an indication of their soundness. Particular attention
should be given to tubular handrails, which may have corroded from the inside. Crevices where water can collect
should be closely checked by picking at them with a scraper or knife and by tapping them with a hammer. Such
crevices can exist at bracket connections, around bolts and nuts, and between stair treads and support angles. If the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>surfaces are painted, corrosion may exist under the paint film. Rust stains visible through the paint and a general
lifting of paint are evidence of such corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.2 Platform and Walkway Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Platforms, elevated walkways, and external floating roof wind girders set up to be used as walkways can be inspected
in the same manner as ladders and stairways. These details should also be evaluated per OSHA recommendations
as detailed in 29  CFR  Part 1910. The thickness of walking surfaces used by personnel can be checked at the edges
with calipers and in other areas by tapping with a hammer. Low spots where water can collect should be checked
carefully because corrosion may be rapid in such areas. Drain holes can be drilled in the area to prevent future
accumulation of water. Platform supports should also be measured to determine thickness and should be checked for
buckling and other signs of failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Defects not requiring repair before inspection can be marked with paint or crayon and recorded in field notes or by
some other appropriate means including electronic media (digital photography, video, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In areas with high seismic activity, the platforms and connections between tanks should be reviewed for sufficient
flexibility to accommodate anticipated tank movement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.3 Foundation Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The foundations of tanks may be made of sand or other fill pads; crushed stone pads or stone-filled grade bands;
steel and concrete piers, ringwalls, or natural earth pads. Pads should be visually checked for erosion and uneven
settlement. The condition of foundations and tank supports should be evaluated in accordance with requirements of
API 653.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank level can be measured by using a surveyor’s level or other appropriate device to check the amount of
settlement. Measured settlement should be evaluated in accordance with API 653, Annex B guidelines. For tanks that
are actively settling, records of settlement should be maintained. Concrete pads, base rings, and piers/footings
should be checked for spalling, cracks, and general deterioration as shown in Figure 34. Scraping of suspected areas
can uncover such deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The opening or joint between a tank bottom and the concrete pad or base ring should be sealed to prevent water from
flowing under the tank bottom. Visual inspection, combined with some picking and scraping, will disclose the condition
of this moisture barrier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wooden supports for small tanks, stairways, or other accessories can be checked for rot by tapping with a hammer,
picking with a scraper, or probing with a knife or ice pick.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steel columns or piers can be hammered or measured with calipers to check for corrosion. Caliper readings can be
checked against the original thickness or against the thickness of uncorroded sections to determine any metal loss.
Piers or columns should be examined to see if they are plumb. This operation may be done visually or plumb lines
and levels can be used if more accuracy is desired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.4 Anchor Bolt Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The condition of anchor bolts can usually be determined by visual inspection. A tap with a hammer to the side of the
nut may reveal complete corrosion of the anchor bolt below the base plate (Figure 35 and Figure 36). Severe damage
may not be detected by such a test. Visual inspection can be aided by removing the nuts one at a time, or
supplemented by ultrasonic thickness examination. Anchor bolt nuts should be checked for a snug fit to the anchor
chair top plate (i.e. there should be no distance between the location of the nut on the bolt and the anchor chair top
plate).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.5 Grounding Connection Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some tanks are provided with grounding connections. The grounding connections should be intact. They should be
visually examined for corrosion at the point where they enter the earth or attach to a grounding rod and at the tank
ground clip. If there is any doubt about the condition of the grounding connection, its resistance can be checked. The
total resistance from tank to earth should not exceed approximately 25 ohms. API 545 provides information
concerning the grounding of tanks to prevent ignition from static electricity, lightning strikes, or stray electrical
currents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.6 Protective Coating Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The condition of the protective coating on a tank should be adequately established during inspection. Rust spots,
blisters, peeling, and cracking of the coating due to lack of adhesion are all types of common paint failure. Rust spots
and blisters are easily found by visual inspection. Coating bond failure is not easily seen unless a blister has formed
or has broken. ASTM D3359 provides a standardized test method for quantifying paint bond failure. Care should be
taken not to significantly damage protective coatings during inspection. The coating inspection should identify areas
of coating failure and the degree of active corrosion and existing corrosion damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Paint blisters most often occur on the roof and on the side of the tank receiving the most sunlight. Coating bond failure
commonly occurs below seam leaks. Other points at which the paint may fail are in crevices or depressions and at
tank seams that are welded, riveted, or bolted. The portion of the tank wall behind liquid level gauge boards is often
overlooked as a location of deterioration. The paint on the tank roof is especially susceptible to accelerated failure.
The paint on floating roofs should be inspected carefully, especially in areas where water or product is retained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.7 Insulation Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a tank is insulated, the condition of the insulation and weather jacket (if present) should be evaluated. Visual
examination is normally performed. Detailed inspection should be conducted around nozzles, around the saddles of
horizontal tanks, and at caulked joints. Areas of insulation may need to be removed prior to such inspection (usually
removal is performed by personnel specializing in insulation application or removal), especially where the type of
insulation is unknown. A few samples (cores) may also be removed—especially on the shaded side of the tank, on
roofs, below protrusions, and at areas of obvious water intrusion—to better determine the condition of the insulation
and the metal under the insulation. Insulation support clips, angles, bands, and wires should be spot-checked for
tightness and signs of corrosion and breakage. If access is available internally, many of these areas (nozzle necks,
external stiffeners, welded attachments) can be checked by UT from the inside. Significant corrosion can occur
beneath insulation, at points near gaps in the weather protection, and in areas of the lower shell where the insulation
may be in contact with surface water as shown in Figure 37 and Figure 38. Thermography and neutron back-scatter
techniques to detect hot spots (or cold spots as the case may be) may also be useful in evaluating the condition of an
insulation system in service. Corrosion under insulation (CUI) is most aggressive in temperature ranges between
120 °F (49 °C) and 200 °F (93 °C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should exercise great care when inspecting insulated tank roofs. Thin roof plates may not be strong
enough to support the inspector, and insulation could be damaged, allowing water to enter. Means of properly
distributing personnel loading should be used when accessing such roofs of unknown condition for inspection
purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8 Tank Shell Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection for paint failure to locate corrosion on the external surfaces of the tank (at the points of paint failure, under
insulation, behind gauge boards, inside valve boxes, at points that have not been painted, and on unpainted tanks)
can be of critical importance. Corrosion may occur on the shell near the bottom due to build-up of soil or other foreign
matter and where product leakage occurs, especially if the tank contains corrosive materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

43<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If any foreign material or soil has collected around the bottom of the shell or if the tank has settled below grade, a
close inspection should be made at and below the grade line. The shell may need to be uncovered completely in
these areas (removal is usually done by others) and inspected for corrosion. Accelerated corrosion often occurs at
the grade line, as shown in Figure 39. Tanks with product at elevated temperatures in cold climates may have water
present near the shell and under the bottom because of ice or snow build-up around the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When evidence of extensive external corrosion or other types of deterioration justifies further inspection, it may be
necessary to erect scaffolding for access to additional surfaces. Alternate rigging, portable ladders, cranes with man
baskets, or man lifts can also be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any evidence of corrosion should be investigated. Corrosion products or rust scale can be removed by picking,
scraping, wire brushing, or blasting (with sand, grit ,  or water under high pressure) so that the depth and extent of the
corrosion may be evaluated. Vigorous rapping with a hammer or with an air-driven chipping hammer with a blunt
chisel can remove hard, thick rust scale. The potential hazards of using such methods should be evaluated
beforehand. For example, hammer testing or removal of heavy scale should not be done with the tank under pressure
or otherwise in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8.2 Thickness Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If corrosion is found, ultrasonic thickness (UT) measurements may be taken at the most corroded areas as one
method of measurement. If much corrosion is evident, it is more effective to take several measurements on each ring
or to scan the surface with a thickness-scanning device supplemented by ultrasonic prove-up. Numerous thickness
measurements may be necessary for assessing thickness in accordance with API 653, Section 4 guidelines. It should
be emphasized that when UT is used for establishing corrosion rates, other evaluation methods may also be
appropriate. These include similar service or establishment of corrosion rates from past internal inspections or
substitution of higher rates from the bottom when applied to the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>44
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The depth of localized areas of corrosion can be measured by placing a straightedge long enough to span the
corroded area on the longitudinal axis, then measuring from the straightedge to the lowest point of the corroded area.
Isolated areas of corrosion can be measured by pit gauging.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sun, shade, prevailing winds, and marine environments may affect the rate of external corrosion significantly. These
factors need to be considered when determining the number and location of thickness measurements to be taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>UT measurements may be taken on the upper shell courses from ground level by the use of a sectional pole or a
remote-controlled scanning tool. UT measurements taken from the outside should be compared with thickness
measurements that may subsequently be taken from the inside. In obtaining shell thickness, special attention should
be given to the upper 24 in. (61 cm) of uncoated shells of floating-roof tanks. These portions of the shell plates can
corrode at a higher rate than the lower shell plates because of constant exposure to the atmosphere on both sides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>UT measurements should be taken only by trained personnel using a properly calibrated thickness measurement
instrument and an appropriate thickness measurement procedure. Coatings can affect UT thickness readings and the
examiner may need to compensate for the coating when recording the metal thickness measured. Modern ultrasonic
multi-echo thickness scopes, when properly calibrated, allow direct metal thickness readings to be taken through thin-
film coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8.3 Stiffeners and Wind Girders<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The outside stiffeners and wind girders of a tank can be inspected visually and by hammer testing. Thickness
measurements should be made at points where corrosion is evident. Outside calipers and a steel rule are usually
adequate to take these measurements, although ultrasonic thickness measurements are more efficient and more
accurate. Any pockets or crevices between the rings or girders and the shell should receive close attention. If the
stiffening members are welded to the shell, the welds should be visually checked for cracks. If any evidence of
cracking is found, the welds should be cleaned thoroughly by wire brushing or abrasive-blasting for closer inspection.
For maximum sensitivity, the areas can be checked by the magnetic particle or liquid penetrant examination method.
If the magnetic particle method is used for detecting cracks while the tank is in service, current flow (prod techniques)
should not be used because of the danger of sparks. For this type of test, a permanent magnet or electromagnet
(magnetic flow) technique should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8.4 Caustic Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If caustic or amine is stored in a tank, the tank should be checked for evidence of damage from caustic stress
corrosion cracking, sometimes referred to as caustic embrittlement. The most probable place for this to occur is
around connections for internal heating units or coils. This type of deterioration is manifested by cracks that start on
the inside of the tank and progress through to the outside. If this condition exists, the caustic material seeping through
the cracks will deposit readily visible salts (usually white). Figure 40 shows an example of caustic stress corrosion
cracking. Thorough cleaning and checking with indicating solutions is necessary before welded repairs are conducted<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

such areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8.5 Hydrogen Blisters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The shell and the bottom of the tank should be checked for hydrogen blisters. This form of deterioration is discussed
further in API 571. Figure 41 and Figure 42 show the types of blisters that can occur either on the inside or outside
surfaces. They are found most easily by visual examination and by feel. Visual examination should be aided by use of
hand-held lighting of sufficient candlepower (at least 100 lumens) under low ambient lighting conditions, holding the
flashlight against the shell so the light beam shines parallel to the shell surface. Many small blisters can be found by
running fingers over the metal surface. The location of large blisters should be recorded so that while the tank is out of
service, further inspection of the area can be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8.6 Leaks, Crack-like Flaws, and Distortion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to an examination for corrosion, the shell of the tank should be examined for leaks, crack-like flaws,
buckles, bulges, and banding or peaking of weld seams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leaks are often marked by a discoloration or the absence of paint in the area below the leaks. Leaks are sometimes
found by testing the tank as discussed in 8.5 or by other methods discussed in 8.4.6. The nature of any leaks found
should be carefully determined. If there are any indications that a leak is believed to be due to a crack, the tank should
be removed from service as soon as possible, and a complete inspection should be made to determine the repairs
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although cracks in tanks are not common, crack-like flaws can occur. These can be found at the connection of
nozzles to the tank, in welded seams, and in the metal ligament between rivets or bolts, between a rivet or bolt and
the edge of the plate, at the connection of brackets or other attachments to the tank, and at the connection of the shell
to the bottom of a welded tank. When an angle detail (i.e. mechanical joint) is found at the bottom joint of a welded
tank, crack-like flaws can occur in the shell plate. Usually, close visual inspection is sufficient when checking for crack-
like flaws but for increased detection capability, liquid penetrant or magnetic particle examination should be used. If
any signs of crack-like flaws do exist, the entire suspected area should be abrasive-blasted or otherwise adequately
cleaned for magnetic particle (MT) or liquid penetrant (PT) examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deformations will normally be readily apparent through visual inspection. Inspectors should consider that there could
be slight deformations near a welded seam or elsewhere in the shell. Deformation can be measured by placing a
straight edge lengthwise against the vertical shell or by placing a curved edge (cut to the radius of the shell) against
the circumference. If deformation is present, it is important to determine the cause. Deformation can be caused by
settlement of the tank, wind, earthquake, internal pressure in the tank due to defective vents or relief valves, an
operating or induced vacuum in the tank, severe corrosion of the shell, movement of connected piping, improper
welding repair methods, and other mechanical damage. Figure 43 shows an extreme case of tank deformation
caused by inadequate vacuum venting. Settlement or frost heave of the soil beneath a tank bottom can cause
deformation of the shell at the bottom edge. This can be checked with a straight-edge level placed vertically at
locations around the bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a welded tank has significant deformations, weld seams may be highly stressed and can crack. The joints most
susceptible to cracking are those at connections, at the bottom-to-shell joint, at floating-roof deck lap seams, the
shell-to-roof joint, and at vertical shell seams. Failure of a shell-to-roof frangible joint detail is shown in Figure 44.
When cracking is suspected, magnetic particle examination is the preferred method to use. In using this method, the
seams to be inspected should be abrasive-blasted or wire-brushed clean. If the welded surface is rough or extends
significantly above the surface of the joined plates, it may be necessary to grind the welds to obtain a reasonably
smooth surface without sharp corners or discontinuities. Liquid penetrant and ultrasonic shear wave examination
methods also can be used to find cracks. In addition, radiographic (RT) examination can be used, but it requires that
the tank be emptied and prepared for personnel entry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8.7 Rivet Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the tank is of riveted or bolted construction, a number of randomly selected rivets or bolts should be checked for
tightness. They may be checked by lightly tapping the rivet or bolt head laterally with a hammer while holding a finger
against the opposite side in contact with the plate. Movement of the rivet or bolt should not be detectable. Bolts or
rivets tested in this manner may need to have the paint touched up after tapping. It may be advisable to postpone this
test until the tank is out of service and the rivets or bolts can be checked on the inside of the tank. Alternatively, broken
rivet bodies or bolts can be detected by ultrasonic examination while a tank is in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.9 Tank Roof Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The roof or top head of a tank can be inspected for significant thinning by ultrasonic thickness examination or even by
MFL scanning (if the roof condition is thought sound enough to withstand the weight of the equipment). Hammer
testing may dislodge scale from the internal plate surfaces into stored product and is not a recommended method of
establishing roof plate integrity for personnel loading. Suitable fall protection should be used when working on roofs.
On a fixed roof, planks long enough to span at least two roof rafters should be laid and used as walkways, at least
until the safety of the roof is determined. In general, the inspector should always walk on weld seams if they are
present, because of the extra thickness available to support body weight. On a floating roof of unknown or
questionable condition (e.g. insulated roof decks), the same precautions should be taken. In addition, because of the
possible existence of harmful vapors, the floating roof should be as high as possible if volatile liquid is in the tank at
the time of inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the tank is not full (i.e. floating roof at or near maximum fill height), appropriate atmospheric testing should be
performed before personnel without respiratory equipment are allowed on the roof. It may be desirable to station a
second employee with respiratory equipment on the platform to give assistance if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The runway, rollers, and treads of any rolling ladders on the roof of a floating-roof tank are subject to wear and
distortion. The ladder can be checked in the same manner as outside ladders or stairs. If the ladder has come off the
runway because of roof rotation (which could result from seismic loading, high winds or lack of suitable anti-rotation
device), the roof—and especially the roof seals—should be examined visually for physical damage. The rollers on the
ladder base should be freewheeling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grounding cables that connect the floating roof to the shell should be checked for breaks or damage. Broken
grounding cables are common in freezing climates. Electrical shunts, if present, should be checked to ensure
adequate contact between the floating roof and the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gaps between the shell and the seal(s) of a floating roof may be restricted by air quality regulations (local or federal).
Minor emissions may be present at any time. Excessive emissions indicate improper seal installation, altered seal
condition due to tank operations or long-term wear and tear or a malfunctioning seal(s) due to external influences
(earthquake, high winds, snow and ice). Excessive emissions due to seal gaps can also result in rim space fires if a
source of ignition (lightning strike) occurs. Visual inspection may be adequate to determine seal condition, and
corrections may be possible while the tank is in service. If permanent repairs cannot be made, the defective areas
and any temporary repairs should be noted in the records so that permanent repairs can be made when the tank is
removed from service. Seal damage can occur if the maximum operating level is exceeded when portions of the seal
are pushed up above the top angle or plate edge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Drainage systems on floating roofs should be inspected frequently for leakage or blockage. If the drains are blocked,
an accumulation of liquid can cause floating roofs to sink or to be severely damaged. This is especially true when the
roof is sitting on its legs or has a poorly contoured deck that does not allow good drainage. Proper operation of check
valves in drainage sumps should be verified on a regular schedule, especially for those in fouling or corrosive service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the appropriate inspections performed on floating roofs and cone roofs, the vapor seals around columns
and the ladder of covered floating roofs should be checked for leakage and condition. The ladder and columns should
be checked for plumbness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In areas where bottom settlement problems continue to occur in service, columns may subside due to uneven bottom
settlement, causing cone roofs to deform and retain water. Depending upon severity, repairs may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Platforms and guardrails on a roof should be checked carefully in the same manner as described earlier for stairways
and ladders.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External corrosion on roof surfaces will usually be most severe at depressions where water can remain until it
evaporates. When corrosive vapors in a tank leak through holes in the roof, pressure vents, floating-roof seals, or
other locations, significant external corrosion may occur in these areas. Inspection for corrosion on the external
surfaces of a roof may follow the same procedure as for the shell. UT measurements of badly corroded areas can be
made if the thickness of the corroded roof plate is still within the range that the instrument can measure accurately.
The inspector should be aware of the doubling effect of older types of ultrasonic instruments that are operated below
their specified thickness range; for example, a 180 mil (4.6 mm) roof thickness may show up on a digital thickness
meter as 360 mils (9.1 mm). Multi-echo ultrasonic measurement equipment, which can provide accurate thickness
through thin-film coatings, should be used wherever possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank pipe connections and bolting at each first outside flanged joint should be inspected for external corrosion. Visual
inspection combined with scraping and picking can reveal the extent of this condition. See API 570 if piping beyond
the first external tank flange is to be inspected. When external piping inspection is specified, the soil around the pipe
should be dug away for 6 in. to 12 in. (150 mm to 300 mm) to allow for inspection, as soil corrosion may be especially
severe at such points. After the pipe is exposed, it should be thoroughly scraped and cleaned to permit visual and
ultrasonic thickness or other non-destructive examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Connected piping should be inspected for possible distortion if a tank has settled excessively, especially if the tank
has been subjected to earthquake or high water levels. In the latter case, water draw-off and cleanout nozzles
connected to the bottom may have been subjected to high shearing or bending stresses. Special attention should be
given to such nozzles. In colder climates, frost heave can raise piping supports and place excessive bending
moments on piping nozzles and shell connections. Internal explosions, high winds, and fires can also cause
distortion. If there is any evidence of distortion or cracks around nozzle connections, all seams and the shell in this
area should be examined for cracks. The area should be abrasive-blasted or wire-brush cleaned down to parent
metal. Magnetic particle or liquid penetrant examination may be used for improved detection of crack-like flaws.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the most important aspects of piping integrity associated with the tank is sufficient flexibility to accommodate
settlement or movement due to seismic activity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flame arrestors should be opened at appropriate intervals, and the screens or pallets should be visually inspected for
cleanliness and corrosion. Bees and mud daubers occasionally plug arrestors. Solidification of vapors from the stored
product may also restrict the flow area of the flame arrestor. If the venting capacity is seriously reduced under either
pressure or vacuum conditions, the possibility of tank failure increases greatly. In the event of an explosion in a tank
having a connected gas-collecting system, flame arrestors should be checked immediately for signs of damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Earthen and concrete dikes should be inspected to ensure that they are not eroded or damaged and are maintained
at the required height and width. Masonry firewalls should be checked for cracks, erosion, or any other signs of
deterioration. Stairways and walkways over dikes or firewalls should be inspected in the same manner as those on a
storage tank. Drains for fire wall enclosures and dikes should be inspected to ensure that they are not plugged and
that they are equipped with an operable drainage control valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fire-fighting equipment attached to or installed on tanks—such as foam lines, chambers, connections, and any
steam-smothering lines—should be visually inspected. These parts can be hammer-tested (as long as they are not
under pressure), or ultrasonic thickness measurements can be obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_58>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>50
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure-vacuum vents and breather valves should be inspected to see that they are not plugged; that the seat and
seal are tight; and that all moving parts are free and not significantly worn or corroded. Thickness measurements
should be taken where deterioration is located. Plugging of the discharge side screen and build-up of solids on the
pallets are common problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cathodic protection systems should be maintained as indicated in API 651.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other auxiliary equipment should be inspected to ensure that it is in an operable and safe condition. API 653, Annex
C, contains detailed checklists for inspection of auxiliary equipment for tanks that are in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 External Inspection of Out-of-Service Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.1 External Tank Bottom Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank bottoms that rest on pads or on soil can be reliably inspected for soil-side corrosion using inspection technology
developments such as magnetic flux leakage (MFL) bottom scanners or robotic inspection equipment. Tank bottom
inspection has advanced from coupon cutting to a combination of UT and coupon cutting, electronic profiling or MFL
scanning methods. When properly calibrated and operated to acceptable procedures, the probability of a better
inspection exists with these newer technologies because much more of the surface area is examined and a better
database with respect to bottom thickness measurements is available. With these developments, tunneling under or
completely lifting a tank just for soil-side bottom inspection should normally be avoided, but these methods may be
used when justified by other considerations such as a desire to coat the soil-side or the need to remove contaminated
subgrade material or to install a release prevention barrier (RPB). It should be remembered that inspection of a tank
by lifting may necessitate a hydrostatic test that would be unnecessary with other methods (see API 653, Section 12).
As it is difficult to refill a tunnel properly, tunneling should be applied only to locations near the edge of the tank. Clean
sand or washed gravel are the best types of fill material. Tank lifting allows 100 % inspection of the bottom from the
external surface after adequate cleaning but can be relatively costly for a large diameter tank. Lifting does allow for
blasting and coating (or re-coating if the existing bottom is coated underneath), as well as tank pad re-leveling and
access for repair. Tanks that have been physically moved, jacked, or lifted should be either hydrostatically re-tested or
subjected to an engineering evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.2 External Pipe Connection Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of pipe connections while a tank is out of service is essentially the same as when the tank is in service (see
8.2.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.3 External Tank Roof Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All roof plates should be checked for thickness, regardless of the external appearance. The inside surface of the roof
plates may be susceptible to rapid corrosion because of the presence of corrosive vapors, water vapor, and oxygen.
Figure 45 shows an example of roof corrosion that progressed completely through the metal. UT instruments should
be used to check roof plate thickness. The same safety considerations as detailed in 8.2.10 regarding fixed roof
inspection also apply to inspection of floating roofs, especially if external inspection is being performed with the tank is
still in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On cone, umbrella, and similar fixed roof tanks; on pan floating roofs; and on the lower deck of pontoon floating roofs,
the thickness testing should be accomplished before the bottom of the tank has been thoroughly cleaned, because
considerable dust and rust may be dislodged from the inside of the roof. The interiors of the pontoons or double decks
on floating roofs should be inspected visually. Metal thickness measurements should also be taken. For stability,
some floating roofs have weighted (with concrete or sand) or hollow pontoons (sitting on top of the roof deck not
penetrating to the product) that should be checked to ensure that they are watertight. If these pontoons become
saturated with water, corrosion can occur and the roof may not function as intended. A bright, portable light (of at least
100 lumens) will be needed for this work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 45—Example of Sever Corrosion of Tank Roof<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The condition of the roof rafters in fixed roof tanks can sometimes be checked through roof openings. Usually, the
rafter thickness can be measured with calipers. Unless severe corrosion of the rafters is evident, these
measurements should suffice. Coupons approximately 12 in.  ×  12 in. (300 mm  ×  300 mm) in size can also be
removed from the roof to check for under-side corrosion and rafter condition. All coupons should be round or have
rounded corners; no square-cornered coupons should be cut.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>`

`
` `
`<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While inspecting tank roofs for corrosion, a search for leaks should be made, although the best way to find leaks in
the roof is with the low-pressure air test discussed later in this document. If the drain is blocked, leakage may
eventually cause the floating roof to sink. In addition, any leakage into the pontoon of floating roofs or through the
bottom deck of double-deck roofs can eventually cause the floating roof to sink. Leakage in the roof deck or in the
pontoons can also cause the roof to become unbalanced and possibly damaged if it hangs up on the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before an inspection of floating-roof seals, the seal details should be reviewed so that the operation is well
understood. The points at which problems can occur will thus become more evident. All seals should be inspected
visually for corroded or broken parts and for worn or deteriorated vapor barriers. Any exposed mechanical parts—
such as springs, hanger systems and other tensioning devices, and shoes—are susceptible to mechanical damage,
wear, and atmospheric or vapor space corrosion. Figure 46 shows one type of deterioration of a floating-roof seal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Most floating-roof tanks are equipped with guides or stabilizers to prevent rotation. These guides are subject to
corrosion, wear, and distortion and should be inspected visually. If the guides are distorted or the roof is no longer in
alignment with these guides, the roof may have rotated excessively. The shell should then be inspected for
deformation or other defects as previously outlined in this section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Roof drains on floating-roof tanks can be designed in many ways. They can be simple open drain pipes or swing-joint
and flexible-hose drains that keep water from contaminating the product. Roof drains must function properly;
otherwise, certain types of floating roofs can sink or not function properly. Figure 47 and Figure 48 show the severe
damage that can result. The damage in Figure 47 occurred while the roof was resting on its supports with excessive
water load on top. The same type of failure can result from excessive snow, ice, or product loading. This kind of
damage can be prevented by keeping the roof floating drain systems operating properly and by not landing the roof
under such loading conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the tank is out of service, the drain lines should be inspected. Some drains are built such that the only possible
way to measure wall thickness is by using calipers or by ultrasonic testing methods. Any movable joints in the drain
lines should be checked visually for wear and tightness. The drain lines, including the joints, can also be tested for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>tightness by pressure testing with water. It has been found that a two-stage hydro-pneumatic test procedure is
desirable. The first stage is a test at about 30 lbf/in. 2  (207 kPa) gauge pressure for approximately  1 / 2  hour to detect
any leaks in the pipe, hose, or rigid joints. The pressure is then reduced to approximately 5 lbf/in. 2  (34.5 kPa) gauge
for another  1 / 2  hour to test the tightness of the swing joints. Swing joints may be self-sealing at the higher pressure but
will leak at the lower pressure if defective. The drain lines can also be checked for blockage at the completion of the
pressure test by opening the drain valve and observing whether the test water flows out freely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design, construction, and physical condition of internal floating roofs, particularly the lightweight types (thin-skin
aluminum and composite panel), should be taken into consideration prior to inspection. Planking may be required to
walk on such roofs even if they are not corroded. If there are no roof drains, adequate inspection should be made to
ensure that stored liquid does not leak onto the roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the appropriate inspections performed on floating roofs and cone roofs, the seals around columns and
the ladder of internal floating roofs should be checked for leakage and condition. The ladder and columns should be
checked for plumbness. The legs and leg sleeves should be checked for soundness and straightness. Aluminum
floating-roof leg supports need to be adequately isolated from bare carbon steel as recommended in API 650,
Appendix H to avoid corrosion by dissimilar metals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>All valves on the tank should be inspected when the tank is out of service. The first outside valve on all connections
should be examined visually to ensure that there is no detectable leakage or deterioration. If leakage or significant
deterioration is noted, consideration should be given to valve replacement while the tank is out of service. Valves can
be refurbished if there is sufficient time during the out-of-service period but this option could affect the return to
service schedule for the tank. Water draw-off valves should be inspected to determine their condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure-vacuum vents and breather valves should be inspected in the manner described in 8.2.11.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Liquid level gauging equipment should be visually inspected. For float-type gauges, the float should be examined to
find any corrosion or cracks and to ensure that it does not contain liquid. Cables and chains should be inspected for
corrosion, kinks, and wear. Sheaves should be inspected to verify that they turn freely and are properly lubricated.
Guides should be examined to ensure that they are free and not plugged. Any wooden parts should be checked for
signs of rot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a pressure gauge is used on a tank, it should be checked to ensure that the pipe connection to the gauge is not
plugged, that the gauge is operative, and that it is reading accurately. For ordinary uses, the gauge can be checked
for reasonable accuracy by connecting it to a suitable source of pressure and a gauge known to be accurate. For
calibration purposes, a deadweight tester or a calibrated test gauge should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4 Internal Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal inspections often require that the tank be out of service for entry and thorough internal visual inspection. As
described in 8.1, physical entry is not always required to make an internal inspection. To minimize out-of-service time,
the inspection should be planned carefully. As previously stated, all necessary equipment such as tools, lights,
ladders, and scaffolding should be assembled at the site in advance, and arrangements should be made to have all
necessary mechanical assistance available. For large, tall tanks, a tank buggy (a scaffold mounted on wheels) can be
used as shown in Figure 49. Remotely controlled automated ultrasonic crawlers can also be used as shown in Figure
50. The necessity of adequate lighting for internal inspections cannot be overemphasized. The value of taking
photographs or videotaping for inspection records should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.1 Precautions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tank must be emptied of liquid, freed of gases, and washed or cleaned out as appropriate for the intended
inspection. See 8.1 as well as API 2015, API 2016, and API 653. Appropriate certification of the tank for personnel
entry and inspection work should be part of the permit process. Many tanks that are cleaned after removal from
service are not completely gas-free or product free unless particular attention is paid to areas where hydrocarbon
build-up can be overlooked otherwise. Such areas include fixed roof support columns, floating-roof legs, and guide
poles all fabricated from pipe or other closed sections without drainage holes and bearing pads or striker pads on the
bottom that may have leak paths (exhibited by product weeping). Diffusers and other internal piping extensions inside
the tank open to the product can retain product in the piping inverts and should also be completely drained and
cleaned, and made otherwise safe prior to inspection work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.2 Preliminary Visual Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A preliminary, general visual inspection is the first step in internal inspection. Visual inspection is important for safety
reasons since the condition of the roof or top head and any internal supports should be established first. The shell and
bottom should follow—in that order—for the preliminary visual inspection. Any evident corrosion should be identified
as to location and type (pitting or uniform). The vapor space, the liquid-level line, and the bottom are areas where
corrosion will most likely be found. Floating-roof tanks should be examined for loose or broken seal hangers and shoe
bolt heads that can cause abrasive wear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Following the preliminary, general visual inspection, it may be necessary to do further initial work before a detailed
inspection can proceed. Any parts or any material hanging overhead that could fall, including large areas of corrosion
(scale) products on the under-side of the roof, should be removed or otherwise made safe. In cases of severely
corroded or damaged roof supports, it may be necessary to remove, repair, or replace the supports. Additional<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

From a personnel safety or equipment operability standpoint, it may be even be necessary to remove light coatings of
oil or surface rust. After these operations are completed, the detailed inspection can proceed under safer
circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should also be alert to accumulation of dry pyrophoric material (self-igniting when exposed to ambient
conditions) during inspection. These accumulations may occur on the tank bottom, in the seal rim space areas, or on
the top of rafters. Such accumulations that cannot be cleaned out prior to inspection should be kept moist to reduce
the potential for ignition. See API 2015 and API 2016 for more information on controlling pyrophoric deposits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.3 Types and Location of Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal corrosion of storage tanks depends on the contents of the tank and on the material of construction. Severely
corrosive conditions exist in unlined steel tanks storing corrosive chemicals or sour petroleum liquids. Corrosion will
be uniform throughout the interior of such tanks but non-uniform corrosion may also be present. In sour refinery fluid
service, the vapor space above the stored liquid can be an area of significant corrosion. This is caused by the
presence of corrosive vapors, such as hydrogen sulfide, mixed with moisture and air. The vapor-liquid interface is
another region that may be subject to accelerated corrosion, especially when fluids heavier than water are stored.
Although these fluids are not common in refinery storage, water will float on the stored fluid and accelerate corrosion.
Figure 51 shows an example of vapor-liquid line corrosion. In this case, the stored fluid was 98 % sulfuric acid (not
corrosive to carbon steel at this temperature and concentration). Moisture collecting in the tank produced a weak
(corrosive) acid in the upper layer of liquid, resulting in the deep grooving shown. When the stored fluid contains acid
salts or compounds, they may settle to the bottom of the tank; and if water is present, a weak (corrosive) acid will
form. Pitting-type corrosion can occur in the top of tanks directly under holes or openings where water can enter, at
breaks in mill scale, and adjacent to fallen scale particles on the bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipeline breakout tanks are often susceptible to accelerated corrosion behind floating-roof seals. Breakout tanks are
typically used for the temporary storage of product prior to its injection into a pipeline system or to a final delivery
location. Because storage is temporary, breakout tank roofs tend to be resting on legs the majority of the time. As the
tank heats and cools, condensation, product residuals, and air trapped behind the roof seals will result in accelerated
corrosion of the tank shell at the point where the roof seals normally rest. This type of corrosion is shown in Figure 52
and is typically identifiable as a band of corrosion extending around the tank circumferentially with a vertical height
corresponding to the seal height. The severity of the band of corrosion may vary around the tank circumference
depending on the location of the tank in relation to other tanks, the location of the sun, and other environmental
conditions. The weld heat affected zone (HAZ) has been found to corrode at an accelerated rate in relation to the
surrounding shell plate material. Tanks built to API 650 prior to the Seventh Edition of the standard may have been
constructed with incomplete penetration of the circumferential shell weld seams. The HAZ corrosion may expose
areas of incomplete fusion, resulting in areas where product can migrate within the interstice, presenting the
possibility of flammable conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 52—Corrosion Behind Floating-roof Seal<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Among other types of deterioration that can occur on the shells of storage tanks are hydrogen blistering, caustic
stress corrosion cracking, galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals in close proximity, and mechanical cracking.
These types of deterioration occur less frequently on the roofs and bottoms of tanks. Carbon steel that contains slag
inclusions and laminations is more susceptible to hydrogen blistering. Caustic stress corrosion cracking may occur in
tanks storing caustic products. Hot, strong caustic can also cause accelerated general corrosion. Areas of residual
stresses from welding or areas highly stressed from product loading are most susceptible to caustic corrosion. Such
corrosion thrives when the temperature rises above 150 °F (65 °C) and is most likely to occur around heating coil
connections at the tank wall or at piping supports on the bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the insulation is not removed, or for low-temperature storage tank details that can make external inspection
impractical, the shell can be inspected for external corrosion by ultrasonic area scans taken from the tank interior
while out of service. This may help to identify areas of external shell corrosion that would otherwise be undetected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.4 Tank Bottoms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Good lighting is essential for a quality visual inspection. A minimum 100-watt halogen light is usually adequate, but
more light is better. A brush blast of the bottom is necessary for uncoated bottoms or for coated bottoms where the
coating has deteriorated to enable a good visual inspection to be performed and to ensure the effectiveness of other
NDE techniques. The tank bottom should be inspected over its entire area to assess whether significant soil-side
corrosion has occurred and whether there are manufacturing or repair defects. A range of NDE tools capable of
rapidly scanning floor plate for metal loss are now in use across the industry. Magnetic Flux leakage (MFL) scanners
are the most common but hybrid MFL/Eddy Current, Saturate Low frequency Eddy Current *SLOFEC) and well as
ultrasonic based may also be used. On unlined tanks, many operators specify a brush blast or a commercial blast
cleaning to accommodate MFL bottom scanning and the visual inspection. When suspect areas are located, a more
detailed quantitative ultrasonic thickness or corrosion scan should be conducted. Typically, straight beam manual UT
is satisfactory for quantifying soil-side corrosion; UT flaw detectors showing the full waveform display should be used
for this measurement. Alternatively, multi-transducer ultrasonic inspection scanning devices with digital or analog
displays can be used to detect under-side corrosion. Areas of signal loss in ultrasonic data need to be qualified further
by additional inspection using methods such as manual A-scan, B-scan, or automated or shear wave ultrasonic
testing. When ultrasonic scanners are used, the surface condition of tank bottom plates should be sufficiently clean to
maintain adequate scanner accuracy during the inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Experience demonstrates considerable variability in the effectiveness of tank bottom scanning inspection and UT
prove-up. When conducted by qualified personnel, equipment, and procedures, scanning inspection can be highly
effective. The owner/operator should consider the benefit in conducting a performance demonstration for personnel
involved in tank bottom scanning and UT prove-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Statistical methods are also available for assessing the probable minimum remaining metal thickness of the tank
bottom, and the methods are based on a sampling of thickness scanning data. The number of measurements taken
for a statistical sampling will depend on the size of the tank and the degree of soil-side corrosion found. Typically,
0.2 % to 10 % of the bottom should be scanned randomly. The collection of thickness data is required to assess the
remaining bottom thickness. In addition, the outer circumference next to the shell should be included in the statistical
sampling. When significant corrosion is detected, the entire bottom should be scanned to determine the minimum
remaining metal thickness and the need for repairs. A note of caution is in order about statistical methods for
assessing the condition of tank bottoms. Soil-side corrosion tends to be localized, especially if the tank pad is not of
uniform consistency or has been contaminated with corrosive fluids. A statistically adequate sampling of the bottom
can be helpful in establishing the existence of corrosion that could result in a tank leak prior to the next scheduled
inspection. Statistical sampling methods are used for both physical entry and robotic (see Annex A.5) inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pits can sometimes be found by scratching suspected areas with a pointed scraper. When extensive and deep pitting
is located and measurements in the pits are necessary, the areas may be abrasive-blasted first, although it should be
noted that this process can also create holes or open existing holes. The depth of pitting can be measured with a pit
gauge or with a straight edge and steel rule (in large pits). An estimated depth can be found by extending the lead of
a mechanical pencil as a simulated depth gauge. Seams of riveted tanks can be checked by running a thin-bladed
scraper or knife along the riveted seam. If the seam is open, the scraper will pass into the opening and disclose the
separation. Rivets should be checked at random for tightness. Rivet heads should be checked visually for corrosion
(see 8.2.8.7). This may involve considerable scraping and picking to clean corrosion products from the rivet head.
Consideration should be given to determining whether enough of the rivet head remains to last until the next
inspection. Figure 53 shows a special case of severe corrosion near a tank bottom seam. The tank contents were
acidic and were kept in motion with an agitator. This deterioration, a combination of corrosion and mixing erosion,
would be further accelerated by the high stresses in the area of the riveted seam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depressions in the bottom and in the areas around or under roof supports and pipe coil supports should be checked
closely. Any water that gets into the tank may collect and remain at these points, thereby causing accelerated
corrosion. These support details should have seal welded bearing pads installed between the bottom and the support
since they are areas that cannot be inspected properly otherwise. Low points such as sumps or sloped bottoms may<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

which are subject to higher than normal corrosion rates, can be carefully inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If localized corrosion or pitting is present (from either the top-side or the under-side), single-point ultrasonic thickness
measurements alone are usually not an appropriate method of assessing the condition of the tank bottom. In such
areas, techniques providing broader inspection coverage—such as ultrasonic scanning, magnetic flux leakage
scanning, and coupon removal—may be necessary. Automated ultrasonic devices can be utilized to give a more
accurate picture of the soil-side condition of areas of the tank bottom plates. An example of extensive bottom
corrosion is shown in Figure 54 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Unlined tank bottoms must be sufficiently clean for an effective visual inspection of plate surface areas and welds.
MFL scanning equipment, when properly calibrated and operated per approved procedures, is capable of detecting
soil-side corrosion, even through thin-film coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some scanning equipment can also operate effectively through thick-film coatings and reinforced linings. General
metal loss and significant pitting can be effectively located using scanning equipment. Availability of such equipment
has greatly lessened the likelihood of not detecting such soil-side corrosion. It should be noted that sharp, small,
isolated pits may not be detected with this equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Coupon removal, the prevailing method of determining the presence of soil-side corrosion previously, is not a reliable
enough method for locating areas of localized soil-side pitting when compared to the alternative methods available
today. Representative sections or coupons (minimum size 12 in. [300 mm] each way) may be taken to confirm the
results of magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic examinations. The increasing accuracy of magnetic flux leakage,
ultrasonic scanning, and other automated methods makes coupon removal less useful, especially considering the
time and expense associated with replacing the coupons. Coupons may be advisable in assessing the root cause of
soil-side corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water draw-off details are subject to internal and external corrosion and crack-like flaws. They are especially subject
to crack-like flaws if they are cast iron, and they should be visually inspected to the maximum extent possible.
Conversion to a water draw-off sump of the type illustrated in API 650, Figure 5.21 may be desirable under certain
conditions. Internal low suction details should be examined for both internal and external corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bottom should be checked visually for damage caused by settlement. Significant unevenness of the bottom
indicates that this type of damage has occurred. If settlement is detected (internally or externally), the magnitude of
the settlement should be measured. (API 653, Annex B, provides guidelines for evaluation of tank bottom settlement.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 653, Annex C, provides additional checklist entries for tank bottom inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.5 Tank Shell<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The area of highest stress in flat bottom tanks is commonly at the shell-to-bottom joint detail and this area can be
susceptible to corrosion as shown in Figure 55. This area should receive a close visual inspection for evidence of
corrosion or other defects. If not coated (or if the coating is removed), this area can be further inspected by liquid
penetrant or magnetic particle examination. It should be noted that a riveted shell-to-bottom joint using a structural
angle detail is considered a mechanical joint, not a welded joint, and may not be suitable for certain types of
examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Interior sources of shell seam (welded, riveted or bolted) leakage noted during external inspection should be
investigated during internal inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The shell should be inspected visually for signs of corrosion. The product service conditions will determine the areas
of corrosion. The vapor space and operating liquid level are the areas most subject to corrosion. If the contents are
corrosive, the entire shell can be subject to corrosion. Figure 56 shows an example of a tank shell corroded
completely through because of corrosion. When significant corrosion is found, additional ultrasonic thickness
measurements should be taken to supplement those measurements obtained from the outside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When corroded areas of considerable size are located, sufficient thickness measurements should be recorded to
determine the controlling thickness in accordance with API 653, Section 4.3.2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While inspecting the bottom, the roof, and especially the shell of the tank for corrosion, the plate joints and nozzle
connection joints should be inspected carefully for any evidence of cracking. A bright light and a magnifying glass will
be very helpful in performing this work. If any evidence of cracking is found, a thorough investigation using magnetic
particle, liquid penetrant, radiographic, or ultrasonic shear wave examination may be necessary. See API 653, Annex
C for additional guidance on shell inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.6 Testing for Leaks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For tanks not provided with under-tank leak detection systems, a search for leaks through the bottom should be
performed at intervals prescribed by API 653, in addition to a search for leaks through the shell. If the tank is to be
hydrostatically tested during the course of the inspection, the hydrostatic test will be the best method for detecting
shell leaks. If a hydrostatic test is not to be made, a penetrating oil (such as diesel or automobile spring oil) can be
sprayed or brushed on one side of the shell plate in suspect areas and the other side can then be observed for
leakage. Lower temperature will extend the time for oil penetration to become visible on the other side of the area
being inspected. The liquid penetrant method used for finding cracks can also be used in much the same manner,
with the penetrant applied to one side of the plate and the developer applied to the other side. For either method,
approximately 24 hours may be required for leaks to become evident. Tank bottom leak detection methods are
described in Section 9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.7 Linings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Special inspection methods may be needed when the inside surfaces of a tank are lined with a corrosion resistant
material such as steel or alloy steel cladding, rubber or other synthetic fabric, organic or inorganic coatings, glass, or
concrete (see API 652). The most important considerations to ensure that the lining is in good condition are that it is in
proper position and does not have holes or cracks. With alloy steel or more rigid metal linings such as nickel and
Monel, inspections should be made for leaks or cracks in the lining joints. A careful visual examination is usually
required. If there is evidence of cracking, the liquid penetrant examination method can be used. The magnetic particle
examination method cannot be used on non-magnetic lining material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With rubber, synthetics, glass, and organic and inorganic linings, the general condition of the lining surface should be
inspected for mechanical damage. Holes in the lining are suggested by bulging, blistering, or spalling. A thorough
method of inspecting for leaks in such linings is the use of a high-voltage, low-current electrode that is passed over
the nonconductive lining while the other end of the circuit is attached to the steel of the tank. This is commonly called
a holiday detector. An electric arc will form between the brush electrode and the steel tank through any holes in the
lining. Caution should be used so that the test voltage does not approach a value that might puncture or damage the
lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To avoid mechanical damage to the linings, considerable care should be taken when working inside tanks lined with
rubber, synthetics, glass, or organic or inorganic coatings. Glass-lined tanks are especially susceptible to severe
damage that cannot be easily repaired. Glass-lined vessels should never be hammered or subjected to any impact on
the inside or the outside because the lining can crack. It is advisable to paint them a distinctive color or to stencil a
warning against striking them prominently on the external shell. It is important to keep spillage off the outside of glass-
lined tanks. Corrosion from spillage can result in hydrogen penetration and cause defects in the glass liners (glass-
lined tanks commonly contain materials that are more corrosive than can be stored in unlined or internally coated
tanks).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Concrete linings are difficult to inspect adequately, primarily because the surface is porous. Concrete-lined steel
bottoms are impractical to inspect unless the concrete is removed. A view of a lead roof lining is shown in Figure 57 .
Mechanical damage, breakage, spalling, major cracking, bulging, and a complete separation of the lining can be
seen. Minor cracks and areas of porosity are more difficult to find. In some instances, they may be seen as rust spots
on the surface of the concrete caused by steel corrosion products leaking through the lining. Corrosion behind the
lining is possible where the concrete bond with the steel has failed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.8 Roof and Structural Members<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ordinarily, a visual inspection of the interior roof plates, framing system and column supports is sufficient. When
corrosion or distortion is evident or heavy under-side roof corrosion is indicated by external thickness measurements,
access scaffolding should be erected so that measurements can be taken internally. If corrosion is noted on the roof
and upper shell, then structural members may also be thinning, possibly at as much as twice the rate of the thinning
of the roof or shell, since both sides of the structural members are exposed to the corrosive vapors. See API 653,
Annex C, for guidance that is more detailed. Figure 58 shows an example of internal corrosion of roof plates and
rafters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When local corrosion has been found on the inside of the shell, any roof support columns should be checked closely
at the same level. Transfer calipers and steel rules or ultrasonic thickness equipment may be used in measuring
structural members. Measurements should be checked against the original thickness or the thickness of uncorroded
sections. If corrosion or distortion of the members is evident, structural welds and bolting should be examined to
determine the extent of the damage. Light hammer taps can be used to test the tightness of bolts and the soundness
of structural members. Figure 59 shows the results of failure of roof supports (wooden supports are unusual in
modern tanks but some such tanks may still exist).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The under-side of all types of floating roofs should be inspected for corrosion and deterioration not seen during the
top-side inspection described in 8.3.3. Vital parts of some roof seals, such as the hanger supports of a mechanical
shoe seal, can only be inspected from the under-side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.9 Internal Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any internal equipment such as pipe coils, coil supports, swing lines, nozzles, and mixing devices should be visually
inspected. Coils and supports should be checked for corrosion, deformation, misalignment and cracking. Except for
cast iron parts, the coils and supports may be ultrasonically tested or hammer-tested. If wooden coil supports are
used, they should be checked with a scraper or knife for rot, and the bottom should be checked for corrosion under
the wooden supports. Consideration should be given to replacing wooden supports with metal supports. Coils should
be tested hydro-pneumatically for leaks. Wet steam coils should be inspected for condensation grooving in the bottom
of the piping coil using radiography or ultrasonic testing. If cracks are suspected in the nozzles or nozzle welds, they
should be checked by the magnetic particle or liquid penetrant examination method. Figure 60 shows a typical
installation of heating units in a tank, and Figure 61 shows an example of heating coil corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The swing lines of floating-roof tanks may be equipped with pontoons, rollers, and tracks. The pontoons should be
hammer-tested and checked for leaks. The thickness of the pontoon wall can be measured by ultrasonic testing. The
tracks and alignment rollers should be inspected visually for corrosion, wear, and distortion. The roof deck in the area
of these tracks should be checked for bulging, which can occur if the swing line pontoons create an extensive upward
thrust. Swing line rollers in contact with the under-side of internal floating roofs should also be inspected for damage
or restricted movement. See API 653, Annex C, for more information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thickness of the tank nozzles and pipe walls should be measured with ultrasonic thickness instruments
(especially if the connecting pipelines carry corrosive products or if there is any other reason to expect internal metal
loss). Visual examination of a piping connection is usually made at the flange connection closest to the tank (by
dropping a valve or unbolting the connection). Caliper measurements of the pipe can be made if a joint is opened.
The caliper measurements will require emptying the line and blinding it at some point beyond the opened joint,
emptying the connecting piping between the point of isolation and the open joint, and making that connecting piping
safe and gas-free. Gasket surfaces of opened flanges should be checked for corrosion, and the flange faces should<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

outside diameters or it can be determined by ultrasonic thickness measurement. As corrosion may be greater on one
side of the nozzle, a visual or ultrasonic thickness check for eccentricity of the nozzle interior surfaces should
accompany these measurements and calculations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5 Testing of Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When storage tanks are built, they are tested in accordance with the standard to which they were constructed. The
same methods can be used to inspect for leaks and to check the integrity of the tank after repair work. When major
repairs or alterations have been completed, such as the installation of a new tank bottom or the replacement of large
sections of shell plate, the test requirements are specified in API 653, Section 12. If the repairs have not restored the
tank to an equivalent full-height operating condition, the water height for the test should be limited in accordance with
the lower strength conditions revealed during a re-evaluation of stored product height limitations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The word testing, as used in this section, applies only to the process of filling the tank with a liquid or gaseous fluid, at
the appropriate level or pressure, to verify the tank for strength or for shell or roof leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Atmospheric storage tanks designed to withstand only a small (0.5 lbf/in. 2  [3.5 kPa] gauge is typical) pressure over
the static pressure of the liquid in the tank, are normally tested by filling with water. The lower portions of a tank are
thus tested at a pressure that depends on the depth of water. All visible portions of the tank can be checked for leaks
up to the water level. Leaks in bottoms resting on pads also can be detected if the test fluid seeps outside the tank
perimeter where it can be seen visually. For certain high-strength and high-alloy steels, consideration should be given
to the purity of the water for testing since contaminants such as chlorides can lead to the possibility of stress corrosion
cracking (see API 571). Consideration should also be given to the notch toughness of the shell material at the air and
water temperatures existing at the time of the test. A discussion of notch toughness and brittle fracture can be found
in API 571 and in API 653, Section 5. If water is not available and if the roof of the tank is reasonably air tight or can
be made so, a carefully controlled air test using air pressure not exceeding 2 in. (0.50 kPa) of water pressure may be
applied. This type of test is of very little use as a strength test and is used only in inspection for leaks. For this test,
indicator solution is applied to the outside surface of any suspect areas of the tank, shell, and roof weld seams, so
that the air escaping through any leak path will produce bubbles indicating the leak location. Roof seams can be
effectively vacuum-tested in the same manner. Very small leaks and some large leaks in welded seams may not be
detectable using the vacuum box method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_74>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>66
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Low-pressure storage tanks can be tested in a similar manner as atmospheric storage tanks but at slightly higher
pressure depending upon their design (see API 620).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carefully controlled pneumatic testing can be used when water or other suitable liquid is unavailable, when a tank
would be unstable when filled with liquid, or when a trace of water cannot be tolerated in the stored product. If a tank
is significantly corroded, pneumatic testing should be avoided. If it is necessary to use the method, caution should be
exercised to avoid excessive stresses that could lead to brittle failure. Inspection for leaks can easily be made by
applying an indicator solution to the outside weld seams of the tank and looking for bubbles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.6 Inspection Checklists<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 653, Annex C provides sample checklists of items for consideration when conducting external and internal
inspections. These checklists, although relatively thorough, are not necessarily complete for all possible situations.
Additionally, these checklists are not intended as minimum inspection requirements for all situations. They should be
used judiciously by the inspector as guidance for issues and items to be checked during inspections, both internal and
external.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9 Leak Testing and Hydraulic Integrity of the Bottom<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks that have impermeable foundations (reinforced concrete), under-tank liners, or tanks constructed with double
bottoms, provide an inherent leak detection system which directs leaks to the perimeter of the tank where they can be
visually detected in accordance with the leak detection provisions of API 650, Appendix I. These systems are
collectively referred to as release prevention barriers (RPBs). RPBs are not typically retrofit with additional leak
detection devices, cables or sensors since these would provide limited added value based upon industry experience.
The owner/operator may elect to perform additional bottom integrity testing after repairs are made; the procedures that
follow may assist in that assessment. While tankage that complies with a tank integrity program built upon API 653
generally has acceptable environmental performance, specific circumstances may warrant the use of additional
measures to ensure that tanks are not leaking. When regulations or a risk assessment indicates the need for additional
measures then the owner/operator can apply advanced technology leak detection systems such as those specified in
API 334. Hydraulic integrity confirmation should be performed at intervals established in API 653, Section 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section provides information on procedures and practices that may be used to assess the hydraulic integrity of
the tank bottom. Except as specifically required in API Standard 653, all procedures identified here are recognized to
be optional when used for attaining an enhanced confidence in the hydraulic integrity for a repaired or newly
constructed replacement tank bottom. For those owner/operators that already have procedures for determining the
suitability of the tank bottom, this discussion may serve as a reference when policy warrants a change in their
methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 62 identifies test procedures and summarizes operational issues that the tank operator should consider when
assessing a suitable inspection strategy regarding the hydraulic integrity of tank bottom construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where API 653 shows preference for specific procedures in specific applications, these cases are noted. It is
beyond the scope of this document to assess the specific performance characteristics of one method compared to
another, or to cover the impact of multiple testing with multiple technologies. More information on these topics has
been published previously in such documents as API 334. As with any NDE method, it is the responsibility of the
owner/operator to make that assessment. It is anticipated that leak test personnel (examiners) have qualifications
consistent with API 653. Additional factors to consider include vendors and technologies that have been qualified by
third-party testing agencies or owner/operators. These methods may be required by various regulatory agencies or
companies and provide other effective ways to evaluate the needed qualifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>When using information provided in this section, considerations for schedule, operational, economic and
environmental characterizations should be reviewed. An owner/operator should be familiar with conditions under
which the procedures can be used and in the case of developing technology, API 334 should be consulted. There are
eleven procedures associated with determination of the hydraulic integrity of a tank bottom. Of this total number of
procedures there are six that are conducted with the tank typically out of service during the API 653 internal
inspection and another five procedures that are applied with the tank either partially or completely filled to its safe fill
height with the service fluid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2 Leak Integrity Methods Available During Out-of-Service Periods<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Visual inspection may be direct type when the surface is readily accessible to place the eye within 24 in. (61 cm) of
the surface at an angle of not less than 30 degrees. The minimum illumination is 15-foot candles (25 lumens) for
general viewing and 50-foot candles (100 lumens) for viewing of small anomalies. Visual inspection may be remote
by using mirrors, cameras or other suitable instruments. The test would detect surface defects such as cracking, weld
undercut, corrosion, dents, gouges, weld scars, incomplete welds etc. This method is applicable to all visually<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.2 Evaluation by Wicking Examination of Shell-to-Bottom Weld<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is a practical test because it provides information regarding the actual hydraulic integrity of the weld with a
product less viscous than the product being stored. A leak could be easily located and repaired. The process of
applying a highly penetrating oil or dye penetrant to one side of a weld (initial pass or completed weld as required by
the applicable standard of construction or repair), then letting it stand for at least four hours (12 hours is preferred) and
observing if it penetrates to the other side of the weld is called a wicking test (see API 650, Section 8.2.4.1 and API
653, Section 12.1.6). Personnel performing this test should have the same visual acuity required for performing other
visual methods (see API 653 and ASME Section V).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.3 Evaluation by Bubble Test Examination—Pressure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For this method, the inside surface of the bottom is coated with an indicator solution. Air at not more than 3 in. (0.75
kPa) of water pressure is injected by a hose under the bottom of the tank through the clay seal or through a drilled and
tapped hole (or holes) in the bottom. The bottom is then inspected for bubbles, which will indicate any leaks. An
alternative approach consists of pumping approximately 6 in. (150 mm) of water into the tank and then placing air at
not more than 9 in. (2.24 kPa) of water pressure under the tank. Leaks will be evident if air bubbles through the water
in the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effectiveness of these methods can be improved by tapping the entire bottom with an air-operated hammer. The
sharp jarring of the bottom plates will frequently cause enough scale to pop out of pits to allow them to leak. When
using 9 in. (2.24 kPa) of water pressure, the water must be pumped into the tank before air pressure is applied under
the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A variation on the bubble test method consists of pumping water under the tank to a depth of approximately 6 in. (150

<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.4 Evaluation by Bubble Test Examination—Vacuum<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another method for finding leaks is the vacuum box method, which is particularly useful on the flat bottom of a tank
but can also be adapted to the shell and the shell-to-bottom joint. An example of a typical vacuum box is shown in
Figure 63 and Figure 64. In this method, the suspect area is first coated with an indicator solution. In cold weather, it
is important that the leak-testing liquid be formulated for use at the temperature involved. The open side of the
vacuum box with soft rubber gaskets attached is then pressed tightly over the area. A vacuum is developed inside the
box by means of a vacuum pump or air ejector connected to the box through a hose. Leaks will appear as bubbles
when looking through the glass top of the vacuum box. The method requires a minimum vertical clearance of 6 in.
(150 mm) between the bottom and any obstruction for placement of device and accessibility to viewing the local area
being examined. Additional details on test implementation are described in API 650, Section 8.6. Some inspection
technicians offer an enhancement to this approach by supplementing the methodology with a detectable gas that has
been pumped under the bottom (see 9.2.7.1). A detector for this gas is then attached to the vacuum box.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.5 Evaluation by Liquid Penetrant<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Liquid penetrant inspection is a test method that can be used to locate weld defects such as cracks, seams, laps or
porosity that are open to the surface of the weld. Liquid penetrant is applied to the weld where it will enter
discontinuities in the surface, primarily by capillary action. The excess penetrant is removed using water or a cleaning<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_78>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>70
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>agent. The weld is then allowed to dry and a developer is applied. The developer acts as a blotter to draw the
penetrant out of the discontinuities back to the surface and as a contrasting background for the penetrant. The dyes
are either color contrast (viewable in white light against a contrasting color developer) or fluorescent (visible under
ultraviolet or black light). Discontinuities should show clearly as colored marks on a contrast background (visible light
type) or a glowing fluorescent mark (ultraviolet light type). This inspection may be used on any weld. The test may be
most useful in areas where other physical weld evaluations cannot be performed due to access limitations. Additional
details on test implementation are described in API 650, Section 8.4. It is not required by API 650 or API 653, but is
listed as an owner/operator-specified option.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.6 Evaluation by Magnetic Particle Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The weld area to be examined is first magnetized and then ferromagnetic particles are placed on the weld. These will
form patterns on the surface of the weld where there are distortions in the magnetic field caused by such weld
discontinuities as cracks, seams, laps or porosity. The patterns are most evident for discontinuities located near the
surface of the weld and oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field. The test is run a second time with the direction of
the new magnetic field set up perpendicular to the old one in order to pick up discontinuities missed in the first pass.
The magnetic particles are either color contrasting (viewable in white light) or fluorescent (visible under ultraviolet or a
black light) type. The color contrast type is either wet or dry. Discontinuities should show clearly as colored marks
(visible light type) or a glowing fluorescent mark (ultraviolet light type). The technology may be used on any weld. The
test may be most useful in areas where other physical weld evaluations cannot be performed due to access
limitations. Magnetic particle inspection is not required by API 650 and API 653, but is listed as an owner/operator-
specified option.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.7 Evaluation by Detectable Gas<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.7.1 Under-bottom Injection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another method being used successfully is the injection of inert gas with a tracer element under the tank. An
advantage of this method is that welded repairs can be made immediately with the inert gas under the bottom and a
re-check can be made immediately after repairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The technology has been applied to existing, replacement and new tank bottoms. The tank must be emptied and
cleaned prior to the testing. Tank cleaning by abrasive blasting will sometimes cause deep pits or very thin areas to
begin leaking when scale or debris is the only material that was preventing leakage. This test method is best suited
for uncoated plates or tank plates prior to coating or lining. This method is also well suited for determining the location
of leaks in tank plates having a known or suspected leak.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Testing of tank bottoms using a detectable gas beneath the tank plates is accomplished by injecting the gas, which is
lighter than air, beneath the tank plates in adequate amounts to allow dispersal over the entire under-side of the plate.
Welding grade helium is a common gas used for this application. This test is performed by detectable gas injection
through a standpipe or under-tank telltale piping system using a threaded coupling or other suitable connection. If the
tank is not equipped with a leak detection system, or there is no way to inject detectable gas through the leak
detection system, detectable gas injection may be accomplished by drilling and tapping holes in the tank bottom.
Sampling ports are sometimes drilled in the bottom plates to confirm that the detectable gas has spread across the
entire bottom. Once it has been confirmed that the detectable gas has dispersed across the tank bottom, detection
instrumentation is scanned over the bottom from the product side. Instruments capable of detecting a few parts per
million (ppm) of the tracer gas are then used for sniffing for leaks on the product side of the tank bottom as shown in
Figure 65. The sensitivity of this test is dependent on the detectable gas concentrations (background) under the tank
bottom and type of detection equipment used on the top surface that will help make tracer gas detection more
successful.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method of testing is applicable to 100 % of all bottom plates, welds, bottom-to-shell weld, patch plate welds, clip
attachment welds, sump welds, weld scars, tear-offs, or other defects away from welds. Special attention should be
paid to three-plate laps and areas of severe deformations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If the subsurface under the bottom or the interstitial space between double bottoms is below the water table or
saturated with water/product/liquid, the dispersal of detectable gas along the under-side of the bottom plates may be
restricted or impossible. Consideration as to the feasibility of the test is required under these circumstances. De-
watering or purging may be viable options to eliminate the problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In applying this test method, the inspector and/or technician should consider the design and construction of the
bottom. If the bottom is anchored to a concrete pad, such as in a cut and cover or bunkered tank,
compartmentalization of bottom plates or bottom sections may exist. In this circumstance, it may be necessary to drill
numerous holes in a bottom to ensure complete dispersion underneath. In addition, there is a risk of over
pressurization of the tank bottom and possible damage to, or failure of the anchoring system. Consideration as to the
feasibility of the test is required under these circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.7.2 Above-bottom Injection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The typical and preferred approach for implementing this leak test is to perform it with liquid in the tank as described
in 9.3.2. Liquid loading has two primary advantages: 1) dispersion of the chemical marker is facilitated by the liquid;
and 2) liquid loading will increase the probability of opening small cracks that might be closed otherwise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The primary difference between implementing the technology without liquid loading compared to the approach
outlined in 9.3.2 is the means of injecting the marker gas. In a liquid-free tank, plastic sheets are taped to the bottom
and the marker gas is injected under the plastic. Sampling for gas in the under-tank well system is accomplished as
described in 9.3.2. In addition, all of the limitations described in that section with respect to sampling and gas
dispersion are applicable for the liquid-free implementation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

selecting the appropriate technology for their application. The technology descriptions are presented here in summary
form.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.1 Evaluation by Leak Detection Systems Using Volumetric/Mass Measurement Technology<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leak detection systems based on volumetric and mass measurement technologies are an outgrowth of the automatic
tank gauging industry and are a proven system for leak detection for underground fuel storage tanks (USTs). They
have been in general use for USTs for several years and as such are widely accepted. Although they have been used
commercially on ASTs with some success, third party validation testing is limited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Both volumetric and mass systems operate on the principle of measuring the amount of liquid in a tank over time
while eliminating or compensating for those variables in a tank that are unrelated to a leak. Any liquid loss or apparent
volumetric/mass change not attributed to those variables may be considered a leak. These methods have the
advantage of directly testing the hydraulic integrity of the tank bottom under near-operational conditions (with liquid in
the tank and during the hydrostatic test prior to placing in service). There are several classes of systems, including:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) volumetric level and temperature measurement;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) mass measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.1.1 Evaluation by Leak Detection by Volumetric Level and Temperature Measurement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Volumetric level and temperature measurement technologies use sensors to measure the level of a liquid in the tank
over time. There are two distinct implementations of this technology. In one mode, it is applied to a liquid level of at
least 50 % of safe fill height; in the other mode, it is applied to a liquid height of a few feet (meters). This level is
converted to volume using strapping charts. Additional sensors may be used to measure the temperature of the liquid
(and tank shell) at various points. After eliminating from consideration the volume changes caused by noise (normally
occurring events such as tank and fuel growth or shrinkage due to temperature changes) any remaining product
volume drop may be considered a leak. The keys to volumetric level and temperature measurement are first, the
measurement of the liquid level and second, the ability of the system to compensate for noise, primarily change in
fluid and shell temperatures. More details on these technologies can be found in API 334.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.1.2 Leak Detection by Mass Balancing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mass measurement technologies use sensors to measure the pressure of a liquid in the tank over time by use of a
differential pressure sensor. When conducting in-service leak tests, the owner/operator should consider the
appropriate liquid fill height depending on the application and technology. Additional sensors are used to measure or
compensate for the temperature drift of the differential pressure sensor. Other sensors are typically attached directly
to the shell to assess diametric changes attributable to temperature change. After eliminating from consideration the
volume changes caused by noise (normally occurring events such as tank growth or shrinkage due to temperature
changes) any remaining product pressure drop may be considered a leak. The keys to mass measurement are first,
the measurement of the liquid level and second the ability of the system to compensate for noise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.2 Evaluation by Detectable Gas Above-bottom in Liquid Inoculation (Chemical Marker Technology)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Detectable marker chemical (inoculate) has been applied to existing, replacement, and new tank bottoms. The tank is
full or partially full of product or water prior to testing and may be used on coated plates, or tank bottom plates prior to
coating or lining. This test is conducted without disruption of operations and may be useful during acceptance
evaluation of a new tank or bottom by inoculating water just prior to the hydrostatic test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Testing of tank bottoms using a detectable marker chemical in the tank is accomplished by injecting a volatile
chemical into the receipt line, directly into the liquid, or the water draw-off line. The required concentration is a function
of the following parameters:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) mixing of the marker in the liquid;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) leak detection threshold;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_81>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES   FOR  A TMOSPHERIC   AND  L OW -P RESSURE  S TORAGE  T ANKS
73<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) sensitivity of detection equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) composition of the soil under the tank;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) wait time between inoculation and sampling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typically, an acceptable inoculation concentration is on the order of 1 to 10 parts per million (ppm). The marker must
be compatible with product purity and comply with any regulations (e.g. non-ozone-depleting; approved for used in
motor fuels or fuel for commercial aircraft, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the subsurface of the bottom or interstitial space is below the water table or saturated with water/product/ liquid,
migration of the marker chemical will be impeded. Two options are available:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) de-watering or purging prior to sample collection; or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) extension of waiting time for migration of inoculate in the liquid up to 60 days depending upon conditions and
tank size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hollow tubes are installed under the tank bottom to extract air samples for analysis. A tank with secondary
containment bottom details may have suitable detection tubes already installed. The under-tank gas collection system
should be installed such that the termination point of each pipe covers the entire tank bottom, consistent with the
anticipated leak detection threshold and the parameters listed. For many applications, acceptable leak detection
performance can be realized with a tube layout so that no part of the bottom is over 20 ft (6 m) in lateral direction from
any termination point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The leak detection analytical equipment used to perform leak testing should be in calibration and capable of detecting
concentrations consistent with the parameters listed previously. The marker gas detection equipment should be
calibrated and tested for sensitivity and proper function throughout testing in accordance with the operating
instructions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.3 Evaluation by Acoustic Emission Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acoustic emission testing is based on the principle that liquid escaping through a fissure in the tank bottom or shell
produces a detectable sound. The demonstration of this principle has shown that two types of sound are produced
simultaneously. One type is detectable in the backfill material below the bottom. This impulsive sound extends
beyond the audible frequency range and is the distinguishing characteristic signal upon which passive acoustic
emission testing is based. The continuous hissing sound, even though it is generated by flow through a fissure, is
considered, along with other detectable sounds, to be noise. For acoustic emission testing, noise is defined as any
sound, continuous and/or intermittent, which is not a signal. The detection method includes the use of sound sensors
that identify the appropriate sounds and therefore the presence of a leak. While this method cannot pinpoint the exact
location of the leak, in some instances, when a number of sensors are used, the various signals can be triangulated to
indicate the general location, so that more specific methods can be used to pinpoint its location. The acoustic
emission test method is theoretically applicable for concurrently testing the parent metal plates, the bottom lap welds,
and the sump(s), e.g. all tank bottom areas wetted by and under the head pressure of the tank contents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acoustic systems operate on the principle of detection by location. The basis for identifying a leak, a fissure in the
tank bottom through which a fluid is leaking, is the point of origin of the signal. The frequency of an intermittent
impulsive signal greatly depends on the condition of the backfill material. Porous materials such as well-drained sand
could be expected to generate more impulsive signals per unit of time than cohesive materials like well-compacted
clay if all other tank conditions were the same. The degree of saturation of water in the backfill also impacts the
frequency of signals. If water or hydrocarbon product, possibly from an existing tank leak or possibly from natural
characteristics of the foundation backfill and its general drainage, significantly displaces air immediately below the
bottom plate at the location of a fissure, the impulsive signals may be reduced completely. The sources of noise,
against which a signal must be discerned, include sounds initiated external to the tank as well as within the tank. The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_82>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>74
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>effects of noise external to the tank can often be avoided by testing during quiet periods including low activity of
nearby operations. Intermittent sounds initiated within the tank structure may be very similar to impulsive signals and
must be accounted for in the reduction and interpretation of the collected data. Lining of the tank bottom prior to
running this test may increase the chance that a leak path in a bottom plate or weld will be masked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The type of sensor used in acoustic emission testing is an accelerometer, which converts sound energy into
measurable electrical output. The sensors are clamped around the periphery of the tank shell, usually at evenly
spaced intervals and near the bottom. In some implementations, at least one sensor may be placed at a higher
elevation than the others to differentiate sounds initiated at the liquid surface or by the floating roof from sounds
initiated at the bottom. In addition, the test operator may choose to cluster some sensors to account for reflected
sounds created by echoes from internal piping and structural members. An echo, if undifferentiated from direct
signals, causes errors in locating the origin of the signal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the acoustic test method to be able to indicate signals apart from noise, data collection algorithms and signal
processing algorithms are used. The data recorder receiving all raw output from the sensors feeds these electrical
outputs to a data collection algorithm to account for predictable unwanted sounds. The algorithm also is used for
discrimination of multiple reflections from direct signals. The use of a high-performance algorithm complements the
placing of sensors to account for the echo phenomena. The algorithm is configured for known general test conditions
of velocity of sound in water or product, diameter of the tank, height of hydro - test water, and spacing of sensors on the
shell. The algorithms will typically be able to discern signals and their point of origin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The primary limitations of the technology concern the generation of the acoustic leak signal and distinguishing it from
other sounds that will occur within the tank environment. The nature and condition of the backfill must be known,
since it is an integral part of the acoustic system. Sludge and deposits that settle on the tank bottom may cause signal
attenuation and must be taken into account. The sounds from a floating roof and its sliding seals, though nominally at
rest, must be accounted for. Connected piping must be considered, as the noise of normal terminal operations such
as pumping or valve actuation may be transmitted to the tank. Testing during quiet periods of low activity in near-by
operations is often the most effective approach. A pre-test waiting period is recommended to accommodate and
minimize noise from tank deformation and to allow for tank and foundation deformations that occur because of a
change in the liquid height. Potential leaks in under-bottom piping require special attention in the placement of the
sensors and may not be detected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effects of weather conditions such as wind and precipitation should be considered to minimize weather related
noise. Tests are often put on hold or postponed during periods of adverse weather conditions. The following
information should be part of the inspection record from any such acoustic emissions test:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) date of test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) certification level and name of operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10 Integrity of Repairs and Alterations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repairs and alterations to tanks can affect the strength, safety, or environmental integrity of the tank and thus require
inspection after the repairs or alterations are completed. It is a good practice to make a visual check of all repairs and
alterations to see that they have been done properly. In addition, some repairs and alterations may require other
types of nondestructive examination as specified in API 653. This section will discuss some typical repairs and the
recommended methods of inspection to assure the integrity of repaired or altered tanks. Not every defect or non-
conformity will require repair. The decision to repair or not repair should be made by an engineer familiar with storage
tank design, construction and maintenance issues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2 Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before any repairs or alterations are made on tanks, the applicable codes, standards, rules of construction, and
jurisdictional requirements should be known, so that the method of repair will comply with all applicable requirements.
As a minimum, for guidance on repairs and alterations, refer to API 653, Section 9. All tank dismantling and
reconstruction should be performed in accordance with API 653, Section 8 and Section 10, as well as the appropriate
sections of API 650.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.1 Repairs to Welded Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repairs made by welding on the bottom, shell, or roof of a tank should be conducted and inspected in accordance
with API 653, Section 9, Section 11, and Section 12.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All crack-like flaws should be repaired unless a fitness-for-service (FFS) assessment (see API 579) or another
appropriate evaluation indicates crack-like flaws do not need to be repaired in order to insure the integrity of the tank.
Crack-like flaws in bottom or shell plates should be repaired by chipping, grinding, gouging or burning the flaw out
entirely from end to end before welding. If several crack-like flaws occur in one plate, it may be more economical to
replace the plate completely. Welded repairs of crack-like flaws should be inspected carefully to ensure that the
cracks were completely removed, especially at the ends of the welded areas, using magnetic-particle or liquid-
penetrant examination, as appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.2 Repairs to Riveted or Bolted Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repairs can be made by riveting or bolting, using the procedures given in the original standards for riveted or bolted
tanks. Repairs to these tanks may also be made by welding if the weldability of the steel is first confirmed by physical
testing. At leaking rivet seams, rivets can be caulked, re-riveted, welded, or abrasive-blasted, and epoxy coated. Any
epoxy coating or repair material should be allowed to cure as recommended by the manufacturer before the tank is
returned to service. When parts or riveted seams are sealed by welding, the rivets and seams should be caulked for
at least 6 in. (150 mm) in all directions from the welding. It should be noted that rivets and seams contaminated with
hydrocarbons are difficult to repair by welding techniques. The weld repair may require several attempts, and in some
cases, may not be successful in sealing the seam or rivet. Defective rivets can also be replaced by tap bolts,
especially in the bottom plates where it is not possible to reach the under-side of the bottom. All repairs that involve
caulking, riveting, bolting, epoxy coating, and partial welding should be inspected. The typical methods of inspecting
repairs to riveted joints include visual, penetrating oil, hammer testing, and vacuum box or tracer gas techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When making weld repairs to rivet heads or seams, special procedures that minimize distortion and residual stresses
should be followed. These include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) use small diameter electrodes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) set welding machine at low amperage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_84>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>76
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  575<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) keep weld beads small;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) use back-step bead application;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) lightly ring-weld rivet heads adjacent to the weld area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consider using two-pass welds for rivets and seams that are to be seal welded, to allow for the possibility that the first
pass will be poor due to hydrocarbon contamination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In many cases, the preferred repair method for leaking seams and rivets is the use of an epoxy coating. This repair
method removes the risk of creating additional leaks in adjacent seams and rivets as the result of shrinkage stresses
associated with all weld repairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.3 Bottom Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For requirements on repairs to tank bottoms, see API 653, Section 9.10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If complete tank bottom plates must be replaced, the replacement plates can be taken into the tank through a slot that
is cut in the bottom shell course or they may be brought in through a door sheet and inserted into the slots from inside
the tank or they may be lowered into the tank through access created in the fixed roof or external / internal floating
roof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When new bottoms are installed through slots, as illustrated in Figure 66, each sketch plate should be welded in place
or securely wedged to the upper part of the shell plate before cutting the next slot. This will prevent the shell from
sagging between slots. A perimeter layer of clean sand fill, metal grating, or a concrete pad should be installed under
and at least 3 in. (76 mm) beyond the projection of the new bottom so that the shell is supported on the foundation
through the new bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 66—Method of Repairing Tank Bottoms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the old bottom has been protected cathodically, or if cathodic protection is planned for a new bottom, the old bottom
should be completely removed. If concrete is used as the spacer for a new bottom in conjunction with a non-
conductive liner (release prevention barrier) then the old bottom may remain in place. If sand or aggregate is used as
a spacer, anodes should be installed between the old and new bottoms in accordance with API 651 if the old bottom
is not removed. For tanks retrofit with second bottoms and which use a concrete spacer, a cathodic protection system
is not necessary for either the old bottom or the new bottom, even if the tank was previously protected by cathodic
protection. This is because the old bottom no longer serves as the release prevention barrier but the elastomeric liner
that is installed electrically isolates the old bottom from the new bottom and the concrete is not considered corrosive
as well as being better drained than the original foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Nondestructive examination requirements for bottom repairs and alterations are given in API 653, Section 12 and are
summarized in API 653, Annex F, as well as API 650. When entire tank bottoms are installed, the NDE requirements
are the same as for new tanks constructed to API 650. These requirements include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) visual examinations (F.2.1.c);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) magnetic particle and/or liquid penetrant examinations (F.3.1.d and F.3.2);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) vacuum box testing (F.5.1.a and F.5.1.b);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) tracer gas testing (F.6.1);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) radiographic examinations (F.9.1.e and F.9.1.f);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to conducting the above examinations as appropriate, the hydraulic integrity of tank bottoms that have
undergone repairs or alterations may be further assessed by applying the testing procedures contained in Section 9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.4 Shell Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.4.1  The requirements for shell repairs and alterations outlined in API 653, Sections 9.2 to 9.9 should be
followed. Since the reinstallation of door sheets can be difficult for even experienced tank specialists, the following
procedure is suggested .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Locate the door sheet where the bottom plate is reasonably level for a distance of at least 5 ft on either side of the
door sheet vertical seams. This will prevent differential bottom settlement due to load transfer when the door sheet
is removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Make the door sheet cuts so that the vertical and horizontal weld joints meet the weld spacing requirements in API
653, Section 7. Leaving a shell lip by making the bottom door sheet cut above the shell-to-bottom weld can
provide sufficient stiffness if bottom buckling is a concern. Alternatively, the bottom door sheet cut may be made at
the shell-to-bottom joint. This method may require a hydrostatic test of the tank following completion of the repairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Provide reinforcement to the shell around the door sheet cutout as required to prevent distortion of the shell from
the unsupported dead load or wind loads. This reinforcement can be structural shapes welded to the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) After reinstalling the door sheet, radiograph the weld in accordance with API 653, Section 12.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.4.2  Nondestructive examination requirements for shell repairs are presented in API 653, Section 12 and are
summarized in API 653, Annex F. These requirements include:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) visual examinations (F.2.1.a to F.2.1.f);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.5 Roof Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Roof plates can usually be replaced in the same manner in which they were installed when originally constructed. For
further guidance, see API 653, Section 9.11, Section 9.12, and Section 9.13.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nondestructive examination requirements for roof repairs and alterations are presented on API 653, Section 12 and
are summarized in API 653, Annex F. These requirements include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) visual examination (F.2.1.c);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) magnetic particle and/or liquid penetrant examinations (F.3.1.d);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) vacuum box testing (F.5.1.c);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) diesel oil testing (F.7.1.b).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3 Special Repair Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When deep pits in tank plates are not closely spaced or extensive and thus do not affect the strength of the tank, they
may be repaired or filled by a number of methods. Filling with air-hardening adhesive-to-steel epoxies may be suitable
if it will not be affected by the tank’s contents. Any other material of a putty-like nature that hardens upon drying can
be used for temporary repairs; such material must be able to tolerate the tank’s contents in addition to making a tight
bond with the steel plate. In all cases, the pits should be cleaned thoroughly, preferably by abrasive blasting, and then
filled as soon as possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The application of epoxies and other thermo-setting resins can provide valuable corrosion protection for storage tank
shells, bottoms, roofs, and pontoons. Combined with fiberglass cloth, they provide effective repairs for bottoms, roofs,
and pontoons, as well as other low-stress members. See API 652 for more information on lining repairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>` ,
,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leaks in roofs can be repaired by soft patches that do not involve cutting, welding, riveting, or bolting of the steel. Soft
patches can be made from a variety of materials, including rubber, neoprene, glass cloth, asphalt, and mastic or
epoxy sealing materials; the choice depends on the contents of the tank and the service conditions. The patching is
applied in much the same manner as similar patching would be applied to the roof of a building. The patches may be
applied when the tank is in service, if proper safety practices are followed. Figure 67 and Figure 68 show a patch and
a complete coating, respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 68—Mastic Roof Coating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be noted that if large areas of patching are used then consideration to personnel safety and the possibility of
fall-through becomes likely for persons working on roofs repaired in this manner. Also, be aware that should parts of
the repair materials be dropped into the tank while making these repairs, or while the tank is in service, this can lead
to hazards if these parts enter piping and pumping systems and cause blockages, seal failures and/or fires or other
process related problems. These repairs should be inspected at a frequency that is higher than conventional
permanent repairs. Soil foundations that have washed out or settled under the bottoms of atmospheric storage tanks
can be repaired by pumping sand, drilling mud, clay, lean concrete or similar material under the tank. Material can be
pumped through holes cut in the tank bottom. In some cases, it may also be necessary to raise the tank with jacks, as
shown in Figure 69. It should be noted that while these repairs are possible, they may cause problems in some cases
because of localized pressure from the pumping or grouting process, resulting in yielding and bending of bottom
plates in an uneven, local mode. The experience of the contractor performing the work may be a significant
variable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A complete record file should consist of at least three types of records: a) design and construction records, b) repair/
alteration records, and c) inspection records. Refer to API 653 for a description of these types of records. Records
should be maintained throughout the service life of each tank and should be updated to include new information
pertinent to the mechanical integrity of the tank. Inspection reports should also document:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Selected Non-destructive Examination (NDE) Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 Ultrasonic Thickness (UT) Measurement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic testing may be used in conducting inspections. In the context of tank inspection, it is typically used for
thickness determination. It should be noted that UT is not required since any method that establishes corrosion rates
may be used. When UT is applied and the corrosion rate is not known, then the maximum interval between
inspections is specified in API 653, Section 6. Other methods that may be used for determination of corrosion rates
include similar service, corrosion coupons, use of more conservative corrosion rates by substituting bottom corrosion
rates for shell corrosion rates, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recommended that the ultrasonic instrument have an “A Scan” display with a digital readout. UT measurement
should be performed using a transducer with characteristics appropriate for the particular test to be performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dual-element transducers are frequently selected, and they are available with many different operating ranges. Dual-
element transducers may have the ability to measure thin sections from 0.050 in. to 1.000 in. (1.3 mm to 25 mm). The
limitations of transducers that should be recognized are that their range is finite and that the transducer frequency
must be high enough to measure thin sections accurately. Holes in the material or sections of less than 0.050 in. (1.27
mm) will provide either no reading or a false reading when measured with too low a frequency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Further, if the material being tested is coated, procedures must be employed to account for the coating thickness. The
dual-element transducer will read the thickness of the coating in addition to the thickness of the base metal .  The effect
of the coating on the overall thickness measurement will depend on the difference in the velocity of ultrasonic wave
propagation between the base metal and the coating material. This difference may be significant in some cases. For
example, epoxy coatings have a wave velocity approximately half that of the steel, therefore the ultrasonic tool will
measure 0.015 in. [15 mils] of epoxy coating as 030 in. [30 mils]) of steel. Selection of a single-crystal transducer
operating in the so-called echo-to-echo mode can prevent this coating thickness error. However, the single-crystal
transducer has poor resolution for small diameter deep pits. Many echo-to-echo measurement devices now generally
available eliminate the need to compensate for the coating thickness during measurement. Once properly calibrated,
the multi-echo technique produces direct readings through coatings up to approximately 0.080 in. to 0.100 in. (80 mils
to 100 mils) thick without loss of accuracy. The echo-to-echo mode is sometimes difficult to use for measuring the
thickness when the backside is heavily corroded because the loss in signal caused by the corrosion may prevent
resolution of the second back wall echo. Currently, some UT transducers and gauges for thickness measurement
offer the ability to measure coating thickness and remaining wall thickness simultaneously. UT thickness
measurements on tank bottoms, shells, and roofs should carefully distinguish between thickness loss and mid-wall
laminations. Standard thickness transducers when used with UT flaw detectors and or thickness gages can be used
to view the “A Scan” which can be effective for this purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2 Ultrasonic Corrosion Mapping<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many automated ultrasonic corrosion mapping units that enable areas to be scanned with high-resolution
repeatability are available. Typical automated UT equipment as shown in Figure A.1 is used for this purpose.
Selection of the correct transducer size and frequency is critical to test resolution. The American Society of
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) recommends 10% minimum overlap for readings based on the transducer diameter.
Large diameter transducers will not find small diameter deep corrosion pits. Some scanning techniques can illustrate
very thin sections or holes as dropout regions in the data plot. Phased Array Ultrasonics is now used for thickness
mapping and provides ultra high data point density which helps in detection, characterization and discrimination of
mid-wall anomalies from loss of wall thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Angle Beam Ultrasonic (Shear and High Angle L Wave) inspection can be used to assist in the discrimination
between laminations and inclusions in material. Automated angle beam ultrasonic testing is especially effective for
this purpose. The most general application of angle beam transducers is to detect defects in butt-welded joints,
usually in lieu of radiography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4 Floor Scanning Inspection of Tank Bottoms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank bottom scanning has become a commonly used technique to effectively evaluate a large portion of the tank
bottom for both top or product side corrosion, and bottom or soil side corrosion. Typically, a floor scan can cover a
majority of the tank bottom, excluding areas adjacent to welds and other obstructions. While this varies, typically 80%
of the floor can be successfully inspected, which can be increased using complimentary techniques. Since the
inception of magnetic flux leakage (MFL) scanners, the ability to scan a large portion of tank bottoms has been
available. This is a major improvement in inspection capability for tank bottoms because of the random nature of tank
bottom under-side corrosion. Additionally, a number of other inspection technologies have become available such as,
low-frequency eddy current, remote field eddy current, and partial saturation low-frequency eddy current technology.
See Figure A.2 for an example of a bottom scan unit. The user should make sure that the scanner is calibrated
properly and has a validation and/or calibration test plate, which will ensure that the test area is inspected uniformly
over the width of the scanning head. A primary advantage of these tools is the ability to detect product-side pitting,
soil-side corrosion, and holes in the tank bottom in an efficient and economical manner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be noted that simply scanning over the area does not ensure detection of all metal loss as all systems have
detection thresholds. The owner should determine what the minimum detection threshold is a factor this into the
overall assessment. Furthermore, of the systems require some additional inspection to quantify detected flaws.
Typically, an ultrasonic examination method is used for such prove-up work. Section 8.4.4 provides additional details.
Figure A.3 shows a typical UT bottom scrub area scan to establish the extent of soil-side corrosion. There can be
considerable variability on the quality of these inspections. Industry experience shows they can be highly effective
when operators with the proper training and experience use machines with suitable detection capabilities. Most
scanners and procedures require operators to optimize sensor and magnet standoff from the bottom. Moreover, they
must determine the suitable sensitivity settings. Experience shows that these sensitivity settings should be optimized
on the specific tank under examination for the anticipated corrosion morphology. Follow-up ultrasonic examinations
are critical for an effective electromagnetic bottom scan inspection. Performance demonstration testing of the
operators can increase the probability of detecting and accurately sizing corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5 Robotic Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tools for internal tank inspection used while the tank is in service have been developed. These robotic crawler
devices are designed for total immersion in liquids and have been successful in providing ultrasonic thickness
information on tank bottoms in clear finished product storage such as gasoline, naphtha, jet fuel, No. 4 and No. 6 fuel
oils, condensate, and some crude oil. This equipment needs to be used under carefully controlled circumstances and
within API safety guidelines for work on tanks in service. See Figure A.4 for an example of a robotic inspection tool.
The technology has been utilized in a wide variety of products including, but not limited to, crude, diesel, jet, gasoline,
lube oil, benzene, hexane, boiler feedwater, and chemicals. Of course, the owner/user needs to conduct a review of
safe operating procedures prior to performing robotic inspection. The robotic inspection process can acquire a large
density of measurements over an analyzed area, which can total hundreds of thousands of ultrasonic thickness
measurements. This enables an evaluation using statistical methods to extrapolate the thinnest remaining metal of
the entire bottom. Some robotic equipment can also perform adequate inspection on other portions of the tank and
accessories (bottom settlement, a visual inspection of the vapor space, and a visual inspection of the tank bottom).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Corrosion Rates for Tank Bottoms<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Factor
Range
Comment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Product Side<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydrocarbon stocks typically result in corrosion rates of 1 mil
to 3 mils (0.025 mm to 0.076 mm) per year for finished fuels.
Aviation gas may be 2 to 3 times this amount. Crude oils have
variable rates of corrosion. It is important to apply similar
service to similar stocks, preferably the same stock, unless it
can be demonstrated that the extrapolation of corrosion rate
from one stock to another is warranted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stock
Can range from nil to very high rates;
corrosion can be in form of pitting or general
thinning or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temperature
Stock temperatures can be divided into two
cases: (1) ambient or tanks and (2) heated or
refrigerated tanks. Most petroleum tanks are
ambient temperature. For heated tanks, most
are below 500 ºF (260 ºC). Asphalt tanks are
typically the highest temperatures and are
typically at about 500 ºF (260 ºC).
Refrigerated tanks vary from ambient down
to cryogenic temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temperature is a critical factor when using similar service
because reaction rates typically double for every 18 ºF (10 ºC)
increase in temperature. This increase due to higher
temperature also applies to corrosion rates. For ambient
tanks, note that tank location will impact ambient storage
temperature to a degree.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water bottoms
Some tanks have no water bottoms (e.g.
asphalt tanks or lube oil tanks); other tanks
have very aggressive water bottoms such as
crude oil tanks; finished fuel oil tanks may
have water bottoms but the corrosion rates
can be variable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, petroleum tanks do not have water bottoms. For
tanks with water bottoms, internal tank bottom corrosion rates
may be primarily controlled by the chemical composition of the
water bottoms and basic factors such as pH. Application of
similar service for tanks with water bottoms should be based
on product produced by the same or a similar manufacturing
plant or process if the water chemistry of the water bottoms is
not known.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bottom design
The design of the tank bottom will impact the
ability to remove all water bottoms or other
phases and debris that can rest on the
bottom and accelerate corrosion. Bottoms
range from flat, to cone up, cone down, or
single slope. The slope itself can vary. The
use of a foundation and ringwall will impact
the long-term ability of the tank bottom to
retain the design drainage patterns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be realized that even if water is removed regularly
and the tank is designed for water removal, depending on the
quality of the tank bottom and the design, some water cannot
be removed. In this case, the tank essentially carries a water
bottom and the use of similar service should assume that
there is a water bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal lining
Ranges from unlined to fully lined. Linings
range from a thin-film to a reinforced thick-
film. The general classifications of linings are
thin-film, thick-film and reinforced thick-film.
The selection for the lining system is
dependent upon the product being stored,
temperature of operation and the condition of
the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Linings are used to prevent corrosion from occurring and are
applied to the areas of a tank that are susceptible to corrosion.
The areas of the tank that are commonly lined are: the tank
bottom and 2 ft to 3 ft (61 cm to 91 cm) up the shell; the roof
and down the shell to the liquid level; and local bands of the
shell at the liquid vapor interface. In addition, some tanks are
fully lined to prevent corrosion and to improve product quality<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Effective linings can reduce product side corrosion. Factors
that increase the life of a properly selected lining system are
outlined in API 652. If factors (e.g. material selection, surface
preparation, application among others) are not properly
performed they can reduce the effectiveness of the lining and
projected life of the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Corrosion Rates for Tank Bottoms (Continued)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Factor
Range
Comment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Use of similar service involves consideration of the life of the
CP system as well as its effectiveness and whether the tank
is, or is not coated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cathodic
protection (CP)
Typically only applied to crude oil tanks. For
crude tanks, ranges from no CP to CP
applied to the bottom. Coating efficiency is a
factor that addresses how much of the
coating is actually effective. CP applied
internally (sacrificial) to uncoated tanks is
possible, but limited to small tanks and short
design life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Soil Side<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Foundation
material
Concrete ringwall, concrete slab, engineered
fill, native soil.
Concrete is alkaline and tends to reduce corrosion rates as
compared to typical soil. Since soil and fill corrosion rates are
site specific, similar service should be limited to experience
with the same site or sites with higher corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Release
prevention
barrier (RPB)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Double bottoms, plastic liner under tanks,
lined secondary containment.
Tanks with double bottoms have the new bottom elevated at
least 4 in. (10 cm) above the old bottom and therefore
standing water corrosion is reduced. Tanks that have RPBs or
liners installed under and around the tank bottoms are more
likely to trap water and thus increase corrosion. Similar
service must consider the impact of standing water and
drainage that results from use of RPBs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Drainage
Poor, stagnant to well drained.
Drainage is impacted by foundation design, native soil, RPBs,
and by original design for drainage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Isolation from
old bottom
Isolated not-isolated. Isolation means
electrical insulation of the old bottom to the
new bottom by use of a non-conductive
membrane. Since new steel is anodic (more
corrosive) than old steel, many improperly
installed double bottoms are subject to a
corrosion life for the new bottom which is
shorter than that of the original old bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar service must be based on knowledge of whether the
tank being compared has a double bottom which is isolated or
not.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cathodic
protection (CP)
CP systems for tank bottoms can be galvanic
or impressed current. Impressed current
systems have an indefinite life, but must be
maintained. Galvanic or sacrificial systems
do not need to be maintained, but have a
finite life. Either type of system can be
improperly or ineffectually installed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Use of similar service should only be applied to cathodic
protection systems of the same kind (i.e. galvanic, impressed
current). Additional considerations apply primarily to
verification that the CP system is effective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Qualification of Tank Bottom Examination Procedures and Personnel<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.1.1  This Annex provides guidance for qualifying both tank bottom examination procedures and individuals that
perform tank bottom UT prove-up examinations. Owner-operators may elect to either apply this Annex as written or
modify it to meet their own applications and needs. Tank bottom examinations are an important factor in providing the
owner-operator increased assurance of tank integrity. As a result, it is important that qualified examination procedures
and personnel are used in these examinations. Specific agreements and requirements for qualification of tank bottom
examination procedures and tank bottom examiners should be established between the owner-operator and the
Authorized Inspection Agency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.1.2  There have been many NDE tools developed for inspecting tank bottoms. Most of these tools are complex
and require the operator to have a high level of knowledge and skill. The effectiveness of these examinations may
vary greatly depending on the equipment used, the examination procedure, and the skill of the examiner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Often the owner-operator will not have the ability to easily determine if the tank bottom examination has been effective
in assessing the actual condition of the tank bottom. The requirements in this Annex will provide the owner-operator
additional assurance that the tank bottom examination will find significant metal loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.3 Tank Bottom Examination Procedures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.3.1  Each Authorized Inspection Agency performing tank bottom examinations is responsible to have and use
Tank Bottom Examination Procedure(s) (TBP). These procedures provide direction for examiners performing tank
bottom examinations. A procedure also allows the owner-operator or Authorized Inspector to verify whether the
examiners are correctly performing the examinations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.3.2  The Authorized Inspection Agency that performs the tank bottom examinations should develop the Tank
Bottom Examination Procedures (TBP).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.3.3  Each TBP should address essential and non-essential variables. Section C.5.4 provides guidance for
determining appropriate TBP essential and non-essential variables. Each procedure should specify limits on
appropriate variables, e.g. plate thickness range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.4 Tank Bottom Examiners<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.4.1  Examiners need only to be qualified for the work they do in the field. For example, scanning operators who
only use the bottom scanning equipment and do not prove-up the flaw with a follow-up method need only to be
qualified for the scanning operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.4.2  The purpose of qualifying the tank bottom examiner is to determine that the examiner is capable of
satisfactorily using a qualified procedure to determine the condition of the tank bottom.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.4.3  Each Authorized Inspection Agency is responsible to train, test and qualify the scanning operators and
examiners they employ using follow-up techniques. Qualifications gained through one Authorized Inspection Agency
are not necessarily valid for any other Authorized Inspection Agency (see C.4.4 and C.4.9.f).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.4.4  The Authorized Inspection Agency is responsible to train each scanning operator they employ. Each scanning
operator should receive a minimum of 40 hours of training. This training should include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instruction on the NDE principles/methods used by the bottom scanner, limitations and application of the specific
scanning equipment and procedure, scanning equipment calibration and operation, key scanning equipment
operating variables, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hands-on operation of the bottom scanner under the direct supervision of a qualified scanning examiner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When hiring experienced examiners, The Authorized Inspection Agency should verify and document previous
examiner training and provide any necessary additional training experienced examiners should be provided training
regarding specific procedural requirements and test equipment to be utilized by the new employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.4.5  The Authorized Inspection Agency is responsible to test each scanning operator by written examination. The
test questions should be appropriate for the scanning method to be used. The test should include a minimum of 40
questions. The Authorized Inspection Agency should establish the passing score for the written examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.4.6  The Authorized Inspection Agency is responsible to qualify all examiners they employ. All examiners
(scanning operators and examiners performing prove-up on the indications) should be qualified by performing an
examination on test plates as specified in C.5. Only third-party companies, having no conflict of interest in tank bottom
examination applications, or owner-operator companies may facilitate qualification tests. The examiner should be
considered qualified if the acceptance criteria specified in C.5.3 has been met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examiners performing prove-up of indications using Ultrasonic Testing methods should be qualified in accordance
with API 650 and supplemental requirements given in this Annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.4.7  During the qualification test, a Tank Bottom Examiner Qualification record (TBEQ) must be completed for
each examiner. The TBEQ is a record of the variables used during the qualification test. On the TBEQ, the qualifying
company must record:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the essential variables from the qualification test;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the qualification test results;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) number of hours the individual has been trained;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) test score from the written training examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The TBEQ should be certified (signed) as accurate by a representative of the Authorized Inspection Agency and a
representative of the company facilitating the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.4.9  The bottom-scanning examiners (operators and/or UT examiners) should be requalified when any of the
following apply:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When the examiner is not qualified to the TBP that is to be used at the owner-operator facility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) When the Authorized Inspection Agency changes the TBP and that change requires the procedure to be
requalified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) When the operator has not performed a tank bottom scan in 6 months.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) When the operator has not used the specific procedure (TBP) for 12 months.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) When the Authorized Inspection Agency has reason to question the ability of the examiner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

When an examiner changes to a new employing Authorized Inspection Agency that utilizes procedures with
essential variables that are different from the previous employer’s procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.5 Qualification Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.5.1 Qualification Test Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.5.1.1  The qualification test will be performed on a test tank bottom with designed flaws. The test tank bottom
should be of sufficient size to provide space for the designed flaws (a minimum of 70 ft 2  (6.51 m 2 )). The plate material
used to fabricate test plates may be either new steel or used steel. It should be noted that the results obtained during
qualification tests might not be indicative of the results of examinations performed on other plates of differing quality or
permeability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When used steel is utilized for qualification purposes, the qualification test acceptance standards recommended in
C.5.2 may not be appropriate. The owner-operator should establish its own acceptance standards in such cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.5.1.2  The  minimum  number and types of underside test pits located on the test plates are described below:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Remaining Bottom Thickness ( t )

5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1 / 2   T  <  t  <  2 / 3   T
4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Key:  T  = nominal bottom thickness;  t  = remaining bottom thickness at test plate flaws.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Test pits should generally be hemispherical having a depth-to-diameter ratio of from 20 % to 50 %. Test pits should not
be flat bottom holes since examiners may interpret these as a lamination. Also machined conical holes should not be used since
they are difficult to size with UT methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner-operator may consider placing additional flaws near the plate edge, i.e., less than 6 in. (0.15 m) from the
edge, to determine if such flaws can be detected by Authorized Inspection Agency procedures. Any flaws placed
closer than 6 in. (0.15 m) to the plate edge should be in addition to those shown above and should not be included in
determining qualification unless specifically required by an owner-operator and such defects are stated as being
detectable in Authorized Inspection Agency procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.5.3 Qualification Test Variables<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.5.3.1  Essential Variables are those items that may have a significant effect on the quality of the examination if
they are changed from those used during the qualification test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C.5.3.2  Table C.1 lists suggested items that may be considered as essential variables for the qualification test when
qualifying either a tank bottom examination procedure or a tank bottom examiner. Essential variables may be different
for different types of tank bottom scanners. Authorized Inspection Agencies are responsible to determine what
additional variables should be considered essential variables for each tank bottom scanner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
