<<HEADING level=3>>Important Information Concerning Use of Asbestos or Alternative Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Asbestos is specified or referenced for certain components of the equipment described in some API standards. It has
been of extreme usefulness in minimizing fire hazards associated with petroleum processing. It has also been a
universal sealing material, compatible with most refining fluid services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain serious adverse health effects are associated with asbestos, among them the serious and often fatal diseases
of lung cancer, asbestosis, and mesothelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings). The degree of exposure
to asbestos varies with the product and the work practices involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consult the most recent edition of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), U.S. Department of
Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Standard for Asbestos, Tremolite, Anthophyllite, and Actinolite, 29  Code of
Federal Regulations  Section 1910.1001; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Emission Standard for
Asbestos, 40  Code of Federal Regulations  Sections 61.140 through 61.156; and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) rule on labeling requirements and phased banning of asbestos products (Sections 763.160-179).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are currently in use and under development a number of substitute materials to replace asbestos in certain
applications. Manufacturers and users are encouraged to develop and use effective substitute materials that can
meet the specifications for, and operating requirements of, the equipment to which they would apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

refractory), in accordance with 8.1 and 8.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1.2  Subject to owner’s approval, the contractor shall arrange for testing at either an independent laboratory or
the manufacturer’s plant and direct the work to assure that mixing techniques, water quality and content, ambient
temperatures, mix temperatures, etc., represent those needed for production installation. The testing party is
responsible for conducting sampling, specimen preparation, testing, and documentation of results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1.3  For plastic refractories, the manufacturer shall provide the actual workability index determined seven days
after manufacture in accordance with 8.1.6 and the minimum acceptable workability index for suitable installation of

<<PARAGRAPH>>In the event a sample fails to meet specified requirements, it may be retested once. The retest shall be conducted
using a new sample representing the same pallet(s) of the same batch of refractory as the failed sample. Use the
same testing facility, testing procedure, inspector, and inspection methods. A different facility may be used, subject to

stripping of the forms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.2  Refractory shall be mixed using the procedures, equipment, and water levels demonstrated in the material
and applicator qualification tests. For casting and vibration casting, the mixer capacity shall be sufficient to facilitate
placement with no more than 10 minutes delay between successive mix batches. For pump casting, mixer capacity
shall be sufficient to allow for continuous pump operation without stops and starts to wait for material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.3  For vibration casting, two or more vibrators shall be mounted externally on the equipment or component to be
lined. Vibrators shall be attached by strapping or a similar method; do not attach vibrators to nozzles, welded lugs, or
other components. Vibrators shall have adequate force to move and consolidate the material being vibrated. Each
vibrator shall be independently controlled to focus the vibration and prevent segregation due to over vibration.
Vibrator selection, number, placement, and method of attachment shall be included in the installation procedure and
approved by the owner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.2.3  Refractory products with dryout requirements differing from those defined by Table 5 shall be rated by the
Dryout Index. To provide a comparative basis, the Dryout Index shall be defined as the duration time in hours that is
required for initial heating from 50 °F to 1300 °F (10 °C to 705 °C), including recommended heating rates and holding
times. The Index shall be based on single-layer linings 5 in. (127 mm) thick, applied and dried out in accordance with
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.2.2.4  Details of actual heating rates and holding times within the overall duration defined by the Dryout Index
shall be determined prior to installation work in accordance with 10.1.1. Modifications to account for greater thickness
and/or dual-layer designs shall be resolved at that time. When drying out a unit or vessel that has multiple
refractories, schedules shall to be based on the refractory or lining system that has the longest duration requirement
for the maximum thickness at each stage of the dryout.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
