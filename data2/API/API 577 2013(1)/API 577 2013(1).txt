<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This recommended practice (RP) provides guidance to the API authorized inspector on welding inspection as
encountered with fabrication and repair of refinery and chemical plant equipment and piping. This RP includes
descriptions of common welding processes, welding procedures, welder qualifications, metallurgical effects from
welding, and inspection techniques to aid the inspector in fulfilling their role implementing API 510, API 570, API 653
and API 582. The level of learning and training obtained from this document is not a replacement for the training and
experience required to be a certified welding inspector under one of the established welding certification programs
such as the American Welding Society (AWS) Certified Welding Inspector (CWI), or   Canadian and European
equivalent schemes such as CWB, CSWIP, PCN, or EFW.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This RP does not require all welds to be inspected; nor does it require welds to be inspected to specific techniques
and extent. Welds selected for inspection, and the appropriate inspection techniques, should be determined by the
welding inspectors, engineers, or other responsible personnel using the applicable code or standard. The importance,
difficulty, and problems that could be encountered during welding should be considered by all involved. A welding
engineer should be consulted on any critical, specialized or complex welding issues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4 Welding Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding inspection is a critical part of an overall weld quality assurance program. Welding inspection includes much
more than just the non-destructive examination of the completed weld. Many other issues are important, such as
review of specifications, joint design, cleaning procedures, and welding procedures. Welder qualifications should be
performed to better assure the weldment performs properly in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding inspection activities can be separated into three stages corresponding to the welding work process.
Inspectors should perform specific tasks prior to welding, during welding and upon completion of welding, although it
is usually not necessary to inspect every weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Tasks Prior to Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The importance of tasks in the planning and weld preparation stage should not be understated. Many welding
problems can be avoided during this stage when it is easier to make changes and corrections, rather than after the
welding is in progress or completed. Such tasks may include.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Non-Conformances and Defects<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At any time during the welding inspection, if defects or non-conformances to the specification are identified, they
should be brought to the attention of those responsible for the work or corrected before welding proceeds further.
Defects should be completely removed and re-inspected following the same tasks outlined in this section until the
weld is found to be acceptable. Corrective action for a non-conformance depends upon the nature of the non-
conformance and its impact on the properties of the weldment. Corrective action may include reworking the weld. See
9.1 for common types of discontinuities or flaws that can lead to defects or non-conformances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.2 Repair Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When inspection identifies a   rejectable defect, the inspector should   mark the area for repair, the defect removed, and
any necessary repair welding performed. Any repair welding should be performed according to a procedure accepted
by the inspector or engineer. After the repair, the weld should be reinspected. If the inspection indicates that the repair
is acceptable, no further action is taken, and the equipment/piping is placed into service. If the inspection indicates
that the defect was not removed or that a new defect is present, the repair weld is rejected and a second repair is
undertaken. After the second unsuccessful attempt at weld repair, the inspector and/or welding engineer should
evaluate the reason for the inadequacy of the weld repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are many factors that come into play when trying to determine the number of times a welded joint can
continuously be repaired before a complete cut-out of the weld is required such as: base metal material, complexity of
the weld configuration/position (e.g. furnace tubes or boiler tubes), or size of the weld. The welding engineer or
inspector should be notified when a weld has failed a weld quality test more than three times to help determine the
cause(s) of the defect(s) and the appropriate path forward.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6 NDE Examiner Certification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1  The referencing codes or standards may require the examiner be qualified in accordance with a specific code
and certified as meeting the requirements. Typically weld construction standards such as ASME for pressure vessels
or piping, and API 510 for in-service pressure vessel examination reference ASME Section V, Article 1, which when
specified by the referencing code, requires NDE personnel be qualified with one of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) ASNT SNT-TC-1A,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) ANSI/ASNT CP-189.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These references give the employer guidelines (SNT-TC-1A) or standards (CP-189) for the certification of NDE
inspection personnel. They also require the employer to develop and establish a written practice or procedure that
details the employerâs requirements for certification of inspection personnel. It typically includes the training, and
experience prerequisites prior to certification, and recertification requirements. A certification scheme in accordance
with ISO 9712 may be specified for international work. ISO 9712 outlines certification quidelines generally organized
under a national scheme and vested in the individual. In the USA the scheme is managed by ASNT as the ACCP<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_30>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>22
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(ASNT Central Certification Program). Although an Inspection companyâs Written Practice may allow the employer to
appoint a Level III, the owner user may prefer that, at least for initial certification, a Level III Examiner be certified by
examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.2  If the referencing code does not list a specific standard to be qualified against, qualification may involve
demonstration of competency by the personnel performing the examination or other requirements specified by the
owner-user. The API in-service inspection documents go further than this and for a number of specific circumstances
such as fitness-for-service (FFS) and welds not subject to hydrotest may require the use of personnel who have
passed a performance test such as the API QUTE (Qualification of Ultrasonic Examiners) or owner-user accepted
equivalent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6.3  Equivalency is determined by the relevant API committee and is posted on the API website. In general it is
defined as:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic shear wave operators should be subject to a performance demonstration test that should meet or exceed
as a minimum the test protocols, criteria and passing scores described as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The test should be administered either by the owner-user or an independent third party as designated by the
owner-user. All testing protocols including design, manufacture, and verification of test samples should be
documented and retained under close limited supervision to ensure the test protocols remain confidential.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Candidates prior to performance testing should demonstrate training and certification to a national or international
certification scheme acceptable to the owner-user (see SNT-TC-1A, CP-189, EN473, or ISO 9712 for guidance).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Candidates should be provided with a written outline protocol which they should read and acknowledge prior to
commencement of the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) As a minimum the test should   comprise:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Carbon steel (P1) plates  1 / 2  in. (12 mm) and 1 in. (25 mm) thick with a weld with a single or doubleâVâ weld prep.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Two carbon steel (P1) pipes 12 in. (300 mm) and 8 in. (200 mm) NPS, in the wall thickness range  1 / 2  in. to  3 / 4  in.
(12 mm to 17 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) The samples should provide a weld length such that the total weld length examined by the candidate   should not
be less than 77 in. (1956 mm) in total.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) The total weld length should   include a number of individual flaws simulating the following typical weld
imperfections:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
lack of side wall fusion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ii)
lack of root fusion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iii) linear inclusions (slag);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>iv) cracks;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>v) porosity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Flaws   should be designed and placed so as to determine the candidateâs ability to detect and characterize a flaw,
and to accurately locate the flaw in relationship to the weld. Also, the individual should demonstrate the ability to
discern geometric indications like mismatch and weld root from actual flaws.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_31>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING  P ROCESSES , I NSPECTION ,  AND  M ETALLURGY
23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.4  In order to be successful in the test, candidates should detect, characterize and locate 80 % of the known
flaws in the weld sections they have been requested to examine. Candidates who make more than 20 % overcalls i.e.
misinterpreting a geometric reflector as a flaw should   not be deemed to have passed the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.5  Candidates   should be advised if they have passed or failed the test. No other data should be made available
in order to ensure the confidentiality of data relating to flaw, numbers, locations, types, and sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.6  The approval test should typically be valid for a period of three years after which the candidate should be
retested. If at any time the performance of an operator is called into question, the operator may be re-tested at the
owner-users discretion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.7  Approval of any candidate under this protocol is restricted to the specific owner-user administering the test
and it should be utilized for compliance with the referenced paragraphs in API 510 and API 570 and should not be
deemed as an API certification or endorsement in any form.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7 Safety Precautions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should be aware of the hazards associated with welding and take appropriate steps to prevent injury while
performing inspection tasks. As a minimum, the siteâs safety rules and regulations should be reviewed as applicable
to welding operations. Hazards that the inspector would more commonly encounter in the presence of welding
include arc radiation, air contamination, airborne debris, tripping hazards (cables), and heat. The arc is a source of
visible, ultraviolet and infrared light. As such, eye protection using proper filters and proper clothing to cover the skin
should be used. Proper ventilation is necessary to remove air-borne particulates, which include vaporized metals. In
areas of inadequate ventilation, filtered breathing protection may be required. The use of gas-shielded processes in
confined spaces can create an oxygen deficient environment. Ventilation practice in these instances should be
carefully reviewed. Welding can produce sparks and other air-borne debris that can burn the eyes. Appropriate
precautions are necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 Welding Processes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector should understand the basic arc welding processes most frequently used in the fabrication and repair of
refinery and chemical process equipment. These processes include shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), gas
tungsten arc welding (GTAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), flux cored arc welding (FCAW), submerged arc
welding (SAW), stud welding (SW), plasma arc welding (PAW), and electrogas welding (EGW). Descriptions of less
frequently used welding process are available in the referenced material. Each process has advantages and
limitations depending upon the application and can be more or less prone to particular types of discontinuities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SMAW is the most widely used of the various arc welding processes. SMAW uses an arc between a covered
electrode and the weld pool. It employs the heat of the arc, coming from the tip of a consumable covered electrode, to
melt the base metal. Shielding is provided from the decomposition of the electrode covering, without the application of
pressure and with filler metal from the electrode. Either alternating current (ac) or direct current (dc) may be
employed, depending on the welding power supply and the electrode selected. A constant-current (CC) power supply
is preferred. SMAW is a manual welding process. See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for schematics of the SMAW circuit and
welding process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Depending on the type of electrode being used, the covering performs one or more of the following functions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Provides a gas to shield the arc and prevent excessive atmospheric contamination of the molten filler metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Provides scavengers, deoxidizers, and fluxing agents to cleanse the weld and prevent excessive grain growth in
the weld metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Establishes the electrical characteristics of the electrode, stabilizes the welding arc and influences operability in
various welding positions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Provides a slag blanket to protect the hot weld metal from the air and enhances the mechanical properties, bead
shape, and surface cleanliness of the weld metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Provides a means of adding alloying elements to produce appropriate weld metal chemistry, mechanical
properties and increase deposition efficiency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Equipment is relatively simple, inexpensive, and portable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Process can be used in areas of limited access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Process is less sensitive to wind and draft than other welding processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Limitations associated with SMAW are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Deposition rates are lower than for other processes such as GMAW.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Slag usually must be removed from every deposited weld pass,   at stops and starts, and before depositing a weld
bead adjacent to or onto a previously deposited weld bead.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>GTAW is an arc welding process that uses an arc between a non-consumable tungsten electrode and the weld pool.
The process is commonly referred to as TIG (tungsten inert gas) or heliarc welding, and is used with a shielding gas
and without the application of pressure. GTAW can be used with or without the addition of filler metal. The constant
current (CC) type power supply can be either dc or ac, and depends largely on the metal to be welded. Direct current
welding is typically performed with the electrode negative (DCEN) polarity. DCEN welding offers the advantages of
deeper penetration and faster welding speeds. Alternating current provides a cathodic cleaning (sputtering) that
removes refractory oxides from the surfaces of the weld joint, which is necessary for welding aluminum and
magnesium. The cleaning action occurs during the portion of the ac wave, when the electrode is positive with respect
to the work piece. See Figure 3 and Figure 4 for schematics of the GTAW equipment and welding process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>GMAW is an arc welding process that uses an arc between continuous filler metal electrode and the weld pool. The
process is used with shielding from an externally supplied gas and without the application of pressure. GMAW may be
operated in semiautomatic, machine, or automatic modes. It employs a constant voltage (CV) power supply, and uses
either the short circuiting, globular, spray, or pulsed transfer modes to transfer metal from the electrode to the work.
The type of transfer is determined by a number of factors. The most influential are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) magnitude and type of welding current;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) electrode diameter;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) electrode composition;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) electrode extension or contact tube-to-work distance (often referred to as âstick outâ);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2 Short Circuiting Transfer (GMAW-S)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>GMAW-S encompasses the lowest range of welding currents and electrode diameters associated with the GMAW
process. This process produces a fast freezing weld pool that is generally suited for joining thin sections, out-of-
position welding, or root passes. Due to the fast-freezing nature of this process, there is potential for lack of sidewall
and interpass fusion when welding thick-wall equipment or a nozzle attachment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2.2 GMAW-MSC (Modified Short Circuit)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The modified short-circuit GMAW process, designated the GMAW-MSC process, has several proprietary derivatives
of the short-circuiting transfer mode which use a modified waveform to reduce some of the problems found with short-
circuitingâmainly, spatter and a turbulent weld pool. Typically these systems sense the progression of the short
circuit as it happens and modulates the current to limit the amount of force behind spatter and turbulence-producing
events. GMAW-MSC power sources are software-driven to maintain optimum arc characteristics by closely
monitoring and controlling the electrode current during all phases of the short-circuit. There are a limited number of
companies that manufacture welding power supplies which employ this technology.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The GMAW-MSC process minimizes the disadvantages of GMAW-S while maintaining comparable weld metal
deposition rates and achieving X-ray quality welds. The welding process has the capability to complete open root
welds more rapidly than GTAW, with low heat input and no lack of fusion. The lower heat input results in smaller heat
affected zones (HAZ) as well as reduced distortion and chance of burn-through. The process appears to be more
tolerant of less experienced welders since GMAW-MSC is tolerant of gaps and capable of automatically maintaining
the optimum wire feed speed and contact tip-to-work distance, and allows the use of larger diameter GMAW wires.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.3 Globular Transfer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The advantages of this transfer method are its low cost when carbon dioxide is used as a shielding gas, and a high
deposition rate. The maximum deposition rate for the globular arc transfer mode is about 250 in./min (110 mm/sec).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The globular arc transfer mode is often considered the least desirable of the GMAW variations due to the tendency to
produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and weld spatter or a cold lap. This process uses relatively low current (below
250 A). During welding, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up on the end of the electrode, often in
irregular shapes, with a diameter up to twice that of the electrode. When the droplet finally detaches (i.e. by gravity or
short circuiting) and falls to the work piece, it produces an uneven surface and weld spatter. The welding process
produces a high amount of heat and forces the welder to use a larger electrode wire. This increases the size of the
weld pool, and causes greater residual stresses and distortion in the weld area. The welding process uses carbon
dioxide as the shielding gas, and is limited to the flat and horizontal position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.4 Spray Transfer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The spray arc transfer mode results in a highly directed stream of discrete drops that are accelerated by arc forces.
Since these drops are smaller than the arc length, short circuits do not occur and the amount of spatter generated is
negligible. The inert gas shield allows the spray arc transfer mode to weld most metals. However, using this process
on materials thinner than about 0.250 in. (6.4 mm) may be difficult because of the high currents needed to produce
the spray arc. The spray arc transfer mode produces high weld metal deposition rates. At high deposition rates, the
welding process may produce a weld metal pool that is too large to be supported by surface tension depending on the
electrode diameter, limiting the use of the welding process in the vertical or overhead position. Specially designed
power supplies have been developed to address the work thickness and welding position limitations. The maximum
deposition rate for spray arc transfer mode is about 150 in./min (60 mm/sec).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.5 Pulsed Transfer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pulsed arc GMAW method was developed to overcome the thickness and welding position limitations. Pulsed
GMAW welding is a variation of the GMAW process. The welding process uses:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) a low background/constant current to sustain the arc without providing enough energy to produce drops at the
tip of the wire; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) a superimposed/pulsing current with an amplitude greater than the transition current necessary for spray
transfer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the pulsing portion of the current cycle, one or more drops are formed and transferred. The frequency and
amplitude of the pulses control the rate at which the wire melts. Pulsing makes the desirable features of spray arc
transfer available for joining sheet metals and welding in all positions. The maximum deposition rate for pulsed arc
transfer mode is about 200 in./min (85 mm/sec). The pulsed arc GMAW method requires a power source capable of
providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 pulses/sec and 400 pulses/sec, and requires that the shielding
gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.6 Advantages of GMAW<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some commonly accepted advantages of the GMAW process include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the only consumable electrode process that can be used to weld most commercial metals and alloys;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) deposition rates are significantly higher than those obtained with SMAW;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) minimal postweld cleaning is required due to the absence of a slag.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.7 Limitations of GMAW<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Limitations associated with GMAW are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the welding equipment is more complex, more costly, and less portable than that for SMAW;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the welding arc should be protected from air drafts that can disperse the shielding gas;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) when using the GMAW-S process, the weld is more susceptible to lack of adequate fusion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FCAW is an arc welding process that uses an arc between a continuous tubular electrode and the weld pool. The
process is used with shielding gas evolved from a flux contained within the tubular electrode, with or without additional
shielding from an externally supplied gas, and without the application of pressure. Normally a semiautomatic process,
the use of FCAW depends on the type of electrodes available, the mechanical property requirements of the welded
joints, and the joint designs and fit-up. The recommended power source is the dc constant-voltage type, similar to
sources used for GMAW. Figure 7 shows a schematic of FCAW equipment, while Figure 8 shows the welding process
with additional gas shielding. Figure 9 shows a schematic of the self-shielded FCAW process where no additional gas
is used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 Submerged Arc Welding (SAW)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Submerged arc welding is an arc welding process that uses an arc or arcs between a flux-covered bare metal
electrode(s) and the weld pool. The arc and molten metal are shielded by a blanket of granular flux, supplied through
the welding nozzle from a hopper. The process is used without pressure and filler metal from the electrode and
sometimes from a supplemental source (welding rod, flux, or metal granules). SAW can be applied in three different
modes: semiautomatic, automatic, and machine. It can utilize either a CV or CC power supply. SAW is used
extensively in shop pressure vessel fabrication and pipe manufacturing. Figure 10 shows a schematic of the SAW
process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2 Advantages of SAW<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some commonly accepted advantages of the SAW process include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) provides very high metal deposition rates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) produces repeatable high quality welds for large weldments and repetitive short welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.3 Limitations of SAW<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Limitations associated with SAW are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) a power supply capable of providing high amperage at 100   % duty cycle is recommended;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) weld is not visible during the welding process;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) equipment required is more costly and extensive, and less portable;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.8 Plasma Arc Welding (PAW)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Plasma arc welding (PAW) is a variation of the gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process except that the tungsten
electrode is positioned within the body of the torch. There are two types of plasma arc welding, namely the transferred
arc process and non-transferred arc process. In the plasma transferred arc (PTA) process, similar to GTAW, the
workpiece is part of the electrical circuit, and the arc is struck between the tungsten electrode and the workpiece. By
constricting the arc, the plasma or ionized gas is forced through a fine-bore copper nozzle which constricts the arc,
and exits the orifice at high velocities (approaching the speed of sound). The process produces a collimated arc which
focuses the arc on a relatively small area of the workpiece with an arc temperature in excess of 20,000 Â°F
(11,093 Â°C). In the non-transferred arc process, also referred as the plasma spray (PS) process, the arc is struck
between the tungsten electrode and the constricting nozzle rather than with the work-piece. The plasma spray
process is solely used for the deposition of surface coatings. It is not used for making strength welds. A comparison of
the GTAW and PAW circuits and welding processes is shown in Figure 11.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) lower total heat input due to focused arc results in less distortion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) welds produced are narrower than GTAW due to the constricted arc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8.3 Limitations of PAW<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The limitations of plasma arc welding include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) expensive equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) larger torch than GTAW makes access more difficult in narrow weld joints;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Focused arc requires better control by the welder<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9 Electrogas Welding (EGW)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Electrogas welding (EGW) is similar to the GMAW process in that it a solid electrode can be fed into the joint.
Alternately, similar to the FCAW process in that a flux cored tubular electrode can be used. The weld is deposited in
the flat position with the molten metal continually being deposited at the bottom of the moving cavity. In electrogas
welding, fixed or moving metal (usually copper) or ceramic shoes (or dams), water cooled if needed, are set up before
starting, to bridge the gap between abutting plates and contain the molten metal until solidification is completed. The
welding process utilizes either a solid wire or flux-cored electrode. The weld area is protected from atmospheric
contamination by an externally supplied shielding gas, or by the gas produced by the disintegration of the flux-cored
electrode wire. Electrogas welding is used to make square-groove welds for butt and T-joints in the construction of
storage tanks, ship hulls and pressure vessels with plate thicknesses from  3 / 8  in. to 4 in. (10 mm to 100 mm). The
workpiece should be at least 0.4 in. (10 mm) thick, while the maximum thickness for one electrode is approximately
0.8 in. (20 mm). Additional electrodes make it possible to weld thicker workpieces. The height of the weld is limited
only by the mechanism used to lift the welding head. In general, it ranges from 4 in. (100 mm) to 50 ft (20 m).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Low and medium carbon steels, low alloy high strength steels, and some stainless steels can be welded using the
electrogas process. Quenched and tempered steels may also be welded by the process, provided that the proper
amount of heat is applied. Figure 12 shows an electrogas welding set-up using a solid electrode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.2 Advantages of EGW<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some commonly accepted advantages of the EGW process include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) welding is usually done in one pass;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) very high deposition rates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) minimum distortion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6 Welding Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Qualified welding procedures are required for welding fabrication and repair of pressure vessels, piping and tanks.
They detail the steps necessary to make a specific weld and generally consist of a written description, details of the
weld joint and welding process variables, and test data to demonstrate the procedure produces weldments that meet
design requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While various codes and standards exist for the development of welding procedures, this section reflects criteria
described in ASME Section IX. Welding procedures qualified to ASME Section IX are required by API inspection
codes for repair welding and are often required by construction codes used in fabrication of new equipment and
piping. However, construction codes and proprietary company specifications may have additional requirements or
allow specific exceptions so they should be reviewed for each weld application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding procedures required by ASME Section IX include a written welding procedure specification (WPS) and
procedure qualification record (PQR). The WPS provides direction to the welder while making production welds to
ASME code requirements. The PQR is a record of the welding data and variables used to weld a test coupon and the
test results used to qualify the welding procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important to differentiate the PQR and welder performance qualification (WPQ), detailed in Section 7. The
purpose of the PQR is to establish the properties of the weldment. The purpose of the WPQ is to establish the welder
is capable of making a quality weld using the welding procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Welding Procedure Specification (WPS)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME Section IX requires each manufacturer and contractor to develop welding procedures. Whereas this
requirement appears repetitious, qualified welding procedure specifications are an important aspect of fabrication
quality control. They help each organization recognize the significance of changes in welding variables that may be
required on the job, and the effects of the changes on weldment properties. The WPS is but one step for welding
fabrication quality assurance. ASME B31.3 allows welding procedure qualification by others, provided it is acceptable
to the inspector and meets certain conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The completed WPS for a welding process addresses all essential, nonessential, and supplementary essential
variables when impact testing is required, or when specified by the end user. Essential variables affect the
me c hanical properties of the weld. If they are changed beyond what the reference code paragraph allows for the
process, the WPS must be re-qualified. Nonessential variables do not affect the mechanical properties of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_47>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING  P ROCESSES , I NSPECTION ,  AND  M ETALLURGY
39<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>They may be changed on the WPS without re-qualifying the welding procedure. Supplementary essential variables
apply, or when specified by the end user, are treated as essential variables when they apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2 Types of Essential Variables<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The WPS should contain, as a code requirement, the following information:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) process(es);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) base metal;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) filler metal (and/or flux);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) welding current;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) welding position;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
shielding gas, if used;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) preparation of base metal;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) fit-up and alignment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
backside of joint;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)

<<PARAGRAPH>>k) preheat;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)

<<PARAGRAPH>>m) welding technique (weaving, multiple or single pass, etc.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n) cleaning method;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>o) back gouge method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3 Other Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The WPS should also reference the supporting PQR(s) used to qualify the welding procedure. In addition, the
construction code or proprietary company specifications can impose specific requirements related to service of the
equipment and piping. These can include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) toughness of base metal, weld metal, and HAZ;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) limitations of welding process;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) limitations of filler metals and fluxes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) critical joint geometries;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) limitations on preheat;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
limitations on PWHT;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>40
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) limitations on weld metal hardness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) limitations on the chemical composition of base metal and filler metal;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
base metal heat   treatment   condition limitation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
limitations on thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These requirements should be reflected in the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The format of the WPS is not fixed, provided it addresses all essential and nonessential variables (and supplementary
essential variables when necessary). An example form is available in ASME Section IX, Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The WPS   should   be available for review by the Inspector. Since it provides the limits the welder is responsible for
staying within, it should be available to the welder as well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Procedure Qualification Record (PQR)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The PQR records the essential and nonessential variables used to weld a test coupon, the coupon test results, and
the manufacturerâs certification of accuracy in the qualification of a WPS. Record of the nonessential variables used
during the welding of the test coupon is optional.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME Section IX requires that the manufacturer or contractor supervise the production of the test weldments and
certify that the PQR properly qualifies the welding procedure; however, other groups may perform sample preparation
and testing. Mechanical tests are required to qualify a welding procedure to demonstrate the properties of the
weldment. Test sample selection and testing requirements are defined in Section IX. Typically, they include tension
test to determine the ultimate strength of a groove weld, guided bend tests to determine the degree of soundness and
ductility of a groove weld, notch toughness testing when toughness requirements are imposed, and hardness
measurements when hardness restrictions are defined. If any test specimen fails, the test coupon fails and a new
coupon is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The format of the PQR is not fixed, provided it addresses all essential variables (and supplementary essential
variables when necessary). An example form is available in ASME Section IX, Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The PQR should accompany the WPS and be available for review by the Inspector upon request. It does not need to
be available to the welder. One PQR may support several WPSs. One WPS may be qualified by more than one PQR
within the limitations of the code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Reviewing a WPS and PQR<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors   should   review the WPS and PQR to verify they are acceptable for the welding to be done. While there are
many ways to review a welding procedure, the most effective one utilizes a systematic approach that assures a
complete and thorough review of the WPS and PQR to verify that all ASME Section IX and construction and repair
code requirements have been satisfied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The initial step is to verify the WPS has been properly completed and addresses the requirements of Section IX and
the construction/repair code. The second step is to verify the PQR has been properly completed and addresses all
the requirements of Section IX and the construction and repair code. The third step is to confirm the PQR essential
variable values properly support the range specified in the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For simplicity purposes, the following list is for a single weld process on the WPS when notch toughness is not a
requirement (so supplementary essential variables do not apply).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7 Welding Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding materials refers to the many materials involved in welding including the base metal, filler metal, fluxes, and
gases, if any. Each of these materials has an impact on the WPS and the weldment properties. An understanding of
the conventions used by the ASME Section IX is necessary to adequately review qualified welding procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 P-Number Assignment to Base Metals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Base metals are assigned P-numbers in ASME Section IX to reduce the number of welding procedure qualifications
required. For ferrous base metals having specified impact test requirements, group numbers within P-numbers are
assigned. These assignments are based on comparable base metal characteristics such as composition, weldability,
and mechanical properties. Table 1 lists the assignments of base metal to P-numbers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A complete listing of P-number, S-number, and group number assignments are provided in QW/QB-422 of ASME
Section IX. This list is an ascending sort based on specification numbers. Specification numbers grouped by P-
number and group number are also listed in ASME Section IX nonmandatory Annex D. Within each list of the same
P-number and group number, the specifications are listed in an ascending sort.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 F-Number Assignment to Filler Metals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Electrodes and welding rods are assigned F-numbers to reduce the number of welding procedure and performance
qualifications. The F-number groupings are based essentially on their usability characteristics, which fundamentally
determine the ability of welders to make satisfactory welds with a given process and filler metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welders who qualify with one filler metal are qualified to weld with all filler metals having the same F-number, and in
the case of carbon steel SMAW electrodes, may additionally qualify to weld with electrodes having other F-numbers.
For example, a welder who qualified with an E7018 is qualified to weld with all F-4 electrodes, plus all F-1, F-2, and F-
3 electrodes (with backing limitations). The grouping does not imply that base metals or filler metals within a group
may be indiscriminately substituted for a metal, which was used in the qualification test. Consideration should be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 AWS Classification of Filler Metals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An AWS classification number identifies electrodes and welding rods. The AWS classification numbers are specified
in ASME Section IIC under their appropriate SFA specification number. ASME Section IX Table QW-432 lists the
AWS classification numbers and SFA specification numbers included under each of the F-numbers. Note that the Xâs
in the AWS classification numbers represent numerals, i.e. the AWS classifications E6010, E7010, E8010, E9010,
and E10010 are all covered by F-number 3 (EXX10). Annex A contains additional details on the conventions used in
identification of filler metals for the welding processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 A-Number<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To minimize the number of welding procedure qualifications, steel and steel alloy filler metals are also grouped
according to their A-number. The A-number grouping in ASME Section IX, Table QW-442 is based on the chemical
composition of the deposited weld metal. This grouping does not imply that filler metals may be indiscriminately
substituted without consideration for the compatibility with the base metal and the service requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Filler Metal Selection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should verify the filler metal selection is appropriate for the base metal being welded. Some considerations
in selection include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) chemical composition of filler metal;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) tensile strength of filler metal and base metal;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex D provides a guide of common filler metals for base metals most often used in petrochemical plants. In
addition, there is a table comparing the current AWS filler metal classification to the previous ones for low-alloy steels.
AWS modified the classifications for several common low-alloy filler metals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7 Consumable Storage and Handling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding consumable storage and handled guidelines should be in accordance with the consumable manufacturerâs
instructions and guidelines and as given in the AWS A5.XX series of filler metal specifications. Covered electrodes
exposed to moisture can become unstable due to moisture pickup by the coating. Particularly susceptible to moisture
pickup are coatings on low-hydrogen electrodes and stainless steel electrodes. Moisture can be a source of
hydrogen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To reduce exposure to moisture, certain welding consumables should be stored in warm holding ovens after they
have been removed from the manufacturerâs packaging. Low-hydrogen SMAW electrodes supplied in non-
hermetically sealed containers   should   be baked according to manufacturerâs instructions prior to use.   They should be
stored separately from other types of electrodes with higher hydrogen content, as this can be another source for
hydrogen pickup. Some welding consumables that are slightly damp can be reconditioned by baking in separate
special ovens. Ovens should be heated by electrical means and have automatic heat controls and visible temperature
indications. Ovens should only be used for electrode storage as using them for food storage or cooking could cause
electrode coatings to absorb moisture. Any electrodes or fluxes that have become wet should be discarded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 Welder Qualification<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welder performance qualification is to establish the welderâs ability to deposit sound weld metal. Similar to welding
procedure qualification, this section reflects the parameters in the referencing code or typically referenced to ASME
S ec tion IX. Other codes exist which utilize other means for welder qualification. The term welder is intended to apply
to both welders and welding operators for the purpose of the following descriptions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The welder qualification is limited by the essential variables given for each process. A welder may be qualified by
radiography of a test coupon or of an initial production weld or by bend tests of a test coupon. Some end users and
codes limit or restrict the use of radiography.   The responsibility for qualifying welders is typically restricted to the
contractor or manufacturer employing the welder and cannot be delegated to another organization. However, some
codes such as B31.3 may modify this rule and generally it is permissible to subcontract test specimen preparation
and NDE.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Welder Performance Qualification (WPQ)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The WPQ addresses all essential variables listed in QW-350 of ASME Section IX. The performance qualification test
coupon is to be welded according to the qualified WPS, and the welding is supervised and controlled by the employer
of the welder. The qualification is for the welding process used, and each different welding process requires
qualification. A change in any essential variable listed for the welding process requires the welder to re-qualify for that
process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>QW-352 through QW-357 in ASME Section IX, list the essential variables and referencing code paragraphs for
different welding processes. The variable groups addressed are: joints, base metals, filler metals, positions, gas, and
electrical characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_55>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING  P ROCESSES , I NSPECTION ,  AND  M ETALLURGY
47<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The record of the WPQ test includes all the essential variables, the type of test and test results, and the ranges
qualified. The format of the WPQ is not fixed provided it addresses all the required items. An example form is
available in ASME Section IXâForm QW-484 in nonmandatory Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mechanical tests performed on welder and welding operator qualification test coupons are defined in ASME Section
IX, QW-452 for type and number required. If radiographic examination is used for welder or welding operator
qualification of coupons, the minimum length of coupon to be examined is 6 in. (152.4 mm), and includes the entire
weld circumference for pipe coupons. Coupons are required to pass visual examination and physical testing, if used.
Alternately, welders and welding operators making a groove weld using SMAW, SAW, GTAW, and GMAW (except
short-circuit mode) may be qualified using radiography of the first production weld. For welders, a minimum of 6 in.
(150 mm) length of the first production weld must be examined for performance qualification while a minimum of 3 ft
(0.91 m) length must be examined for welding operators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are rules (e.g. ASME Section IX) for the immediate retesting of welders or welding operators who fail a
qualification test and is commonly referred to as the âtwo for one ruleâ whereby the welder/operator must be tested on
twice the original extent of tests. Welders or welding operators who fail the second test typically have to be sent for
retraining but no clear guidance is provided to inspectors on what constitutes retraining.   Documented evidence of
retraining and production of acceptable practice welds should be presented to the inspector   before allowing a further
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welder performance qualification expires if the welding process is not used during a six-month period. The welderâs
qualification can be revoked if there is a reason to question their ability to make welds. A welderâs log or continuity
report can be used to verify that a welderâs qualifications are current.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Reviewing a WPQ<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.1 Review Prior to Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to any welding, inspectors should review weldersâ WPQ to verify they are qualified to perform the welding given

<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.4 Limitations for Welder Qualifications<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Limitations for welders or welding operators are discussed in ASME Section IX, Para. QW-305.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9 Non-destructive Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 Discontinuities<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Non-destructive Examination (NDE) is defined as those inspection methods, which allow materials to be examined
without changing or destroying their usefulness. NDE is an integral part of the quality assurance program. A number
of NDE methods are employed to ensure that the weld meets design specifications and does not contain defects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_57>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING  P ROCESSES , I NSPECTION ,  AND  M ETALLURGY

<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector should choose an NDE method that has the capability and adequate sensitivity to detect discontinuities
in the weld joints requiring examination for accept/reject evaluation. Table 2 and Figure 13 list the common types and
location of discontinuities and illustrate their positions within a butt weld. The most commonly used NDE methods
used during weld inspection are shown in Table 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 4 lists the various weld joint types and common NDE methods available to inspect their configuration. Table 5
further lists the detection capabilities of the most common NDE methods. Additional methods, like alternating current
field measurement (ACFM), have applications in weld inspection and are described in this section but are less
commonly used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector should be aware of discontinuities common to specific base metals and weld processes to assure
these discontinuities are detectable. Table 6 is a summary of these discontinuities, potential NDE methods and
possible solutions to the weld process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>During welding inspection, the inspector should verify the conformance of the base material and filler metal
chemistries with the selected or specified alloyed materials. This should include reviewing the certified mill test report,
reviewing stamps or markings on the components, or require PMI testing. It is the responsibility of the owner/user to
establish a written material verification program indicating the extent and type of PMI to be as outlined in API 578.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.3 Visual Examination (VT)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Visual examination is the most extensively used NDE method for welds. It includes either the direct or indirect
observation of the exposed surfaces of the weld and base metal. Direct visual examination is conducted when access
is sufficient to place the eye within 6 in. through 24 in. (150 mm through 600 mm) of the surface to be examined and
at an angle not less than 30 degrees to the surface as illustrated in Figure 14. Mirrors may be used to improve the
angle of vision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R emote visual examination may be substituted for direct examination. Remote examination may use aids such as
telescopes, borescopes, fiberscopes, cameras, or other suitable instruments, provided they have a resolution at least
equivalent to that which is attained by direct visual examination. In either case, the illumination should be sufficient to
allow resolution of fine detail. These illumination requirements are to be addressed in a written procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.2 Visual Inspection Tools<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To visually inspect and evaluate welds, adequate illumination and good eyesight provide the basic requirements. In
addition, a basic set of optical aids and measuring tools, specifically designed for weld inspection can assist the
inspector. Listed below are some commonly used tools or methods with VT of welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.2.2 Optical Aids<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Optical aids used in visual inspection include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Lightingâthe inspection surface illumination is of extreme importance. Adequate illumination levels should be
established in order to ensure and effective visual inspection. Standards such as ASME Section V Article 9 specify
lighting levels of 100 foot-candles (1000 lux) at the examination surface. This is not always easy to achieve so
inspectors have to be keenly aware of the potential need to measure lighting conditions with light meters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Mirrorsâvaluable to the inspector allowing them to look inside piping, threaded and bored holes, inside castings
and around corners if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Magnifiersâhelpful in bringing out small details and defects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)  B orescopes and Fiberscopesâwidely used for examining tubes, a deep hole, long bores, and pipe bends, having
internal surfaces not accessible to direct viewing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.2.3 Mechanical Aids<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mechanical aids used in visual inspection include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Steel rulerâavailable in a wide selection of sizes and graduations to suit the needs of the inspector (considered a
non-precision measuring instrument).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Vernier scaleâa precision instrument, capable of measuring in decimal units to a precision factor of 0.0001 in.
The Vernier system is used on various precision measuring instruments, such as the caliper, micrometer, height
and depth gauges, gear tooth, and protractors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Combination square setâconsisting of a blade and a set of three heads: Square, Center, and Protractor. Used
universally in mechanical work for assembly and layout examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Thickness gaugeâcommonly called a âFeelerâ gauge is used to measure the clearance between objects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Levelsâtools designed to prove if a plane or surface is truly horizontal or vertical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.2.4 Weld Examination Devices<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical inspection tools for weld inspection include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Inspectorâs kit (see Figure 15)âcontains some of the basic tools needed to perform an adequate visual
examination of a weld during all stages of welding. It includes everything from a lighted magnifier to a Vernier
caliper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Bridge cam gauge (see Figure 16)âcan be used to determine the weld preparation angle prior to welding. This
tool can also be used to measure excess weld metal (reinforcement), depth of undercut or pitting, fillet weld throat
size or weld leg length and misalignment (high-low).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Fillet weld gaugeâoffers a quick and precise means of measuring the more commonly used fillet weld sizes. The
types of fillet weld gauges include.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Adjustable fillet weld gauge (see Figure 17)âmeasures weld sizes for fit-ups with 45 degree members and
welds with unequal weld leg lengths.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Skew-T fillet weld gauge (see Figure 18)âmeasures the angle of the vertical member.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) The weld fillet gauge (see Figure 19)âa quick go/no-go gauge used to measure the fillet weld leg length.
Gauges normally come in sets with weld leg sizes from  1 / 8  in. (3 mm) to 1 in. (25.4 mm). Figure 20 shows a weld
fillet gauge being used to determine if the crown has acceptable concavity or convexity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Weld size gauge (see Figure 21)âmeasures the size of fillet welds, the actual throat size of convex and concave
fillet welds, the reinforcement of butt welds and root openings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Hi-lo welding gauge (see Figure 22)âmeasures internal misalignment after fit-up, pipe wall thickness after
alignment, length between scribe lines, root opening, 37 1 / 2  degree bevel, fillet weld leg size and reinforcement on
butt welds. The hi-lo gauge provides the ability to ensure proper alignment of the pieces to be welded. It also
measures internal mismatch, weld crown height and root weld spacing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.4 Magnetic Particle Examination (MT)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Magnetic particle examination is effective in locating surface or near surface discontinuities of ferromagnetic
materials. It is most commonly used to evaluate weld joint surfaces, intermediate checks of weld layers and back-
gouged surfaces of the completed welds. Typical types of discontinuities that can be detected include cracks,
laminations, laps, and seams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this process, the weld (and heat-affected zone) is locally magnetized, creating a magnetic field in the material.
Ferromagnetic particles are then applied to the magnetized surface and are attracted to any breaks in the magnetic
field caused by discontinuities as shown in Figure 23 and Figure 24.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 23 shows the disruption to the magnetic field caused by a defect open to the surface. Ferromagnetic particles
are drawn to the break in the flux field. The pattern of the particles is very sharp and distinct. Figure 24 illustrates how
a sub-surface defect would also disrupt the magnetic lines of flux. The observed indication would not be as clearly
defined, as would a defect open to the surface. The pattern formed by the particles represents the shape and size of
any existing discontinuities as seen in Figure 25. The particles used during the exam can be either dry or wet. If the
examination is performed in normal lighting the color of the particles should provide adequate contrast with the exam
surface. The best results are achieved when the lines of flux are perpendicular to the discontinuity. Typically, two
inspections are performed, one parallel to the weld and one across the weld to provide the maximum coverage. When
a magnetic force is applied to the material, a magnetic flux field is created around and through the material.
Discontinuities that are perpendicular to the lines of flux attract the magnetic particles causing an indication as shown
in Figure 26. Figure 27 illustrates the setup for detecting transverse indications. The yoke is placed parallel on the
weld to detect discontinuities transverse to the weld. Figure 28 shows the setup for detecting indications that run
parallel to the weld. In this case, the yolk is placed across the weld to detect discontinuities parallel to the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For added sensitivity, wet fluorescent magnetic particle (WFMT) techniques may be used. With this technique, a

<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME Section V, Article 7, lists requirements for magnetic particle examination. Some codes and specifications may
list compliance with these requirements as being mandatory. ASME B31.3 and ASME Section VIII, Division 1,
requires magnetic particle examination be performed in accordance with Article 7. Some of the requirements listed in

<<PARAGRAPH>>The direction of the magnetic flux direction can be confirmed by the use of several indicators. One of the most popular
indicators is the pie gauge. It consists of eight low-carbon steel segments, brazed together to form an octagonal plate
that is copper plated on one side to hide the joint lines (see Figure 29). The plate is placed on the test specimen,
adjacent to the weld, during magnetization with the copper side up. The particles are applied to the copper face and
outline the orientation of the resultant field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>When the residual magnetism in the part could interfere with subsequent processing or usage, demagnetization
techniques should be used to reduce the residual magnetic field to within acceptable limits. Care should be taken
when performing MT examination of a weld during the welding process. If a residual field is left in a partially
completed weld, this field may deflect the weld arc and make it difficult to control the weld deposit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.5 Alternating Current Field Measurement (ACFM)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ACFM technique is an electromagnetic non-contacting technique that is able to detect and size surface breaking
defects in a range of different materials and through coatings of varying thickness. This technique can be used for
inspecting complex geometries such as nozzles, ring-grooves, and grind-out areas. It requires minimal surface
preparation and can be used at elevated temperatures up to 900 Â°F (482 Â°C). However, it is less sensitive and more
prone to operator errors than WFMT. ACFM is used for the evaluation and monitoring of existing cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ACFM uses a probe similar to an eddy current probe and introduces an alternating current in a thin skin near to the
surface of any conductor. When a uniform current is introduced into the area under test, if it is defect free, the current
is undisturbed. If the area has a crack present, the current flows around the ends and the faces of the crack. A
magnetic field is present above the surface associated with this uniform alternating current and becomes disturbed if
a surface-breaking crack is present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The probe is scanned longitudinally along the weld with the front of the probe parallel and adjacent to the weld toe.
Two components of the magnetic field are measured:  B x  along the length of the defect, which responds to changes in
surface current density and gives an indication of depth when the reduction is the greatest; and  B z , which gives a
negative and positive response at either end of the defect caused by current-generated poles providing an indication
of length. A physical measurement of defect length indicated by the probe position is then used together with a
software program to determine the accurate length and depth of the defect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the application of the ACFM technique actual values of the magnetic field are being measured in real time.
These are used with mathematical model look-up tables to eliminate the need for calibration of the ACFM instrument
using a calibration piece with artificial defects such as slots.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6 Liquid Penetrant Examination (PT)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>PT is capable of detecting surface-connecting discontinuities in ferrous and nonferrous alloys. Liquid penetrant
examination can be used to examine the weld joint surfaces, intermediate checks of individual weld passes, and
completed welds. PT is commonly employed on austenitic stainless steels where magnetic particle examination is not
possible. The examiner should recognize that many specifications limit contaminants in the penetrant materials which
could adversely affect the weld or parent materials. Most penetrant manufacturers provide material certifications on
the amounts of contaminants (e.g. chlorine, sulfur, and halogens).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A limitation of PT is that standard penetrant systems are limited to a maximum of 125 Â°F (52 Â°C) so the weld must be
cool which significantly slows down the welding operation. High-temperature penetrant systems can be qualified to
ex tend the temperature envelope.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During PT, the test surface is cleaned and coated with a penetrating liquid that seeks surface-connected
discontinuities. After the excess surface liquid penetrant is removed, a solvent-based powder suspension (developer)
is normally applied by spraying. The liquid in any discontinuity bleeds out to stain the powder coating. An indication of
depth is possible if the Inspector observes and compares the indication bleed out to the opening size visible at the
surface. The greater the bleed out to surface opening ratio, the greater the volume of the discontinuity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.2 Liquid Penetrant Techniques<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The two general penetrant techniques approved for use include the color contrast penetrant technique (normally red
in color to contrast with a white background) and the fluorescent penetrant technique, which uses a dye that is visible
to ultraviolet light, as shown in Figure 30. For added sensitivity, fluorescent penetrant techniques may be used to
detect fine linear type indications. The examination is performed in a darkened area using a filtered blacklight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) post emulsifiable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Compatibility with base metals, welds, and process material should be considered before penetrants are used, since
they can be difficult to remove completely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME Section V, Article 6, (Paragraph T-620) lists general requirements for liquid penetrant examination. Codes and
specifications may list compliance with these requirements as mandatory. API Standard 650, ASME B31.3 and ASME
Section VIII, Division 1, require liquid penetrant examination be performed in accordance with Article 6. Some

<<HEADING level=3>>9.7 Eddy Current Examination (ET)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Eddy current inspection is used to detect surface discontinuities, and in some cases subsurface discontinuities in
tubing, pipe, wire, rod and bar stock. ET has limited use in weld inspection. Eddy current can be used as a quick test
to ensure that the components being joined during welding have the same material properties, and as a quick check
for defects of the weld joint faces. It can also be used to measure the thickness of protective, nonconductive surface
coatings and measure cladding thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Eddy current uses a magnetic field to create circulating currents in electrically conductive material. Discontinuities in
the material alter the magnetically induced fields and present them on the unitâs display. As with the magnetic particle
inspection, this technique is most sensitive for defect detection when the currents are perpendicular to the
discontinuity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>More information can be found in ASME Section V, Article 8, which addresses eddy current examination of tubular
products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8 Radiographic Examination (RT)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RT is a volumetric examination method capable of examining the entire specimen rather than just the surface. It is the
historical approach to examine completed welds for surface and subsurface discontinuities. The method uses the
change in absorption of radiation by solid metal and in  an  areas of a discontinuity. The radiation transmitted reacts
with the film, a latent image is captured, and when the film is processed (developed) creates a permanent image
(radiograph) of the weld. Some methods are available which use electronics to create a digital image and are referred
to as âfilmless.â Due to the hazard of radiation, and the licensing requirements, the cost can be higher and the trained
and certified personnel more limited, than with other NDE methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An NDT examiner interprets and evaluates the radiographs for differences in absorption and transmission results.
Radiographic indications display a different density as contrasted with the normal background image of the weld or
part being inspected. The radiographer also makes sure that the film is exposed by the primary source of the radiation
and not backscatter radiation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The NDT examiner that performs the film interpretation, evaluation and reporting should be certified as a minimum to
ASNT Level II requirements. However, all personnel performing radiography are required to attend radiation safety
training and comply with the applicable regulatory requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME Section V, Article 2, paragraph T-220 lists the general requirements for radiographic examination. There are
very specific requirements with regard to the quality of the produced radiograph, including the sharpness of the
image, the ability to prove adequate film density in the area of interest and sensitivity to the size and type of expected
flaws. Requirements listed in Article 2 include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) method to determine if backscatter is present;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) permanent identification, traceable to the component;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) film selection in accordance with SE-1815;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) designations for hole or wire type image quality indicators (penetrameters);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
facilities for viewing radiographs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) calibration (certification of source size).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The exposure and processing of a radiograph is considered acceptable when it meets the required quality features in
terms of sensitivity and density. These factors are designed to ensure that imperfections of a dimension relative to
section thickness are revealed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.2 Image Quality Indicators (Penetrameters)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Standards for industrial radiography require the use of one or more image quality indicators (IQIs) to determine the
required sensitivity is achieved. The IQI was previously called a penetrameter but this term is no longer being used in
most codes. To assess sensitivity the required hole or wire as specified by the governing code must be visible on the
finished radiograph. Mistakes with IQIs (penetrameters) can have much greater impact on thinner wall pipe where
large root pass imperfections can significantly reduce the strength and integrity of a weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IQIs (penetrameters) are tools used in industrial radiography to establish the quality level of the radiographic
technique. IQIs (penetrameters) are selected based on the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Material being radiographed. The IQI must be made from the same alloy material group or one with less radiation
absorption.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Thickness of the base material plus reinforcement. The thickness of any backing ring or strip is not a consideration
in IQI selection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are two types of IQIs (penetrameters) in use today.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Wire-type IQIs (penetrameters) are constructed of an array of six paralleled wires of specified diameters. They
are made of substantially the same material as the component being radiographed. Wire-type IQIs
(penetrameters) are placed on and perpendicular to the weld prior to the exposure of a radiograph. The
diameter of the smallest wire that is visible as a lighter-white image on the radiograph provides an indication of
the sensitivity of the radiograph. The wire that is to be visible on an acceptable radiograph is known as the
essential wire and it is specified by the standard. Wire-type IQIs (penetrameters) are most often placed
perpendicular to the center line of the weld with the required sensitivity based on the weld thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Hole-type IQIs (penetrameters) are strips of metal of known thickness with holes of a specified diameter drilled
or punched through the sheet. They are made of substantially the same material as the component being
radiographed. The thickness of hole-type IQIs (penetrameters) are generally specified to represent
approximately two to four percent of the thickness of the object being radiographed. The holes in the IQI
(penetrameter) are projected on a radiograph as darker (black or gray) spots. The thickness of the IQI
(penetrameter) and the diameter of the smallest hole that is visible as a darker image on the radiograph provide
an indication of the sensitivity of the radiograph. The diameter of holes in hole-type IQIs (penetrameters) are a
multiple of the thickness of the sheet. Common hole diameters are one, two and four times the thickness (1 T , 2 T ,
and 4 T ) of the IQI (penetrameter), as shown in Figure 31. Hole-type IQIs (penetrameters) are placed adjacent to
the weld either on the parent material or on a shim having a thickness equivalent to the weld build-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For pipe wall or weld thickness of 0.312 in. (7.9 mm), a No. 15 ASTM IQI (penetrameter) with a thickness of 0.015 in.
(0.38 mm) as shown in Figure 32 would be used. See Table 7 for IQI (penetrameter) numbers for other thicknesses.
This table illustrates the specified thickness and number of ASTM E94 IQIs (penetrameters) for all thickness ranges.
It summarizes the essential hole diameter requirements for hole-type IQIs (penetrameters).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The hole that is required to be visible on an acceptable radiograph is called the essential hole. Each size of hole-type
IQIs (penetrameters) are identified by a number that is related to the sheet thickness in inches. For example, a No. 10
IQI (penetrameter) is 0.010 in. (0.25 mm) thick while a No. 20 is 0.020 in. thick (0.51 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.3 Radiographic Film<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiographic film Class I or II are acceptable for use. The film is required to be of a sufficient length and width to allow
a minimum of 1 in. (25 mm) on consecutive circumferential exposures, and 3/4 in. (19 mm) coverage on either side of
the weld. Film should be stored in a cool, dry, clean area away from the exposure area where the emulsion is not
affected by heat, moisture and radiation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For weld inspection, typically radioactive isotopes of Iridium 192 or Cobalt 60 are used. X-ray machines may also be
us e d. Iridium 192 is normally used for performing radiography on steel with a thickness range of 0.25 in. to 3.0 in. (6.3
mm to 76.2 mm). Cobalt 60 is used for steel thickness of 1.5 in. to 7.0 in. (38 mm to 178 mm). The minimum or
maximum thickness that can be radiographed for a given material is determined by demonstrating that the required
sensitivity has been obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.5 Film Processing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Exposed film can either be hand-processed, or the examiner may use an automatic processor. Normal developing
time is five to eight minutes at 68 Â°F (20 Â°C). When the temperature is higher or lower, the developing time is adjusted
such that the processing consistently produces radiographs of desired quality. The chemicals used in processing,
developer, fixer and rinse water are changed on a regular basis of at any time that processed film shows chemical
irregularities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.6 Surface Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where a surface condition, which could mask a defect, is visually detected by the radiographer prior to radiography,
the surface condition should be remedied prior to the exposure. Weld ripples or other irregularities on both the inside,
where accessible, or on the outside, should be removed to the degree that the resulting image does not have
indications that can either mask or be confused with the image of a discontinuity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.7 Radiographic Identification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The identification information on all radiographs should be plainly and permanently produced, traceable to contract,
manufacturer, date, and to component, weld or weld seam or part numbers as appropriate and should not obscure
any area of interest. Location markers should also appear on the film identifying the area of coverage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.8 Radiographic Techniques<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most effective technique is one in which the radiation passes through a single thickness of the material being
radiographed and the film is in contact with the surface opposite the source side. Other techniques may be used as
the referencing code or situation dictates. Regardless of the technique used, the goal is to achieve the highest
possible quality level. The IQI (penetrameter) placement should be as close to the weld as possible without interfering
with the weld image.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A technique should be chosen based upon its ability to produce images of suspected discontinuities, especially those
that may not be oriented in a favorable direction to the radiation source. Radiography is extremely sensitive to the
orientation of tight planar discontinuities. If a tight planar discontinuity is expected to be at an angle to the source of
the radiation, it may be difficult or impossible to detect. The nature, location, and orientation should always be a major
factor in establishing the technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.8.2 Single-wall Technique<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A single-wall exposure technique should be used for radiography whenever practical. In the single-wall technique, the
radiation passes through only one wall of the material or weld, which is viewed for acceptance on the radiograph (see<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_78>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>70
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 33). An adequate number of exposures should be made to demonstrate that the required coverage has been
obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.8.3 Single-wall Viewing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For materials, and for welds in components, a technique may be used in which the radiation passes through two walls
and only the weld (material) on the film sidewall is viewed for acceptance. An adequate number of exposures should
be made to demonstrate that the required coverage is met for circumferential welds (materials). A minimum of three
exposures taken at 120 degrees to each other should be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.8.4 Double-wall Technique<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When it is not practical to use a single wall technique, a double-wall technique should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For materials and for welds in components 3.5 in. (88.9 mm) or less in nominal outside diameter, a technique may be
used in which the radiation passes through two walls and the weld (material) in both walls is viewed for acceptance on
the same radiograph. For double-wall viewing of welds, the radiation beam may be offset from the plane of the weld at
an angle sufficient to separate the images of the source side portions and the film side portions of the weld so there is
no overlap of the areas to be interpreted (see Figure 34). When complete coverage is required, a minimum of two
exposures taken at 90 degrees to each other should be made of each weld joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, the weld may be radiographed with the radiation beam positioned such that both walls are
superimposed. When complete coverage is required, a minimum of three exposures taken at either 60 degrees or
120 degrees to each other should be made for each weld joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.9 Evaluation of Radiographs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The final step in the radiographic process is the evaluation of the radiograph. Accurate film interpretation is essential;
it requires hours of reviewing and the understanding of the different types of images and conditions associated in
industrial radiography. The interpreter should be aware of different welding processes and the discontinuities<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>associated with those processes. The various discontinuities found in weldments may not always be readily
detectable. For example, rounded indications such as porosity, slag and inclusions are more apparent than an
indication compared to a crack, lack of fusion or overlap. A weld crack is generally tight and not always detectable by
radiography unless their orientation is somewhat in the same plane as the direction of the radiation. Lack of fusion is
typically narrow and linear and it tends to be straighter than a crack. In many cases lack of fusion is located at the
weld bevel angle or between two subsequent weld bead passes. This may add to the degree of difficulty in identifying
this condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.9.2 Facilities for Viewing Radiographs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Viewing facilities need to provide subdued background lighting of an intensity to avoid troublesome reflections,
shadows, or glare on the radiograph. Equipment used to view radiographs for interpretation needs to provide a light
source sufficient for the essential IQI (penetrameter) hole or wire to be visible for the specified density range. The
viewing conditions should be such that the light from around the outer edge of the radiograph or coming through low-
density portions of the radiographs does not interfere with the interpretation. Low power magnification devices (1.5X
to 3X) may also be used to aid in film interpretation and evaluation; but too high of a magnification also enhances the
graininess of the film. For example, comparators with scales etched into the glass offer magnification and measuring
capabilities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.9.3 Quality of Radiographs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiographs should be free from mechanical, chemical or other blemishes to the extent that they do not mask, and
are not confused with the image of any discontinuity in the area of interest. A radiograph with any blemishes in the
area of interest should be discarded and the area radiographed again.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Definition of the area of interest is often commonly misunderstood and the subject of confusion. Many   of the common
codes and standards in the hydrocarbon industry do not actually define   the area of interest which leads to
misalignment between inspectors and fabricators. ASTM E1316 states âthe specific portion of a radiograph that
needs to be evaluatedâ. This is the approach inspectors generally prefer, and gives the inspector the final decision to
identify the area of interest. ASME Section XI for the nuclear industry has a more practical guidance of  1 t  where  t  is
the nominal thickness of the component being joined. This provides a minimum recommended guidance for
inspectors reviewing radiographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.9.4 Radiographic Density<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Film density is the quantitative measure of film blackening as a result of exposure and processing. Clear film has a
zero density value. Exposed film that allows 10 % of the incident light to pass through has a 1.0 film density. A film
density of 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 allows 1 %, 0.1 % and 0.01 % of the incident light to pass through respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The transmitted film density through the radiographic image through the body of the hole type IQI (penetrameter), or
adjacent to the wire IQI (penetrameter), in the area of interest should be within the range 1.8 to 4.0 for x-ray and 2.0 to
4.0 for Gamma Ray. Adequate radiographic density is essential; rejectable conditions in a weld may go unnoticed if
slight density variations in the radiographs are not observed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A densitometer or step wedge comparison film is used to measure and estimate the darkness (density) of the film. A
densitometer is an electronic instrument calibrated using a step tablet or step wedge calibration film traceable to a
national standard. The step wedge comparison film is a step wedge that has been calibrated by comparison to a
calibrated densitometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The base density of the radiograph is measured through the IQI (penetrameter). A number of density readings should
be taken at random locations in the area of interest (excluding areas having discontinuities). The density range in the
area of interest must not vary greater or less than a specified percentage of the base density as defined in the code or
specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.9.5 Excessive Backscatter<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiation that passes through the object and film can be reflected back towards the film (i.e. a phenomenon termed
âbackscatterâ). A lead letter âBâ with a minimum dimension of  1 / 2  in. (12.7 mm) and  1 / 16  in. (1.55 mm) thickness is
typically attached to the back of each film holder/cassette during each exposure to determine if backscatter radiation
is exposing the film. If a light image of the letter âBâ appears on any radiograph of a darker background, protection
from scatter radiation is considered insufficient and the radiograph is considered unacceptable. A dark image of the
âBâ on a lighter background is not cause for rejection of the radiograph.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is a common misconception by those not trained in industrial radiography that the letter âBâ always appears on
a radiograph. This is in fact not correct. Where there is no medium besides free air to cause backscatter, there will be
insufficient radiation back to the film or imaging device to produce an image.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.9.6 Interpretation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiographic interpretation is the skill of extracting the maximum information from a radiographic image. This
requires subjective judgment by the interpreter and is influenced by the interpreterâs knowledge of:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the characteristics of the radiation source and energy level(s) with respect to the material being examined;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the characteristics of the recording media in response to the selected radiation source and the energy level(s);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the processing of the recording media with respect to the image quality;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the product form (object) being radiographed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) the possible and most probable types of discontinuities that may occur in the test object;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
the possible variations of the discontinuitiesâ images as a function of radiographic geometry, and other factors; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) the acceptance criteria that are to be applied for accept/reject determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Because radiographic interpreters have varying levels of knowledge and experience, training becomes an important
factor for improving the agreement levels between interpreters. In applications where quality of the final product is
important for safety and/or reliability, more than one qualified interpreter should evaluate and pass judgment on the
radiographs. Figure 35, Figure 36, Figure 37, Figure 38, Figure 39, Figure 40, Figure 41, Figure 42, Figure 43, Figure
44, Figure 45, and Figure 46 are radiographic weld images illustrating some typical welding discontinuities and

<<HEADING level=3>>9.9 Ultrasonic Examination (UT)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>UT is capable of detecting surface and subsurface discontinuities. A beam of sound in the ultrasonic frequency range
(>20,000 cycles per second) travels a straight line through the metal and reflects from an interface. For weld
inspection, this high frequency sound beam is introduced into the weld and heat affected zone on a predictable path,
which, upon reflection back from an interruption in material continuity, produces a wave that is electronically amplified
to produce images. These images are displayed such that they might give the inspector both the size and positional
information of the discontinuity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Straight beam techniques are used for thickness evaluation or to check for laminations, and/or other conditions which
may prevent angle beams from interrogating the weld. Straight beam (or zero degree) transducers, direct a sound
beam from an accessible surface of the test piece to a boundary or interface that is parallel or near parallel to the
contacted surface. The time it takes for the sound to make a round trip through the piece is displayed on the ultrasonic
instruments time base. There are a number of different ways that straight-beam ultrasonic information can be
displayed as shown in Figure 47, Figure 48, and Figure 49, reprinted courtesy of GE Inspection. These displays
represent an accurate thickness of the test piece.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shear wave or angle beam techniques are employed for identification of discontinuities in welds. The sound beam
enters the area of the weld at an angle. If the sound reflects from a discontinuity, a portion of the sound beam returns
to the receiver where it is displayed on the ultrasonic instrument. These images can be displayed in a number of ways
to aid in evaluation. From this display, information such as the size, location and type of discontinuity can be
determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.2 Types of Ultrasonic Displays<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.2.1 A-Scan Display<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The A-scan, as shown in Figure 47, is the most common display type. It shows the response along the path of the
sound beam for a given position of the probe. It  is  shows the amplitude of the signal coming from the discontinuity as
a function of time. The âxâ axis (right) represents the time of flight and indicates the depth of a discontinuity or back
wall (thickness). The âyâ axis shows the amplitude of reflected signals (echoes) and can be used to estimate the size
of a discontinuity compared to a known reference reflector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 49âC-scan<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.2.2 B-Scan Display<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The B-scan display (see Figure 48) shows a cross sectional view of the object under test by scanning the probe along
one axis. The horizontal axis (left) relates to the position of the probe as it moves along the surface of the object and
provides information as to the lateral location of the discontinuity. Echo amplitude is usually indicated by the color or
gray scale intensity of echo indications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.2.3 C-Scan Display<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The C-scan display (see Figure 49) shows a plan view of the test object. The image is produced by mechanically or
electronically scanning in an x-y plane. The âxâ and âyâ axis form a coordinate system that indicates probe/discontinuity
position. Color or gray scale intensity can be used to represent depth of discontinuity or echo amplitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.2.4 D-Scan Display<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The D-scan display (see Figure 50) shows a through-thickness view showing a cross-section of the test object
perpendicular to the scanning surface and perpendicular to the projection of the beam axis on the scanning surface.
The D-scan display is exactly like a B-scan display except that the view is oriented perpendicular to B-scan view in
the plane of the plate. The D-scan allows quick discrimination of indications along a weld by presenting their position
in depth from the scanning surface. An example of the relationship between all four common ultrasonic displays is
shown in Figure 50.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.2.5 Phased Array S-Scan Display<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The S-Scan or sector display (see Figure 51) shows two dimensional imaging of ultrasonic reflectors by plotting
information from a multitude of angles simultaneously. The image is a cross sectional view of the area where the
ultrasound passes through. Location and size information can be measured for any reflectors that are in the Sectorial
scan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Phased Array ultrasonics accomplishes this by using a transducer that contains multiple elements, 8 to 128
commonly, that are excited at intervals to create constructive interference in the wave front of ultrasonic energy. This<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>constructive interference is controlled by the amount of time delay in element excitation and can steer the sound
through a range of angles. This array of beam angles is then plotted to create the sector scan. The ultrasonic energy
provides responses in a pulse-echo fashion as with conventional straight beam and angle beam techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.2.6 Time of Flight Diffraction (TOFD) B-scan and D-scan displays (see Figure 52 and Figure 53)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The B-scan and D-scan displays are a different format than the B & D scan displays acquired in any other ultrasonic
technique utilizing information provided in a pulse echo fashion. TOFD B & D scan images provide defect sizing
information for through wall extent by using diffracted signals rather than pulse echo signals. The TOFD B & D scan
displays are created by stacking A-scan displays at a preset interval or collection step and viewing the data in a
grayscale image where 100 % amplitude of the sine wave in either the positive or negative direction are plotted as all
black or all white with gray images of signals less than 100 % amplitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>TOFD passes sound energy through a weld area by utilizing a transmitting transducer on one side of the weld and a
receiving transducer on the other (see Figure 54). Any changes in the material, such as discontinuities, are vibrated
by the induced ultrasonic energy. This vibration of discontinuities produces diffracted signals from the discontinuity
that are then received by the receiving transducer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The set of TOFD probes can be manipulated along a weld or across a weld to create scans. Standard TOFD weld
inspection is accomplished by moving TOFD probes along the weld, with one transducer on each side of the weld,
where the ultrasonic energy is perpendicular to the weld. This is a TOFD D-scan or non-parallel scan. The TOFD
probes can also be manipulated across an area parallel to the sound path to evaluate an indication from a position 90
degrees from the perpendicular imaging. This is a TOFD B-scan or parallel scan. This can only be accomplished if the
weld cap has been removed for the purpose of weld inspection and is most often used to provide more accurate
defect location information once defects have been located with the TOFD D-scan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.3 Ultrasonic Examination System Calibration<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic examination system calibration is the process of adjusting the controls of the ultrasonic instrument such
that the UT display of the sound path is linear. Calibration is to ensure that there is sufficient sensitivity to detect
discontinuity of the size and type expected in the product form and process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection system includes the examiner, the ultrasonic instrument, cabling, the search unit, including wedges or
shoes, couplant, and a reference standard. The search unit transducer should be of a size, frequency, and angle that
is capable of detecting the smallest rejectable defect expected to be in the part being examined. The ultrasonic
instrument is required to meet or exceed the requirements of ASME Section V, Article 5, Paragraph T-530, and should
provide the functionality to produce the required display of both the calibration reflectors and any discontinuities
located during the examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>T h e reference standard (calibration block) should be of the same nominal diameter and thickness, composition and
heat treatment condition as the product that is being examined. It should also have the same surface condition as the
part being examined. The reference standard should be of an acceptable size and have known reflectors of a
specified size and location. These reflectors should be acceptable to the referencing code. ASME Section V, Article 4,
Figure T-434.2.1 and Figure T-434.3   details the requirements for basic calibration block construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--``,`````,,,,`,`,,,,,```,,,,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Calibration system checks should be performed prior to and at the completion of an examination. In addition, a
system check is required with any change in the search unit, cabling, and examiner. The temperature of the
calibration standard should be within 25 Â°F (14 Â°C) of the part to be examined. If the temperature falls out of that
range, the reference standard is brought to within 25 Â°F (14 Â°C), and a calibration check should be performed. For
high temperature work, special high temperature transducers and couplants are usually necessary. Consideration
should be given to the fact that temperature variations within the wedge or delay line can cause beam angle changes
and/or alter the delay on the time base. System checks are typically performed at a minimum of every four hours
during the process of examination but can be done more often at the examiners discretion after any instance of
suspected system irregularity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If during a system calibration check, it is determined that the ultrasonic equipment is not functioning properly, all areas
tested since the last successful calibration should be reexamined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.3.2 Echo Evaluation with DAC<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The distance amplitude correction (DAC) curve allows a simple echo evaluation of unknown reflectors by comparison
of the echo height with respect to the DAC (%DAC).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of attenuation and beam divergence in all materials, the echo amplitude from a given size reflector
decreases as the distance from the probe increases. To set up a DAC curve, the maximum response from a specified
reference reflector (e.g. flat bottom or side drilled hole) is recorded at different depths over the required test range.
The calibration block with reference reflectors should be of the same material as the part under test. The curve is
plotted through the peak points of the echo signals from the reflectors as shown in Figure 55. The curve represents
the signal amplitude loss based upon distance, from the same size reference reflector using a given probe. The gain
setting used to establish the DAC during the initial calibration is referred to as the primary reference level sensitivity.
Evaluation is performed at this sensitivity level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 55âDAC Curve for a Specified Reference Reflector<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unknown reflectors (flaws) are evaluated by comparing their echo amplitude against the height of the DAC curve (i.e.
50 % DAC, 80 % DAC, etc.) at the sound path distance of the unknown reflector (see Figure 56). Material
characteristics and beam divergence are automatically compensated for because the reference block and the test
object are made of the same material, have the same heat treatment and surface condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.4 Surface Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to UT examination, all scan surfaces should be free from weld spatter, surface irregularities and foreign matter
that might interfere with the examination. The weld surface should be prepared such that it permits a meaningful
examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.5 Examination Coverage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The volume of the weld, HAZ, and a portion of the adjacent base material on both sides of the weld should be
examined by moving the search unit over the examination surface in order to scan the entire examination volume.
Each pass of the transducer should overlap the previous pass by 10 % of the transducer element dimension. The rate
of search unit movement should not exceed 6 in. (152 mm) per second unless the calibration was verified at an
increased speed. In many cases, the search unit is oscillated from side to side to increase the chances of detecting
fine cracks that are oriented other than perpendicular to the sound beam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.6 Straight Beam Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A  s traight beam examination should be performed adjacent to the weld to detect reflectors that would interfere with
the angle beam from examining the weld such as a lamination in the base material. All areas having this type of
reflector should be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.7 Angle Beam Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typically, there are two different angle beam examinations performed on a weld. A scan for reflectors that are oriented
parallel to the weld, and a scan for reflectors that are oriented transverse to the weld. In both cases, the scanning
should be performed at a gain setting at least two times the reference level sensitivity established during calibration.
Evaluation of indications however, should be performed at the primary reference level sensitivity. In both cases, the
search unit should be manipulated such that the ultrasonic energy passes through the required volume of the weld
and HAZ.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During examination for reflectors that are oriented parallel to the weld, the sound beam is directed at approximate
right angles to the weld, preferably from both sides of the weld. For reflectors that are oriented transverse to the weld,
the sound beam is directed parallel to the weld and a scan is performed in one direction around the weld, then the
search unit is turned 180 degrees and another scan is performed until the ultrasonic energy passes through the
required volume of weld and HAZ in two directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To inspect for transverse flaws, the angle-beam transducers should be rotated 90 degrees, or additional transverse
flaw inspection using other techniques may be performed to supplement automated ultrasonic weld inspection
techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.7.2 Supplemental Shear Wave Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When inspecting a weld with TOFD, the presence of the lateral wave and back-wall indication signals, may obscure
detection of flaws present in these zones. ASME BPVC Section V requires that the weld's near and far surfaces (i.e.
both top and bottom surfaces) be examined by angle beam with the angles chosen that are closest to being
perpendicular to the fusion lines. This examination may be performed manually or mechanized; if mechanized, the
data should be collected in conjunction with the TOFD examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.8 Automated Ultrasonic Testing (AUT)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Volumetric Inspection of welds may be performed using one of the four automated ultrasonic weld inspection
techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Pulse Echo Raster Scanning: This technique inspects with zero degree compression and two angle beam
transducers interrogating the weld from either side simultaneously. The compression transducers examine for
corrosion or laminar defects in the base metal and the angle beam transducers scan the volume of the weld
metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Pulse Echo Zoned Inspection: The zoned inspection is a Line Scan technique. The technique uses an array of
transducers on either side of the weld with the transducer angles and transit time gates set to ensure that the
complete volume of the weld is inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Time of Flight Diffraction (TOFD): This is a line scan technique used in the pitch-catch mode. The multi-mode
transducers are used to obtain the maximum volume inspection of the weld region. More than one set of
transducers may be required for a complete volumetric inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) Phased Array (PA) Inspection: This technique utilizes an array of transducer elements to produce steering of
the ultrasonic beam axis or focusing of the ultrasonic beam over a specified range. This allows the user the
ability to inspect certain portions or zones of the component being tested using many different beam angles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.9 Discontinuity Evaluation and Sizing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>UT procedures should include the requirements for the evaluation of discontinuities. Typically, any imperfection that
causes an indication in excess of a certain percentage of DAC curve should be investigated in terms of the
acceptance standards. The procedure should detail the sizing technique to be used to plot the through thickness
dimension and length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One commonly used sizing technique is called the âintensity dropâ or â6 dB dropâ technique. This sizing technique
uses the beam spread of the transducer to quickly estimate the axial length of the reflector. Using this technique, the
transducer is positioned on the part such that the amplitude from the reflector is maximized. This point is marked with
a grease pencil. The UT instrument is adjusted to set the signal to 80 % full screen height (FSH). The transducer is
then moved laterally until the echo has dropped to 40 % FSH (6dB). This position is also marked. The transducer is
then moved laterally in the other direction, past the maximum amplitude point, until the echo response again reaches
40 % FSH. This point is marked with the grease pencil. The two outside marks produce the approximate axial size of
the flaw.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other sizing techniques should be used to get a more precise measurement of the length and through wall dimension
of the flaw. With advances in technologies a number of other through-thickness sizing techniques are described in
9.9.9.2, 9.9.9.3, 9.9.9.4, and 9.9.9.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.9.2 The ID Creeping Wave Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ID Creeping wave method uses the effects of multiple sound modes, such as longitudinal waves and shear
waves to qualitatively size flaws. The method is used for the global location of flaws in the bottom  1 / 3 , middle  1 / 3 , and
top  1 / 3  regions. Three specific waves are presented with the ID Creeping wave method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) High angle refracted longitudinal wave of approximately 70 degrees.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Direct 30 degree shear wave which mode converts to a 70 degree refracted longitudinal wave.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_98>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>90
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Indirect shear or âheadâ wave which mode converts at the inside diameter from a shear wave to a longitudinal
wave, and moves along the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.9.3 The Tip Diffraction Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tip diffraction methods are very effective for sizing flaws which are open to the inside or outside diameter surface. For
ID connected flaws, the half âVâ path or one and one half âVâ path technique is used. For OD connected flaws, two
techniques are available; the time-of-flight tip diffraction technique and the time measurement technique of the tip
diffracted signal and the base signal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.9.4 The High Angle Longitudinal Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The high angle refracted longitudinal wave method is very effective for very deep flaws. Dual element, focused, 60,
70, and OD creeping wave are used to examine the outer one half thickness of the component material. Probe
designs vary with the manufacturer. Depth of penetration is dependent upon angle of refraction, frequency, and
focused depth. Many of these transducers are used not only for sizing, but also for detection and confirmation of flaws
detected during the primary detection examination. For coarse grain materials, these probes work well where shear
wave probes are ineffective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.9.5 The Bimodal Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bimodal method is a dual element tandem probe with the transducers crystals located one in front of the other.
The probe also generates an ID creeping wave. The wave physics are essentially the same. The pseudo-focusing
effect of the dual element crystals is very effective for ID connected flaws in the mid-wall region, 30 % to 60 % through
wall depth. A low angle shear wave (indirect) mode converts at the ID to produce an ID creeping wave, which detects
the base of the flaw. A further low angle shear wave mode converts at the ID to a longitudinal wave, which reflects a
longitudinal wave from the flaw face. A high angle refracted longitudinal wave detects the upper extremity of the flaw
(70 degrees). The bimodal method can be used to confirm the depth of shallow to deep ID connected flaws. However,
very shallow flaws of less than 10 % to 20 % tend to be slightly oversized, and very deep flaws tend to be slightly
undersized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Significant training and experience is required to effectively utilize some of the more advanced UT detection and
sizing techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.9.6 The Phased Array Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The phased array method utilizes an array of transducer elements, excited in precise timing patterns, to produce
steering or focusing of the ultrasonic beam over a specific range of angles in the component being inspected. The
system consists of a computerized ultrasonic pulser/receiver instrument that contains the collection setup and
analysis software, an umbilical cable, and the   phased array probe/wedge. The phased inspection may be performed
manually, or with an encoder for semi-automated scans, or with a mechanized scanner for fully automated scanning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method allows the user the ability to inspect certain portions or zones of the component under test using many
different beam angles. The results may be viewed as A-scan, B-scan, C-scan, or as a Sectorial scan images. Multiple
views may be viewed simultaneously as well for assistance with data analysis. This technique is also used in a single
axis scan motion which makes it more efficient than manual scanning for data collection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.10 Hardness Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.10.1 Hardness Testing for PQR and Production Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardness testing of the weld and HAZ is often required to assure the welding process, and any PWHT, resulted in an
acceptably âsoftâ result. Testing production welds and HAZ requires test areas to be ground flat or even flush with the
base metal to accommodate the hardness testing instrument in the area of interest. The HAZ can be difficult to locate
and is often assumed for testing purposes to be just adjacent to the toe of the weld. Hardness testing for a PQR is
easier since the coupon is cross-sectioned and etched to identify the weld, fusion line and HAZ. API 582 details<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>hardness test requirements for PQRs and production welds. High hardness is particularly an issue with hardenable
materials where the weld size is small compared to the base metal being welded (i.e. tube-to-tubesheet welds).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardness testing of production welds often utilizes portable equipment. Field measurements tend to have greater
variability and so additional measurements may be required to verify results. However, hardness testing performed as
part of the PQR uses laboratory equipment where greater accuracy is possible. Portable hardness testers are not
substitutes for the bench top models, and results from portable testers should be given careful review.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.10.2 Hardness Testing for Repair Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On site hardness testing may be required on pressure retaining welds after any PWHT in accordance with API 582
and NACE SP 0472. Hardness testing of repair welds can be conducted with portable hardness testers in accordance
with either ASTM A833, ASTM A1038, or ASTM A956<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Using API 582 as a reference, the HAZ hardness readings may include locations as close as possible (approximately
0.2 mm) to the weld fusion line (see Figure 57). The surface should be polished and should not exceed 16 Î¼in. (0.4
Î¼m) maximum. After the surface has been polished, it should be etched to identify the weld metal, fusion line and
HAZ.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardness measurements may be conducted at locations shown in Figure 57. Five impressions in an area of
approximately 1 in. 2  (645 mm 2 ) should constitute a test. Because field hardness measurements tend to have greater
variability, additional assessment such as âField Metallography Replicationâ (FMR) can be conducted to determine
whether an excessively hard HAZ microstructure has been formed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.11 Pressure and Leak Testing (LT)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where a hydrostatic or pneumatic pressure test is required by code, the inspector should   adopt code and
specification requirements relevant to vessels or piping. API 510, API 570, API 574, and ASME B31.3 provide
guidance on the application of pressure tests. Pressure tests should be conducted at temperatures appropriate for the
material of construction to avoid brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_100>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>92
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Codes and most specifications do not indicate the duration of pressure tests. The test must be held long enough for a
thorough visual inspection to be completed to identify any potential leaks. Typically, a pressure test should be held for
at least 30 minutes. The inspector should be aware of the effect of changing temperature of the test medium has in
causing either an increase or decrease of pressure during the test period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pneumatic pressure tests often require special approvals and considerations due to the amount of stored energy in
the system. Where pneumatic testing is conducted, the inspector should verify safe pressure-relieving devices, and
the cordoning off of test areas to exclude all but essential personnel. The inspector should monitor the pressure at the
maximum test level for some time before reducing pressure and performing visual inspection. This safety precaution
allows time for a potential failure to occur before the inspector is in the vicinity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leak testing may be required by code or specification to demonstrate system tightness or integrity, or may be
performed during a hydrostatic pressure test to demonstrate containment on a sealed unit such as a pressure vessel.
ASME Section V, Article 10, addresses leak testing methods and indicates various test systems to be used for both
open and closed units, based upon the desired test sensitivity. Leak testing of welded tube-to-tubesheet joint may be
specified for service applications that are sensitive to small tube-to-tubesheet joint leaks. Helium leak testing is
especially effective for tube-to-tubesheet joints when highly sensitive leak testing is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the most common methods used during hydrostatic testing is the direct pressure bubble test. This method
employs a liquid bubble solution, which is applied to the areas of a closed system under pressure. A visual test is then
performed to note any bubbles that are formed as the leakage gas passes through it. When performing the bubble
test, some items of concern include the temperature of surface to be inspected, pre-test and post-test cleaning of the
part to be inspected, lighting, visual aids and the hold time at a specific pressure prior to application of the bubble
solution. Typically, the area under test is found to be acceptable when no continuous bubble formation is observed. If
the unit under pressure is found to have leakage, it should be depressurized, the leaks repaired as per the governing
code, and the test is repeated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A wide variety of fluids and methods can be used, dependent on the desired result. Considerations for system design
limitations may prevent the most common type of leak test using water. Drying, hydrostatic head, and support
limitations should be addressed before water is used. The required sensitivity of the results may also lead to a more
sensitive leak test media and method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>of metallurgical effects important to personnel performing inspections, but is not to be considered an in depth
resource of metallurgy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Based on the concept that this section provides a basic understanding, this section does not describe all aspects of
metallurgy such as crystalline structures of materials and atomic configurations, which are left to other more complete
metallurgy texts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2 The Structure of Metals and Alloys<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Solid metals are crystalline in nature and all have a structure in which the atoms of each crystal are arranged in a
specific geometric pattern. The physical properties of metallic materials including strength, ductility and toughness
can be attributed to the chemical make-up and orderly arrangement of these atoms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Metals in molten or liquid states have no orderly arrangement to the atoms contained in the melt. As the melt cools, a
temperature is reached at which clusters of atoms bond with each other and start to solidify developing into solid
crystals within the melt. The individual crystals of pure metal are identical except for their orientation and are called
grains. As the temperature is reduced further, these crystals change in form eventually touch and where the grains
touch an irregular transition layer of atoms is formed, which is called the grain boundary. Eventually the entire melt
solidifies, interlocking the grains into a solid metallic structure called a casting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Knowledge of cast structures is important since the welding process is somewhat akin to making a casting in a
foundry. Because of the similarity in the shape of its grains, a weld can be considered a small casting. A solidified
weld may have a structure that looks very much like that of a cast piece of equipment. However, the thermal
conditions that are experienced during welding produce a cast structure with characteristics unique to welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.2 Castings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The overall arrangement of the grains, grain boundaries and phases present in the casting is called the
microstructure of the metal. Microstructure is a significant area that inspectors should understand, as it is largely
responsible for the physical and mechanical properties of the metal. Because castings used in the refinery industry
are typically alloyed, they typically contain two or more microstructural phases. A phase is any structure that is
physically and compositionally distinct. As the chemical composition is altered or temperature changed, new phases
may form or existing phases may disappear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cast structures, depending on their chemical composition can exhibit a wide range of mechanical properties for
several reasons. In general, it is desirable to keep the size of grains small, which improves strength and toughness.
This can be achieved by maximizing the rate of cooling or minimizing the heat input (in the case of welding). This
increases the rate of crystal formation and decreases the time available for crystal growth, which has a net effect of
reducing crystalline grain size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The properties of the cast structure can also be impaired by compositional variations in the microstructure called
segregation. Because of the solubility of trace and alloying elements, such elements as carbon, sulfur, and
phosphorous, can vary in a pure metal, these elements can cause variations in the solidification temperature of
different microstructural phases within the melt. As the melt cools, these elements are eventually contained in the
micro structural phases that solidify last in spaces between the grains. These grain boundary regions can have a
much higher percentage of trace elements that the grains themselves, which may lead to reductions in ductility and
strength properties. This effect can be minimized by using high purity melting stocks, by special melting practices
(melting under vacuum or inert gas, for example) to minimize contamination and/or subsequent heat treatment to
homogenize the structure. In many carbon steels this is achieved using oxygen scavengers such as aluminum ,
silicon, or silicon plus   aluminum and the steels are often described as âkilledâ or âfully killedâ steels. Minimizing trace
elements or âinclusionsâ at this stage is often important as they can provide sites for formation of in-service defects
such as hydrogen assisted cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_104>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>96
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gases, such as hydrogen, which become entrapped in the melt as it solidifies, can also affect casting integrity. In
some cases, these create voids or porosity in the structure, or can lead to cracking. Weldments are particularly prone
to cracking because of trapped hydrogen gases. This problem can be avoided by careful cleaning of the weld bevels
to remove hydrocarbons and moisture, the use of low-hydrogen electrodes, correct storage or baking of electrodes
and use of proper purging techniques with high quality welding gases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For refinery applications, castings are used primarily for components having complex shapes in order to minimize the
amount of machining required. These include pump components (casings, impellers, and stuffing boxes) and valve
bodies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.3 Wrought Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The vast majority of metallic materials used for the fabrication of refinery and chemical plant equipment are used in
the wrought form rather than cast. Mechanical working of the cast ingot produces wrought materials by processes
such as rolling, forging, or extrusion, which are normally performed at an elevated temperature. These processes
result in a microstructure that has a uniform composition, and a smaller, more uniform grain shape.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wrought materials may consist of one or more microstructural phases that may have different grain structures.
Austenitic stainless steels, for example, are composed of microstructural phase call austenite, which has grains of the
same crystal structure. Many nickel, aluminum, titanium, and copper alloys are also single-phase materials. Single-
phase materials are often strengthened by the addition of alloying elements that lead to the formation of nonmetallic
or intermetallic precipitates. The addition of carbon to austenitic stainless steels, for example, leads to the formation of
very small iron and chromium carbide precipitates in the grains and at grain boundaries. The effect of these
precipitates is to strengthen the alloy. However, the formation of chromium carbide precipitates   on the grain
boundaries during welding (or other high temperature exposure) depletes the area adjacent to the grain boundaries of
chromium. This microstructure in austenitic stainless steel is referred to as a âsensitized microstructureâ. As a result,
the chromium-depleted area adjacent to the grain boundary may experience severe intergranular corrosion .  In
general, greater strengthening occurs with the finer distribution of precipitates. This effect is usually dependent on
temperature; at elevated temperatures, the precipitates begin to breakdown and the strengthening effect is lost.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alloys may also consist of more than one microstructural phase and crystal structure. A number of copper alloys
including some brasses are composed of two distinct phases. Plain carbon steel is also a two-phase alloy. One phase
is a relatively pure form of iron called ferrite. By itself, ferrite is a fairly weak material. With the addition of more than
0.06 % carbon, a second phase called pearlite is formed which adds strength to steel. Pearlite is a lamellar (i.e. plate-
like) mixture of ferrite and Fe 3 C iron carbide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a result of fast cooling such as quenching in non-alloyed steels and also with the addition of alloying elements
such as chromium to steel, other phases may form. Rather than pearlite, phases such as bainite or martensite may
be produced. These phases tend to increase the strength and hardness of the metal with some loss of ductility. The
formation of structures such as bainite and martensite may also be the result of rapid or controlled cooling and
reheating within certain temperature ranges often termed âquenchingâ and âtempering.â<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.4 Welding Metallurgy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding metallurgy is concerned with melting, solidification, gas-metal reactions, slag-metal reactions, surface
phenomena and base metal reactions. These reactions occur very rapidly during welding due to the rapid changes in
temperature caused by the welding process. This is in contrast to metallurgy of castings, which tends to be slower
and often more controlled. There are three parts of a weld: the weld metal, heat-affected metal (zone), and base
metal. The metallurgy of each area is related to the composition of the base and weld metal, the welding process and
welding procedures used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Most typical weld metals are rapidly solidified and, like the structure of a casting described earlier, usually solidify in
the same manner as a casting and have a fine grain dendritic microstructure. The solidified weld metal is a mixture of
melted base metal and deposited weld filler metal, if used. In most welds, there also can be some segregation of alloy<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_105>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING  P ROCESSES , I NSPECTION ,  AND  M ETALLURGY
97<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>elements. The amount of segregation is determined by the chemical composition of the weld and the base metal.
Consequently, the weld is less homogeneous than the base metal, which can affect the mechanical properties of the
weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The heat-affected zone (HAZ) is adjacent to the weld and is that portion of the base metal that has not been melted,
but whose mechanical properties or microstructure have been altered by the preheating temperature and the heat of
welding. There typically is a change in grain size or grain structure and hardness in the HAZ of steel. The size or width
of the HAZ is dependent on the heat input used during welding. For carbon steels, the HAZ includes those regions
heated to greater than 1350 Â°F (700 Â°C). Each weld pass applied has its own HAZ and the overlapping heat affected
zones extend through the full thickness of the plate or part welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The third component in a welded joint is the base metal. Most of the common carbon and low-alloy steels used for
tanks and pressure vessels are weldable. The primary factor affecting the weldability of a base metal is its chemical
composition. Each type of metal has welding procedural limits within which sound welds with satisfactory properties
can be made. If these limits are wide, the metal is said to have good weldability. Conversely, if the limits are narrow,
the metal is said to have poor weldability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An important aspect of welding metallurgy is the gas metal reaction between the molten weld metal and gases
present during welding. Gas metal reactions depend on the presence of oxygen, hydrogen, or nitrogen, individually or
combined in the shielding atmosphere. Oxygen can be drawn in from the atmosphere or occur from the dissociation
of water vapor, carbon dioxide, or metal oxide. Air is the most common source of nitrogen, but it can also be used a
shielding gas for welding of austenitic or duplex stainless steels. There are many sources of hydrogen. In SMAW or
SAW, hydrogen may be present as water in the electrode coating or loose flux. Hydrogen can also come from
lubricants, water on the work piece, surface oxides, or humidity or rain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An important factor in selecting shielding gases is the type or mixture. A reactive gas such as carbon dioxide can
break down at arc temperatures into carbon and oxygen. This is not a problem on carbon and low-alloy steels.
However, on high-alloy and reactive metals, this can cause an increase in carbon content and the formation of oxides
that can lower the corrosion resistant properties of the weld. High-alloy materials welded with gas-shielded processes
usually employ inert shielding gases or mixtures with only slight additions of reactive gases to promote arc stability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3 Physical Properties<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The physical properties of base metals, filler metals and alloys being joined can have an influence on the efficiency
and applicability of a welding process. The nature and properties of gas shielding provided by the decomposition of
fluxing materials or the direct introduction of shielding gases used to protect the weldment from atmospheric
contamination can have a pronounced effect on its ability to provide adequate shielding and on the final chemical and
mechanical properties of a weldment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The physical properties of a metal or alloy are those, which are relatively insensitive to structure and can be
measured without the application of force. Examples of physical properties of a metal are the melting temperature,
the thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, the coefficient of thermal expansion, and density.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.2 Melting Temperature<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The melting temperature of different metals is important to know because the higher the melting point, the greater the
amount of heat that is needed to melt a given volume of metal. This is seldom a problem in arc welding since the arc
temperatures far exceed the melting temperatures of carbon and low-alloy steels. The welder simply increases the
amperage to get more heat, thus controlling the volume of weld metal melted per unit length of weld at a given,
v olt age or arc length and travel speed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_106>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>98
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A pure metal has a definite melting temperature that is just above its solidification temperature. However, complete
melting of alloyed materials occurs over a range of temperatures. Alloyed metals start to melt at a temperature, which
is just above its solidus temperature, and, because they may contain different metallurgical phases, melting continues
as the temperature increases until it reaches its liquidus temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.3 Thermal Conductivity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thermal conductivity of a material is the rate at which heat is transmitted through a material by conduction or
thermal transmittance. In general, metals with high electrical conductivity also have high thermal conductivity.
Materials with high thermal conductivity require higher heat inputs to weld than those with lower thermal conductivity
and may require a pre-heat. Steel is a poor conductor of heat as compared with aluminum or copper. As a result it
takes less heat to melt steel. Aluminum is a good conductor of heat and has the ability to transfer heat very efficiently.
This ability of aluminum to transfer heat so efficiently also makes it more difficult to weld with low temperature heat
sources.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thermal conductivity of a material decreases as temperatures increase. The alloying of pure metals also
decreases a materials thermal conductivity. Generally, a material that has had substantial alloying elements added
would have a lower thermal conductivity and lower heat inputs are required to raise the material to a desired
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.4 Electrical Conductivity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The electrical conductivity of a material is a measure of its efficiency in conducting electrical current. Metals are good
conductors of electricity. Metals that have high electrical conductivity are more efficient in conducting electrical current
than those with a low electrical conductivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Aluminum and copper have high electrical conductivity as compared to iron and steel. Their electrical resistance is
also much lower, and as a result, less heat is generated in the process of carrying an electrical current. This is one of
the reasons that copper and aluminum are used in electric wiring and cables.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ability of steel to carry an electrical current is much less efficient and more heat is produced by its high measure
of electrical resistance. One can then deduce that steel can be heated with lower heat inputs than that necessary for
aluminum or copper because of its lower measure of electrical conductivity and higher electrical resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.5 Coefficient of Thermal Expansion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As metals are heated there is an increase in volume. This increase is measured in linear dimensions as the
temperature is increased. This linear increase with increased temperature, per degree, is expressed as the coefficient
of thermal expansion. An example of this would be the increased length of a steel bar that has been heated in its
middle with an oxyfuel torch. As the bar is heated, there is a measurable increase in length that correlates to the
temperature and the specified coefficient of thermal expansion for the material at that temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This coefficient of thermal expansion may not be constant throughout a given temperature range because of the
phase changes a material experiences at different temperatures and the increases or decreases in volume that
accompany these phase changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Metals with a high coefficient of thermal expansion are much more susceptible to warping and distortion problems
during welding. The increases in length and shrinkage that accompany the heating and cooling during welding should
be anticipated, and procedures established which would assure that proper tolerances are used to minimize the
effects of thermal conditions. The joining of metals in which their coefficients of thermal expansion differ greatly can
also contribute to thermal fatigue conditions, and result in a premature failure of the component. Welding procedures
are often employed, which specify special filler metals that minimize the adverse effects caused by inherent
differences between the metals being joined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.6 Density<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The density of a material is defined as its mass per unit volume. Castings, and therefore welds, are usually less dense
than the wrought material of similar composition. Castings and welds contain porosity and inclusions that produce a
metal of lower density. This is an important factor employed during RT of welded joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The density of a metal is often important to a designer, but more important to the welder is the density of shielding
gases. A gas with a higher density is more efficient as a shielding gas than one of a lower density as it protects the
weld environment longer before dispersion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4 Mechanical Properties<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mechanical properties of base metals, filler metals and of completed welds are of major importance in the
consideration of the design and integrity of welded structures and components. Engineers select materials of
construction that provide adequate strength at operating temperatures and pressures. For the inspector, verification
that mechanical properties meet the design requirements is essential. Inspectors should understand the underlying
principles of mechanical properties and the nature of tests conducted to verify the value of those properties. This is
one of the fundamental principles of performing welding procedure qualification tests. Examples of mechanical
properties of metals and alloys are: the tensile strength, yield strength, ductility, hardness, and toughness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4.2 Tensile and Yield Strength<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tensile testing is used to determine a metals ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, elongation and reduction in
area. A tensile test is performed by pulling a test specimen to failure with increasing load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stress is defined as the force acting in a given region of the metal when an external load is applied. The nominal
stress of a metal is equal to the tensile strength. The ultimate tensile strength of a metal is determined by dividing the
external load applied by the cross sectional area of the tensile specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Strain is defined as the amount of deformation, change in shape, a specimen has experienced when stressed. Strain
is expressed as the length of elongation divided by the original length of the specimen prior to being stressed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the specimen is subjected to small stresses, the strain is directly proportional to stress. This continues until the
yield point of the material is reached. If the stress were removed prior to reaching the yield point of the metal, the
specimen would return to its original length and is, considered elastic deformation. However, stress applied above the
yield point produces a permanent increase in specimen length and the yielding is considered plastic deformation.
Continued stress may result in some work hardening with an increase in the specimen strength. Uniform elongation
will continue, and the elongation begins to concentrate in one localized region within the gauge length, as does the
reduction in the diameter of the specimen. The test specimen is said to begin to âneck down.â The necking-down
continues until the specimen can no longer resist the stress and the specimen separates or fractures. The stress at
which this occurs is called the ultimate tensile strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For design purposes, the maximum usefulness should be a based on the yield strength of a material, as this is
considered the elastic/plastic zone for a material, rather than only on the ultimate tensile strength or fracture strength
of a material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4.3 Ductility<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In tensile testing, ductility is defined as the ability of a material to deform plastically without fracturing, measured by
elongation or reduction of area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_108>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>100
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Elongation is the increase in gauge length, measured after fracture of the specimen within the gauge length, usually
expressed as a percentage of the original gauge length. A materialâs ductility, when subjected to increasing tensile
loads, can be helpful to the designer for determining the extent to which a metal can be deformed without fracture in
metal working operations such as rolling and extrusion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tensile specimen is punch marked in the central section of the specimen, and measured, and the diameter of the
reduced area prior to subjecting it to the tensile load is measured. After the specimen has been fractured, the two
halves of the fractured tensile specimen are fitted back together as closely as possible, and the distance between the
punch marks is again measured. The increase in the after-fracture gauge length as compared to the original gauge
length prior to subjecting the specimen to tensile loads is the elongation of the specimen. This is usually expressed as
the percentage of elongation within 2 in. (50.8 mm) of gauge length. The diameter at the point of fracture is also
measured and the reduction in area from the original area is calculated. This reduction in area is expressed as a
percentage. Both the elongation and the reduction in area percentage are measures of a materialâs ductility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design of components can be based on yield strength as well as tensile strength. Permanent deformation,
resulting from plastic flow, occurs when the elastic limit is exceeded. A material subjected to loads beyond its elastic
limit may become strain hardened, or work hardened. This results in a higher effective yield strength, however, the
overall ductility based on the strain hardened condition is lower than that of a material which has not been subjected
to loads exceeding the elastic limit. Some materials also deteriorate in terms of ductility due to thermal cycling in
service. Reduction in ductility in these cases may fall so far that in-service repair welding without cracking becomes
very difficult if not impossible. This is sometimes experienced during the repair welding of complex alloy exchanger
tubesheets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the most common tests used in the development of welding procedures is the bend test. The bend test is used
to evaluate the relative ductility and soundness of welded joint or weld test specimen. The specimen is usually bent in
a special guided test jig. The specimens are subjected to strain at the outer fiber by bending the specimen to a
specified radius that is based on the type of material and specimen thickness. Codes generally specify a maximum
allowable size for cracks in a bend specimen. Cracks and tears resulting from a lack of ductility or discontinuities in
the weld metal are evaluated for acceptance or rejection to the applicable code requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4.4 Hardness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hardness of a material is defined as the resistance to plastic deformation by indentation. Indentation hardness
may be measured by various hardness tests, such as Brinell, Rockwell, Knoop and Vickers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardness measurements can provide information about the metallurgical changes caused by welding. In alloy steels,
a high hardness measurement could indicate the presence of untempered martensite in the weld or heat-affected
zone, while low hardness may indicate an over-tempered condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is an approximate interrelationship among the different hardness test results and the tensile strength of some
metals. Correlation between hardness values and tensile strength should be used with caution when applied to
welded joints or any metal with a heterogeneous structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One Brinell test consists of applying load (force), on a 10 mm diameter hardened steel or tungsten carbide ball to a
flat surface of a test specimen by striking the anvil on the Brinell device with a hammer. The impact is transmitted
equally to a test bar that is held within the device that has a known Brinell hardness value and through the impression
ball to the test specimen surface. The result is an indentation diameter in the test bar and the test specimen surface.
The diameters of the resulting impressions are compared and are directly related to the respective hardnessâs of the
test bar and the test specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rockwell hardness testing differs from Brinell testing in that the hardness number is based on an inverse relationship
to the measurement of the additional depth to which an indenter is forced by a heavy (major) load beyond the depth of
a previously applied (minor) load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_109>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING  P ROCESSES , I NSPECTION ,  AND  M ETALLURGY
101<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Rockwell test is simple and rapid. The minor load is automatically applied by manually bringing the work piece up
against the indenter until the âsetâ position is established. The zero position is then set on the dial gauge of the testing
machine. The major load is then applied, and without removing the work piece, the major load is removed, and the
Rockwell number then read from the dial.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In Rockwell testing, the minor load is always 10 kg, but the major load can be 60, 100, or 150 kg. Indenters can be
diamond cone indenters (commonly known as Brales), or hardened steel ball indenters of various diameters. The
type of indenters and applied loads depends on the type of material to be tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A letter has been assigned to each combination of load and indenter. Scale is indicated by a suffix combination of H
for Hardness, R for Rockwell and then a letter indicating scale employed. For instance, a value of 55 on the C scale is
expressed as 55 HRC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vickers hardness testing follows the Brinell principle as far as the hardness is calculated from the ratio of load to area
of an indentation as opposed to the depth (the Rockwell principle).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the Vickers hardness test, an indenter of a definite shape is pressed into the work material, the load removed, and
the diagonals of the resulting indentation measured. The hardness number is calculated by dividing the load by the
surface area of the indentation. The indenter for the Vickers test is made of diamond in the form of a square-based
pyramid. The depth of indentation is about one-seventh of the diagonal length. The Vickers hardness value is
preceded by the designation (HV). The Vickers hardness number is the same as the diamond pyramid hardness
number (DPH).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In-service hardness testing may involve the use of portable variations of the above-described methods. Alternatively,
varying techniques based on rebound, indentation resistance or comparator indentations may be applied and the
results related to the hardness scales more commonly accepted. Whatever technique is employed may well be
acceptable as long as it produces verifiable and consistent results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various codes and standards place hardness requirements on metals and welds. One should compare test results for
the material or welding procedures with the applicable standards to assure that the requirements for hardness testing
are being met, and that the test results are satisfactory with that specified by the applicable code. There are often in-
service degradation requirements, which are hardness related. For example, susceptibility to wet H 2 S cracking in
carbon steel is reduced if hardness levels are maintained below HRC 22.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4.5 Toughness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The toughness is the ability of a metal to absorb energy and deform plastically before fracturing. An important material
property to tank and pressure vessel designers is the âfracture toughnessâ of a metal which is defined as the ability to
resist fracture or crack propagation under stress. It is usually measured by the energy absorbed in a notch impact
test. There are several types of fracture toughness tests. One of the most common is a notched bar impact test called
the Charpy impact test. The Charpy impact test is a pendulum-type single-blow impact test where the specimen is
supported at both ends as a simple beam and broken by a falling pendulum. The energy absorbed, as determined by
the subsequent rise of the pendulum, is a measure of the impact strength or notch toughness of a material. The tests
results are usually recorded in foot-pounds. The type of notch and the impact test temperature are generally specified
and recorded, in addition to specimen size (if they are sub-size specimens, smaller than 10 mm x 10 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials are often tested at various temperatures to determine the ductile to brittle transition temperature. Many
codes and standards require impact testing at minimum design metal temperatures based on service or location
temperatures to assure that the material has sufficient toughness to resist brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5 Preheating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Preheating, for our purposes, is defined as heating of the weld and surrounding base metal to a predetermined
temperature prior to the start of welding. The primary purpose for preheating carbon and low-alloy steels is to reduce<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_110>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>102
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the tendency for hydrogen induced delayed cracking. It does this by slowing the cooling rate, which helps prevent the
formation of martensite in the weld and base metal HAZ. However, preheating may be performed for many reasons,
including the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Bring temperature up to preheat or interpass temperatures required by the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Reduce shrinkage stresses in the weld and base metal, which is especially important in weld joints with high
restraint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Reduce the cooling rate to prevent hardening and a reduction in ductility of the weld and base metal HAZ.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Maintain weld interpass temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Eliminate moisture from the weld area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Meet the requirements of the applicable fabrication code, such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code,
depending on the chemistry and thickness of the alloy to be welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If preheat is specified in the WPS it is important that the inspector confirms that the required temperature is
maintained. This can be done using several methods, including thermocouples, contact pyrometer, infrared
temperature measuring instruments, or temperature indicating crayons. The inspector should also remember that if
preheat is required during welding the same preheat should be applied during tack welding, arc gouging and thermal
cutting of the metal, all of which induce temperature changes similar to welding of the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Preheat can be applied using several different techniques, but the most common techniques used in pipe and tank
fabrication are electrical resistance coils, or an oxy-acetylene or natural gas torch. Good practice is to uniformly heat
an area on either side of the weld joint for a distance three times the width of the weld. Preheat should be applied and
extend to at least 2 in. (50.8 mm) on either side of the weld to encompass the weld and potential heat affected zone
areas. Inspectors should exercise caution when welding metals of different chemistries or preheat requirements
ensuring that preheats for both metals are in accordance with codes and the WPS documentation. Typically, the metal
with the highest preheat requirement governs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some alloys require controlled cooling or extended heating after weld completion, before PWHT begins. ASME IX
defines this as âpreheat maintenanceâ. Continuous or special heating during welding may also be necessary to avoid
cra ck ing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6 Postweld Heat Treatment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Postweld heat treatment (PWHT) produces both mechanical and metallurgical effects in carbon and low-alloy steels
that varies widely depending on the composition of the steel, its past thermal history, the temperature and duration of
the PWHT and heating and cooling rates employed during the PWHT. The need for PWHT is dependent on many
factors including; chemistry of the metal, thickness of the parts being joined, joint design, welding processes and
service or process conditions. The temperature of PWHT is selected by considering the changes being sought in the
equipment or structure. For example, a simple stress relief to reduce residual stresses is performed at a lower
temperature than a normalizing heat treatment. The holding time at temperature should also be selected to allow the
desired time at temperature dependent actions to take place. In some isolated cases holding time and temperature
are interchangeable, but small temperature changes have been shown to be equivalent to large changes in holding
times.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The primary reason for postweld heat treatment is to relieve the residual stresses in a welded fabrication. In ferritic
welds, postweld heat treatment also is conducted to reduce the hardness of the HAZ. Stresses occur during welding
due to the localized heating and severe temperature changes that occur. PWHT releases these stresses by allowing
the metal to creep slightly at the elevated temperature. However there may also be in-service conditions that require
particular PWHT conditions. These may not be so closely detailed in construction specifications and inspectors<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_111>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING  P ROCESSES , I NSPECTION ,  AND  M ETALLURGY
103<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>should therefore be particularly aware of these potential requirements when allowing, authorizing or inspecting in-
service repairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>PWHT (stress relief) can be applied by electrical resistance heating, furnace heating, or if allowed by the code, local
flame heating. Temperatures should be monitored and recorded by thermocouples attached to the part being heated.
Multiple thermocouples are often necessary to ensure proper PWHT of all components. Adequate support should be
provided during any postweld heat treatment to prevent the sagging that could occur during the heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.7 Hardening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardening or hardenability is defined as that property of a ferrous alloy that determines the depth and distribution of
hardness induced by quenching. It is important to note that there is no close relation between hardenability and
hardness, which is the resistance to indentation. Hardness depends primarily on the carbon content of the material,
whereas hardenability is strongly affected by the presence of alloying elements, such as chromium, molybdenum and
vanadium, and to a lesser extent by carbon content and alloying elements such as nickel, copper and silicon. For
example, a standard medium carbon steel, such as AISI 1040 with no alloying elements has a lower hardenability
then AISI 4340 low-alloy steel which has the same amount of carbon, but contains small amounts of chromium,
nickel, molybdenum and silicon as alloying elements. Other factors can also affect hardenability to a lesser extent
than chemical composition; these include grain structure, alloy homogeneity, amount of certain microstructural
phases present in the steel and overall micro cleanliness of the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding variables, such as heat input, interpass temperature and size of the weld bead being applied all affect the
cooling rate of the base metal HAZ which in turn affect the amount of martensite formation and hardness. The cooling
rate of the base metal can also be affected by the section size of the base metal being welded, temperature of the
metal being welded and weld joint geometry. If the alloying elements which increase hardenability are found in the
base metal HAZ, the cooling rate during welding necessary to produce a high hardness HAZ are generally lower than
for plain carbon steel without alloying elements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The simplest means to determine hardenability is to measure the depth to which a piece of steel hardens during
quenching from an elevated temperature. There are several standardized tests for determining hardenability. A typical
test of hardenability is called a Jominy Bar. In this test, a round bar is heated to a pre-determined elevated
temperature until heated evenly through the cross section. The specimen then subjected to rapid quenching by
spraying water against the bottom end of the round bar. The hardness of the test specimen is measured as a function
of distance away from the surface being quenched. Steels that obtain high hardness well away from the quenched
surface are considered to have high hardenability. Conversely, steels that do not harden well away from the
quenched surface are considered to have low hardenability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It may be important for the welding engineer and inspector to understand the hardenability of the steel as it can be an
indirect indicator of weldability. Hardenability relates to the amount of martensite that forms during the heating and
cooling cycles of welding. This is most evident in the base metal heat affected zone. Significant amounts of martensite
formation in the HAZ can lead to hydrogen assisted cracking or a loss in ductility and toughness. Certain steels with
high hardenability forms martensite when they are cooled in air. While other steels with low hardenability require
much faster cooling rates to form martensite. Knowing the hardenability helps the engineer or inspector determine if
pre-heat or postweld heat treatment are required or if a controlled cooling practice may be acceptable to produce a
serviceable weld and acceptable properties in the HAZ.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardening of the weld and base metal HAZ are important because of hydrogen assisted cracking that occurs in
carbon and low-alloy steels. As the hardness of the base metal HAZ increases so does the susceptibility to hydrogen
assisted cracking. The hardness limits currently recommended for steels in refinery process service are listed in Table
11. Hardness values obtained in excess of these usually indicate that postweld heat treatment is necessary,
regardless of whether specified on the welding procedure specification. In those instances where PWHT is needed,
an alternate welding procedure qualified with PWHT is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_112>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>104
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardness in excess of those listed can result in stress corrosion cracking in service due to the presence of sulfides
in the process. The 200 BHN limit for carbon steel is equally as important in sulfur containing oils as is the limit for
Cr-Mo steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials test reports, sometimes can be a very valuable tool for the inspector and welding engineer. These are
typically notarized statements and are legally binding. There are typically two types of test reports, a heat analysis
and a product analysis. A heat analysis, or mill certificate, is a statement of the chemical analysis and weight percent
of the chemical elements present in an ingot or a billet. An ingot and a billet are the customary shapes into which a
molten metal is cast. These shapes are the starting points for the manufacture of wrought shapes by the metal-
forming process, such as rolling, drawing forging or extrusion. A product analysis is a statement of the chemical
analysis of the end product and is supplied by the manufacturer of the material. These reports can be supplied for any
form of material, including wrought products, such as plate, pipe, fittings or tubing, castings and weld filler metals. The
product analysis is more useful to the inspector and engineer since it provides a more reliable identification of the
actual material being used for new fabrication or repair of existing equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this publication, the information about material test reports pertains to product certificates for
carbon, low-alloy steel and stainless steels. However, it should be noted that the material test report documents may

<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector should review the material test report to confirm that the material(s) being used for fabrication of new
equipment or repair of existing equipment meet the requirements specified by the user. The welding engineer can
also use the information from a materials test report to determine the weldability of the materials to be used, and to
recommend proper welding procedures, pre-heat and/or postweld heat treatment. The chemical analysis given in the
test report can be used to calculate the carbon equivalent for that material. It is important to note that materials test
reports are not generally supplied to the purchaser unless requested. It is good practice for the purchaser to request
the mill test reports.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.9 Weldability of Metals<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are entire books devoted to the weldability of metals and alloys. Weldability is a complicated property that does
not have a universally accepted definition. The term is widely interpreted by individual experience. The American
Welding Society defines weldability as âthe capacity of a metal to be welded under the fabrication conditions imposed,
into a specific, suitably designed structure, and to perform satisfactorily in the intended service.â Weldability is related
to many factors including the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the metallurgical compatibility of the metal or alloy being welded, which is related to the chemical composition and
microstructure of the metal or alloy, and the weld filler metal used;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the specific welding processes being used to join the metal;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the mechanical properties of the metal, such as strength, ductility and toughness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the ability of the metal to be welded such that the completed weld has sound mechanical properties;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) weld joint design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.9.2 Metallurgy and Weldability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A primary factor affecting weldability of metals and alloys is their chemical composition. Chemical composition not
only controls the range of mechanical properties in carbon and alloy steels, it has the most influence on the effects of
welding on the material. The heat cycles from welding in effect produce a heat treatment on the metal that can have a
substantial effect on mechanical properties, depending on the chemical composition of the metal being welded. As
noted earlier, each type of metal has welding procedural limits within which sound weldments with satisfactory
properties can be fabricated. If these limits are wide, the metal is said to have good weldability. If the limits are narrow,
the metal is considered to have poor weldability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The addition of carbon generally makes the metal more difficult to weld without cracking. Carbon content has the
greatest effect on mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, ductility and toughness in the base metal heat
affected zone and weldment. Carbon content influences the susceptibility of the metal to delayed cracking problems
from hydrogen. The carbon content, or carbon equivalent, of carbon steel determines the necessity for pre-heat and
postweld   heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alloying elements other than carbon are added to alloy steels for various reasons and can have an influence on the
weldability of the metal. Some alloying elements, such as manganese, chromium, nickel and molybdenum are added
to provide beneficial effects on strength, toughness, and corrosion resistance. Some of these elements are beneficial
in non-heat treated steel while others come into play during heat treatments necessary to produce the desired
mechanical properties. These alloying elements can have a strong effect on hardenability, so they can also affect the
weldability of the metal being welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are some elements present in carbon and alloy steels that are not deliberately added that can have an affect on
weldability. These include sulfur, phosphorus, tin, antimony, and arsenic. These elements are sometimes referred to
as tramp elements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One tool has been developed to help evaluate the weldability of carbon and alloy steel and that is the carbon
equivalent ( CE ) equation. The  CE  calculates a theoretical carbon content of the metal and takes into account not only
carbon, but also the effect of purposely added alloying elements and tramp elements. Several different equations for
expressing carbon equivalent are in use. One common equation is:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Typically, steels with a  CE  less than 0.35 require no preheat. Steels with a  CE  of 0.35 to 0.55 usually require
preheating, and steels with a  CE  greater than 0.55 require both preheating and a PWHT. However, requirements for
preheating should be evaluated by considering other factors such as hydrogen level, humidity, and section thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.9.3 Weldability Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the best means to determine weldability of a metal or combination of metals is to perform direct weldability
testing. Direct tests for weldability are defined as those tests that specify welding as an essential feature of the test
specimen. Weldability testing provides a measure of the changes induced by welding in a specified steel property and
to evaluate the expected performance of welded joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The problem with predicting the performance of structures or welded equipment from a laboratory type test is a
complex one since size, configuration, environment and type of loading normally differ. For this reason, no single test
can be expected to measure all of the aspects of a property as complex as weldability and most weldments are
evaluated by several tests. If tests are to be useful in connection with fabrication, they should be designed to measure
the susceptibility of the weld metal-base metal system to such defects as weld metal or base metal cracks, lamellar
tearing, and porosity or inclusions under realistic and properly controlled conditions of welding. Selection of a test
method may also have to balance time and cost for emergency repairs or shutdown work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The simplest weldability tests are those that evaluate the strength and ductility of the weld. Tests that evaluate
strength include weld tension tests, shear strength, and hardness. Ductility and fracture toughness tests include bend
tests and impact tests. These tests evaluate the breaking strength, ductility and toughness of simple weld joints.
These tests are the same as tests used for welding procedure and welder qualification to the ASME Boiler and
Pressure Vessel Code. If the weldment has adequate strength and ductility, it is usually deemed acceptable for
service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fabrication weldability tests that incorporate welding into their execution can be broadly classified as restraint
cracking tests, lamellar tearing tests, externally loaded cracking tests, underbead cracking tests or simple weld metal<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>soundness tests. Some of these tests can be used to detect the susceptibility to more than one type of defect, while
others are intended as single purpose tests and still others may be go/no-go types of tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Weld restraint induces stresses that can contribute to cracking of both the weld and base metal in fabrication welds.
This type of cracking occurs when the rigidity of the joint is so severe that the base metal or weld metal strength
cannot resist the strains and stresses applied by expansion and contraction of the weld joint. Weld restraint cracking
specimen are designed to permit a quantitative variation in restraint under realistic welding conditions so the
contribution of the weld metal, base metal and welding processes can be evaluated with respect to contribution to
cracking. Typical weld restraint test methods include the Lehigh restraint test, slot test, rigid restraint cracking (RRC)
test, and circular weld restraint cracking test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another approach to measuring susceptibility to weld cracking is to apply an external load during welding or
subsequent to welding. The loading is intended to duplicate or magnify stresses from restraint of a rigid weld joint.
The tests provide an ability to control the stress and strain applied to the weld joint and, therefore, provide a relative
index of the susceptibility to weld cracking. Test methods that use external loading include the implant test, tension
restraint cracking (TRC) test, and varestraint test. There is also a very specialized test called the Gleeble test that
also applies a load to the specimen during heating or melting of the metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is beyond to the scope of this document to describe each test in detail; however, a general overview of different
types of tests and what types of defects they can detect are given in Table 12.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.10 Weldability of high-alloys<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.10.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section gives information about welding of high-alloy metals, such as austenitic stainless steels, precipitation
hardening stainless steels and nickel based alloys. These materials are not as common as carbon and low-alloy
steels (e.g. 1 1 / 4  Cr- 1 / 2  Mo through 9 Cr-1 Mo steels), but may still be used in some processes within the oil industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.10.2 Austenitic Stainless Steels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Austenitic stainless steels are iron-based alloys that typically contain low carbon, chromium between 15 % to 32 %
and nickel between 8 % to 37 %. They are used for their corrosion resistance and resistance to high temperature
degradation. Austenitic stainless steels are considered to have good weldability and can be welded using any
common welding process or technique. The most important considerations to welding austenitic stainless steels are;
solidification cracking, hot cracking, distortion and maintaining corrosion resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Solidification cracking and hot cracking (sometimes called hot shortness) are directly related to weld metal chemistry
and the resultant metallurgical phases that form in the weld metal. Cracking mechanism of both solidification cracking
and hot cracking is the same. Cracks can occur in various regions of the weld with different orientations. They can
appear as centerline cracks, transverse cracks, and as microcracks in the underlying weld metal or adjacent heat
affected zone (HAZ). Cracking is primarily due to low melting point liquid phases which allow boundaries to separate
under the thermal and shrinkage stresses during weld solidification and cooling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most common measure of weldability and susceptibility to hot cracking is the ferrite number of the weld metal.
Austenitic welds require a minimum amount of delta ferrite to resist cracking. The amount of ferrite in the weld metal is
primarily a function of both base metal and weld metal chemistry. For welds made without filler metal, the base metal
chemistry should be appropriate to produce the small amounts of ferrite that is needed to prevent cracking. If the base
metal chemistry does not allow for ferrite formation, then filler metal is recommended to produce adequate ferrite in
the weld metal. Welding parameters and practices can also effect ferrite formation. For example, small amounts of
nitrogen absorbed into the weld metal can reduce ferrite formation. WRC Bulletin 342 contains diagrams that
accurately predict the amount of ferrite present in a weld metal based on the calculation of nickel and chromium
equivalents based on weld metal and base metal chemistry. A number of resources recommend a minimum of 5% â
20 % ferrite to prevent cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Weldability of austenitic stainless steels can also be affected by the presence of high levels of low melting point
elements like sulfur, phosphorus, and selenium. Other elements such as silicon and columbium (niobium) also
increases the hot cracking susceptibility of austenitic stainless steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Distortion is more often a problem with welding of austenitic stainless steels than carbon or low-alloy steels. The
thermal conductivity of austenitic stainless steels is about one third that of carbon steel and the coefficient of thermal
expansion is about 30 % greater. This means that distortion is greater for austenitic stainless steels than for carbon
steels. More frequent tack welds may be necessary for stainless steels to limit shrinkage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding can reduce the corrosion resistance of regions of the HAZ of some austenitic stainless steels. Areas exposed
to temperatures between 800 Â°F to 1650 Â°F (427 Â°C to 900 Â°C) for a long enough time may precipitate chromium
carbides at the grain boundaries. This causes a loss of corrosion resistance due to chromium depletion. Using low-
carbon content stainless steels, such as Type 304L or 316L, or stabilized grades of stainless steels, such as Type 321
and 347 can prevent this phenomenon. It is also important to select the proper filler metal to prevent a loss in
corrosion resistance. Low carbon electrodes or stabilized grades of bare filler metal should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Oxidation of the backside of welds made without proper shielding can also be detrimental to the corrosion resistance
of austenitic stainless steels. To prevent a loss in corrosion resistance the root of the weld should be protected by
using an inert backing gas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.10.3 Nickel Alloys<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nickel alloys, such as Alloy C276 or Alloy 625 suffer from similar problems as austenitic stainless steels. In general
most nickel alloy materials are considered to have less weldability than austenitic stainless steels. Some nickel alloys,
such as Alloy 825, 600, and 625 have similar welding characteristic to austenitic stainless steels. While Alloy 200,
Alloy 400, and Alloy B-2 have very different welding characteristics compared to austenitic stainless steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the main differences between nickel alloy and carbon steels, and austenitic stainless steels, is their tendency
to be sluggish during welding. This means for nickel alloys that the molten weld pool will not move as easily as it does
for other metals. This sluggish tendency means the welder should move the weld pool with a weave or oscillation
pattern to ensure good sidewall fusion. If some oscillation is not used, a high convex weld contour will result which
cause sidewall lack of fusion, weld undercut or slag inclusions. The formation of a slightly concave weld bead profile
will be more resistant to centerline cracking. It is also important that the bevel angle for nickel alloys be wide enough
to allow for this necessary oscillation of the welding torch. The wider weld bevel will also be beneficial with respect to
weld penetration. Nickel alloys also suffer from shallower weld penetration as compared to carbon steels and
austenitic stainless steel. To overcome this, the weld joint is modified by having a wider bevel and thinner root face.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nickel alloys are also susceptible to hot cracking, in some cases more so than austenitic stainless steels. This hot
tearing will occur as the weld pool cools and solidifies. To help prevent hot cracking the weld joint should be designed
to minimize restraint and the weld should be allowed to cool as quickly as possible. The faster a nickel alloy weld
solidifies (freezes), the less time it spends in the temperature range where it can tear. For this reason pre-heating,
which slows down the cooling rate of the weld, is actually harmful, as it permits more opportunity for hot tearing to
occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As with austenitic stainless steels, the weldability of nickel alloys can also be affected by the presence of high levels
of low melting point elements like sulfur, phosphorus, zinc, copper and lead. All of these contaminants can lead to
cracking in either the weld or base metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11 Refinery and Petrochemical Plant Welding Issues<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section provides details of specific welding issues encountered by the inspector in refineries and petrochemical
plants. This section will be expanded as more issues reflecting industry experience are added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2 Hot Tapping and In-Service Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 2201 provides an in depth review of the safety aspects to be considered when hot tapping or welding on in-
service piping or equipment. Prior to performing this work, a detailed written plan should be developed and reviewed.
The following is a brief summary of welding related issues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two primary concerns when welding on in-service piping and equipment are burn through and cracking. Burn through
will occur if the unmelted area beneath the weld pool can no longer contain the pressure within the pipe or equipment.
Weld cracking results when fast weld-cooling rates produce a hard, crack-susceptible weld microstructure. Fast
cooling rates can be caused by flowing contents inside the piping and equipment, which remove heat quickly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.2 Electrode Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hot tap and in-service welding operations should be carried out only with low-hydrogen consumables and electrodes
(e.g. E7016, E7018, and E7048). Extra-low-hydrogen consumables such as Exxxx-H4 should be used for welding
carbon steels with CE greater than 0.42 % or where there is potential for hydrogen assisted cracking (HAC) such as
cold worked pieces, high strength, and highly constrained areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_118>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>110
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  577<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cellulosic type electrodes (e.g. E6010, E6011, or E7010) may be used for root and hot passes. Although low-
hydrogen electrodes are preferred, some refining locations and the pipeline industry prefer to use cellulosic
electrodes frequently because they are easy to operate and provide improved control over the welding arc. Root pass
with low-hydrogen electrodes reduces risk of HAC. It also reduces risk of burn-through because the amount of heat
directed to the base metal is less than when using cellulosic type electrodes. However, manipulation of low-hydrogen
electrode for root pass is not as easy but it can be done by training and practice. It should be noted that cellulosic
electrodes have the following adverse effects on the integrity of the weldment:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Deep penetration, therefore higher risk of burn-through than low-hydrogen electrodes; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) High diffusible hydrogen, therefore higher risk of hydrogen assisted cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.3 Flow Rates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under most conditions, it is desirable to maintain some product flow inside of any material being welded. This helps to
dissipate the heat and to limit the metal temperature during the welding operation, thereby reducing the risk of burn-
through. Liquid flow rates in piping   should   be between 1.3 ft/sec. and 4.0 ft/sec. (0.4 m/sec. and 1.3 m/sec.). Faster
liquid flow rates may cool the weld area too quickly and thereby cause hard zones that are susceptible to weld
cracking or low toughness properties in the weldment. Because this is not a problem when the pipe contains gases,
there is no need to specify a maximum velocity. If the normal flow of liquids exceeds these values or if the flow cools
the metal to below dew point, it is advisable to compensate by preheating the weld area to at least 70 Â°F (20 Â°C) and
maintaining that temperature until the weld has been completed. High liquid flow may cause rapid cooling of the weld
area during the welding, creating hard zones susceptible to cracking. Under these circumstances, the minimum
interpass temperatures may not be attainable, resulting in undesirable material properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For making attachment welds to equipment containing a large quantity of liquid such as a storage tank 36 in. (0.9 m)
below the liquid/vapor line, normal circulation will effectively cool the weld area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding on a line under no-flow conditions or intermittent-flow conditions, e.g. a flare line,   should not be attempted
unless it has been confirmed that no explosive or flammable mixture will be generated during the welding operation.
In this respect, it should be confirmed that no ingress of oxygen in the line is possible. In cases where this
requirement cannot be met, inert gas or nitrogen purging is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An appropriate flow rate should be maintained to minimize the possibility of burn-through or combustion. The
minimum flow rate is 1.3 ft/sec. (0.4 m/sec.) for liquid and gas. For liquids, the maximum flow rate is usually required
to minimize risk of high hardness weld zone due to fast cooling rate. The allowable maximum flow rate depends on
the process temperature. In general, 4.0 ft/sec. (1.2 m/sec.) is the upper limit. There is no restriction on maximum
velocity for gas lines, subject to maintaining preheat temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.4 Other Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11 .2 .4.1 Burn Through<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To avoid overheating and burn through, the welding procedure specification should be based on experience in
performing welding operations on similar piping or equipment, and/or be based on heat transfer analysis. Many users
establish procedures detailing the minimum wall thickness that can be hot tapped or welded in-service for a given set
of conditions like pressure, temperature, and flow rate. Some users include in their procedures the use of mock-up
weld coupons when the actual thickness of the material to be welded is less than  1 / 4  in. The mock-up coupon
represents the actual material and thickness, the welding parameters are recorded and the weld penetration is
verified by etching. This information becomes the supplement to the repair package. To minimize burn through, the
first weld pass to equipment or piping less than  1 / 4  in. (6.35 mm) thick should be made with  3 / 32  in. (4.76 mm) or
smaller diameter welding electrode to limit heat input. For equipment and piping wall thicknesses where burn through
is not a primary concern, a larger diameter electrode can be used. Weaving the bead should also be avoided as this
increases the heat input.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.4.2 Hot Taps<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adverse effects can also occur from the heat on the process fluid. In addition, welds associated with hot taps or in-
service welding often cannot be stress relieved and may be susceptible to cracking in certain environments. Any hot
tapping or in-service welding on systems containing those listed in Table 13 should be carefully reviewed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During repairs or alterations (including hot taps) of alloy material piping systems, material verification of the existing
and the new materials is required to establish that the selected components are as specified. Additionally, in some
jurisdictions the hot tap component may require to have a registered design in which case this should be verified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Buttering the surface of the run pipe prior to attaching a hot-tap nozzle is particularly recommended when attaching a
nozzle to pipe fabricated from plate material to prevent lamellar tearing of the pipe where the thickness is such that
this may occur as the result of weld shrinkage stresses. With in-service welding there is the risk of high hardness and
hydrogen cracking in the HAZ of the parent material. Buttering allows a more closely controlled heat input in the
parent material, and also permits use of the temper bead welding technique. The temper bead welding technique
tempers the HAZ of the parent material during the deposition of the second layer of weld metal. This approach is
particularly useful where the cooling effect of the process fluid present is high.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Buttering allows a balanced welding sequence to be used, and if correctly applied can reduce the potential distortion
of the pipe after welding. Normally, two layers of weld metal should be deposited especially for dissimilar metal welds
to reduce the impact of weld dilution. The final thickness of the weld deposit at the location of the nozzle-to-pipe weld
should, after grinding, be not less than  1 / 4   in. (3 mm). The width of the buttering should be sufficient to overlap the
nozzle attachment weld by  1 / 4  in. (6.5 mm) on both the inside and outside diameters. Similarly, buttering should be
deposited under any reinforcement plate-to-pipe welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface of the buttered layer should be ground smooth, the edges de-burred and both the weld and the pipe local
to the weld inspected by appropriate crack detection and ultrasonic methods. It is recommended that immediately
before welding is commenced a test be carried out to check the amperage of the welding current to reduce the risk of
burn-through of the run pipe during the actual welding operation, This may be done by striking an arc on a suitable
piece of material, similar to that of the run pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.5 Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection tasks typically associated with hot tapping or welding on in-service equipment should include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Verifying adequate wall thickness along the lengths of the proposed welds typically using UT or RT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Verifying the welding procedure. Often, plants have welding procedures qualified specifically for hot taps and in-
service welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Verifying flow conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Specifying the sequence of welding full encirclement sleeves and fittings (circumferential and longitudinal welds).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Verifying fit-up of the hot tap fitting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Auditing welding to assure the welding procedure is being followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Perform NDE of completed welds. Typically this includes VT, UT shear wave using special procedures for the joint
configuration, MT or PT as applicable for material and temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Witness leak testing of fitting, if specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Perform positive metal identification (PMI) testing on the hot tap component material. Additionally, in some

<<HEADING level=3>>11.3 Lack of Fusion with GMAW-S Welding Process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process can utilize various metal transfer modes. When using the low voltage,
short circuiting mode (designated by the -S extension), the molten weld puddle is able to freeze more quickly. This
allows the unique ability to weld out of position, to weld thin base metals, and to weld open butt root passes. Due to
this inherent nature of the welding process the BPV Code Section IX, restricts this process by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) requiring welders qualify with mechanical testing rather than by radiographic examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) limiting the base metal thickness qualified by the procedure to 1.1 times the test coupon thickness for coupons
less than  1 / 2  in. thick (12.7 mm) per variable QW-403.10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) limiting the deposited weld metal thickness qualified by the procedure to 1.1 times the deposited thickness for
coupons less than  1 / 2  in. thick (12.7 mm) per variable QW-404-32.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) making variable QW-409.2 an essential variable when qualifying a welder for the GMAW-S process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

113<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since the transfer mode may be difficult to determine without an oscilloscope, some general characteristics are listed
in a National Board Classic Bulletin, Low Voltage Short CircuitingâGMAW, from January 1985, to assist the inspector
in determining the transfer mode being used. The quick freeze characteristic, which can result in LOF, is the reason
this process is frequently written out of purchase requisitions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>GMAW in the short-circuiting transfer mode is of particular significance to inspectors in that many specifications,
codes and standards impose limitations or special conditions on its use. The technique can suffer from incomplete
fusion particularly in the sidewall of steep or narrow weld preparations. This occurs as transfer of small fast freezing
droplets only occurs whilst the electrode is short circuited by contact with the work piece. Intermittent loss of contact
can leave areas of lack of fusion. In shallow weld preparations, these are also very difficult to detect with conventional
radiographic techniques. Consequently, a higher standard of NDE inspection is required. In pipeline welding,
automated ultrasonic has been adopted to overcome this problem. The risk of LOF associated with GMAW-S means
restrictions on qualification of welders using radiography only and inspectors should make note of these potential
problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.4 Caustic Service<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel and low alloy steels are subject to stress corrosion cracking in caustic service. Austenitic (i.e. Type-300
series) stainless steels can be sensitive to caustic cracking in high temperature steam environments. Cracking is a
function of temperature, caustic concentration, and the level of operating or residual stress. Prior to welding or PWHT,
the weld area should be cleaned, for a distance of at least 6 in. (150 mm) from the edges of the weld, with a 5 %
acetic acid solution in water and then water wash to removed the neutralized caustic. Check the cleaned area with pH
paper to show that the caustic has been removed. Alternatively, the area can be checked with a phenolphthalein
indicator to show that caustic has been removed. If the indicator turns pink, caustic is still present on the surface. The
contaminated surface should be reneutralized, recleaned and rechecked, as necessary, until caustic is removed from
the surface. Material cleanliness is a very important requirement for successful welding, especially when welding
nickel and nickel alloy materials. Inspection should be performed before welding on caustic contaminated surfaces.
All areas to be welded should be ground or power-brush clean. Nickel and nickel alloys should be cleaned with a
stainless steel wire brush. All cleaning tools including wire brushes and carbide grinding tools should be clean and
free of debris or other metal fragments. Care should be taken during grinding operations since the heat of grinding
may create and propagate crack-like defects on caustic-contaminated surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welds and steel cold formed areas should be postweld heat treated if service conditions are anticipated to exceed
120 Â°F (49 Â°C) for 50 % caustic soda solution. Cracking can be effectively prevented by means of a stress-relieving
heat treatment (e.g. PWHT). Heat treatment, at or above 1150 Â°F, is considered an effective stress relieving heat
treatment for carbon steel to resist caustic stress corrosion cracking. Although caustic stress corrosion cracks may be
seen visually, crack detection is best performed with WFMT, ET, RT, or ACFM techniques. Surface preparation by grit
blasting, high pressure water blasting, or other methods is usually required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to weld repairs in caustic service, a corrosion specialist should review the details of welding plan to assure
suitability for service. This should include a review of the welding electrode/wire selected, the weld procedure, details
of weld preparation, post-weld heat treatment, and the details of the NDE to be used on the completed welds. Other
service that may warrant similar review include amine service, hydrofluoric acid service, hydrogen service, sour and
wet H 2 S service, and situations with dissimilar metal welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the final weldments meet the service requirements. A welder may be unqualified for several reasons including
expired qualification, not qualified for the thickness, not qualified in the technique, or not qualified for the material of
construction. Figure B.1 details some potential steps to address the disposition of these welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A welding procedure may be improper if the weldment is made outside the range of essential variables (and

<<HEADING level=2>>Welding Procedure Review<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex presents a sample checklist prepared by a mythical company named Company Inc. to evaluate a WPS
and PQR for a SMAW process. There is no ASME code requirement for a checklist; however, code users and
reviewers must be certain that every variable as specified in paragraph QW-250 of ASME Section IX is addressed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The checklist presented in this Annex is representative of other lists available in the CASTI âGuidebook to ASME
Section IXâWelding Qualifications.â A narrative discussing each variable, potential problem, and where the
procedure supports the application and each other is included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2 Example of Using a Checklist to Review a WPS & PQR<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure C.1 is a sample WPS #CS-1 and Figure C.2 is a sample PQR #CS-1 prepared by a mythical company, named:
Company Inc. Figures C.1 and C.2 are samples that contain typical errors in the documentation. Figure C.1 has been
prepared to help the reviewer understand how the checklists in this Annex may be used. There is no Code
requirement for a checklist. However, Code users and reviewers must make certain that every variable as specified in
QW-250, by process is addressed. One method is to use the QW-250 list of variables for the process. This method is
flawed in that the supplementary essential variables may distract the Code user and/or the reviewer and there are
other Code requirements which are not on the QW-250 lists.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure C.3 is a sample checklist, which has been prepared to demonstrate how a reviewer can use the checklists in
this chapter to evaluate the Company Inc. WPS CS-1 and PQR CS-1. The following text will identify a marker, a
number in a circle such as
which may be found on the sample WPS CS-1 (Figure C.1), on the sample PQR
(Figure C.2), and again on the sample SMAW Checklist (Figure C.4) for Company Inc. The circled number is then
described in C.4 to explain each of these entries. This circled marker number may occur in more than one place, as
necessary, to locate where a given variable or entry may be found. Each reviewer may use these checklists in any
manner to suit their needs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.3 Checklist for WPS and PQR<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure C.3 is a detailed checklist to document that the WPS and PQR have complied with all of the requirements of
Section IX and the applicable Construction Code. This checklist may be used by the Code user, the Authorized
Inspector, the review team, or any interested party.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The checklist provides a convenience and may be used or revised in any manner that helps the reviewer. Or the
checklist may not be required at all. You may have noticed that commercial airline pilots go through a checklist prior to
every flight. It is no less important to use a checklist when reviewing documents intended for pressure containing
items. The authors have found that using a checklist has helped where some details might otherwise be missed.
Code review team members have reported that checklists are invaluable for their audits and reviews.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure C.3 is derived from the actual list of variables required for the SMAW process in paragraph QW-253 of Section
IX. The checklist has been prepared for welding applications where  notch-toughness is not a requirement  of the
construction code and therefore the supplementary essential variables are not required, and are not listed on this
checklist. These checklists may be used when notch toughness applications are a requirement of the construction
code by adding the supplementary essential variables from QW-253 for the applicable process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each checklist has three additional columns: WPS, PQR, and QUAL.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>122<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_131>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING  P ROCESSES , I NSPECTION ,  AND  M ETALLURGY
123<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) The WPS column is used to document that the WPS has been properly completed and values have been
specified for all the requirements of Section IX and the construction code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) The PQR column is used to document that the PQR has been properly completed and values have been
recorded for all of the requirements of Section IX and the construction code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) The QUAL column is used to document that the values for each essential variable recorded on the PQR
properly support the specified range of variables on the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The checklist begins with the identification block, which allows the Code user to list the WPS and supporting PQR,
revision level, and date of the reviewed documents. The checklist ends with a Documentation Review Certification
that allows space for additional comments, and a space to sign and date the review and indicate whom the reviewer
is representing. Although these details are optional, they provide verifiable, documented evidence of the review of
these documents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The first five columns of Figure C.3 are similar to QW-253 (with the exception of the supplementary column). The next
three columns are titled WPS, PQR, and QUAL. The variables are listed as NE, for nonessential variables, or E for
essential variables. Additional considerations for completing these columns include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The WPS column spaces are all open, since the Code user must specify a range for all essential and nonessential
variables (see QW-200.1(b) of Section IX) on the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The PQR column spaces are only open opposite the essential variables, because the Code user need only record
the values used for all essential variables on the PQR. The spaces opposite the nonessential variables are
shaded, because the Code user is not required to document nonessential variables on the PQR.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The QUAL column spaces are open opposite the essential variables, because the QUAL column will record if the
essential variables specified on the WPS are properly supported by the value recorded on the PQR. The spaces
opposite the nonessential variables are shaded, as the QUAL column does not evaluate the qualification of
nonessential variables.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When each space under the WPS and PQR columns has proper entries, the reviewer may conclude that the WPS
and PQR are properly prepared. If either the WPS or PQR are not properly prepared, or if one or more variables are
not described or recorded, then the documents must be properly completed for each errant variable. When every
variable in both columns is acceptable (properly addressed), and each space in the QUAL column is noted OK (or a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>), the reviewer has a verifiable, documented record of the review.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nonessential variables must be evaluated against the details defined in QW-402 through QW-410. The reviewer
may list âAllâ in the space opposite QW-405.1 under the WPS space, or simply note âOKâ (or a
), in that same
space. The preferred entry is a value that will provide the most information for future reference. The reviewer may
check the type of electrodes that have been specified, conclude that both electrodes may be used in all positions, and
therefore accept all positions on the WPS for this variable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Verifying some of the entries may be difficult. For example, QW-402.4 and QW-402.11 may both be covered by a
single entry such as âno backing.â QW-403.7 and QW-403.8 both address base metal thickness. A single entry in the
WPS column, such as  1 / 16  in. (1.5 mm) through  3 / 4  in. (19 mm) can cover both variables, or the reviewer could note
opposite QW-403.7 that the variable was not applicable for this application, since QW-403.7 only applies when the
PQR test coupon thickness is 1 1 / 2  in. (38 mm) or greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>QW-403.11 and QW-403.13 may also be satisfied with a single entry, such as P-Number 1 to P-Number 1, or the
reviewer could note that QW-403.13 is not applicable since it only applies to welding procedure specifications using
P-Numbers 5, 9, or 10 base metals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The checklist covers some requirements that are not variables. One such requirement is QW-401, which clearly
states that each essential variable has been listed in QW-250 for each specific process. The paragraph ends by
stating, âA change in a process is an essential variable change.â As such, these checklists provide a space to
document the type of process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>QW-202.2 has some special rules for fillet welds and partial penetration groove welds, so it is important to document
that all these rules have been properly applied to the WPS and PQR. This is a good reminder to document the rules
of QW-202.2, QW-202.3, and QW-202.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>QW-200.4 has some special requirements for combination WPSs. Section IX has referred to a change in a
âprocedureâ (non-standard term) as any change in an essential variable. This is a good reminder to document the
rules of QW-200.4 if the Code user has a combination procedure (WPS).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.4 Completed WPS and PQR Checklist<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure C.4 is a completed checklist, which has been prepared to demonstrate how a reviewer can use the checklists
in Figure C.3 to evaluate the Company Inc. WPS CS-1 and PQR CS-1. The following text will identify a marker, a
number in a circle such as
,  which may be found on the completed SMAW Checklist for Company Inc. Section C.4
is a narrative that contains explanations for each marker shown in Figure C.2. This circled marker number may occur
in more than one place, as necessary, to locate where a given variable or entry may be found. Each reviewer may use
these checklists in any manner to suit their needs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the reviewer has verified that both documents are properly prepared, the checklist may be used to document if
each essential variable recorded on the PQR supports the range specified on the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure C.1 (WPS CS-1) and Figure C.2 (PQR CS-1) are sample forms QW-482 and QW-483 respectively found in
ASME Section IX, non-mandatory Annex B. These forms are typical of limited information, typed into the proper
space on the forms and are intended to provide examples typical of the documentation reviewers are likely to
encounter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A Code user may also review the WPS CS-1 or PQR CS-1 for a specific entry, for example, PWHT on WPS CS-1.
The Code user would find PWHT on WPS CS-1 (page 2) and markers
,
at that entry. The Code user may then
find
and
on the checklist (Figure C.4) under the WPS column and find âNA
â, indicating that the entry on
WPS CS-1, at the PWHT box, which was âNA,â may not be an appropriate entry as indicated by the  â
.â The Code
user may then look for the markers
,
in C.5 to review the explanation of how to handle that specific entry. This
may help the Code user who may only need a few pointers in a specific area. This exercise is not intended, however,
to encourage the Code user to simply fill in the forms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the full checklist (Figure C.4) uses all the markers
through
, the reviewer may discover something about
the welding documentation. But equally important, the reviewer may see many blank areas on the WPS or PQR that
have not been addressed. If it is not on the checklist, the variable or entry may apply to another process or
application. For example, there are no electrical nor technique variables (QW-409 and QW-410, respectively) listed
on the PQR. Did the checklist miss these variables? No, there are no essential variables for the SMAW process in
either the QW-409 or QW-410 variables. But the sample forms in Section IX, Nonmandatory Annex B have spaces for
all variables for four processes (specifically SMAW, GMAW, GTAW and SAW), which will result in blank spaces even
when all the variables for a specific process have been addressed. The checklist can be used to assure the reviewer
that the documentation under review has had every required variable addressed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.5 Checklist Narrative<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A reviewer may start with the identification block at the top of both pages of Figure C.4 (completed SMAW checklist)
to provide a record of the exact documentation being reviewed. A review of the values specified or recorded at each
marker is discussed below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following notes are referenced to the marker (bracketed) numbers on the sample documentation of Figure C.1
and Figure C.2. These same marker numbers are referenced on the sample checklist for convenience in locating
each area where the apparent non-conformity appeared in the WPS and PQR.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.5.2 WPS Audit Checklist<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On WPS CS-1 (Figure C.1), Company Inc. listed âSingle V, double V, J & Uâ grooves to meet the requirements of
QW-402.1. In Figure C.4, the reviewer listed V, X, J, and U as a key to what was on the WPS. QW-402.1 deals with
type of joint and, in the reviewerâs opinion, this entry addressed the groove design as required by QW-402.1. The
reviewer also believed the entry was proper and adequate. The reviewer then affixed a
, indicating that an entry
had been made which addressed QW-402.1, and that the entry was do-able, and conformed to the requirements of
the Code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The subject of variable QW-402.4 is backing. The WPS specified âYes and No,â which the reviewer accepted as
addressing QW-402.4. The reviewer therefore noted âyes and noâ in the WPS column and a
, indicating the
variable had been addressed, and the entry was acceptable. The Code user specified, âweld metalâ as the backing
material (type). This is not a required entry, as the E6010 is obviously the backing for the subsequent E7018 layers.
But it is always acceptable, and often prudent to add information beyond that required by the Code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reviewer could not find an entry that addressed QW-402.10, so therefore noted ânot specifiedâ in the WPS
column and a
, indicating the WPS is not complete. A range of root spacing must be specified on the WPS in order
to properly complete the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Since neither backing type (retainer) was specified, neither nonmetallic nor nonfusing backing types (retainers) may be
used unless the WPS is revised to include one or more of these backing types. This entry in the WPS column received a
of
approval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reviewer read QW-403.7 and found this variable applied only when the PQR test coupon was 1 1 / 2  in. (38
mm) thick or thicker. A quick check of PQR CS-1 revealed a  3 / 8  in. (10 mm) PQR test coupon was used, and therefore
QW-403.7 was not applicable for these documents. The reviewer noted not applicable in the WPS column and
crosshatched the spaces under PQR & QUAL on that line, since the variable was not applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The reviewer noted  1 / 16  in. to  3 / 4  in. (1.5 mm to 19 mm) in the WPS column and a
of approval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reviewer noted the thickness of each pass was ânot specified

CS-1 into conformance with Section IX.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The reviewer should continue through each variable on the list, regardless if it is an essential or a nonessential variable,
simply reviewing the subject of each variable and making certain an appropriate value for each variable was recorded on the WPS.
It will be after the WPS and the PQR are both validated as complete, that the PQR will then be evaluated to determine if the values
specified on the WPS are supported by the values recorded on the PQR.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P-No. 1 to P-No. 1.
This is an acceptable entry for the P-Number.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Not applicable. Marker
indicates this WPS covers P-No. 1 and, therefore, QW-403.13, which only deals with
P-Numbers 5, 9, and 10, is not applicable. The reviewer so noted âNot applicableâ in the WPS column and
crosshatched the spaces under PQR & QUAL on that line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-Number 3.
This is an acceptable entry for the F-Number.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-Number 2
/
. The Code user specified an A-Number 2 analysis. This entry gets a
, because the Code
user specified an A-Number analysis on the WPS, which meets the requirements of QW-404.5. The
,
however, is caused by the fact that the reviewer cannot assess the A-Number of the E7010, since there is no such
AWS classification as detailed in marker
. Without a classification, and with no other basis for the A-Number
documented, it is not possible to establish an A-Number 2 analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 / 32  in. to  5 / 32  in. (2.5 mm to 4 mm)
. This is an acceptable entry for the filler metal diameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 / 4  in. (19 mm) max.
. This is an acceptable entry for the maximum weld metal thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A5.1 E7010
/
. The WPS specified an ASME SFA-5.1 specification, AWS E7010 classification, which
meets the requirement of QW-404.33 for specifying the electrode classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The entry at
, however, has two errors in that ASME SFA-5.1 does not have an E7010 classification. ASME SFA-5.5
does cover the E70XX class of filler metals, but in this example, the E7010 is not an AWS classification without the full mandatory
classification designator of -A1. The proper description is AWS Specification A5.5, AWS Classification E7010-A1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All
. This is an acceptable entry, indicating the WPS is acceptable for âallâ positions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Up and down were both checked

<<PARAGRAPH>>Not Specified

<<PARAGRAPH>>and
NA
.  There are times when NA is appropriate, as in markers
and
.  But there are times when NA
is not acceptable. In the instance of QW-407.1, an essential variable, the Code requires the WPS to specify which of
the conditions of PWHT are acceptable for use with the WPS. To indicate NA for an essential variable is a red flag for
inspection authorities. Most of the time the Code user intends the NA to indicate that the WPS is not qualified for use
with a PWHT applied. When a Code user has used NA on a series of WPSs intending it to mean âNot Appliedâ or
ânone applied,â the Code user may add a note indicating that when NA is noted in the PWHT space, it is intended to
mean âNot Applied.â This may be a better choice than revising a series of WPSs and PQRs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>DC reverse

<<PARAGRAPH>>An amperage range is specified in the WPS for each electrode diameter.
Code userâs may specify a large
range of amperage to cover a large number of filler metal diameters. An Inspection Authority may ask the Code user
to demonstrate the full range of amperage listed on the WPS for the smallest filler metal diameter specified. This
demonstration may require a revision to the amperage range for each filler metal size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>String/Weave
. It is acceptable for normal applications to specify either string bead or weave bead or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Not specified
. In addition to Section IX, ASME Section VIII has rules for cleaning (UW-32). What better way
than to specify the construction code rules on the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Air-arc and/or grind
.  It is acceptable for normal applications to allow either, or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Not specified
. QW-410.9 was originally assigned as a nonessential variable then was removed for a period of
time. The 2001 Edition of Section IX reassigned QW-410.9 as a nonessential variable. The checklist has added a
space to verify that this variable has been addressed on the WPS. That is why the numbering system is out of order.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1  This example of a nonessential variable being removed from Section IX, and then returned, is a strong reason why a
Code user should review all changes to Section IX as they are published. We strongly recommend that all documentation be
updated to meet all changes to Section IX. It is easy to say, âChanges are not required to be amended as noted in QW-100.3.â
However, future problems may well be mitigated when these documents are amended to meet new requirements as they are
published.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2  QW-410.9 was also added as a supplementary essential variable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Manual

<<PARAGRAPH>>Not specified
.  Section IX requires the addition or deletion of peening to be specified on the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   In addition to Section IX, ASME Section VIII has rules for peening (UW-39) which has some technical considerations,
including PWHT considerations. Section VIII, UW-39, does not permit peening on the first or last pass unless the weld will be
subjected to a PWHT. This sample WPS should restrict peening on the first or last pass, if the welding application is to be used on
a Section VIII Code Stamped item.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>â
The â in the WPS column, page 2 of 2 indicates that a welding process was specified, as required by QW-
401, which states, in part, that a change in process is an essential variable. The reviewer also inserted a
,
indicating that the process specified was proper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>â
In the WPS column, page 2 of 2 (QW-403, page 1 of WPS #CS-1) indicates the rules of QW-202.2(a) have
been met in that the WPS specified groove welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The WPS did not indicate anything for fillet welds. A groove welded PQR supports all fillet welds, but the WPS must
specify it is applicable for fillet welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Q W-202.3 allows repairs and buildup, but there was no special mention of such on the WPS. This does not mean
that the WPS may not be used for repairs and buildup, but rather that no special provisions were made for QW-202.3;
hence, the crosshatch in the WPS column indicating no comment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>QW-202.4 has special allowances for dissimilar base metal thicknesses, but this WPS is not eligible for any of
those special provisions; hence, the crosshatch indicating not applicable in the WPS column.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>QW-200.4 has special rules for combination of procedures. In the description column, the reviewer noted that this
WPS could take advantage of QW-200.4(a), but not QW-200.4(b).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reviewer notes on the bottom of page 2 of 2 of the checklist that there are several items that must be resolved
before WPS CS-1 may be accepted. For the purpose of this guide, however, the reviewer will now begin the review of
PQR CS-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3 / 8  in. (10 mm)
.  Indicates the thickness of the base metal test coupon  T c  has been recorded on PQR CS-1
( Figure C-2 ). It is tempting at this point to begin comparing the PQR to the WPS, but this is not the time. The reviewer
should verify that the PQR has properly addressed each essential variable, before determining if some parts of the
PQR support some parts of the WPS. In the end, there is so much interaction between the variables, that both
documents must be properly and completely prepared before any comparison may be meaningfully conducted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>><  1 / 2  in. (13 mm)
.  QW-403.9 requires the PQR to note if any single passes were greater than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm)
in weld metal thickness. When the PQR test coupon is only  3 / 8  in. (10 mm), it is obvious that no single pass was
greater than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm), thus the <  1 / 2  in. (13 mm) gets a
. There is no need to note specifically the variable
and that no passes >  1 / 2  in. (13 mm), until the PQR test coupon exceeds  1 / 2  in. (13 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P-Number 4
.  ASME SA-335, Grade P11 has been verified as a P-Number 4 base metal (QW/QB-422) and P-
Number 4 was recorded per QW-403.11. The PQR test coupon (ASME SA-335, Grade P 11) is a P-Number 4,
despite the confusing Grade P11 on the end of the specification. The ASTM A 335 Grade P11 designation identifies
the base metal as a 1 1 / 4 Cr- 1 / 2 Mo base metal, which has been assigned to the ASME Section IX, P-Number 4 base
metal grouping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>CautionâIt is easy to confuse an ASTM Grade PXX number with the ASME P-Numbers. This example should
remind the Code user to use full descriptions of all materials carefully.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Not Applicable. (QW-403.13 covers P-Numbers 5, 9, and 10 only). The reviewer crosshatched the spaces under
PQR & QUAL on that line, since the variable was not applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F-Number 4
.  This is an acceptable entry for the filler metal F-Number used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-Number 2
/
.  The
is because an A-Number was recorded. The
is because the A-Number 2 is an
error. The PQR listed an E7018 filler metal. Based on QW-442, in order to have an A-Number 2 analysis, the
electrode must have a deposit with 0.4 % to 0.65 % Mo. In ASME SFA-5.1, AWS A5.1 E7018 must be produced with
a guaranteed analysis of 0.30 % Mo. maximum, therefore, it is not possible for an E7018 classified filler metal to have
an A-Number 2 analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3 / 8  in. (10 mm)
. This is an acceptable method of recording the thickness of the test coupon for a single
process PQR.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Filler Metals (QW-404) has a space specifically for weld metal thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>200 Â°F (95 Â°C)
. This is an acceptable method of recording the minimum preheat temperature applied on the
PQR.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The WPS may specify an âincreaseâ in preheat temperature that is much warmer than that which was recorded on the
PQR. The âminimumâ preheat, however, must be limited to a value not âlessâ than â100 Â°F (â56 Â°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1150 Â°F (620 Â°C) Â± 50 Â°F (â28 Â°C)
. This is an acceptable method of specifying the actual PWHT temperature
used. QW-407.1(a)(2) specifies the condition; âPWHT below the lower transformation temperature.â This condition
can be determined from the actual recorded condition of 1150 Â°F (620 Â°C) Â± 50 Â°F (â28 Â°C). The Code user must go
beyond Section IX to evaluate the PWHT conditions of QW-407. There is no guidance in Section IX for determining
these PWHT conditions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The PQR
indicated the PWHT was conducted; âbelow the lower transformation temperature.â This gives the
reviewer confidence that QW-407.4 has been addressed, since QW-407.4 only applies to applications when a PWHT
has been applied; âabove the upper transformation temperature.â Listing one of the actual PWHT conditions of QW-
407.1 is an excellent method of addressing the PWHT essential variables.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>?
QW-202.2(a) requires a groove welded PQR test coupon to support full penetration groove welds, but PQR
CS-1 did not indicate by sketch, symbol, or words if the test coupon was a groove butt weld, fillet weld, or other,
therefore the â?â. However, a review of the tension test data would indicate that butt welded tensile specimens were
tested, indicating that a groove welded PQR test coupon was used. The Code user should avoid the questions by
describing the PQR test coupon in more detail, for an example, see sample PQR #Q134, by bill of material, sketch,
and etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

based on the assumption from that
a groove weld test coupon was used. The
Code user should avoid such questions by indicating on the PQR that the test coupon was groove welded. See QW-
202.3, QW-202.4, and QW-200.4
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two side bends
.  QW-451.1 requires four bend test specimens for the qualification of a groove welded PQR
test coupon. Therefore, this PQR is not properly qualified.
.  If the test coupon is still properly identified, and there is
sufficient material to perform the remaining two bend tests, then the Code user can process the additional two bend
test specimens, completing this requirement of the PQR. (For the purpose of this example, we will assume this will be
done, so we may proceed with the evaluation).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Results
/
.  The two bend specimen test results were acceptable
. One bend specimen had an opening
of  3 / 32  in. (2.5 mm), which meets the requirements of QW-163. But there were only two bend specimens instead of
the required four
.  See marker
.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>/
Two transverse tension tests were conducted as required by QW-451
.  The two tensile specimens
measured approximately  3 / 4  in. (19 mm) by  3 / 4  in. (19 mm)!
The PQR test specimen sizes should lead the
reviewer to believe that there has been a mix-up. PQR CS-1 reported a test coupon base metal thickness (T c ) of  3 / 8
in. (10 mm)
PQR CS-1 reported a 6 in. (150 mm) diameter for ASME SA-335 (seamless pipe). An XX-Strong NPS
6 could be 0.864 in. (22 mm) nominal wall, which could have produced finished tensile specimens of  3 / 4  in. (19 mm)
thickness.
/
. ? What a mystery. Was there a mistake in reporting the thickness of the PQR test coupon, or was
the mistake a mix up of test coupons? There are no redeeming clues or artifacts on the documentation available to
resolve this mystery, but the PQR certainly is invalid until the mystery is resolved.
These details will make an
interesting entry on the non-conformity report. Code users should make certain they do not create mysteries when
they ârecordâ what happened during the welding and subsequent examination of a PQR test coupon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The PQR test coupon material, ASME SA-335 Grade P11, per QW/QB-422, has a minimum specified tensile
strength of 60,000 psi [(60 ksi) 415 MPa]. The test results of 72,325 psi (499 MPa) and 74,650 psi (515 MPa) both
exceed the 60,000 psi (415 MPa) minimum specified tensile strength required by QW-153.1(a).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>? There is no documentation as to how the A-No. 2 at marker
was selected. There are no Code rules that
require documentation for the basis of determining the A-Number. The error noted at marker
,  however, supports
our recommendation that a Code user should record the basis used to determine the A-Number. Errors may be
prevented if a Code user makes an effort to record the basis for determining the A-Number. When a chemical
analysis is taken of the PQR test coupon to verify the âAâ number per QW-404.5(a), it would be reported on the
deposit analysis line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>There is a space on the WPS form to list the WPS which was followed when welding the PQR test coupon.
There are no written rules in Section IX which mandate this requirement. There was no entry at marker
,  but this is
a
since it is not a requirement to record the WPS that was followed. The entry is actually a holdover from previous
editions of the Code that required the WPS to be recorded. The rule was removed, but the QW-483 form was not
changed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are no rules which require the Type of Failure & Location to be recorded on a PQR. This is a holdover
from previous editions of the Code. However, there is one circumstance where the Code user would want to record
the Location of the Failure. QW-153.1(d) has a special allowance for the circumstance when a tensile test specimen
breaks in the base metal outside of the weld or fusion line. The test should be accepted as meeting the requirements,
provided the strength is not more than 5 % below the minimum specified tensile strength of the base metal. It would
be prudent for the Code user to record at least the location of the failure for the circumstance when the PQR failed
below, but not more than 5 % below the specified tensile strength, and the break was in the base metal. This would
document the evidence for the Code user to take advantage of the provisions of QW-153.1(d).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.5.4 PQR Supporting the WPS Qualification Audit<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reviewer has many comments on Figure C.4, page 2 of 2, at the reviewer comments line, noting items that must
be resolved before PQR CS-1 may be accepted. For the purpose of this guide, however, the reviewer will now begin
the review to document if the values recorded on PQR CS-1 (Figure C.2) adequately support the values specified on
WPS CS-1 (Figure C.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this exercise, the Code reviewer takes one variable at a time, evaluates the PQR value against the WPS value and
notes, in the QUAL column, if the PQR supports the WPS
or does not support the WPS
. The big picture must
finally be reviewed to make certain the total range of variables is compatible. As we will see in this exercise, several
PQR variables, on their own merit, do support the WPS variables. But taken as a whole, one may cancel out the
other. For example, see the  3 / 8  in. (10 mm) thick PQR test coupon  T c  at marker
, which properly supports the  1 / 16
in. (1.5 mm) through  3 / 4  in. (19 mm) WPS base metal thickness  T b  range
. But the PQR test coupon at marker
was a P-Number 4 while the WPS base metal at marker
is a P-Number 1, which invalidates PQR CS-1, for the
purpose of supporting WPS CS-1. We know this to be a fact of the Code, but for the purpose of this exercise, each
variable will be evaluated on its own merit, with numerous examples of PQR CS-1 values that do not support the
WPS CS-1 values, which will be noted in the Documentation Review Certification in Figure C.4, page 2 of 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The first essential variable on the checklist, QW-403.7, was properly declared not applicable, and the space on
that line under QUAL was crosshatched, and does not need further evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
.  The PQR test coupon thickness (reported herein),  T c  of  3 / 8  in. (10 mm), qualifies the WPS for a base
metal thickness range  T b  of  1 / 16  in. (1.5 mm) through  3 / 4  in. (19 mm) per QW-451.1. The QUAL column gets a
indicating the PQR value supports the WPS value, one on one. In the end, all other essential variables must also be
compatible in order to gain full PQR support for a WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
. The PQR single pass thickness (reported herein), was less than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm) [based on  3 / 8  in. (10 mm)
T c ], and therefore supports weld passes less than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm). We must list a
in the QUAL column, however,
because the WPS did not specify if single passes are limited to less than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm), or if single passes may
exceed  1 / 2  in. (13 mm). Specifying the single pass weld thickness range is important because, if WPS CS-1 is
corrected to specify no single pass greater than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm) weld metal, then PQR CS-1 will support the  1 / 16  in.
(1.5 mm) through  3 / 4  in. (19 mm) base metal thickness range  T b . However, if WPS CS-1 is corrected to specify that
single weld passes may be greater than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm), then the WPS maximum base metal thickness range
supported by the PQR is restricted to a range of 1.1 times the PQR test coupon thickness, or 1.1 x 0.375 in. (9.5 mm)
= 0.4125 in. (10.5 mm) maximum base metal thickness. QWâ403.9 has a double edge sword. If the PQR records
single passes greater than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm), the WPS base metal thickness range  T b  is restricted to 1.1 x  T c . In the
second example, as described herein, when the WPS specifies single weld passes greater than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm), the
WPS must take a base metal thickness range  T b  restriction of 1.1( T c ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>and
The PQR value of P-Number 4, does not support the WPS value of P-Number 1. QW-424 allows a P-
Number 4 PQR test coupon  T c  to support a WPS for welding P-Number 4 to P-Number 4 and P-Number 4 to P-
Number 1, but does not allow for the welding of P-Number 1 to P-Number 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
QW-403.13 is not applicable since P-Numbers 5, 9, and 10 are not specified on either the WPS or the
PQR. Therefore, this variable gets a
indicating the variable has been reviewed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
F-Number 4 does not support an F-Number 3 per QW-404.4.
The F-Number 4 supporting the F-
Number 3 filler metal frequently confuses Code users who may be thinking in terms of QW-433, which applies only to
the qualification of a welder performance (WPQ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
? An A-Number 2 will support an A-Number 1 per QW-404.5.
The WPS must be corrected, however,
before any evaluation may be made.
The PQR using the E7018, corrected to an A-Number 1 filler metal, would
support the WPS using the corrected E7010-A1, for the A-Number variable, QW-404.5, second sentence, which
states, âQualification with an A-Number 1 will qualify for an A-Number 2 and vice versa.â<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The Code user, however, must be aware of markers
and
, which does not allow the E7018 (F-Number 4) filler
metal, to qualify for the E7010-A1 (F-Number 3), because of the F-Number variable QW-404.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
The  3 / 8  in. (10 mm) PQR test coupon  t c  will support a WPS thickness range  t d  of  3 / 4  in. (19 mm)
maximum.
However, the P-Number, F-Number, and other non-conformities will wipe the smile off that face when
combined with the weld thickness  t d .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
The 200 Â°F (95 Â°C) preheat recorded on the PQR will not support the 50 Â°F (10 Â°C) preheat minimum,
specified on the WPS.
QW-406.1 allows a reduction in the preheat temperature of not more than â100 Â°F
(â56 Â°C) from the preheat temperature recorded on the PQR.
A new PQR is needed to support the 50 Â°F (10 Â°C)
minimum preheat of the WPS, or the WPS must be revised or rewritten to specify a preheat of at least 100 Â°F (38 Â°C)
minimum or warmer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
The PQR test coupon, which was subjected to a PWHT below the lower transformation temperature at
1150 Â°F (620 Â°C) Â± 50 Â°F (Â± 28 Â°C), will not support the WPS without PWHT.
QW-407.1 requires a PQR without
PWHT to support a WPS without a PWHT. Also, the preferred PWHT temperature is at least 1200 Â°F (required by
ASME B31.3).
The Code user may also revise WPS number CS-1 (Figure C-1) to indicate that the WPS is
acceptable for use with a PWHT applied below the lower transformation temperature, which may be prudent, given
the base metals involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
QW-407.4 is not applicable
,  since it is for applications above the upper transformation temperature,
wh ere the PQR CS-1 stated âbelow the lower transformation temperature.â<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
The SMAW process was used in the PQR and was specified in the WPS.
,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
Weld groove design is a nonessential variable per QW-402.1. But QW-202.2(a) requires groove welded
PQRs to support the groove welds of the WPS. For the purpose of this example, assume that the tension test data of
marker
verified that the PQR test coupon was groove welded. Therefore there is a
in the QUAL column
because the groove welded PQR does support a groove welded WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
The PQR will support the WPS if it specifies repairs or buildup.
However the WPS must address QW-
202.3 if it is to be used for repairs or buildup.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and
The PQR will not support the WPS for dissimilar base metal thicknesses beyond the  1 / 16  in. (1.5 mm)
through  3 / 4  in. (19 mm) range specified on the WPS.
The dissimilar base metal thickness rule of QW-202.4
applies only when the PQR test coupon is 1 1 / 2  in. (38 mm) thick, or thicker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>and
The PQR will support the WPS for combination procedure WPSs, but only within the QW-200.4(a) range.

<<HEADING level=3>>C.5.5 Documentation Review Certification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reviewer summarized all findings in the Documentation Review Certification Block, making notes for each non-
conformity found, for future reference. There are just too many interdependent complications to try to remember the
details of each non-conformity. The reviewer listed each item that had to be resolved on the WPS and PQR, and listed
the essential variables recorded on the PQR that did not support the ranges specified on the WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There were numerous blank spaces on PQR #CS-1 (Figure C.2) which were not addressed. Specifically, on page 1 of
2, WPS Number, Size of Filler Metal, Electrical Characteristics (QW-409), Interpass Temperature, Technique (QW-
410) and other spaces were left blank. The rules of Section IX do not require these variables to be recorded on the
PQR. However, any additional details added to the PQR may prove to be an invaluable resource for future use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reviewer should then certify the checklist, noting every non-conformity. The final space should specify who the
