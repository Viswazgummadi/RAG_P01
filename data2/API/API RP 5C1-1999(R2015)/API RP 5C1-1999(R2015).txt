<<PARAGRAPH>>API publications necessarily address problems of a general nature. With respect to partic-
ular circumstances, local, state, and federal laws and regulations should be reviewed.
API is not undertaking to meet the duties of employers, manufacturers, or suppliers to
warn and properly train and equip their employees, and others exposed, concerning health
and safety risks and precautions, nor undertaking their obligations under local, state, or fed-
eral laws.
Information concerning safety and health risks and proper precautions with respect to par-
ticular materials and conditions should be obtained from the employer, the manufacturer or
supplier of that material, or the material safety data sheet.
Nothing contained in any API publication is to be construed as granting any right, by
implication or otherwise, for the manufacture, sale, or use of any method, apparatus, or prod-
uct covered by letters patent. Neither should anything contained in the publication be con-
strued as insuring anyone against liability for infringement of letters patent.
Generally, API standards are reviewed and revised, reafﬁrmed, or withdrawn at least every
ﬁve years. Sometimes a one-time extension of up to two years will be added to this review
cycle. This publication will no longer be in effect ﬁve years after its publication date as an
operative API standard or, where an extension has been granted, upon republication. Status

<<PARAGRAPH>>It is suggested that the selection of a thread compound
for casing and tubing be given careful consideration by the
user, bearing in mind that a satisfactory compound should
possess certain properties, the major of which are (a) to lubri-
cate the thread surfaces to facilitate joint makeup and break-
out without galling, and (b) to seal voids between the mating
thread surfaces and effectively prevent leakage. Compounds
that have given outstanding service for casing and tubing
under both laboratory and ﬁeld conditions are described in
the latest edition of API Bulletin 5A2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>casing is being run. In view of this practice, it is suggested
that the individual user:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Immediately before running, remove thread protectors
from both ﬁeld and coupling ends and clean the threads thor-
oughly, repeating as additional rows become uncovered.
b. Carefully inspect the threads. Those found damaged, even
slightly, should be laid aside unless satisfactory means are
available for correcting thread damage.
c. The length of each piece of casing shall be measured prior
to running. A steel tape calibrated in decimal feet (millime-
ters) to the nearest 0.01 feet (millimeters) should be used. The
measurement should be made from the outermost face of the
coupling or box to the position on the externally threaded end
where the coupling or the box stops when the joint is made up
power tight. On round-thread joints, this position is to the
plane of the vanish point on the pipe; on buttress-thread cas-
ing, this position is to the base of the triangle stamp on the
pipe; and on extreme line casing, this position is to the shoul-
der on the externally threaded end. The total of the individual
lengths so measured will represent the unloaded length of the
casing string. The actual length under tension in the hole can
be obtained by consulting graphs that are prepared for this
purpose and are available in most pipe handbooks.
d. Check each coupling for makeup. If the standoff is abnor-
mally great, check the coupling for tightness. Tighten any
loose couplings after thoroughly cleaning the threads and
applying fresh compound over entire thread surfaces, and
before pulling the pipe into the derrick.
e. Before stabbing, liberally apply thread compound to the
entire internally and externally threaded areas. It is recom-
mended that a thread compound that meets the performance
objectives of API Bulletin 5A2 be used; however, in special
cases where severe conditions are encountered, it is recom-
mended that high-pressure silicone thread compounds as
speciﬁed in API Bulletin 5A2 be used.
f. Place a clean thread protector on the ﬁeld end of the pipe
so that the thread will not be damaged while rolling pipe on
the rack and pulling into the derrick. Several thread protectors
may be cleaned and used repeatedly for this operation.
g. If a mixed string is to be run, check to determine that
appropriate casing will be accessible on the pipe rack when
required according to program.
h. Connectors used as tensile and lifting members should
have their thread capacity carefully checked to ensure that the
connector can safely support the load.
i. Care should be taken when making up pup joints and con-
nectors to ensure that the mating threads are of the same size
and type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Familiarize himself with inspection practices speciﬁed in
the standards and employed by the respective mills, and with
the deﬁnition of “injurious defect” contained in the standards.
b. Thoroughly evaluate any nondestructive inspection to be
used by him on API tubular goods to assure himself that the
inspection does in fact correctly locate and differentiate inju-
rious defects from other variables that can be and frequently
are sources of misleading “defect” signals with such inspec-
tion methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All casing, whether new, used, or reconditioned,
should always be handled with thread protectors in place.
Casing should be handled at all times on racks or on wooden
or metal surfaces free of rocks, sand, or dirt other than normal
drilling mud. When lengths of casing are inadvertently
dragged in the dirt, the threads should be recleaned and ser-
viced again as outlined in 4.1.7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Slip elevators are recommended for long strings.
Both spider and elevator slips should be clean and sharp and
should ﬁt properly. Slips should be extra long for heavy cas-
ing strings. The spider must be level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note: Slip and tong marks are injurious. Every possible effort should
be made to keep such damage at a minimum by using proper up-to-
date equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If collar-pull elevators are used, the bearing surface
should be carefully inspected for (a) uneven wear that may
produce a side lift on the coupling with danger of jumping it
off, and (b) uniform distribution of the load when applied
over the bearing face of the coupling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spider and elevator slips should be examined and
watched to see that all lower together. If they lower unevenly,
there is danger of denting the pipe or badly slip-cutting it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.6<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care shall be exercised, particularly when running
long casing strings, to ensure that the slip bushing or bowl is
in good condition. Tongs may be sized to produce 1.5 percent
of the calculated pullout strength (API Bulletin 5C3) with
units changed to ft-lb (N • m) (150 percent of the guideline
torque found in Table 1). Tongs should be examined for wear
on hinge pins and hinge surfaces. The backup line attachment
to the backup post should be corrected, if necessary, to be
level with the tong in the backup position so as to avoid
uneven load distribution on the gripping surfaces of the cas-
ing. The length of the backup line should be such as to cause
minimum bending stresses on the casing and to allow full
stroke movement of the makeup tong.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2
DRIFTING OF CASING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recommended that each length of casing be
drifted for its entire length just before running, with mandrels
conforming to API Speciﬁcation 5CT. Casing that will not
pass the drill test should be laid aside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.7<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following precautions should be taken in the
preparation of casing threads for makeup in the casing strings:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Lower or roll each piece of casing carefully to the
walk without dropping. Use rope snubber if necessary. Avoid
hitting casing against any part of derrick or other equipment.
Provide a hold-back rope at window. For mixed or unmarked
strings, a drift or “jack rabbit” should be run through each
length of casing when it is picked up from the catwalk and
pulled onto the derrick ﬂoor to avoid running a heavier length

<<PARAGRAPH>>in torque requirements that can exist for a speciﬁc connection.
Because of this, it is essential that torque be related to made-
up position as outlined in 4.4.1. The torque values listed in
Table 1 apply to casing with zinc-plated or phosphate-coated
couplings. When making up connections with tin-plated cou-
plings, 80 percent of the listed value can be used as a guide.
The listed torque values are not applicable for making up cou-
plings with PTFE (polytetraﬂuoroethylene) rings. When mak-
ing up round thread connections with PTFE rings, 70 percent
of the listed values are recommended. Buttress connections
with PTFE seal rings may make up at torque values different
from those normally observed on standard buttress threads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Do not remove thread protector from ﬁeld end of cas-
ing until ready to stab.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note: Thread galling of gall-prone materials (martensitic chromium
steels, 9 Cr and 13 Cr) occurs during movement—stabbing or pull-
ing and makeup or breakout. Galling resistance of threads is prima-
rily controlled in two areas—surface preparation and ﬁnishing
during manufacture and careful handling practices during running
and pulling. Threads and lubricant must be clean. Assembly in the
horizontal position should be avoided. Connections should be turned
by hand to the hand-tight position before slowly power tightening.
The procedure should be reversed for disassembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If necessary, apply thread compound over the entire
surface of threads just before stabbing. The brush or utensil
used in applying thread compound should be kept free of for-
eign matter, and the compound should never be thinned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In stabbing, lower casing carefully to avoid injuring
threads. Stab vertically, preferably with the assistance of a
man on the stabbing board. If the casing stand tilts to one side
after stabbing, lift up, clean, and correct any damaged thread
with a three-cornered ﬁle, then carefully remove any ﬁlings
and reapply compound over the thread surface. After stabbing,
the casing should be rotated very slowly at ﬁrst to ensure that
threads are engaging properly and not cross-threading. If spin-
ning line is used, it should pull close to the coupling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

FIELD MAKEUP<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following practice is recommended for ﬁeld
makeup of casing:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. For round thread, sizes 4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>.
1. It is advisable when starting to run casing from each
particular mill shipment to make up sufﬁcient joints to
determine the torque necessary to provide proper makeup.
See 4.4.2 for the proper number of turns beyond hand-tight
position. These values may indicate that a departure from
the values listed in Table 1 is advisable. If other values are
chosen, the minimum torque should be not less than 75
percent of the value selected. The maximum torque should
be not more than 125 percent of the selected torque.
2. The power tong should be provided with a reliable
torque gauge of known accuracy. In the initial stages of
makeup, any irregularities of makeup or in speed of
makeup should be observed, since these may be indicative
of crossed threads, dirty or damaged threads, or other
unfavorable conditions. To prevent galling when making
up connections in the ﬁeld, the connections should be
made up at a speed not to exceed 25 rpm.
3. Continue the makeup, observing both the torque gauge
and the approximately position of the coupling face with
respect to the thread vanish point position.
4. The torque values shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3 have
been selected to give recommended makeup under normal
conditions and should be considered as satisfactory pro-
viding the face of the coupling is ﬂush with the thread
vanish point or within two thread turns, plus or minus, of
the thread vanish point.
5. If the makeup is such that the thread vanish point is

<<PARAGRAPH>>Note: Recommendations in 4.3.4 and 4.4.1 for casing makeup apply
to the use of power tongs. For recommendations on makeup of cas-
ing with spinning lines and conventional tongs, see 4.4.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of power tongs for making up casing made
desirable the establishment of recommended torque values for
each size, weight, and grade of casing. Early studies and tests
indicated that torque values are affected by a large number of
variables, such as variations in taper, lead, thread height and
thread form, surface ﬁnish, type of thread compound, length
of thread, weight and grade of pipe, etc. In view of the number
of variables and the extent that these variables, alone or in
combination, could affect the relationship of torque values
versus made-up position, it was evident that both applied
torque and made-up position must be considered. Since the
API joint pullout strength formula in API Bulletin 5C2 con-
tains several of the variables believed to affect torque, using a
modiﬁed formula to establish torque values was investigated.
Torque values obtained by taking 1 percent of the calculated
pullout value were found to be generally comparable to values
obtained by ﬁeld makeup tests using API modiﬁed thread
compound in accordance with API Bulletin 5A2. Compounds
other than API modiﬁed thread compound may have other
torque values. This procedure was therefore used to establish
the makeup torque values listed in Table 1. All values are
rounded to the nearest 10 ft-lb (10 N • m). These values shall
be considered as a guide only, due to the very wide variations<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

as a questionable joint as provided in 4.4.3.
6. If several threads remain exposed when the listed
torque is reached, apply additional torque up to 125 per-
cent of the value shown in Table 1. If the standoff
(distance from face of coupling to the thread vanish point)
is greater than three thread turns when this additional
torque is reached, the joint should be treated as a question-
able joint as provided in 4.4.3.
b. For buttress thread casing connections in sizes 4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>spinning line, it is necessary to compare hand tightness with
spin-up tightness. In order to do this, make up the ﬁrst few
joints to the hand-tight position, then back off and spin up
joints to the spin-up tight position. Compare relative position
of these two makeups and use this information to determine
when the joint is made up the recommended number of turns
beyond hand tight.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Joints that are questionable as to their proper tight-
ness should be unscrewed and the casing laid down for
inspection and repair. When this is done, the mating coupling
should be carefully inspected for damaged threads. Parted
joints should never be reused without shopping or regauging,
even though the joints may have little appearance of damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

aid in locating the thread vanish point for basic power-tight
makeup; however, the position of the coupling with respect to
the base of the triangle shall not be a basis for acceptance or
rejection of the product. Care shall be taken to avoid cross-
threading in starting these larger connections. The tongs
selected should be capable of attaining high torques [50,000
ft-lb (67,800 N • m)] for the entire run. Anticipate that maxi-
mum torque values could be ﬁve times the minimum experi-
enced in makeup to the recommended position.
2. Joints that are questionable as to their proper makeup
in 4.4.1, item a.5 or a.6 should be unscrewed and laid
down to determine the cause of improper makeup. Both
the pipe thread and mating coupling thread should be
inspected. Damaged threads or threads that do not comply
with the speciﬁcation should be repaired. If damaged or
out-of-tolerance threads are not found to be the cause of
improper makeup, then the makeup torque should be
adjusted to obtain proper makeup (see 4.4.1, item a.1). It
should be noted that a thread compound with a coefﬁcient
of friction substantially different from common values
may be the cause of improper makeup.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Casing strings should be picked up and lowered care-
fully and care exercised in setting slips to avoid shock loads.
Dropping a string even a short distance may loosen couplings
at the bottom of the string. Care should be exercised to pre-
vent setting casing down on bottom or otherwise placing it in
compression because of the danger of buckling, particularly
in that part of the well where hole enlargement has occurred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.7<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deﬁnite instructions should be available as to the
design of the casing string, including the proper location of
the various grades of steel, weights of casing, and types of
joint. Care should be exercised to run the string in exactly the
order in which it was designed. If any length cannot be
clearly identiﬁed, it should be laid aside until its grade,
weight, or type of joint can be positively established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To facilitate running and to ensure adequate hydro-
static head to contain reservoir pressures, the casing should
be periodically ﬁlled with mud while being run. A number of
things govern the frequency with which ﬁlling should be
accomplished: weight of pipe in the hole, mud weight, reser-
voir pressure, etc. In most cases, ﬁlling every six to ten
lengths should sufﬁce. In no case should the hydrostatic bal-
ance of reservoir pressure be jeopardized by too infrequent
ﬁlling. Filling should be done with mud of the proper weight,
using a conveniently located hose of adequate size to expedite
the ﬁlling operation. A quick opening and closing plug valve<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

mud line, rather than at the outlet end of the hose. It is also
recommended that at least one other discharge connection be
left open on the mud system to prevent buildup of excessive
pressure when the quick-closing valve is closed while the
pump is still running. A copper nipple at the end of the mud
hose may be used to prevent damaging of the coupling
threads during the ﬁlling operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>When casing is being retrieved because of a casing
failure, it is imperative to future prevention of such failures
that a thorough metallurgical study be made. Every attempt
should be made to retrieve the failed portion of the “as-failed”
condition. When thorough metallurgical analysis reveals
some facet of pipe quality to be involved in the failure, the
results of the study should be reported to the API ofﬁce.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5
CASING LANDING PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deﬁnite instructions should be provided for the proper
string tension, also on the proper landing procedure after the
cement has set. The purpose is to avoid critical stresses or
excessive and unsafe tensile stresses at any time during the
life of the well. In arriving at the proper tension and landing
procedure, consideration should be given to all factors, such
as well temperature and pressure, temperature developed due
to cement hydration, mud temperature, and changes of tem-
perature during producing operations. The adequacy of the
original tension safety factor of the string as designed will
inﬂuence the landing procedure and should be considered. If,
however, after due consideration it is not considered neces-
sary to develop special landing procedure instructions (and
this probably applies to a very large majority of the wells
drilled), then the procedure should be followed of landing the
casing in the casing head at exactly the position in which it
was hanging when the cement plug reached its lowest point
or “as cemented.”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7.6<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Casing stacked in the derrick should be set on a ﬁrm

<<HEADING level=3>>4.8.7
Improper care in storage.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Breakout tongs should be positioned close to the cou-
pling but not too close since a slight squashing effect where
the tong dies contact the pipe surface cannot be avoided,
especially if the joint is tight and/or the casing is light. Keep-
ing a space of one-third to one-quarter of the diameter of the
pipe between the tong and the coupling should normally pre-
vent unnecessary friction in the threads. Hammering the cou-
pling to break the joint is an injurious practice. If tapping is
required, use the ﬂat face, never the peen face of the hammer,
and under no circumstances should a sledge hammer be used.
Tap lightly near the middle and completely around the cou-
pling, never near the end nor on opposite sides only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.8.8
Excessive torquing of casing to force it through tight
places in the hole.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.8.9
Pulling too hard on a string (to free it). This may

corrosion. On the basis of the industry’s experience to date,
the following practices and measures can be used to control
corrosion of casing:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ated holes, or occasionally in straight holes where corrective
measures are taken, result in concentrated bending of the cas-

when the doglegs are high in the hole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.8.12
Wire-line cutting, by swabbing or cable-tool drilling.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Where external casing corrosion is known to occur or stray
electrical current surveys indicate that relatively high currents
are entering the well, the following practices can be
employed:
1. Good cementing practices, including the use of central-
izers, scratchers, and adequate amounts of cement to keep
corrosive ﬂuids from contact with the outside of the casing.
2. Electrical insulation of ﬂow lines from wells by the use
of nonconducting ﬂange assemblies to reduce or prevent
electrical currents from entering the well.
3. The use of highly alkaline mud or mud treated with a
bactericide as a completion ﬂuid will help alleviate corro-
sion caused by sulfate-reducing bacteria.
4. A properly designed cathodic protection system simi-
lar to that used for line pipe, which can alleviate external
casing corrosion. Protection criteria for casing differ
somewhat from the criteria used for line pipe. Literature
on external casing corrosion or persons competent in this
ﬁeld should be consulted for proper protection criteria.
b. Where internal corrosion is known to exist, the following
practices can be employed:
1. In ﬂowing wells, packing the annulus with fresh water
or low-salinity alkaline muds. (It may be preferable in
some ﬂowing wells to depend upon inhibitors to protect
the inside of the casing and the tubing.)
2. In pumping wells, avoiding the use of casing pumps.
Ordinarily, pumping wells should be tubed as close to bot-
tom as practical, regardless of the position of the pump, to
minimize the damage to the casing from corrosive ﬂuids.
3. Using inhibitors to protect the inside of the casing
against corrosion.
c. To determine the value and effectiveness of the above
practices and measures, cost and equipment-failure records
can be compared before and after application of control mea-
sures. Inhibitor effectiveness may be checked also by means
of caliper surveys, visual examinations of readily accessible
pieces of equipment, and water analyses for iron content.
Coupons may also be helpful in determining whether sufﬁ-
cient inhibitor is being used. When lacking previous
experience with any of the above measures, they should be
used cautiously and on a limited scale until appraised for the
particular operating conditions.
d. In general, all new areas should be considered as being
potentially corrosive and investigations should be initiated
early in the life of a ﬁeld, and repeated periodically, to detect
and localize corrosion before it has done destructive damage.
These investigations should cover: (1) a complete chemical
analysis of the efﬂuent water, including pH, iron, hydrogen
sulﬁde, organic acids, and any other substances that inﬂuence<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.8.15
Leaky joints, under external or internal pressure, are
a common trouble, and may be due to the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Improper thread compound.
b. Undertonging.
c. Dirty threads.
d. Galled threads, due to dirt, careless stabbing, damaged
threads, too rapid spinning, overtonging, or wobbling during
spinning or tonging operations.
e. Improper cutting of ﬁeld-shop threads.
f. Pulling too hard on string.
g. Dropping string.
h. Excessive making and breaking.
i. Tonging too high on casing, especially on breaking out.
This gives a bending effect that tends to gall the threads.
j. Improper joint makeup at mill.
k. Casing ovality or out-of-roundness.
l. Improper landing practice, which produces stresses in the
threaded joint in excess of the yield point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8.16
Corrosion. Both the inside and outside of casing can
be damaged by corrosion, which can be recognized by the
presence of pits or holes in the pipe. Corrosion on the outside
of casing can be caused by corrosive ﬂuids or formations in
contact with the casing or by stray electric currents ﬂowing out
of the casing into the surrounding ﬂuids or formations. Severe
corrosion may also be caused by sulphate-reducing bacteria.
Corrosion damage on the inside is usually caused by corrosive
ﬂuids produced from the well, but the damage can be
increased by the abrasive effects of casing and tubing pumping
equipment and by high ﬂuid velocities such as those encoun-
tered in some gas-lifted wells. Internal corrosion might also be
due to stray electrical currents (electrolysis) or to dissimilar
metals in close contact (bimetallic galvanic corrosion).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because corrosion may result from so many different con-
ditions, no simple or universal remedy can be given for its
control. Each corrosion problem must be treated as an indi-
vidual case and a solution attempted in the light of the known
corrosion factors and operating conditions. The condition of
the casing can be determined by visual or optical-instrument
inspections. Where these are not practical, a casing-caliper
survey can be made to determine the condition of the inside
surfaces. No tools have yet been designed for determining the
condition of the outside of casing in a well. Internal casing-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

duced gas for carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulﬁde is also
desirable; (2) corrosion rate tests by using coupons of the
same materials as in the well; and (3) the use of caliper or

corrosion exist, a qualiﬁed corrosion engineer should be con-
sulted. Particular attention should be given to mitigation of
corrosion where the probable life of subsurface equipment is
less than the time expected to deplete a well.

should be drifted with an API drift mandrel to ensure passage
of pumps, swabs, and packers.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.4
Elevators should be in good repair and should have
links of equal length.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.5
Slip-type elevators are recommended when running
special clearance couplings, especially those beveled on the
lower end.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.6
Elevators should be examined to note if latch ﬁtting is
complete.<<HEADING_END>>

Spider slips that will not crush the tubing should be
used. Slips should be examined before using to see that they
are working together.<<HEADING_END>>

PREPARATION AND INSPECTION BEFORE
RUNNING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
New tubing is delivered free of injurious defects as
deﬁned in API Speciﬁcation 5CT and within the practical
limits of the inspection procedures therein prescribed. Some
users have found that, for a limited number of critical well
applications, these procedures do not result in tubing sufﬁ-
ciently free of defects to meet their needs for such critical
applications. Various nondestructive inspection services have
been employed by users to ensure that the desired quality of
tubing is being run. In view of this practice, it is suggested
that the individual user:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.8
Tubing tongs that will not crush the tubing should be
used on the body of the tubing and should ﬁt properly to
avoid unnecessary cutting of the pipe wall. Tong dies should
ﬁt properly and conform to the curvature of the tubing. The
use of pipe wrenches is not recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.9
The following precautions should be taken in the
preparation of tubing threads:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Immediately before running, remove protectors from both
ﬁeld end and coupling end and clean threads thoroughly,
repeating as additional rows become uncovered.
b. Carefully inspect the threads. Those found damaged, even
slightly, should be laid aside unless satisfactory means are
available for correcting thread damage.
c. The length of each piece of tubing shall be measured prior
to running. A steel tape calibrated in decimal feet (millimeters)
to the nearest 0.01 feet (millimeters) should be used. The mea-
surement should be made from the outermost face of the
coupling or box to the position on the externally threaded end
where the coupling or the box stops when the joint is made up
power tight. The total of the individual lengths so measured
will represent the unloaded length of the tubing string.
The actual length under tension in the hole can be obtained
by consulting graphs that are prepared for this purpose and
are available in most pipe handbooks.
d. Place clean protectors on ﬁeld end of the pipe so that
thread will not be damaged while rolling pipe onto the rack
and pulling into the derrick. Several thread protectors may be
cleaned and used repeatedly for this operation.
e. Check each coupling for makeup. If the stand-off is abnor-
mally great, check the coupling for tightness. Loose
couplings should be removed, the thread thoroughly cleaned,
fresh compound applied over the entire thread surfaces, then<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Familiarize himself with inspection practices speciﬁed in
the standards and employed by the respective manufacturers,
and with the deﬁnition of “injurious defect” contained in the
standards.
b. Thoroughly evaluate any nondestructive inspection to be
used by him on API tubular goods to assure himself that the
inspection does in fact correctly locate and differentiate inju-
rious defects from other variables that can be and frequently
are sources of misleading “defect” signals with such inspec-
tion methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CAUTION:  Due to the permissible tolerance on the outside
diameter immediately behind the tubing upset, the user is cau-
tioned that difﬁculties may occur when wrap-around seal-type
hangers are installed on tubing manufactured on the high side
of the tolerance; therefore, it is recommended that the user
select the joint of tubing to be installed at the top of the string.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
All tubing, whether new, used, or reconditioned,
should always be handled with thread protectors in place.
Tubing should be handled at all times on racks or on wooden
or metal surfaces free of rocks, sand, or dirt other than normal
drilling mud. When lengths of tubing are inadvertently<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Notes:
1. It is recommended that the makeup target be based on position, not torque. See 4.4.1 and 4.4.2.
2. Under normal circumstances, and for sizes 13 3 / 8  and smaller, variations in the listed torque values of ±25% should be
considered acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the coupling replaced and tightened before pulling the tubing
into the derrick.
f. Before stabbing, liberally apply thread compound to the
entire internally and externally threaded areas. It is recom-
mended that a thread compound that meets the performance
objectives of API Bulletin 5A2 be used; however, in special
cases where severe conditions are encountered, it is recom-
mended that high-pressure silicone thread compound as
speciﬁed in API Bulletin 5A2 be used.
g. Connectors used as tensile and lifting members should
have their thread capacity carefully checked to ensure that the
connector can safely support the load.
h. Care should be taken when making up pup joints and con-
nectors to ensure that the mating threads are of the same size
and type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>threads should have thread compound applied just before
stabbing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.11
When tubing is pulled into the derrick, care should

STABBING, MAKING UP, AND LOWERING<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1
Do not remove thread protector from ﬁeld end of tub-
ing until ready to stab.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2
If necessary, apply thread compound over entire sur-
face of threads just before stabbing. The brush or utensil used
in applying thread compound should be kept free of foreign
matter, and the compound should never be thinned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.10
For high-pressure or condensate wells, additional
precautions should be taken to ensure tight joints as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3
In stabbing, lower tubing carefully to avoid injuring
threads. Stab vertically, preferably with the assistance of a
man on the stabbing board. If the tubing tilts to one side after
stabbing, lift up, clean, and correct any damaged thread with
a three-cornered ﬁle, then carefully remove any ﬁlings and
reapply compound over the thread surface. Care should be
exercised, especially when running doubles or triples, to pre-
vent bowing and resulting errors in alignment when the tub-
ing is allowed to rest too heavily on the coupling threads.
Intermediate supports may be placed in the derrick to limit
bowing of the tubing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Couplings should be removed, and both the mill-end pipe
thread and coupling thread thoroughly cleaned and inspected.
To facilitate this operation, tubing may be ordered with cou-
plings handling tight, which is approximately one turn
beyond hand tight, or may be ordered with the couplings
shipped separately.
b. Thread compound should be applied to both the external
and internal threads, and the coupling should be reapplied
handling tight. Field-end threads and the mating coupling<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Notes:
1. The torque values listed above are recommended for use in conjunction with close visual examination to be sure the shoulder closes and to
avoid excessive bos swelling.
2. The outside shoulder is not sealing surface; serves as a stop only.
3. Torque values higher than those listed above may be considered under certain conditions, providing box swelling does not occur.
4. Increased axial tension stress due to higher torque values could be excessive for sulﬁde service.
5. If the connection does not shoulder when maximum torque is applied, it should be treated as a questionable joint as provided under 4.4.3.
6. Recommended makeup torque values for size 10 3 / 4  are not available due to lack of data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.4
After stabbing, start screwing by hand or apply regu-
lar or power tubing tongs slowly. To prevent galling when
making connections in the ﬁeld, the connections should be
made up at a speed not to exceed 25 rpm. Power tubing tongs
are recommended for high-pressure or condensate wells to
ensure uniform makeup and tight joints. Joints should be
made up tight, approximately two turns beyond the hand-tight
position, with care being taken not to gall the threads. When
the additional preparation and inspection precautions for
high-pressure or condensate wells are taken, the coupling will
“ﬂoat” or make up simultaneously at both ends until the
proper number of turns beyond the hand-tight position have
been obtained. The hand-tight position may be determined by
checking several joints on the rack and noting the number of
threads exposed when a coupling is made up with a torque of
50 ft-lb (68 N • m).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>long joint life. The use of power tongs for making up tubing
made desirable the establishment of recommended torque
values for each size, weight, and grade of tubing. Table 3 con-
tains makeup torque guidelines for nonupset, external upset,
and integral joint tubing, based on 1 percent of the calculated
joint pullout strength determined from the joint pullout
strength formula for 8-round-thread casing in API Bulletin
5C3. All values are rounded to the nearest 10 ft-lb (13.5 N •
m). The torque values listed in Table 3 apply to tubing with
zinc-plated or phosphate-coated couplings. When making up
connections with tin-plated couplings, 80 percent of the listed
value can be used as a guide. When making up round-thread
connections with PTFE (polytetraﬂuoroethylene) rings,  70
percent of the listed values are recommended. As with stan-
dard couplings, makeup positions  shall  govern. Buttress
connections with PTFE seal rings may make up at torque val-
ues different from those normally observed on standard but-
tress threads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3
FIELD MAKEUP<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note: Thread galling of gall-prone materials (martensitic chromium
steels, 9 Cr and 19 Cr) occurs during movement—stabbing or pull-
ing and makeup or breakout. Galling resistance of threads is prima-
rily controlled in two areas—surface preparation and ﬁnishing

Joint life of tubing under repeated ﬁeld makeup is
inversely proportional to the ﬁeld makeup torque applied.
Therefore, in wells where leak resistance is not a great factor,
minimum ﬁeld makeup torque values should be used to pro-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

After a hard pull to loosen a string of tubing, all
joints pulled on should be retightened.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and pulling. Threads and lubricant must be clean. Assembly in the
horizontal position should be avoided. Connections should be turned
by hand to the hand-tight position before slowly power tightening.
The procedure should be reversed for disassembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.13
All threads should be cleaned and lubricated or
should be coated with a material that will minimize corrosion.
Clean protectors should be placed on the tubing before it is
laid down.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2
Spider slips and elevators should be cleaned fre-
quently, and slips should be kept sharp.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.3
Finding bottom should be accomplished with
extreme caution. Do not set tubing down heavily.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.14
Before tubing is stored or reused, pipe and threads
should be inspected and defective joints marked for shopping
and regauging.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4
PULLING TUBING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.15
When tubing is being retrieved because of a tubing
failure, it is imperative to future prevention of such failures
that a thorough metallurgical study be made. Every attempt
should be made to retrieve the failed portion in the “as-failed”
condition. When thorough metallurgical analysis reveals
some facet of pipe quality to be involved in the failure, the
results of the study should be reported to the API ofﬁce.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.1
A caliper survey prior to pulling a worn string of tub-
ing will provide a quick means of segregating badly worn
lengths for removal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.2
Breakout tongs should be positioned close to the cou-
pling. Hammering the coupling to break the joint is an injuri-
ous practice. When tapping is required, use the ﬂat face, never
the peen face, of the hammer, and tap lightly at the middle
and completely around the coupling, never near the end or on
opposite sides only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5
CAUSES OF TUBING TROUBLES<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most common causes of tubing troubles are listed in
5.5.1 through 5.5.15.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.3
Great care should be exercised to disengage all of the
thread before lifting the tubing out of the coupling. Do not
jump tubing out of the coupling.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.1
Improper selection for strength and life required,
especially of nonupset tubing where upset tubing should be
used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.4
Tubing stacked in the derrick should be set on a ﬁrm
wooden platform and without the bottom thread protector
since the design of most protectors is not such as to support
the joint or stand without damage to the ﬁeld thread.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.2
Insufﬁcient inspection of ﬁnished product at the mill
and in the yard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.3
Careless loading, unloading, and cartage.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.5
Protect threads from dirt or injury when the tubing is
out of the hole.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.4
Damaged threads resulting from protectors loosening
and falling off.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.6
Tubing set back in the derrick should be properly
supported to prevent undue bending. Tubing sizes 2 3 / 8  and
larger preferably should be pulled in stands approximately 60
feet (18.3 meters) long or in doubles of range 2. Stands of
tubing sizes 1.900 OD or smaller and stands longer than 60
feet (18.3 meters) should have intermediate support.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.5
Lack of care in storage to give proper protection.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.6
Excessive hammering on couplings.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.7
Use of worn-out and wrong types of handling equip-
ment, spiders, tongs, dies, and pipe wrenches.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.8
Nonobservance of proper rules in running and pulling
tubing.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.7
Before leaving a location, always ﬁrmly tie a setback
of tubing in place.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.9
Coupling wear and rod cutting.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.8
Make sure threads are undamaged, clean, and well
coated with compound before rerunning.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.10
Excessive sucker rod breakage.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.11
Fatigue, which often causes failure at the last
engaged thread. There is no positive remedy, but using exter-
nal upset tubing in place of nonupset tubing greatly delays the
start of this trouble.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.9
Distribute joint and tubing wear by moving a length
from the top of the string to the bottom each time the tubing is
pulled.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.10
In order to avoid leaks, all joints should be retight-
ened occasionally.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.12
Replacement of worn couplings with non-API cou-
plings.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.13
Dropping a string, even a short distance. This may
loosen the couplings at the bottom of the string. The string
should be pulled and rerun, examining all joints very carefully.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.11
When tubing is stuck, the best practice is to use a
calibrated weight indicator. Do not be misled, by stretching of
the tubing string, into the assumption that the tubing is free.<<HEADING_END>>

Leaking joints, under external or internal pressure,
are a common trouble, and may be due to the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.15.2
To determine the value and effectiveness of the
above practices and measures, cost and equipment failure
records can be compared before and after application of con-
trol measures. Inhibitor effectiveness can also be checked by
means of coupons, caliper surveys, and visual examinations
of readily accessible pieces of equipment. Water analyses to
determine the iron content before and after starting the inhibi-
tor treatment may also serve as an indication of the compara-
tive rates of corrosion. When lacking previous experience
with any of the above measures, these should be used cau-
tiously and on a limited scale until appraised for the particular
operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Improper thread compound and/or improper application.
b. Dirty threads, or threads contaminated with coating mate-
rial used as protection from corrosion.
c. Undertonging or overtonging.
d. Galled threads due to dirt, careless stabbing, damaged
threads, and poor or diluted thread compound.
e. Improperly cut ﬁeld threads.
f. Couplings that have been dented by hammering.
g. Pulling too hard on string.
h. Excessive rerunning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.15.3
In general, all new areas should be considered as
being potentially corrosive, and investigations should be initi-
ated early in the life of a ﬁeld, and repeated periodically, to
detect and localize corrosion before it has done destructive
damage. These investigations should cover the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.15
Corrosion. Both the inside and outside of tubing can
be damaged by corrosion. The damage is generally in the
form of pitting, box wear, stress-corrosion cracking, and sul-
ﬁde stress cracking; but localized attack like corrosion-ero-
sion, ringworm, and caliper tracks can also occur. Pitting and
wear by the sucker rod box can be determined visually by cal-
iper surveys. Cracking may require aids, such as magnetic
powder, for detection. Corrosion products may or may not
adhere to the pipe walls. Corrosion is generally due to the
corrosive well ﬂuid but may be aggravated by the abrasive
effects of pumping equipment, by gas lifting, or by high
velocities. Corrosion can also be inﬂuenced by dissimilar
metals in close proximity to each other (bimetallic corrosion)
and by variations in grain structure, surface conditions, and
deposits (concentration cell corrosion). Since corrosion may
result from many causes and inﬂuences and take different
forms, no simple or universal remedy can be given for con-
trol. Each problem shall be treated individually, and the solu-
tion shall be attempted in light of known factors and
operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. An analysis of produced gas for carbon dioxide and hydro-
gen sulﬁde. Also desirable is an analysis of the efﬂuent water
for pH, iron content, organic acids, total chlorides, and other
substances believed to inﬂuence the individual problem.
b. Corrosion rate tests by using coupons of the same materi-
als as in the well.
c. The use of caliper or optical-instrument inspections.
Where conditions favorable to corrosion exist, a qualiﬁed
corrosion engineer should be consulted. Particular attention
should be given to mitigation of corrosion where the probable
life of subsurface equipment is less than the time expected to
deplete a well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6
Transportation, Handling, and Storage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API tubular goods in general, and threads in particular, are
made with such precision that they require careful handling,
and whether new, used, or reconditioned, they should always
be handled with thread protectors in place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.15.1
Where internal or external tubing corrosion is
known to exist and corrosive ﬂuids are being produced, the
following measures can be employed:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. In ﬂowing wells, the annulus can be packed off and the
corrosive ﬂuid conﬁned to the inside of the tubing. The inside
of tubing can be protected with special liners, coatings, or
inhibitors. Under severe conditions, special alloy steel or
glass reinforced plastics may be used. Alloys do not always
eliminate corrosion. When H 2 S is present in the well ﬂuids,
tubing of high yield strength may be subject to sulﬁde corro-
sion cracking. The concentration of H 2 S necessary to cause
cracking in different strength materials is not yet well deﬁned.
Literature on sulﬁde corrosion or persons competent in this
ﬁeld should be consulted.
b. In pumping and gas-lift wells, inhibitors introduced via the
casing-tubing annulus afford appreciable protection. In this
type of completion, especially in pumping wells, better oper-
ating practices can also aid in extending the life of tubing,
such as through the use of rod protectors, rotation of tubing,
and longer and slower pumping strokes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1
TRANSPORTATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1
Water Transportation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipe suppliers or their agents should provide proper super-
vision at the time of loading and unloading of water carriers to
guard against improper or insufﬁcient dunnage, inadequate
bracing to prevent shifting during lurching of the ship, stowing
pipe in or adjacent to bilge water, injurious chemicals or other
corrosive material, dragging pipe along the pile and permitting
couplings or thread protectors to hook together or strike the
edge of a hatch opening or bump against the ship rail.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3
STORAGE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>should be provided across the bottom of the car to provide
suitable support for pipe, to allow space for lifting, and to
keep pipe away from dirt. If the bottom of the car is uneven,
the stringers should be rigidly shimmed so that their tops will
be in the same plane. Stringers should not be placed under
couplings or the upset part of pipe. The load should be tied
down and properly bulkheaded to keep it from shifting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following precautions are recommended for pipe
storage:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Do not pile pipe directly on ground, rails, and steel or con-
crete ﬂoors. The ﬁrst tier of pipe should be no less than 18
inches (500 millimeters) from the ground to keep moisture
and dirt away from pipe.
b. Pipe should rest on supports properly spaced to prevent
bending of the pipe or damage to the threads. The stringers
should lie in the same plane and be reasonably level and
should be supported by piers adequate to carry the full stack
load without settling.
c. Provide wooden strips as separators between successive
layers of pipe so that no weight rests on the couplings. Use at
least three spacing strips.
d. Place spacing strips at right angles to pipe and directly
above the lower strips and supports to prevent bending of pipe.
e. Stagger adjoining lengths of pipe in the tiers an amount
approximating the length of the coupling.
f. Block pipe by nailing 1 by 2 or 2 by 2 blocks at both ends
of the spacing strips.
g. For purposes of safety, ease of inspection, and handling,
pipe should not be stacked higher than 10 feet (3000 millime-
ters). Pipe should not be stacked higher than ﬁve tiers at the rig.
h. Pipe in storage should be inspected periodically and pro-
tective coatings applied when necessary to arrest corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3
Truck Transportation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following precautions should be taken for truck trans-
portation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Load pipe on bolsters and tie down with suitable chain at
the bolsters. In hauling long pipe, an additional chain should
be provided in the middle.
b. Load pipe with all couplings on the same end of the truck.
c. Care should be taken to prevent chaﬁng of tool-joint
shoulders on adjacent joints.
d. Do not overload truck to the point where there is any dan-
ger that the load cannot be delivered to its destination without
unloading.
e. After the load has been hauled a short distance, retighten
load-binding chains loosened as a result of the load settling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2
HANDLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following precautions should be observed when han-
dling casing and tubing:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7
Inspection and Classiﬁcation of Used
Casing and Tubing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Before loading or unloading make sure that the thread pro-
tectors are tightly in place. Do not unload pipe by dropping.
Avoid rough handling which might damage the threads or
ding or dent the body of the pipe. Damaged threads may leak
or part. Dents and out-of-roundness may reduce the collapse
resistance of the pipe.
Special handling may be required for sour service and
CRA material. Impact against adjacent pipe or other objects
may cause a local increase in the hardness of the pipe to the
extent that they become susceptible to sulﬁde stress cracking.
The owner of pipe which requires special handling require-
ments should notify his service providers of the applicable
special handling requirements and to which pipe the special
requirements are applicable.
b. When unloading by hand, use rope slings to control the
pipe. When rolling down skids, roll pipe parallel to the stack
and do not allow pipe to gather momentum or to strike the
ends, because even with thread protectors in place there is
danger of damaging the threads.
c. When using a crane, the use of spreader-bar with a choker-
sling(s) at each end is the recommended method of handling
long pipe. Each choker-sling shall be double wrapped.
d. When rolling pipe, on the rack, keep pipe parallel and do
not allow pipe to gather momentum or to strike the ends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

INSPECTION AND CLASSIFICATION
PROCEDURES<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.1
Inspection Capability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Presently accepted methods of inspecting the body sec-
tion of pipe are visual, mechanical gauging, electromagnetic,
eddy current, ultrasonic, and gamma ray. These inspection
techniques are limited to location of cracks, pits, and other
surface imperfections. Service induced defects considered to
be representative of defects associated with used pipe inspec-
tion are as follows: outside and inside corrosion damage;
inside surface wireline (longitudinal) damage; outside trans-
verse and longitudinal slip and tong cuts; inside surface drill
pipe wear (casing only); transverse cracking (work tubing
only); and inside surface sucker rod wear (tubing only).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Notes:
1. It is recommended that the makeup target be based on position, not torque. See 5.2.4 and 5.3.1.
2. Under normal circumstances, variations in the listed torque values of ± 25 % should be considered acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the body wall loss classiﬁcation shown in
Table 4, the color code identiﬁcation system used to denote
the conditions is provided in Table 5. The color coding should
consist of a paint band of the appropriate color approximately
2 inches wide around the body of the pipe approximately 1
foot from the box end.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>instruments, or gamma-ray devices that the operator can dem-
onstrate to be within 2 percent accuracy by use of test blocks
sized to approximate pipe wall thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.3
Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Used casing and tubing should be classiﬁed according to
the loss of nominal wall thickness listed in Table 4.
These percentages represent reductions in the body wall
from the API speciﬁed pipe wall thickness. This loss of wall
thickness affects the body areas along both the inside and/or
outside surfaces. Pipe with loss of wall thickness in the
threaded portion and/or upset section, whether threaded and
coupled external upset or integral joint, is not to be classiﬁed
in accordance with Table 4. Loss of wall thickness in the
heavier upset sections could be permitted to a higher percent-
age without penalty depending on the intended service. Dam-
ages and/or wall reductions affecting the threaded ends of
pipe require individual consideration depending on the antici-
pated service by the owner of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

wear on burst rating, and it has been suggested that burst pres-
sures be reduced if wall reduction is caused by wire-line wear.
The type of metal loss may inﬂuence the application of
used casing and tubing. Pipe with pits may not be used under
some corrosive conditions but may perform satisfactorily
where corrosion is not a factor. Pipe having more uniform
metal loss from mechanical wear should be less vulnerable to
corrosive conditions and needs only to be derated for the min-
imum remaining wall thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>When inspecting threads of used casing and tubing, one
should check for the following: pulled round threads, galling,
and fatigue cracks in the last engaged thread. A fast thread
lead at the area of last thread engagement of round threads
would indicate that the threads became stretched when pulled
at loads exceeding the yield strength of the connection. They
may make into a coupling on the next makeup but would not
have the anticipated joint strength and could have inadequate
leak resistance. Galling is always a possibility that may be
encountered while breaking out connections, particularly
when backups are placed on the coupling. Also on repeated
makeup, the threads make up more each time and interference
occurs. Work tubing and strings subjected to reciprocal ten-
sion stress often develop fatigue cracks at the root of the last
engaged thread that could reduce tension values or propagate
to joint failure during further use. These situations would
require shopping of the threads to restore the length to usable
status. It should not be expected that threaded connections
shall gauge properly after being made up power tight, there-
fore minor deviations from the speciﬁed tolerances should be
accepted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.4
Performance Properties<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Performance properties of new casing, tubing, and drill
pipe are usually based on equations in API Bulletin 5C3.
However, there is no standard method for calculating perfor-
mance properties of used casing and tubing. API Recom-
mended Practice 7G provides a recommended practice for
calculating performance properties of used drill pipe. Drill
pipe wear usually occurs on the outside surface and, conse-
quently, the performance properties of used drill pipe are
based on a constant ID, and the wall thickness and OD vary
with the degree of wear.
Casing and tubing wear (metal loss) and corrosion usually
occur on the inside surface. Performance properties should be
based on a constant OD. If external corrosion is evident, it
must also be taken into account. Small pits or other localized
metal loss may not be damaging depending on the application
of the pipe, but this type of metal loss should be considered
and evaluated by the pipe owner.
If cracks are detected in a length of pipe during inspection
and are veriﬁed to be of sufﬁcient length to be identiﬁed by
either visual, optical, or magnetic particle inspection, this
joint shall be rejected and considered unﬁt for further service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.3
Pin Cone Reduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubing that has made multiple round-trips in the hole, as
in the case of work strings, may have pins reduced in diame-
ter due to successive yielding by repeated makeups. This con-
dition may penalize joint strength, leak resistance, and in
severe cases, lead to abutment of pin ends near the center of
the coupling in the made-up connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2
GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following general comments concern loss of pipe
wall thickness and conditions of the threaded joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1
Pipe Wall<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Metal losses in used casing and tubing usually occur on
the inside surface and range in character from isolated pits,
gouges, or cuts to massive reductions caused by mechanical
wear or sand cutting. Wear occurs inside casing and liners by
rotation and movement of the drill string while drilling. Wear
occurs inside the casing even though rubber protectors are
applied to the drill pipe. The amount of wear increases with
the length of time the casing is drilled through. Frequently,
wear occurs on only one side, that being the casing on the low
side of the hole. The performance properties can be calculated
by using the remaining wall thickness. Some experience has<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3
SERVICE RATING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Final rating of a length of pipe for further services
requires consideration of the ID wall condition and remaining
wall thickness to evaluate resistance of the body to collapse,
burst, and tension; consideration of the thread condition to
evaluate resistance to leaks; and consideration of the pin cone
to evaluate makeup.
Depending on circumstances and emergency needs, gaug-
ing of the threads may be considered along with the usual
wall inspection to determine ﬁnal performance properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The responsibility for welding lies with the user, and
results are largely governed by the welder’s skill. Weldability
of the various types and grades of casing varies widely, thus
placing added responsibility on the welder. Transporting a
qualiﬁed welder to the job rather than using a less-skilled
man who may be at hand will in most cases prove economi-
cal. The responsible operating representative should ascertain
the welder’s qualiﬁcations and, if necessary, assure himself
by instruction or demonstration that the welder is able to per-
form the work satisfactorily.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Utilization of the used casing or tubing should be based on
experience and judgment with respect to well conditions and
environmental factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Reconditioning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubular goods that have become damaged through use or
abuse may often be reconditioned to advantage. This should
be done only in accordance with API Speciﬁcation 5CT. The
acceptability of reconditioned threads should always be con-
ﬁrmed by gauging and inspection in accordance with API
Speciﬁcation 5B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

REQUIREMENTS OF WELDS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.1
Welds should have sufﬁcient mechanical strength to
prevent joints from backing off or to hold various attachments
to the casing. In-service welds are called upon to withstand
impact, pounding, vibration, and other severe service condi-
tions to which casing is subjected. Ability to withstand bend-
ing forces is also often important. To accomplish this, ductile
welds free from cracks and brittle or hard spots are desired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9
Field Welding of Attachments on
Casing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1
INTRODUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1
The selection of steel for use in casing is governed by
important considerations dictated by the service casing must
perform. Steels most suitable for ﬁeld welding do not have
these performance properties. Therefore, ﬁeld weldability
shall not be of primary consideration in the selection of steel
for the manufacture of casing. As a result, unless precautions
are taken welding may have adverse effects on many of the
steels used in all grades of casing, especially J55 and higher.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2.2
Leak resistance is not a factor in welds covered by
procedures herein outlined. The purpose of the welds is to
make attachments or to prevent joints from unscrewing.
Where welding is done on joints, the weld shall not be
intended as a seal to prevent leakage but rather as a means of
preventing the joint from backing off. Leak resistance is
obtained by the joint itself.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.2
The heat from welding may affect the mechanical
properties of high-strength casing steels. Cracks and brittle
areas are likely to develop in the heat-affected zone. Hard
areas or cracks may cause failure, especially when the casing
is subjected to tool-joint battering. For these reasons, welding
on high-strength casing should be avoided if possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2.3
Leak resistance is required for the seal weld in casing
hangers.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3
PROCESS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding is currently being done by the metal-arc or oxy-
acetylene processes. Brazing alloys melting at 1200°F
(650°C) or lower, which possess good mechanical properties,
are available for application by the oxyacetylene or oxypro-
pane torch. They may be used to avoid brittle areas or cracks
that may occur in alloy casing when welded; but when so
subjected to this temperature, a reduction in strength may
result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.3
Practices and equipment that shall eliminate welding
are recommended. For example, cements or locking attach-
ments might be used rather than welding bottom joints to pre-
vent them from unscrewing. Similarly, use of mechanical
means for attachment of centralizers and scratchers is encour-
aged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.4
Although welding on high-strength casing is not rec-
ommended as the best practice, it is recognized that under
certain circumstances the user may elect to do so. In such
cases, there are certain practices that, if followed, will mini-
mize the deleterious effects of welding. The intent here is to
outline practices that will serve as a guide to ﬁeld personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4
FILLER FOR ARC WELDING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using the metal arc process, low-hydrogen elec-
trodes should be used. These include all electrodes with the
AWS classiﬁcations Exx 15, Exx 16, and Exx 18 in AWS
Speciﬁcation A5.1,  Covered Carbon Steel Arc Welding Elec-
trodes . Low-hydrogen electrodes should not be exposed to the
atmosphere until ready for use. Electrodes must be stored in
holding ovens at 150°F to 300°F (65°C to 150°C) immedi-
ately after their containers have been opened. Once removed
from the holding oven, electrodes must be used within 30
minutes. Electrodes not used within this time limit must be
discarded or reconditioned by baking at 600°F to 700°F<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.5
Welding is not recommended on those critical por-
tions of the casing string where tension, burst, or collapse-
strength properties shall not be impaired. If welding is neces-
sary, it should be restricted to the lowermost portions of the
cemented interval at the bottom of the casing string. Shoe-
joint welding of couplings, when necessary, shall be used
with extreme caution and with full use of procedures outlined
herein.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.6
Care should be taken to ensure that the welding cable
is properly grounded to the casing, but ground wire should
not be welded to the casing. Ground wire should be ﬁrmly
clamped to the casing or ﬁxed in position between pipe slips.
Bad contact may cause sparking, with resultant hard spots
beneath which incipient cracks may develop. The welding
cable should not be grounded to steel derrick, rotary-table
base, or casing rack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(315°C to 370°C) for 1 hour. After reconditioning, electrodes
must be placed into the holding oven.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5
PREPARATION OF BASE METAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The area to be welded should be dry and brushed or wiped
free of any excess paint, grease, scale, rust, or dirt.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6
PREHEATING AND COOLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.7
As much welding as possible should be done on the
rack instead of on the rig ﬂoor or while the casing is hanging
in the well. This procedure has the two-fold advantage of (a)
welding under more favorable conditions, and (b) the weld
cooling rate can be slower and more closely controlled. Do not
ground to the rack but ﬁrmly clamp to casing being welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.6.1
Preheating is considered essential for welding all
grades of casing. At least 3 inches (75 millimeters) on each
side of weld locations should be preheated to 400°F to 600°F
(205°C to 315°C). Preheat temperature should be maintained
during welding. (Use a “Tempilstik” or equivalent tempera-
ture sensitive crayon to check temperature.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.8
If couplings, ﬂoat collars, and guide shoes are
welded, sufﬁcient metal should be deposited to prevent them
from backing out. If the top side of the ﬂoat collar and casing
collars are welded while the casing is in the rotary or if the
practice is not to make a complete weld, three 3-inch (75-
millimeter) welds should be placed at 120-degree intervals
around size 9 5 / 8  casing; three 4-inch (100-millimeter) welds
should be placed on larger casing; and three 2-inch (50-milli-
meter) welds on smaller casing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.6.2
Rapid cooling shall be avoided. To ensure slow cool-
ing, welds should be protected from extreme weather condi-
tions (cold, rain, high winds, etc.). Welds made on the casing
as it is being run should be cooled in air to below 250°F
(121°C) (measured with a “Tempilstik” or equivalent) prior to
lowering the weld into the hole. The required cooling usually
takes about 5 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7
WELDING TECHNIQUE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.9
If welds longer than 4 inches (100 millimeters) to 6
inches (150 millimeters) are made, backstepping is advanta-
geous. For example, if 6 inches (150 millimeters) of weld
have been deposited as a stringer bead from left to right, then
the operator should start about 6 inches (150 millimeters) to
the left of the weld deposited and weld up to the starting point
of the previously deposited weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7.1
The weld should be started as soon as the speciﬁed
preheat temperature has been attained. The welding operation
should be shielded from strong winds, blowing dust and sand,
and rain.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.2
Where metal-arc welding is used, electrodes  3 / 16 -inch
(4.8-millimeter) diameter or smaller should be used. Two pass
welds are preferred, provided the second pass may be con-
trolled so that it shall overlay only the weld metal and not
extend to the casing. The function of the second pass is to tem-
per or anneal the underlying weld and adjacent metal. This
purpose is defeated if the second pass extends onto the casing.
The second pass should be laid on very quickly after cleaning
the ﬁrst bead so as to prevent the metal heated by the ﬁrst pass
from cooling quickly enough to become brittle. Weaving
should be kept to a minimum, and the current should be on the
low side of the range recommended by the electrode manufac-
turer. Every effort should be made to avoid undercutting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7.10
Complete ﬁllet welds should have approximately
equal leg dimensions. Care should be taken to avoid under-
cutting. Two passes are preferred. (Welds should be cleaned
between passes.)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.11
When lugs are welded to casing, the weld should
extend around the lug ends. It is good practice to strike the arc
near the lug end, weld the end, and bring the weld back to
about the lug center. The arc is momentarily broken so that
the lug can be cut or burnt to length and the unwelded end
hammered down against the casing. The weld is then contin-
ued around the second end, bringing the arc back on the weld
before breaking. In this manner, ends are welded without
either striking or breaking the arc at the ends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7.3
All slag or ﬂux remaining on any welding bead
should be removed by chipping or grinding before depositing
the next bead.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7.12
When centralizers and scratchers are welded to cas-
ing, welds should be a minimum length of 2 inches (50 milli-
meters) at 2-inch (50-millimeter) intervals.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7.4
Attachments should ﬁt as closely as possible to the
casing surface.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.5
The arc shall not be struck on the casing, as every arc
burn results in a hard spot and damage to the casing. Cracks
have frequently resulted from striking the arc on casing. The
arc should be struck on the attachment, which is made from
steel not as susceptible to damage. If necessary to strike the
arc on the casing, it should be struck in the area to be welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.13
When rotating scratchers are welded to casing, full-
length welds on each end, with  3 / 4 -inch (19-millimeter) welds
at two equal spacings on the front edge and one  3 / 4 -inch (19-
millimeter) weld on the center of the rear or trailing edge,
have been found satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
