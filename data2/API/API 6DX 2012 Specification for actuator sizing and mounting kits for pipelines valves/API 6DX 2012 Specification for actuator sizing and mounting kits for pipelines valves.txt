<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards
bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out
through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical
committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO
collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of
electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of
patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is necessary that users of this International Standard be aware that further or differing requirements can
be needed for individual applications. This International Standard is not intended to inhibit a vendor from
offering, or the purchaser from accepting, alternative equipment or engineering solutions for the individual
application. This can be particularly applicable where there is innovative or developing technology. Where
an alternative is offered, it is the responsibility of the vendor to identify any variations from this
International Standard and provide details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard defines the requirements for mechanical integrity and sizing of actuators used
on valves manufactured under ISO 14313 and API Specification 6D.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard is applicable to all types of electric, pneumatic and hydraulic actuators,
inclusive of mounting kit, installed on pipeline valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard is not applicable to actuators installed on control valves, valves being used for
regulation, valves in sub-sea service, handheld powered devices, stand-alone manually operated
gearboxes, instrument tubing and associated fittings and actuator control equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Conformance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Units of measurement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this International Standard, data are expressed in both SI units and USC units. For a specific order item,
unless otherwise stated, only one system of units shall be used, without combining data expressed in the
other system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For data expressed in SI units, a comma is used as the decimal separator and a space is used as the
thousands separator. For data expressed in USC units, a dot (on the line) is used as the decimal
separator and a comma is used as the thousands separator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2 Rounding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise stated in this International Standard, to determine conformance with the specified
requirements, observed or calculated values shall be rounded to the nearest unit in the last right-hand
place of figures used in expressing the limiting value, in accordance with ISO 80000-1:2009.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.3 Compliance with this International Standard<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A quality system should be applied to assist compliance with the requirements of this International
Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
ISO/TS 29001 gives sector-specific guidance on quality management systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manufacturer shall be responsible for complying with all of the applicable requirements of this
International Standard. It shall be permissible for the purchaser to make any investigation necessary in
order to be assured of compliance by the manufacturer and to reject any material that does not comply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical configurations for double-acting actuators are shown, for illustration purposes only, in Figures 1, 2,
3, 5, 7, 9, 10 and 12.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Double-acting actuators can be of the electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic type and can have either part-turn,
multi-turn or linear action. The design requires the application of supply energy to operate the actuator output in both
directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>CAUTION — If supplying a double-acting actuator for fail-safe action, a suitable and appropriately
sized stored energy device is required.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical configurations for single-acting actuators are shown, for illustration purposes only, in Figures 4, 6,

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Single-acting actuators can be of the electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic type and can have either part-turn
or linear action to operate in one direction only, with the return stroke being powered by an alternative form of stored
energy. Single-acting actuators are generally associated with fail-safe applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Action on loss of supply energy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Upon loss of supply energy, the valve shall be automatically driven to, or remain in, a predetermined
position as defined by the purchaser. These positions are commonly as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  fail-open;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The actuator portion of the interface between the actuator and the valve shall be in accordance with
ISO 5210 or ISO 5211 unless otherwise agreed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If alternative dimensions are used that are outside the scope of ISO 5210 or ISO 5211, they shall follow
the design methodology and acceptance criteria of these International Standards unless otherwise
agreed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Actuators that are subjected to frequent cycling and/or rapid operation can require additional design
considerations, including fatigue analysis and impact as appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design verification and/or validation, including a design review, shall be performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For pneumatic and hydraulic actuators,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the design pressure being used for the design of the pressure-containing parts shall be specified by
the actuator manufacturer, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the maximum rated pressure shall be defined by the actuator manufacturer, and shall be less than or
equal to the design pressure and greater than or equal to the maximum operating pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These actuator pressure relationships are illustrated in Figure 14. The relationships between energy (e.g.
pressure and voltage), torque/thrust, component part design and sizing are shown in Figure 15, along

<<PARAGRAPH>>Mechanically loaded parts shall be designed to accommodate the maximum anticipated in-service load,
including design torque/thrust, and shall take into account the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  torque/thrust generated at maximum rated pressure, for pneumatic/hydraulic actuators;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  torque/thrust generated by maximum compressed spring force, for spring return actuators;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  torque/thrust at maximum supply voltage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  torque/thrust at stall condition, for electric actuators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mechanically loaded parts shall be designed in accordance with a documented methodology, including
acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria shall include analysis of stress, strain (and fatigue where
applicable) encountered during operation at maximum torque/thrust output. Alternatively, acceptance
criteria may be satisfactory documented previous experience including validation testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 Springs and modules<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The spring(s) on spring return actuators shall be designed in accordance with internationally recognized
design codes or standards. If no equations exist for the spring type, a proprietary equation may be used
provided it has been validated by cycle testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
An example of an internationally recognized design code or standard is EN 13906.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A qualification test shall be performed on all spring(s) by full-load cycling a minimum of five times followed
