<<HEADING level=3>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This recommended practice (RP) is intended to provide guidance on developing a Risk-Based Inspection (RBI)
program for fixed equipment and piping in the hydrocarbon and chemical process industries. It includes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) what is RBI,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) what are the key elements of RBI,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) how to implement an RBI program,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) how to sustain an RBI program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is based on the knowledge and experience of engineers, inspectors, risk analysts, and other personnel in the
hydrocarbon and chemical industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shall: As used in a standard, “shall” denotes a minimum requirement in order to conform to the specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Should: As used in a standard, “should” denotes a recommendation or that which is advised but not required in order
to conform to the specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This RP is intended to supplement API 510, API 570, and API 653. These API inspection codes and standards allow
an owner-user latitude to plan an inspection strategy and increase or decrease the code designated inspection
frequencies and activities based on the results of an RBI assessment. The assessment shall systematically evaluate
both the probability of failure (POF) and the associated consequence of failure (COF). The POF assessment should
be evaluated by considering all credible damage mechanisms. Refer to the appropriate code for other RBI
assessment requirements. This RP is intended to serve as a guide for users in properly performing such an RBI
assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The information in this RP does not constitute and should not be construed as a code of rules, regulations, or
minimum safe practices. The practices described in this publication are not intended to supplant other practices that
have proven satisfactory, nor is this publication intended to discourage innovation and originality in the inspection of
hydrocarbon and chemical facilities. Users of this RP are reminded that no book or manual is a substitute for the
judgment of a responsible, qualified inspector or engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nothing contained in any API publication is to be construed as granting any right, by implication or otherwise, for the
manufacture, sale, or use of any method, apparatus, or product covered by letters patent. Neither should anything
contained in the publication be construed as insuring anyone against liability for infringement of letters patent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This document was produced under API standardization procedures that ensure appropriate notification and
participation in the developmental process and is designated as an API standard. Questions concerning the
interpretation of the content of this publication or comments and questions concerning the procedures under which
this publication was developed should be directed in writing to the Director of Standards, American Petroleum
Institute, 1220 L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005. Requests for permission to reproduce or translate all or any part
of the material published herein should also be addressed to the director.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, API standards are reviewed and revised, reaffirmed, or withdrawn at least every five years. A one-time
extension of up to two years may be added to this review cycle. Status of the publication can be ascertained from the
API Standards Department, telephone (202) 682-8000. A catalog of API publications and materials is published
annually by API, 1220 L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Suggested revisions are invited and should be submitted to the Standards Department, API, 1220 L Street, NW,

<<HEADING level=3>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This recommended practice (RP) contains both minimum program requirements to qualify for establishing inspection
intervals based on Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) analysis versus rule-based (e.g.  1 / 2  life) requirements, and provides
additional suggested guidelines on using risk analysis to develop an effective inspection plan. The use of risk-based
methodologies for inspection planning is not compulsory; they are optional, subject to the requirements and
limitations of the other inspection codes (API 510, API 570, and API 653) and this RP. Inspection planning is a
systematic process that begins with identification of facilities or equipment and culminates in an inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The output of an RBI assessment conducted according to this RP is an inspection plan for each piece or group of
equipment assessed, which should include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) identified risk drivers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) inspection methods that should be used;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)   extent of inspection (percent of total area to be examined or specific locations);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) inspection interval or next inspection date (timing);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) other risk mitigation activities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
residual level of risk after inspection and other mitigation actions have been implemented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RBI plan produced according to the guidance herein combined with a comprehensive set of integrity operating
windows (IOWs) for each process unit and a rigorous management of change (MOC) program should provide the
basis for sound management of the integrity of fixed equipment in the refining and petrochemical process industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI is synonymous with risk-prioritized inspection, risk-informed inspection, and with inspection planning using risk-
based methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Purpose<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of this document is to provide users with the basic minimum and recommended elements for developing,
implementing, and maintaining a RBI program. It also provides guidance to owner-users, operators, and designers of
pressure-containing equipment for developing and implementing an inspection program. These guidelines include
means for assessing an inspection program and its plan. The approach emphasizes safe and reliable operation through
risk-prioritized inspection. A spectrum of complementary risk analysis approaches (qualitative through fully quantitative)
can be considered as part of the inspection planning process. RBI guideline issues covered include an introduction to
the concepts and principles of RBI for risk management, and individual sections that describe the steps in applying these
principles within the framework of the RBI process include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) understanding the design premise;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) planning the RBI assessment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) data and information collection;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) identifying damage mechanisms and failure modes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) assessing probability of failure (POF);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
assessing consequence of failure (COF);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) risk determination, assessment, and management;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

reassessment and updating;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) roles, responsibilities, training, and qualifications;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
documentation and recordkeeping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The expected outcome from the application of the RBI process should be the linkage of risks with appropriate
inspection, process control, or other risk mitigation activities to manage the risks. The RBI process is capable of
generating:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) a ranking by relative risk of all equipment evaluated;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) a detailed description of the inspection plan to be employed for each equipment item, including:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) inspection method(s) that should be used (e.g. visual, ultrasonic, radiography, wet fluorescent magnetic
particle),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) extent of application of the inspection method(s) (e.g. percent of total area examined or specific locations),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) timing of inspections/examinations (inspection intervals/due dates),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) risk management achieved through implementation of the inspection plan;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>viii<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_10>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) a description of any other risk mitigation activities, such as repairs, replacements, or safety equipment upgrades,
equipment redesign or maintenance, IOWs, and controls on operating conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the expected risk levels of all equipment after the inspection plan and other risk mitigation activities have been
implemented;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) identification of risk drivers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Required Elements in RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This RP contains both minimum program requirements to qualify for interval extension beyond rule-based ( 1 / 2  life)
requirements and provides additional suggested guidelines on using risk analysis to develop an effective RBI
program. In general, the required elements/attributes of conducting an RBI analysis per this RP include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Work Process Requirements (see Section 16)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Work process requirements include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A documented management system to implement and sustain RBI program shall be developed and typically

<<PARAGRAPH>>Data requirements include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Data inputs and assumptions shall be validated by qualified personnel such as process engineer/operator to
review operating parameters used (7.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Damage Mechanisms and Failure Modes (Section 8)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requirements for damage mechanisms and failure modes include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The RBI team shall consult with a corrosion specialist to define the equipment damage mechanisms, damage
modes (optional), and potential failure modes (8.1.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Equipment design (pressures, temperature, and materials of construction) and current condition shall be
considered. Data used and assumptions made shall be validated and documented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) All process conditions, e.g. start-up, shutdown, idle, anticipated abnormal and normal, as well as planned process
changes shall be considered. Identifying trace constituents (ppm) in addition to the primary constituents in a
process can be very important as trace constituents can have a significant effect on the damage mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Considering the materials, methods, and details of fabrication, a list of the credible damage mechanisms that
may have been present in past operation, be presently active, or may become active shall be developed
including the rate of deterioration for primary damage mechanisms and the tolerance of the equipment to the
type of damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A qualified corrosion specialist shall be responsible for assessing the types of damage mechanisms and their
applicability and severity to the equipment considering the process conditions, environment, metallurgy, age, and
other relevant data pertaining to of the equipment (15.2.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>POF Analysis (Section 9)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>POF analysis requirements include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The POF analysis shall address all credible damage mechanisms to which the equipment being reviewed is or
can be susceptible. Further, it shall address the situation where equipment is or can be susceptible to multiple
damage mechanisms (9.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Combinations of process conditions and existing materials of construction for each equipment item shall be
evaluated to identify active and credible damage mechanisms (9.4.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Inspections shall be evaluated to determine the effectiveness in finding the identified mechanisms (9.4.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>COF Analysis (Section 10)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>COF analysis requirements include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) COF calculations steps shall be performed to estimate the consequences that are likely to occur due to a failure
mode typically resulting from an identified damage mechanism(s) (10.1.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The major factors to consider in evaluating the consequences of failure shall include (10.5.1):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) flammable events (fire and explosion),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>x<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_12>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) toxic releases,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) releases of other hazardous fluids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Evaluation of Risk (Section 11)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requirements for evaluation of risk include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Risk shall be determined by combining the POF (results of work done as described in Section 9) and the COF
(results of the work done as described in Section 10). The general form of the risk equation shall be as follows (11.1):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>risk = probability  ×  consequence<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Overall risk shall include the probability of loss of containment (11.2.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Output (Section 12)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Output requirements include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Items with unacceptable risk to the owner-user shall be assessed for potential risk management through
inspection plans or other risk management strategies. In addition, higher risk items should also be prioritized for
potential risk management (12.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The inspection strategy shall be a documented, iterative process to assure that inspection activities are continually
focused on items with higher risk (12.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Inspection results such as the identification of damage mechanisms, rate of deterioration, and equipment
tolerance to the types of deterioration shall be used as variables in assessing remaining life and future inspection
plans (12.6).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>RBI Reassessment and Updating (Section 14)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requirements for RBI reassessment and updating include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Changes are inevitable and the results from the RBI assessment shall be updated (14.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) When inspection activities have been performed, the results shall be reviewed to determine if an RBI
reassessment is necessary (14.2.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The governing inspection codes (such as API 510, API 570, and API 653) and jurisdictional regulations, if any,
shall be reviewed in this context (14.3.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>RBI Benefits and Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The primary work products of the RBI assessment and management approach are plans that address ways to
manage risks on an individual equipment level. These equipment plans highlight risk from a safety/health/
environment perspective and/or from an economic standpoint. RBI plans should include cost-effective actions along
with projected risk mitigation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Implementation of these plans provides one of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) an overall reduction in risk for the facilities and equipment assessed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) an acceptance/understanding of the current risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>xi<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_13>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RBI plans also identify equipment that does not require inspection or some other form of mitigation because of
the acceptable level of risk associated with the equipment’s current operation. In this way, inspection and
maintenance activities can be focused and more cost-effective. This can result in a significant reduction in the amount
of inspection data that is collected. This focus on a smaller set of data should result in more accurate information. In
some cases, in addition to risk reductions and process safety improvements, RBI plans may result in cost reductions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI is based on sound, proven risk assessment and management principles. Nonetheless, RBI will not compensate for:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) inaccurate or missing information;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) inadequate design or faulty equipment installation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) operating outside the acceptable IOWs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) not effectively executing the plans;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) lack of qualified personnel or teamwork;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
lack of sound engineering or operational judgment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Using RBI as a Continuous Improvement Tool<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Utilization of RBI provides a vehicle for continuously improving the inspection of facilities and systematically reducing
the risk associated with pressure boundary failures. As new data such as inspection results and industry experience
with similar processes becomes available, or when changes occur in operating conditions, a reassessment of the RBI
program can be conducted to provide an updated view of risk. RMPs should be adjusted appropriately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI offers the added advantage of identifying gaps or shortcomings in the effectiveness of commercially available
inspection technologies and applications. In cases where technology cannot adequately and/or cost-effectively
mitigate risk, other risk mitigation approaches can be implemented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>RBI as an Integrated Management Tool<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI is a risk assessment and management tool that addresses an area of risk management not completely
addressed in other organizational risk management efforts such as process hazards analyses, IOWs, or reliability
centered maintenance. Integration of these risk management efforts, including RBI, is the key to a successful risk
management program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI produces equipment inspection and maintenance plans that identify the actions that should be taken to provide
reliable and safe operation. An RBI effort can provide input into an organization’s annual planning and budgeting to
define the staffing and funds required to maintain equipment operation at acceptable levels of performance and risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI should be integrated with a management system to define and maintain IOWs as well as a robust MOC process
as a basis to manage and control damage mechanisms in fixed equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 Industry Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although the risk management principles and concepts that Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) is built on are universally
applicable, this recommended practice (RP) is specifically targeted to the application of RBI in the hydrocarbon and
chemical process industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2 Flexibility in Application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of the broad diversity in organizational size, culture, and federal and/or local regulatory requirements, this
RP offers users the flexibility to apply RBI methodology within the context of existing corporate risk management
practices and to accommodate unique local circumstances. The document is designed to provide a framework that
clarifies the minimum and recommended attributes of a quality risk assessment without imposing undue constraints
on users. This RP is intended to promote consistency and quality in the identification, assessment, and management
of risks pertaining to material deterioration that could lead to loss of containment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many types of RBI methods exist and are currently being applied throughout industry. This document is not intended
to single out one specific approach as the recommended method for conducting an RBI effort. The RP instead is
intended to identify and clarify the minimum essential elements of an RBI analysis and program as well as to provide
guidance on the recommended work process for conducting a successful RBI program. The best RBI programs will
not only be in compliance with the minimum essential elements in this RP but will also adhere to the entire work
process contained herein.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.3 Mechanical Integrity Focused<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RBI process is focused on maintaining the mechanical integrity of pressure equipment items and minimizing the
risk of loss of containment due to deterioration. RBI is not a substitute for a process hazards analysis (PHA) or hazard
and operability assessment (HAZOP). Typically, PHA risk assessments focus on the process unit design and
operating practices and their adequacy given the unit’s current or anticipated operating conditions. RBI complements
the PHA by focusing on the mechanical integrity related damage mechanisms and risk management through
inspection. RBI also is complementary to reliability centered maintenance (RCM) programs in that both programs are
focused on understanding failure modes, addressing the modes and therefore improving the reliability of equipment
and process facilities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.4 Equipment Covered<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following types of equipment and associated components/internals are covered by this document:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) electrical systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) structural systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) machinery components (except pump and compressor casings).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, these systems and components may be covered by other types of RBI or risk directed work processes such
as RCM.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.6 Target Audience<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Th e primary audience for this RP is inspection and engineering personnel who are responsible for the mechanical
integrity and operability of equipment covered by this RP. However, while an organization’s inspection and materials
engineering groups may champion the RBI initiative, RBI is not exclusively an inspection activity. RBI requires the
involvement of various segments of the organization such as engineering, maintenance, and operations.
Implementation of the resulting RBI product (e.g. inspection plans, replacement/upgrading recommendations, other
mitigation activities, etc.) may rest with more than one segment of the organization. RBI requires the commitment and
cooperation of the total operating organization. In this context, while the primary audience may be inspection and
materials engineering personnel, other stakeholders who are likely to be involved should be familiar with the concepts
and principles embodied in the RBI methodology to the extent necessary for them to understand the risk assessment
process and to be able to accept the results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

design premise
Assumptions made during the design (e.g. design life and corrosion allowance needed).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.12
deterioration
The reduction in the ability of a component to provide its intended purpose of containment of fluids. This can be
caused by various damage mechanisms (e.g. thinning, cracking, mechanical). Damage or degradation may be used
in place of deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.13

multiple. The probability of an event occurring within a given period of time can be estimated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.15
event tree
An analytical tool that organizes and characterizes potential occurrences in a logical and graphical manner and
shows the events relationship to each other. The event tree begins with the identification of potential initiating events.
Subsequent possible events (including activation of safety functions) resulting from the initiating events are then
displayed as the second level of the event tree. This process is continued to develop pathways or scenarios from the
initiating events to potential outcomes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Termination of the ability of a system, structure, equipment, or component to perform its required function of
containment of fluid (i.e. loss of containment). Failures may be unannounced and undetected at the instant of
occurrence (unannounced failure). For example, a slow leak under insulation may not be detected until a pool of fluid
forms on the ground or someone notices a drip or wisp of vapor. A small leak may not be noticed until the next
inspection (unannounced failure), e.g. slow leakage from buried piping or small leak in a heat exchanger tube, or they
may be announced and detected by any number of methods at the instance of occurrence (announced failure), e.g.
rupture of a pipe in a process plant or sudden decrease in pressure in the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

hazard and operability study
HAZOP
A HAZOP study is a form of failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). HAZOP studies, which were originally
developed for the process industry, use systematic techniques to identify hazards and operability issues throughout
an entire facility. It is particularly useful in identifying unforeseen hazards designed into facilities due to lack of
information or introduced into existing facilities due to changes in process conditions or operating procedures. The
basic objectives of the techniques are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) to produce a full description of the facility or process, including the intended design conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) to systematically review every part of the facility or process to discover how deviations from the intention of the
design can occur;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) to decide whether these deviations can lead to hazards or operability issues;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) to assess effectiveness of safeguards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.23
inspection
Activities performed to verify that materials, fabrication, erection, examinations, testing, repairs, and any other data
relevant to the equipment conform to applicable codes, engineering, and the owner-user’s written procedure

Extent to which an event is likely to occur within the timeframe under consideration. The mathematical definition of
probability is “a real number in the scale 0 to 1 attached to a random event.” Probability can be related to a long-run
relative frequency of occurrence or to a degree of belief that an event will occur. For a high degree of belief, the
probability is near one (1). Frequency rather than probability may be used in describing risk. Degrees of belief about
probability can be chosen as classes or ranks like “rare/unlikely/moderate/likely/almost certain” or incredible/
improbable/remote/occasional/probable/frequent.”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4 Basic Risk Assessment Concepts<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 What is Risk?<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk is the combination of the probability of some event occurring during a time period of interest and the consequences
(generally negative) associated with the event. In mathematical terms, risk can be calculated by the equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>risk = probability  ×  consequence<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Likelihood is sometimes used as a synonym for probability. However, probability is used throughout this document for
consistency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Effective risk assessment should be a rational, logical, structured process that contains at least two key steps:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) determine how significant the risk is, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) determine whether the risk is acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Risk Management and Risk Reduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once the risk is known and the magnitude of the risk is established, the risk can be managed. At first, it may seem
that risk management and risk reduction are synonymous. However, risk reduction is only part of risk management.
Risk reduction is the act of mitigating a known risk that is deemed to be too high to a lower, more acceptable level of
risk with some form of risk reduction activity. Risk management, on the other hand, is a process to assess risks, to
determine if risk reduction is required, and to develop a plan to maintain risks at an acceptable level. By using risk
management, some risks may be identified as acceptable so that no risk reduction (mitigation) is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 The Evolution of Inspection Intervals and Due Dates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In process plants, inspection and testing programs and process monitoring are established to detect and evaluate
deterioration due to the effects of in-service operation. The effectiveness of inspection programs varies widely,
ranging from reactive programs, which concentrate on known areas of concern, to broad proactive programs covering
a variety of equipment. One extreme of this would be the “don’t fix it unless it’s broken” approach. The other extreme
would be complete inspection of all equipment items on a frequent basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Setting the intervals/due dates between inspections has evolved over time. With the need to periodically verify
equipment integrity, organizations initially resorted to time-based or “calendar-based” intervals/due dates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With advances in inspection approaches, and better understanding of the type and rate of deterioration, inspection
intervals/due dates became more dependent on the equipment condition (i.e. condition-based inspection), rather than
what might have been an arbitrary calendar date. Codes and standards such as API 510, API 570, and API 653
evolved to an inspection philosophy with elements such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) inspection intervals/due dates based on some percentage of equipment life (such as  1 / 2  life);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>12
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) on-stream inspection in lieu of internal inspection based on low deterioration rates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) internal inspection requirements for damage mechanisms related to process environment induced cracking;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) consequence-based inspection intervals/due dates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI represents the next generation of inspection approaches and interval/due date setting, recognizing that the
ultimate goal of inspection is the safety and reliability of operating facilities. RBI, as a risk-based approach, focuses
attention specifically on the equipment and associated damage mechanisms representing the most risk to the facility.
In focusing on risk and its mitigation, RBI provides a better linkage between the mechanisms that lead to equipment
failure (loss of containment) and the inspection approaches that will effectively reduce the associated risks. Though
there can be many definitions for failure of pressure equipment, in this document failure is defined as loss of
containment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Overview of Risk Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk is assessed by identifying credible damage mechanisms, estimating the POFs, assessing the COFs, and
identifying the risk drivers to enable development of effective risk mitigation strategies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The complexity of a risk analysis is a function of the number of factors that can affect the risk, and there is a
continuous spectrum of methods available to assess risk. The methods range from a strictly relative ranking to
rigorous calculation. The methods generally represent a range of precision for the resulting risk analysis (see 6.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any particular analysis may not yield usable results due to a lack of data, low-quality data, or the use of an approach
that does not adequately differentiate the risk represented by the equipment items. Further, analysis results may not
be realistic. Therefore, the risk analysis should be validated before decisions are made based on the analysis results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A logical progression for a risk analysis is:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) collect and validate the necessary data and information (see Section 7);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) identify damage mechanisms and, optionally, determine the damage mode(s) for each mechanism (e.g. general
metal loss, local metal loss, pitting) (see Section 8);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) determine damage susceptibility and rates (see Section 8);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) determine the POF over a defined timeframe for each damage mechanism (see Section 9);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) determine credible failure mode(s) [e.g. small leak, large leak, rupture (see Section 9)];<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
identify credible consequence scenarios that will result from the failure mode(s) (see Section 10);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) determine the probability of each consequence scenario, considering the POF and the probability that a specific
consequence scenario will result from the failure (see Section 10);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) determine the risk, including a sensitivity analysis, and review risk analysis results for consistency/reasonableness
(see Section 11).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The logical progression after completing the risk analysis is to develop an inspection plan and, if necessary, other
mitigation actions, and to evaluate the residual risk (see Section 12).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the risk is not acceptable, consider mitigation. For example, if the damage mode is general metal loss, a mitigation
plan could consist of on-stream wall thickness measurements, with a requirement to shut down or to repair on-stream
if the wall thickness measurements do not meet Fitness-For-Service acceptance criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Inspection Optimization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the risk associated with individual equipment items is determined and the relative effectiveness of different
inspection techniques and process monitoring in reducing risk is estimated or quantified, adequate information is
available for planning, optimizing, and implementing an RBI program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 1 presents stylized curves showing the reduction in risk that can be expected when the degree and frequency of
inspection are increased. The upper curve in Figure 1 represents a typical inspection program. Where there is no
inspection, there may be a higher level of risk, as indicated on the y-axis in the figure. With an initial investment in
inspection activities, risk generally is significantly reduced. A point is reached where additional inspection activity begins
to show a diminishing return and, eventually, may produce very little additional risk reduction. If excessive inspection is
applied, the level of risk may even go up. This is because invasive inspections in certain cases may cause additional
deterioration (e.g. moisture ingress in equipment with polythionic acid; inspection damage to protective coatings or
glass-lined vessels). This situation is represented by the dotted line at the end of the upper curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A complete RBI program provides a consistent methodology for assessing the optimum combination of methods and
frequencies of inspection. Each available inspection method can be analyzed and its relative effectiveness in
reducing failure probability can be estimated. Given this information and the cost of each procedure, an optimization
program can be developed. The key to developing such a procedure is the ability to assess the risk associated with
each item of equipment and then to determine the most appropriate inspection techniques for that piece of
equipment. A conceptual result of this methodology is illustrated by the lower curve in Figure 1. The lower curve
indicates that with the application of an effective RBI program, lower risks can be achieved with the same level of
inspection activity. This is because, through RBI, inspection activities are focused on higher risk items and away from
lower risk items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Many of these factors are strongly influenced by the process safety management (PSM) system in place at the facility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6 Relative Risk vs Absolute Risk<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The complexity of risk calculation is a function of the number of factors that can affect the risk. Calculating absolute
risk can be very time-consuming and costly, and often cannot be done with a high degree of accuracy due to too
many uncertainties. Many variables are involved with loss of containment in hydrocarbon and chemical facilities, and
the determination of absolute risk value is often not possible nor cost-effective. RBI is focused on a systematic
determination of relative risk. In this way, facilities, units, systems, equipment, or components can be ranked based
on their relative risk. This focuses risk management efforts on the higher ranked risks and allows decisions to be
made on the usefulness of risk management efforts on lower ranked risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a quantitative RBI study is conducted rigorously and properly, the resultant risk number is a good
approximation of the actual risk of loss of containment due to deterioration. In addition, numerical relative risk values
properly determined using qualitative and semi-quantitative approaches and the appropriate sensitivity analysis are
effective methods to evaluate and manage risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 Introduction to Risk-Based Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Key Elements of an RBI Program<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Key elements that exist in any RBI program include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) management systems for maintaining documentation, personnel qualifications, data requirements, consistency of
the program, and analysis update.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) documented method for POF determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) documented method for COF determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) management systems for maintaining documentation, personnel qualifications, data requirements, consistency of
documented methodology for managing risk through inspection, process control, and other mitigation activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, all the elements outlined in the Purpose section should be adequately addressed in all RBI applications, in
accordance with the RPs in this document.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Consequence and Probability for RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One objective of RBI is to determine what incident could occur (consequence) in the event of an equipment failure,
and how likely (probability) it is that the incident could happen. For example, if a pressure vessel subject to damage
from corrosion under insulation develops a leak, a variety of consequences could occur. Some of the possible
consequences are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) form a vapor cloud that could ignite, causing injury and equipment damage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_27>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
15<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) release of a toxic chemical that could cause health problems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) result in a spill and cause environmental damage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) force a unit shutdown and have an adverse economic impact;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) minimal safety, health, environmental, and/or economic impact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Combining the probability of one or more of these events with its consequences will determine the risk to the
operation. Some failures may occur relatively frequently without significant adverse safety, environmental, or
economic impact. Similarly, some failures have potentially serious consequences, but if the probability of the incident
is low, the risk may not warrant immediate or extensive action. However, if the probability and consequence
combination (risk) is high enough to be unacceptable, then a mitigation action to reduce the probability and/or the
consequence of the event is appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Traditionally, organizations have focused solely on the consequences or the POF without systematic efforts to tie the
two together. They have not considered how likely it is that an undesirable incident will occur in combination with the
consequence. Only by considering both factors can effective risk-based decision-making take place. Typically, risk
acceptability criteria are defined, recognizing that not every failure will lead to an undesirable incident with serious
consequence (e.g. water leaks) and that some serious consequence incidents have very low probabilities (e.g.
rupture of a clean propane vessel).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Understanding the two-dimensional aspect of risk allows new insight into the use of risk for inspection prioritization
and planning. Figure 2 displays the risk associated with the operation of a number of equipment items in a process
plant. Both the probability and COF have been determined for 10 equipment items, and the results have been plotted.
The points represent the risk associated with each equipment item. Ordering by risk produces a risk-based ranking of
the equipment items to be inspected. From this list, an inspection plan can be developed that focuses attention on the
areas of highest risk. An “ISO-risk” line is shown on Figure 2. An ISO-risk line represents a constant risk level, as
shown across the matrix in Figure 2. All items that fall on or very near the ISO-risk line are roughly equivalent in their
level of risk. A user-defined acceptable risk level could be plotted as an ISO-risk line. In this way the acceptable risk
line would separate the unacceptable from the acceptable risk items. Often a risk plot is drawn using log-log scales for
a better understanding of the relative risks of the items assessed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Types of RBI Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various types of RBI assessment may be conducted at several levels. The choice of approach is dependent on
multiple variables such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) objective of the study,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) number of facilities and equipment items to study,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) available resources,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) assessment timeframe,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) complexity of facilities and processes,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
nature and quality of available data,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) risk discrimination needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RBI procedure can be applied qualitatively, quantitatively, or by using aspects of both (i.e. semi-quantitatively).
Each approach provides a systematic way to screen for risk, identify areas of potential concern, and develop a
prioritized list for more in-depth inspection or analysis. Each develops a risk ranking measure to be used for
evaluating separately the POF and the potential COF. These two values are then combined to estimate risk of failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The chosen approach may be selected at the beginning of the analysis process and carried through to completion, or
the approach may be changed (i.e. the analysis may become more or less quantitative) as the analysis progresses.
However, consistency of approach will be vital to comparing results from one assessment to the next. If the risk
determined using any approach is below the acceptance criterion specified by the management of the organization
conducting the analysis, no further analysis, inspection, or mitigation steps are typically required within the analysis
timeframe as long as the conditions and assumptions used in the analysis remain valid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The spectrum of risk analysis should be considered to be a continuum with qualitative and quantitative approaches
being the two extremes of the continuum and everything in between being a semi-quantitative approach (see 5.3.5
and Figure 3). Use of expert opinion will typically be included in most risk assessments regardless of type or level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2 Risk-Based Inspection Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI is a methodology that uses relative risk as a basis for prioritizing and managing the efforts of an inspection
program, including recommendations for monitoring and testing. It provides focus for inspection activity to specifically
address threats to the integrity of the asset and the equipment’s capacity to operate as intended. The POF and COF
are assessed separately and then combined to determine risk of failure. Risk is compared and prioritized for
inspection planning and risk mitigation. Risk mitigation plans may include options in addition to or other than
inspection such as changes in materials of construction, the use of corrosion inhibitors, changes in operating
conditions and fluids, and/or installation of liners and coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An effective RBI program identifies and measures the relative uncertainties associated with ascertaining the condition
of the equipment. An effective program then uses risk to identify and prioritize when those uncertainties must be
reduced, typically by improved knowledge though additional data. This is achieved by improved knowledge about the
degradation rates and condition of equipment via inspection and other monitoring methods, for example,
implementation of integrity operating windows (IOWs), probes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI program includes the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Systems or processes within an operation prioritized by risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Determined risk value or category associated with an equipment item within a system or process based on a
consistent methodology.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Prioritized equipment ranking based on risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Development of an appropriate inspection program to address key risk drivers. A method to systematically
manage risks associated with the operation of process equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI program is based on relative risk rather than a traditional risk analysis, but it uses similar techniques and
combines the disciplines of risk analysis and mechanical integrity based on relative risk. Since RBI is based on
relative risk, it is imperative that analyses are performed consistently. RBI programs can be qualitative, quantitative, or
semi-quantitative, as described below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.3 Qualitative Approach<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This approach requires data inputs based on descriptive information using engineering judgment, subject matter
expertise, and experience as the basis for the analysis of probability and COF. Inputs are often given in data ranges
instead of discrete values. Results are typically given in qualitative terms such as high, medium, and low, although
numerical values may also be associated with these categories. The value of this type of analysis is that it enables
completion of a risk assessment in the absence of detailed quantitative data. The accuracy of results from a
qualitative analysis is dependent on the background and expertise of the risk analysts and team members.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although the qualitative approach is less precise than more quantitative approaches, it is effective in screening out
units and equipment with low risk; being less precise does not always mean that the qualitative method is less
accurate. However, qualitative assessments generally are not as repeatable as quantitative assessments. The
qualitative approach may be used for any aspect of inspection plan development; however, the conservatism
generally associated with the more qualitative approach should be considered when making final mitigation and
inspection plan decisions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.4 Quantitative Approach<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quantitative programs are model-based approaches where numerical values are calculated and more discreet input
data used. The advantages of a quantitative approach are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) calculates, with some precision, when the risk acceptance limit is reached or exceeded;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_30>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>18
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) discrimination between equipment risk allowing prioritization of mitigation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) trending and monitoring risk exposure over time as well as other metrics;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) benchmarking of reliability management such as POF trending and comparisons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quantitative methods are more systematic, consistent, and documented, and they are easier to update with
inspection results than qualitative approaches. A quantitative approach generally uses a software program to
calculate risk and develop inspection program recommendations. The models are initially data-intensive, but use of
models removes repetitive, detailed work from the traditional inspection planning process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quantitative RBI outlines a methodology for prioritizing equipment risk in a risk matrix or ISO-risk plot in addition to
calculating discrete risk values for prioritization from higher to lower risk. POF and COF are combined to produce an
estimate of risk for equipment. Equipment items are ranked based on risk with POF, COF, and risk calculated and
reported separately to aid identification of major contributors to risk, or risk drivers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.5 Semi-quantitative Approach<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Semi-quantitative is a term that describes any approach that has aspects derived from both the qualitative and
quantitative approaches. It is geared to obtain the major benefits of the previous two approaches (e.g. speed of the
qualitative and rigor of the quantitative). Typically, most of the data used in a quantitative approach is needed for this
approach, but in less detail. The models may not be as rigorous as those used for the quantitative approach. The results
are usually given in consequence and probability categories or as risk numbers, but numerical values may be
associated with each category to permit the calculation of risk and the application of appropriate risk acceptance criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.6 Continuum of Approaches<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In practice, an RBI study typically uses aspects of qualitative, quantitative, and semi-quantitative approaches. These
RBI approaches are not considered as competing but rather as complementary. For example, a high level qualitative
approach could be used at a unit level to select the unit within a facility that provides the highest risk for further
analysis. Systems and equipment within the unit then may be screened using a qualitative approach with a more
quantitative approach used for the higher risk items. Another example could be to use a qualitative consequence
analysis combined with a semi-quantitative probability analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When performing risk analysis across different equipment, a single site or multiple sites, the user is cautioned about
comparing specific results unless the same or very similar RBI methodologies and assumptions were applied. The
user is also cautioned against drawing conclusions about different results when different methodologies are used to
evaluate the same piece of equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RBI process, shown in the simplified block diagram in Figure 4, identifies the essential elements of inspection
planning based on risk analysis. This diagram is applicable to Figure 3 regardless of which RBI approach is applied,
i.e. each of the essential elements shown in Figure 4 are necessary for a complete RBI program regardless of
approach (qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Precision vs Accuracy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important to understand the difference between precision and accuracy when it comes to risk analysis. Accuracy
is a function of the analysis methodology, the quality of the data, and consistency of application, while precision is a
function of the selected metrics and computational methods. Risk presented as a precise numeric value (as in a
quantitative analysis) implies a greater level of accuracy when compared to a risk matrix (as in a qualitative analysis).
However, the implied linkage of precision and accuracy may not exist because of the element of uncertainty that is
inherent with probabilities and consequences. The basis for predicted damage and rates, the level of confidence in
inspection data, and the technique used to perform the inspection are all factors that should be considered. In
practice, there are often many extraneous factors that will affect the estimate of damage rate (probability) as well as<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

be beneficial to use quantitative and qualitative methods in a complementary fashion to produce the most effective
and efficient assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quantitative analysis uses logic models to calculate probabilities and consequences of failure. Logic models used to
characterize materials damage of equipment and to determine the COF can have significant variability and therefore
can introduce error and inaccuracy that impacts the quality of the risk assessment. It is important that results from
these logic models are validated by expert judgment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accuracy of any type of RBI analysis depends on using a sound methodology, quality data, and qualified
personnel. These factors are important to any type of RBI methodology selected for application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Understanding How RBI Can Help to Manage Operating Risks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mechanical integrity and functional performance of equipment depends on the suitability of the equipment to
operate safely and reliably under the normal and abnormal (upset) operating conditions to which the equipment is
exposed. In performing an RBI assessment, the susceptibility of equipment to damage by one or more mechanisms
(e.g. corrosion, fatigue, and cracking) is established. The susceptibility of each equipment item should be clearly
defined for the current and projected operating conditions including such factors as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) normal operation,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) upset conditions,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) normal start-up and shutdown,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) idle or out-of-service time,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) emergency shutdown and subsequent start-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Process variables that should be considered for each operating condition include, but are not limited to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) process fluid, contaminants, and aggressive components;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) pressures, including cyclic and transient conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>e) desired unit run length between scheduled shutdowns (turnarounds).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The suitability and current condition of the equipment within the established IOWs will determine the POF (see
Section 11) of the equipment from one or more damage mechanisms. This probability, when coupled with the
associated COF (see Section 10), will determine the operating risk associated with the equipment item (see Section
11) and therefore the need for mitigation, if any, such as inspection, metallurgy change, or change in operating
conditions (see Section 12 and Section 13).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since risk is dynamic (i.e. changes with time), it is vital that any RBI process that is developed or selected for
application have the ability to be easily updated (including changes in the inspection plan) when changes occur or
new information is discovered. Those changes might include such things as the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) new data from inspection activities (i.e. changes in rates of deterioration are noted in external, internal, or on-
stream inspections);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) changes in operation, operating variables, or operation outside of the IOWs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) changes in the process fluids;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) changes in process equipment, including additions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) equipment leaks or failures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any and all of this type of information shall be communicated on a timely basis so that changes in the inspection plan
can be made, as necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 Management of Risks<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.1 Risk Management Through Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One objective of RBI is to direct the management decision-making process of prioritizing resources to manage risk.
Inspection influences the uncertainty of the risk associated with pressure equipment primarily by improving
knowledge of the deterioration state and predictability of the POF. Although inspection does not reduce risk directly, it
is a risk management activity (provider of new information) that may lead to risk reduction. Impending failure of
pressure equipment is not avoided by inspection activities unless the inspection precipitates risk mitigation activities
that change the POF. In-service inspection is primarily concerned with the detection and monitoring of deterioration.
The POF due to such deterioration is a function of the following four factors:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) deterioration type and mechanism;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) rate of deterioration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) probability of identifying and detecting deterioration and predicting future deterioration states with inspection
technique(s);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) tolerance of the equipment to the type of deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2 Using RBI to Establish Inspection Plans and Priorities<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The primary product of an RBI effort should be an inspection plan for each equipment item evaluated. RBI is a logical
and structured process for planning and evaluating inspection activities for pressure equipment. The inspection plan<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_33>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
21<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>should detail the unmitigated risk related to the current operation. For risks considered to be unacceptable, the plan
should contain the mitigation actions that are recommended to reduce the unmitigated risk to acceptable levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For those equipment items where inspection is an effective means of risk management, the plans shall describe the
type, scope, and timing of inspection/examination recommended. Ranking of the equipment by the unmitigated risk
level allows owner-users to assign priorities to the various inspection and/or examination tasks. The level of the
unmitigated risk should be used to evaluate the urgency for performing the inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.3 Evaluation and Fitness-For-Service Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Evaluation of the results of the inspection and examination activities, and conducting an assessment of fitness for
continued service, are also key parts of the RBI process. Although the reduction in uncertainty provided by the
inspection process can help to better quantify the calculated risk, without evaluation of inspection results and
assessment of equipment Fitness-For-Service after the inspection, effective risk reduction may not be accomplished.
The Fitness-For-Service assessment is often accomplished through the knowledge and expertise of the inspector
and engineers involved when deterioration is within known acceptable limits, but on occasion will require an
engineering analysis such as those contained in API 579-1/ASME FFS-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.4 Other Risk Management<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some risks cannot be adequately managed by inspection alone. Examples where inspection may not be sufficient to
manage risks to acceptable levels are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) equipment nearing end of service life;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) failure mechanisms (such as brittle fracture, fatigue) where avoidance of failure primarily depends on design and
operating within a defined pressure/temperature envelope;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) consequence-dominated risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In such cases, non-inspection mitigation actions (such as equipment repair, replacement, or upgrade, equipment
redesign, or maintenance of strict controls on operating conditions) may be the only appropriate measures that can
be taken to reduce risk to acceptable levels. See Section 13 for methods of risk mitigation other than inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7 Relationship Between RBI and Other Risk-Based and Safety Initiatives<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RBI methodology is intended to complement other risk-based and safety initiatives. The output from several of
these initiatives can provide input to the RBI effort, and RBI outputs may be used to improve safety and risk-based
initiatives already implemented by organizations. Examples of some of these other initiatives are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) OSHA PSM programs,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) EPA risk management programs,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) American Chemistry Council (ACC) responsible care,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) ASME risk assessment publications,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

safety integrity level (SIL),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
layers of protection analysis (LOPA).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The relationship between RBI and several initiatives is described in 5.7.2, 5.7.3, and 5.7.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.2 PHA<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A PHA uses a systemized approach to identify and analyze hazards in a process unit. The RBI study can include a
review of the output from any PHA that has been conducted on the unit being evaluated. Hazards associated with
potential equipment failure due to in-service degradation identified in the PHA can be specifically addressed in the
RBI analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Potential hazards identified in a PHA will often affect the POF side of the risk equation. The hazard may result from a
series of events that could cause a process upset, or it could be the result of process design or instrumentation
deficiencies. In either case, the hazard may increase the POF, in which case the RBI assessment could reflect the
same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some hazards identified affect the consequence side of the risk equation. For example, the potential failure of an
isolation valve could increase the inventory of material available for release in the event of a leak. The consequence
calculation in the RBI procedure could be modified to reflect this added hazard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Likewise, the results of an RBI assessment can significantly enhance the overall value of a PHA and help to avoid
duplicate effort by two separate teams looking at the risk of failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.3 PSM<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An effective PSM system can significantly reduce risk levels in a process plant (refer to OSHA 29  CFR  1910.119). RBI
may include methodologies to assess the effectiveness of the management systems in maintaining mechanical
integrity. The results of such a management systems evaluation are factored into the risk determinations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Several of the features of an effective PSM program provide input for an RBI study. Extensive data on the equipment
and the process are required in the RBI analysis, and output from PHA and incident investigation reports increases
the validity of the study. In turn, the RBI program can improve the mechanical integrity aspect of the PSM program. An
effective PSM program includes a well-structured and effective pressure equipment inspection program. The RBI
system will improve the focus of the inspection plan, resulting in a strengthened PSM program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Operating with a comprehensive inspection program should reduce the risks of releases from a facility and should
provide benefits in complying with safety-related initiatives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.4 Equipment Reliability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Equipment reliability programs can provide input to the probability analysis portion of an RBI program. Specifically,
reliability records can be used to develop equipment failure probabilities and leak frequencies. Equipment reliability is
especially important if leaks can be caused by secondary failures, such as loss of utilities. Reliability efforts, such as
RCM/FMEA, can be linked with RBI, resulting in an integrated program to reduce downtime in an operating unit. At
facilities with an effective RBI program, the RCM program can typically focus on the reliability aspects of equipment
other than pressure equipment and perhaps just focus on the reliability aspects of pressure equipment that do not
pertain to loss of containment (e.g. tray damage and valve reliability).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8 Relationship with Jurisdictional Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Codes and legal requirements vary from one jurisdiction to another. In some cases, jurisdictional requirements
mandate specific actions such as the type of inspections and intervals between inspections. In jurisdictions that
permit the application of the API inspection codes and standards, RBI should be an acceptable method for
establishing inspection plans and setting inspection due dates. All users shall review their jurisdictional code and legal<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_35>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
23<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>requirements for acceptability of using RBI for inspection planning purposes. The fact that some jurisdictions may
have some prescriptive time-based rules on inspection intervals do not preclude the user from gaining significant
benefits from the application of RBI, as long as jurisdictional requirements are met and as long as the local
regulations do not specifically prohibit the use of RBI planning. The benefits of applying RBI include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) evidence of sound risk management and integrity monitoring programs that can be used as a basis for advocating
adoption of RBI by jurisdictions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) evidence of fulfilling requirements of meeting specific industry standards as well as other types of asset integrity
programs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) basis for reducing risk further than what may be achieved through time-based inspection rules.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 Planning the RBI Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Getting Started<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section helps an owner-user determine the scope and the priorities for an RBI assessment. Screening is done to
focus the effort. Boundary limits are identified to determine what is vital to include in the assessment. The organizing
process of aligning priorities, screening risks, and identifying boundaries improves the efficiency and effectiveness of
conducting the RBI assessment and its end-results in managing risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI assessment is a team-based process that requires proper skills and knowledge from multiple disciplines, as
outlined in Section 15. At the beginning of the exercise, it is important to answer the following questions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Why the assessment is being done?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) How the RBI assessment will be carried out?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  What knowledge and skills are required for the assessment?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Who is on the RBI team?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) What are their roles in the RBI process?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Who is responsible and accountable for what actions?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Which facilities, assets, and components will be included?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) What data is to be used in the assessment?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
What codes and standards are applicable?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)

<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
How the results will be used?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>m) What is the plan period?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the conclusion of the planning portion of the development of the RBI program, the following should have been
completed:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) establish the objectives of the risk analysis;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_36>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>24
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) identify the physical boundaries;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) identify the operating boundaries;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) develop screening questions and criteria consistent with the objectives of the analysis and identified physical and
operating boundaries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once this portion of the RBI planning process has been completed, the data and information required for collection
should be identified (see Section 7). Note that it may be necessary to revise the objectives, boundaries, screening
questions, and other ongoing assumptions, based upon the availability and quality of the data and information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Establishing Objectives and Goals of an RBI Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI assessment should be undertaken with clear objectives and goals that are fully understood by all members of
the RBI team and by management. Some examples are listed in 6.2.2 to 6.2.9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2 Understand Risks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An objective of the RBI assessment may be to better understand the risks involved in the operation of a plant or
process unit and to understand the effects that inspection, maintenance, and mitigation actions have on the risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>From the understanding of risk, an inspection program may be designed that optimizes the use of inspection and
plant maintenance resources.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3 Define Risk Criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI assessment will determine the risk associated with the items assessed. The RBI team and management may
wish to judge whether the individual equipment item and cumulative risks are acceptable. Establishing risk criteria to
judge acceptability of risk could be an objective of the RBI assessment if such criteria do not exist already within the
user’s company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.4 Management of Risks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the risks are identified, inspection actions and/or other mitigation that have a positive effect in reducing risk to
an acceptable level may be undertaken. These actions may be significantly different from the inspection actions
undertaken during a statutory or certification type inspection program. The results of managing and reducing risk are
improved safety, avoided losses of containment, and avoided commercial losses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.5 Reduce Costs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reducing inspection costs is usually not the primary objective of an RBI assessment, but it is frequently a side effect
of optimization. When the inspection program is optimized based on an understanding of risk, one or more of the
following cost reduction benefits may be realized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Ineffective, unnecessary, or inappropriate inspection activities may be eliminated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Inspection of low-risk items may be eliminated or reduced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Online or noninvasive inspection methods may be substituted for invasive methods that require equipment
shutdown.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) More effective, infrequent inspections may be substituted for less effective, frequent inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.6 Meet Safety and Environmental Management Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Managing risk by using RBI assessment can be useful in implementing an effective inspection program that meets
performance-based safety and environmental requirements. RBI focuses efforts on areas where the greatest risks
exist. RBI provides a systematic method to guide a user in the selection of equipment items to be included and the
frequency, scope, and extent of inspection activities to be conducted to meet performance objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.7 Identify Mitigation Alternatives<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RBI assessment may identify risks that may be managed by actions other than inspection. Some of these
mitigation actions may include but are not limited to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) modification of the process to eliminate conditions driving the risk;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) modification of operating procedures to avoid situations driving the risk;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) chemical treatment of the process to reduce deterioration rates/susceptibilities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) change metallurgy of components to reduce POF;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) removal of unnecessary insulation to reduce probability of corrosion under insulation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
reduce or limit available inventories to reduce COF;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) upgrade safety, detection, or loss limiting systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) change process fluids to less flammable or toxic fluids;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
change component design to reduce POF;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
process control and adherence to IOWs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The data within the RBI assessment can be useful in determining the optimum economic strategy to reduce risk. The
strategy may be different at different times in a plant’s life cycle. For example, it is usually more economical to modify
the process or change metallurgy when a plant is being designed than when it is operating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.8 New Project Risk Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI assessment made on new equipment or a new project, while in the design stage, may yield important
information on potential risks. This may allow potential risks to be minimized by design and have a RBI plan in place
prior to actual installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.9 Facilities End of Life Strategies<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Facilities approaching the end of their economic or operating service life are a special case where application of RBI
can be very useful. The end of life case for plant operation is about gaining the maximum remaining economic benefit
from an asset without undue personnel, environmental, or financial risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>End of life strategies focus the inspection efforts directly on high-risk areas where the inspections will provide a
reduction of risk during the remaining life of the plant. Inspection activities that do not impact risk during the remaining
life are usually eliminated or reduced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_38>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>26
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>End of life inspection RBI strategies may be developed in association with a Fitness-For-Service assessment of
damaged components using methods described in API 579-1/ASME FFS-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important to revisit the RBI assessment if the remaining plant life is extended after the remaining life strategy has
been developed and implemented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Initial Screening<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The screening process focuses the analysis on the most important group of equipment items so that time and
resources are more effectively utilized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2 Establish Physical Boundaries of an RBI Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Boundaries for physical assets included in the assessment are established consistent with the overall objectives. The
level of data to be reviewed and the resources available to accomplish the objectives directly impact the extent of
physical assets that can be assessed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The scope of an RBI assessment may vary between an entire refinery or plant and a single component within a single
piece of equipment. Typically, RBI is done on multiple pieces of equipment (e.g. an entire process unit) rather than on
a single component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.3 Facilities Screening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the facility level, RBI may be applied to all types of plants including but not limited to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) oil and gas production facilities,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) oil and gas processing and transportation terminals,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) refineries,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) petrochemical and chemical plants,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) pipelines and pipeline stations,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
liquefied natural gas plants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Screening at the facility level may be done by a simplified qualitative RBI assessment. Screening at the facility level
could also be done by the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) asset or product value,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) history of problems/failures at each facility,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) PSM/non-PSM facilities,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) age of facilities,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) proximity to the public,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
proximity to environmentally sensitive areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_39>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
27<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of key questions to answer at the facility level are listed as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Is the facility located in a regulatory jurisdiction that will accept modifications to statutory inspection intervals based
on RBI?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Is the management of the facility willing to invest in the resources necessary to achieve the benefits of RBI?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Does the facility have sufficient resources and expertise available to conduct the RBI assessment and sustain the
RBI program?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4 Process Units Screening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the scope of the RBI assessment is a multi-unit facility, the first step in the application of RBI is screening of entire
process units to rank relative risk. The screening points out areas that are higher in priority and suggests which
process units to begin with. It also provides insight about the level of assessment that may be required for operating
systems and equipment items in the various units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Priorities may be assigned based on one of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Relative risk of the process units,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) relative economic impact of the process units,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) relative COF of the process units,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) relative reliability of the process units,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) turnaround schedule,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
experience with similar process units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of key questions to answer at the process unit level are similar to the questions at the facility level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Does the process unit have a significant impact on the operation of the facility?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Are there significant risks involved in the operation of the process unit and would the effect of risk reduction be
measurable?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Do process unit operators see that some benefit may be gained through the application of RBI?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Does the process unit have sufficient resources and expertise available to conduct the RBI assessment?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) What is the failure history in this unit?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.5 Systems Within Process Unit Screening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is often advantageous to group equipment within a process unit into systems, loops, or circuits where common
environmental operating conditions exist based on process chemistry, pressure and temperature, metallurgy,
equipment design, and operating history. By dividing a process unit into systems, the equipment can be screened
together saving time compared to treating each piece of equipment separately. In case the risks of each piece of
equipment in the system show a common sensitivity to changes in process conditions, then a screening can establish
one single IOW with common variables and ranges for the entire system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Block flow or process flow diagrams for the unit may be used to identify the systems including information about
metallurgy, process conditions, credible damage mechanisms, and historical problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_40>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>28
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a process unit is identified for an RBI assessment and overall optimization is the goal, it is usually best to
include all systems within the unit. Practical considerations such as resource availability may require that the RBI
assessment is limited to one or more systems within the unit. Selection of systems may be based on the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) relative risk of the systems,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) relative COF of systems,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) relative reliability of systems,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) expected benefit from applying RBI to a system,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) sensitivities of risk to changes in process conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.6 Equipment Item Screening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most plants, a large percentage of the total unit risk will be concentrated in a relatively small percentage of the
equipment items. These potential high-risk items should receive greater attention in the risk assessment. Screening
of equipment items is sometimes conducted to identify the higher risk items to carry forward to more detailed risk
assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI assessment may be applied to all pressure-containing equipment such as the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) piping,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) pressure vessels,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) reactors,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Whether or not utilities, emergency, and off-plot systems should be included depends on the planned use of the RBI
assessment and the current inspection requirements of the facility. Possible reasons for inclusion of off-plot and
utilities are listed below as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The RBI assessment is being done for an overall optimization of inspection resources and environmental and
business COF are included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) There is a specific reliability problem in a utility system. An example would be a cooling water system with
corrosion and fouling problems. An RBI approach could assist in developing the most effective combination of
inspection, mitigation, monitoring, and treatment for the entire facility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Reliability of the process unit is a major objective of the RBI analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When emergency systems (e.g. flare systems, emergency shutdown systems) are included in the RBI assessment,
their service conditions during both routine operations and upset should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Establish Operating Boundaries<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar to physical boundaries, operating boundaries for the RBI study are established consistent with the study
objectives, level of data to be reviewed, and resources. The purpose of establishing operational boundaries is to
identify key process parameters that may impact deterioration. The RBI assessment normally includes review of both
POF and COF for normal operating conditions. Start-up and shutdown conditions as well as emergency and
nonroutine conditions should also be reviewed for their potential effect on POF and COF.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The operating conditions, including any sensitivity analysis, used for the RBI assessment should be recorded as the
operating limits for the assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Operating within the boundaries is fundamental to the validity of the RBI study as well as good operating practice. It is
vital to establish and monitor key process parameters that may affect equipment integrity to determine whether
operations are maintained within boundaries (i.e. IOWs).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.2 Start-up and Shutdown<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Process conditions during start-up and shutdown can have a significant effect on the risk of a plant especially when
they are more severe (likely to cause accelerated deterioration) than normal conditions, and as such should be
considered for all equipment covered by the RBI assessment. A good example is polythionic acid stress corrosion
cracking (PASCC). The POF for susceptible equipment is controlled by whether mitigation measures are applied
during shutdown procedures to avoid PASCC. Start-up lines are often included within the process piping and their
service conditions during start-up and subsequent operation should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.3 Normal, Upset, and Cyclic Operation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The normal operating conditions may be most easily provided if there is a process flow model or mass balance
available for the plant or process unit. However, the normal operating conditions found on documentation should be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_42>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>30
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>verified by unit operations personnel as it is not uncommon to find discrepancies between design and operating
conditions that could impact the RBI results substantially. The following data should be provided:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) operating temperature and pressure including variation ranges;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) process fluid composition including variation with feed composition ranges;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) flow rates including variation ranges;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) presence of moisture or other contaminant species.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Changes in the process, such as pressure, temperature, or fluid composition, resulting from unit abnormal or upset
conditions should be considered in the RBI assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RBI assessment on systems with cyclic operation, such as reactor regeneration systems, should consider the
complete cyclic range of conditions. Cyclic or intermittent conditions could impact the POF due to some damage
mechanisms (e.g. mechanical fatigue, thermal fatigue, corrosion-fatigue, and corrosion under insulation). Examples
include pressure swing absorption vessels, catalytic reforming unit regeneration piping systems, deaerator vessels,
and insulated equipment that normally operates at higher temperatures but is subjected to periods of inactivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.4 Operating Time Period<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The unit run lengths of the selected process units/equipment is an important limit to consider. The RBI assessment
may include the entire operational life, or may be for a selected period. For example, process units are occasionally
shut down for maintenance activities and the associated run length may depend on the condition of the equipment in
the unit. An RBI analysis may focus on the current run period or may include the current and next-projected run
period. The time period may also influence the types of decisions and inspection plans that result from the study, such
as inspection, repair, replace, operating, and so on. Projected operational changes are also important as part of the
basis for the operational time period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5 Selecting a Type of RBI Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Selection of the type of RBI assessment will be dependent on a variety of factors, such as the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Is the assessment at a facility, process unit, system, equipment item, or component level?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Objective of the assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Availability and quality of data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Resource availability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Perceived or previously evaluated risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Time constraints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A strategy should be developed, matching the type of assessment to the expected or evaluated risk. For example,
processing units that are expected to have lower risk may only require simple, fairly conservative methods to
adequately accomplish the RBI objectives, whereas process units that have a higher expected risk may require more
detailed methods. Another example would be to evaluate all equipment items in a process unit qualitatively and then
evaluate the higher risk items identified more quantitatively. See 5.3 for more on types of RBI assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.6 Estimating Resources and Time Required<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The resources and time required to implement an RBI assessment will vary widely between organizations depending
on a number of factors including the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) implementation strategy/plans.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) knowledge and training of implementers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) availability and quality of necessary data and information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) availability and cost of resources needed for implementation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) amount of equipment included in each level of RBI analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
degree of complexity of RBI analysis selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) degree of precision required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The estimate of scope and cost involved in completing an RBI assessment might include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) number of facilities, units, equipment items, and components to be evaluated;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) time and resources required to gather data for the items to be evaluated;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) training time for implementers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) time and resources required for RBI assessment of data and information;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) time and resources to evaluate RBI assessment results and develop inspection, maintenance, and mitigation plans;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
type of analysis (qualitative, semi-quantitative and/or quantitative) to be conducted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 Data and Information Collection for RBI Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Utilizing the objectives, boundaries, level of approach, and resources identified in Section 6, the objective of this
section is to provide an overview of the data that may be necessary to develop an RBI plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The data collected will provide the information needed to assess potential damage mechanisms, potential failure
modes, and scenarios of failure that are discussed in Section 8. Additionally, it will provide much of the data used in
S ec tion 9 to assess probabilities, the data used in Section 10 to assess consequences, and data used in Section 12
to assist in inspection planning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of data sources include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) design and construction records;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) inspection and maintenance records;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) operating and process technology records;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) hazards analysis and management of change (MOC) records;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Materials selection records, corrosion engineering records, and library/database;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Cost and project engineering records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The precision of the data should be consistent with the RBI method used. The individual or team should understand
the precision of the data needed for the analysis before gathering it. It may be advantageous to combine risk analysis
data gathering with other risk/hazard analysis data gathering (see 5.7) as much of the data may be the same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 RBI Data Needs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI study may use a qualitative, semi-quantitative, and/or quantitative approach (see 5.3). A fundamental
difference among these approaches is the amount and detail of input, calculations, and output.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For each RBI approach it is important to document all bases for the study and assumptions from the onset and to apply
a consistent rationale. Any deviations from prescribed, standard procedures should be documented. Documentation of
unique equipment and piping identifiers is a good starting point for any level of study. The equipment should also
correspond to a unique group or location such as a particular process unit at a particular plant site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical data needed for an RBI analysis may include but is not limited to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) type of equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) materials of construction;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) inspection, repair, and replacement records;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) process fluid compositions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) inventory of fluids;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
operating conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) safety systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) detection systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
damage mechanisms, rates, and severity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
personnel densities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) coating, cladding, and insulation data;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
business interruption cost;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>m) equipment replacement costs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n) environmental remediation costs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.2 Data Needs for Qualitative RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A more qualitative approach typically does not require all of the data mentioned in 7.2. Further, items required only
need to be categorized into broad ranges or classified versus a reference point. It is important to establish a set of
rules to assure consistency in categorization or classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_45>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
33<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, a qualitative analysis using broad ranges requires a higher level of judgment, skill, and understanding from
the user than a more quantitative approach. Ranges and summary fields may evaluate circumstances with widely
varying conditions requiring the user to carefully consider the impact of input on risk results. Therefore, despite its
simplicity, it is important to have qualified persons perform the qualitative RBI analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.3 Data Needs for Quantitative RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quantitative RBI uses logic models depicting combinations of events that could result in severe accidents and
physical models depicting the progression of accidents and the transport of a hazardous material to the environment.
The models are evaluated probabilistically to provide both qualitative and quantitative insights about the level of risk
and to identify the design, site, or operational characteristics that are the most important to risk. Hence, more detailed
information and data are needed for a fully quantitative RBI in order to provide input for the models.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.4 Data Needs for Semi-quantitative RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The semi-quantitative analysis typically requires the same type of data as a quantitative analysis, but generally not as
detailed. For example, the fluid volumes may be estimated. Although the precision of the analysis may be less, the
time required for data gathering and analysis will be less too; however, that does not mean that the analysis will be
less accurate (see 5.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Data Quality<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The data quality has a direct relation to the relative accuracy of the RBI analysis. Although the data requirements are
quite different for the various types of RBI analysis, quality of input data is equally important no matter what approach
to RBI is selected. Data inputs and assumptions shall be validated by qualified personnel such as process engineer/
operator to review operating parameters used (see Section 15).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As is true in any inspection program, data validation is essential for a number of reasons. Among the reasons for
inspection data quality errors are the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) outdated drawings and documentation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) errors within inspection planning, execution, and documentation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) clerical and data transcription errors;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) measurement equipment accuracy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another potential source of scatter and error in the analysis is assumptions on equipment history. For example, if
baseline inspections were not performed or documented, nominal thickness may be used for the original thickness.
This assumption can significantly impact the calculated corrosion rate early in the equipment life. The effect may be to
mask a high corrosion rate or to inflate a low corrosion rate. A similar situation exists when the remaining life of a
piece of equipment with a low corrosion rate requires inspection more frequently. The measurement error may result
in the calculated corrosion rate appearing artificially high or low. It is important that those making assumptions
understand the potential impact of their assumptions on the risk calculation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This validation step stresses the need for a qualified person comparing data from the inspections to the expected
damage mechanism and rates. This person may also compare the results with previous measurements on that
system, similar systems at the site, or within the company or published data. Statistics may be useful in this review.
This review should also factor in any changes or upsets in the process. As mentioned previously, this data validation
step is necessary for the quality of any inspection program, not just RBI. Unfortunately, when this data validation step
has not been a priority before RBI, the time required to do it gets included with the time and resources necessary to
do a good job on RBI, leaving the wrong impression with some managers believing that RBI is more time consuming
and expensive than it should be.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Codes and Standards—National and International<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the data collection stage, an assessment of what codes and standards are currently in use for in-service inspection
and evaluation, or were in use during the equipment design, is generally necessary. The selection and type of codes
and standards used by a facility can have a significant impact on RBI results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 Sources of Site-specific Data and Information<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Information for RBI can be found in many places within a facility. It is important to stress that the precision of the data
should match the complexity of the RBI method used (see 5.4). The risk analysis and RBI team should understand
the sensitivity of the data needed for the program before gathering any data. It may be advantageous to combine RBI
data gathering with other risk/hazard analysis data gathering [e.g. PHA, RCM, quantitative risk assessment (QRA)] as
much of the data overlaps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8 Damage Mechanisms and Failure Modes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section provides guidance in identifying credible damage mechanisms and failure modes of pressure boundary
metallic components that are included in an RBI analysis. Guidance is also provided in other documents. Damage
mechanisms in the hydrocarbon process industry are addressed in API 571. ASME PCC-3 also has some useful
information and appendices on damage mechanisms. See 15.2.4 for the type of person with knowledge in materials
and corrosion that should be involved in the process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Damage mechanisms include corrosion, cracking, mechanical, and metallurgical damage. Understanding damage
mechanisms is important for the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) analysis of the POF;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) selection of appropriate inspection intervals/due dates, locations, and techniques;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) decision-making ability (e.g. modifications to process, materials selection, monitoring, etc.) that can eliminate or
reduce the probability of a specific damage mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Failure modes identify how the damaged component will fail (e.g. by leakage or by rupture). Understanding failure
modes is important for the following three reasons:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) analysis of the COF,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) run-or-repair decision-making,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) selection of repair techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.2 Identification of Damage Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Identification of the credible damage  3  mechanisms and failure modes for equipment included in a risk analysis is
essential to the quality and the effectiveness of the risk analysis. The RBI team shall consult with a corrosion
specialist to define the equipment damage mechanisms, damage modes (optional), and potential failure modes. A
sequential approach is as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Equipment design (pressures, temperature, and materials of construction) and current condition shall be
considered. Data used and assumptions made shall be validated and documented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) All process conditions, e.g. start-up, shut-down, idle, anticipated abnormal and normal, as well as planned
process changes shall be considered. Identifying trace constituents (ppm) in addition to the primary constituents in
a process can be very important as trace constituents can have a significant effect on the damage mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Considering the materials, methods, and details of fabrication, a list of the credible damage mechanisms that may
have been present in past operation, be presently active, or may become active shall be developed including the
rate of deterioration for primary damage mechanisms and the tolerance of the equipment to the type of damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Under certain circumstances, it may be preferable to list a specific damage mechanism and then list the various
damage modes or ways that the damage mechanism may manifest itself. For example, the damage mechanism<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3
Deterioration or degradation is sometimes used as a synonym for damage. However, damage mechanism is used throughout
this document for consistency. The term “aging mechanism” is used in some industries to identify a subset of mechanisms that
are dependent upon long-term exposure at specific temperatures or cyclic stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_49>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
37<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>“corrosion under insulation” may precipitate a damage mode of either generalized corrosion or localized corrosion.
Generalized corrosion could result in a large burst, while localized corrosion might be more likely to result in a
pinhole type leak. All credible failure modes for each damage mechanism or damage mode should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) It is often possible to have two or more damage mechanisms at work on the same piece of equipment or piping
component at the same time. An example of this could be stress corrosion cracking in combination with
generalized or localized corrosion (thinning or pitting).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Damage Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Understanding equipment operation and the interaction with the process environment (both internal and external) and
mechanical environment is key to identifying damage mechanisms. Process specialists can provide useful input
(such as the spectrum of process conditions, injection points, etc.) to aid corrosion specialists in the identification of
credible damage mechanisms and rates. For example, understanding that localized thinning may be caused by the
method of fluid injection and agitation may be as important as knowing the corrosion mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Failure Modes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once a credible damage mechanism(s) has been identified, the associated failure mode should also be identified. For
example, local thinning could lead to a pinhole leak in the pressure-containing boundary. There may be more than
one credible failure mode for each damage mechanism. For example, cracking could lead to a through-wall crack with
a leak before break scenario or could lead to a rupture. The failure mode will depend on the type of cracking, the
geometric orientation of the cracking, the properties of the material of construction, the component thickness, the
temperature, and the stress level. Examples of failure modes include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) pinhole leak,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) small to moderate leak,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) large leak,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) ductile rupture,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The risk analysis may, at the discretion of the owner-user, also include failures other than loss of containment, such
as loss of function, tray damage, demister pad failures, coalescer element failures, liquid distribution hardware
failures, and heat exchanger tube leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4 Accumulated Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Damage rates may vary as damage mechanisms progress (i.e. various mechanisms may accelerate or slow or stop
completely). In some cases, damage by one mechanism may progress to a point at which a different mechanism
takes over and begins to dominate the rate of damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An evaluation of damage mechanisms and failure modes should include the cumulative effect of each mechanism
and/or mode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5 Tabulating Results<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The results of a damage mechanisms and failure modes analysis for RBI should identify the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9 Assessing Probability of Failure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 Introduction to Probability Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The probability analysis in an RBI program is performed to estimate the probability of a specific adverse consequence
resulting from a loss of containment that occurs due to damage mechanism(s). The probability that a specific
consequence will occur is the product of the POF and the probability of the scenario under consideration, assuming
that the failure has occurred. This section provides guidance only on determining the POF. Guidance on determining
the probability of specific consequences is provided in Section 11.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The POF analysis shall address all credible damage mechanisms to which the equipment being reviewed is or can be
susceptible. Further, it shall address the situation where equipment is or can be susceptible to multiple damage
mechanisms (e.g. thinning and creep). The analysis should be credible, repeatable, and documented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It should be noted that damage mechanisms are not the only causes of loss of containment. Other causes of loss of
containment could include but are not limited to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) seismic activity,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) weather extremes,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) overpressure due to pressure-relief device failure,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>These and other causes of loss of containment may have an impact on the POF and may be (but typically are not)
included in the POF analysis for RBI.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2 Units of Measure in the POF Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>POF is typically expressed in terms of frequency. Frequency is expressed as a number of events occurring during a
specific timeframe. For probability analysis, the timeframe is typically expressed as a fixed interval (e.g. one year) and
the frequency is expressed as events per interval (e.g. 0.0002 failures per year). The timeframe may also be
expressed as an occasion (e.g. one run length) and the frequency would be events per occasion (e.g. 0.03 failures
per run). For a qualitative analysis, the POF may be categorized (e.g. high, medium, and low, or one through five).
However, even in this case, it is appropriate to associate an event frequency with each probability category to provide
guidance to the individuals who are responsible for determining the probability. If this is done, the change from one
category to the next could be one or more orders of magnitude or other appropriate demarcations that will provide
adequate discrimination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two examples of this are listed in Table 1 and Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following paragraphs discuss different approaches to the determination of probability. For the purposes of the
discussion, these approaches have been categorized as “qualitative” or “quantitative.” However, it should be
recognized that “qualitative” and “quantitative” are the end points of a continuum rather than distinctive approaches
(see Figure 3). Most probability assessments use a blend of qualitative and quantitative approaches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The methodology used for the assessment should be structured so that a sensitivity analysis or other approach may
be used to assure that realistic, though conservative, probability values are obtained (see 11.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.2 Qualitative POF Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A qualitative method involves identification of the units, systems, or equipment, the materials of construction, and the
corrosive components of the processes. Based on knowledge of the operating history, future inspection and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>maintenance plans, and possible materials deterioration, POF can be assessed separately for each unit, system,
equipment grouping, or individual equipment item. Engineering judgment is the basis for this assessment. A POF
category can then be assigned for each unit, system, grouping, or equipment item. Depending on the methodology
employed, the categories may be described with words (such as high, medium, or low) or may have numerical
descriptors (such as 0.1 to 0.01 times per year).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.3 Quantitative POF Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are several approaches to a quantitative probability analysis. One example is to take a probabilistic approach
where specific failure data or expert solicitations are used to calculate a POF. These failure data may be obtained on
the specific equipment item in question or on similar equipment items. This probability may be expressed as a
distribution rather than a single deterministic value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another approach is used when inaccurate or insufficient failure data exists on the specific item of interest. In this
case, general industry, company, or manufacturer failure data is used. A methodology should be applied to assess the
ap p licability of these general data. As appropriate, this failure data should be adjusted and made specific to the
equipment being analyzed by increasing or decreasing the predicted failure frequencies based on equipment-specific
information. In this way, general failure data is used to generate an adjusted failure frequency that is applied to
equipment for a specific application. Such modifications to general values may be made for each equipment item to
account for the potential deterioration that may occur in the particular service and the type and effectiveness of
inspection and/or monitoring performed. Qualified persons should make these modifications on a case-by-case basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4 Determination of POF<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Regardless of whether a more qualitative or a quantitative analysis is used, the POF is determined by two main
considerations, as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Damage mechanisms and rates of the equipment item’s material of construction, resulting from its operating
environment (internal and external).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Effectiveness of the inspection program to identify and monitor the damage mechanisms so that the equipment
can be repaired or replaced prior to failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Analyzing the effect of in-service deterioration and inspection on the POF involves the following steps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Identify active and credible damage mechanisms that are reasonably expected to occur during the time period
being considered (considering normal and upset conditions).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Determine the deterioration susceptibility and rate. For example, a fatigue crack is driven by cyclic stress;
corrosion damage is driven by the temperature, concentration of corrosive, corrosion current, etc. A damage
accumulation rule may be available to mathematically model this process. Rather than a given value of the
magnitude of the damage mechanism driving forces, a statistical distribution of these forces may be available (see
API 579-1/ASME FFS-1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Using a consistent approach, evaluate the effectiveness of the past inspection, maintenance, and process
monitoring program and a proposed future inspection, maintenance, and process monitoring program. It is usually
necessary to evaluate the POF considering several alternative future inspection and maintenance strategies,
possibly including a “no inspection or maintenance” strategy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Determine the probability that with the current condition, continued deterioration at the predicted/expected rate will
exceed the damage tolerance of the equipment and result in a failure. The failure mode (e.g. small leak, large
leak, equipment rupture) should be determined based on the damage mechanism. It may be desirable in some
cases to determine the probability of more than one failure mode and combine the risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
41<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4.2 Determine the Deterioration Susceptibility and Rate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Combinations of process conditions and existing materials of construction for each equipment item shall be evaluated to
identify active and credible damage mechanisms. One method of determining these mechanisms and susceptibility is to
group components that have the same material of construction and are exposed to the same internal and external
environment. Inspection results from one item in the group can be related to the other equipment in the group.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For many damage mechanisms, the rate of damage progression is generally understood and can be estimated for
process plant equipment. Deterioration rate can be expressed in terms of corrosion rate for thinning or susceptibility
for mechanisms where the deterioration rate is unknown or immeasurable (such as stress corrosion cracking).
Susceptibility is often designated as high, medium, or low based on the environmental conditions and material of
construction combination. Fabrication variables and repair history are also important.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The deterioration rate in specific process equipment is often not known with certainty. The ability to state the rate of
deterioration precisely is affected by equipment complexity, type of damage mechanism, process and metallurgical
variations, inaccessibility for inspection, limitations of inspection and test methods, and the inspector’s expertise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sources of deterioration rate information include (also see Section 7) the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) published data and unpublished company data,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) laboratory testing,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) in situ testing and in-service monitoring,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) experience with similar equipment,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) previous inspection data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The best information will come from operating experiences where the conditions that led to the observed deterioration
rate could realistically be expected to occur in the equipment under consideration. Other sources of information could
include databases of plant experience or reliance on expert opinion. The latter method is often used since plant
databases, where they exist, sometimes do not contain sufficiently detailed information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Damage rates will often vary as the mechanism progresses. In some cases, the mechanism is self-limiting (i.e. after
progressing to a certain point), and damage will nearly arrest. In other cases, damage will occur in a slow, stable
manner until it reaches a point where failure occurs. In some cases, damage by one mechanism may progress to a
point at which a different mechanism takes over to control the rate of further damage (e.g. pitting that gives rise to
stress corrosion cracking).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following applicable parameters should be considered in the determination of damage rates:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) fluid stream composition, including electrolytes and ions in solution;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) temperature, humidity, and corrosiveness of the atmosphere or soil;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) process temperature;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) flow velocity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>s) existence and quality of IOWs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4.3 Determine Failure Mode<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>POF analysis is used to evaluate the failure mode (e.g. small hole, crack, rupture) and the probability that each failure
mode will occur. It is important to link the damage mechanism to the most likely resulting failure mode. For example:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) pitting generally leads to small-hole-sized leaks;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) stress corrosion cracking can develop into small, through wall cracks or, in some cases, rupture;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) metallurgical deterioration and mechanical damage can lead to failure modes that vary from small holes to
ruptures;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) general thinning from corrosion often leads to larger leaks or rupture;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) localized corrosion can lead to small- to medium-sized leaks and up to ruptures, depending upon the location and
size of the localized corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Failure mode primarily affects the magnitude of the consequences. For this and other reasons, the probability and
consequence analyses should be worked interactively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4.4 Determine the Effectiveness of Past Inspections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspections [the combination of nondestructive examination (NDE) methods such as visual, ultrasonic (UT),
radiographic, etc., frequency, and coverage/location of inspections] vary in their effectiveness for locating,
characterizing, and sizing deterioration, and thus for determining deterioration rates. After the likely damage
mechanisms have been identified, the inspections shall be evaluated to determine the effectiveness in finding the
identified mechanisms. Reduction in uncertainty of the damage state of a component is a function of the effectiveness
of the inspection in detecting, characterizing, and quantifying the type and extent of the damage. Inspection<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_55>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
43<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>techniques are designed to look for specific types of damage, e.g. thinning, cracking. An inspection technique that is
appropriate for general thinning will not be very effective in detecting and quantifying damage due to local thinning or
cracking. Therefore, the effectiveness of inspections is determined for each type of damage mechanism and is a
function of the type of technique used and the extent of coverage (reference API 581 Part 2, Annex 2.C for
informative examples of inspection effectiveness).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Limitations in the effectiveness of an inspection could be due to the following items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Lack of coverage of an area subject to deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Inherent limitations of some inspection methods to detect and quantify certain types of deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Selection of inappropriate inspection methods, techniques, and tools.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Application of methods and tools by inadequately trained inspection personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Inadequate inspection and examination procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Noncompliance with inspection and examination procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Deterioration rate under some extremes of conditions is so high that failure can occur within a very short time.
Even though no deterioration is found during an inspection, failure could still occur as a result of a change or upset
in conditions. For example, if a very aggressive acid is carried over from a corrosion-resistant part of a system into
a downstream vessel that is made of carbon steel, rapid corrosion could result in failure in a few hours or days .
Similarly, if an aqueous chloride solution is carried into a stainless steel vessel, chloride stress corrosion cracking
could occur very rapidly (depending on the temperature).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Deterioration rate under some extremes of conditions is so high that failure can occur within a very short time.
Even though no deterioration is found during an inspection, failure could still occur as a result of a change or upset
in conditions. For example, if a very aggressive acid is carried over from a corrosion-resistant part of a system into
a downstream vessel that is made of carbon steel, rapid corrosion could result in failure in a few hours or days.
Similarly, if an aqueous chloride solution is carried into a stainless steel vessel, chloride stress corrosion cracking
could occur very rapidly (depending on the temperature).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If multiple inspections have been performed, it is important to recognize that the most recent inspection may best
reflect current operating conditions. If operating conditions have changed, deterioration rates based on inspection
data from the previous operating conditions may not be valid and in those cases revised as necessary for use in the
POF analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Determination of effectiveness of inspections should consider the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) equipment type;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) active and credible damage mechanism(s);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) rate of deterioration or susceptibility;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) NDE methods, coverage, and frequency (i.e. ability to detect the specific deterioration);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) accessibility to expected deterioration areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effectiveness of future inspections can be optimized by utilization of NDE methods better suited for the active/
credible damage mechanisms, adjusting the inspection coverage, adjusting the inspection frequency, or some
combination thereof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>By combining the expected damage mechanism, rate or susceptibility, process monitoring, inspection data, and
effectiveness of inspections, POF can now be determined for each deterioration type and failure mode. The POF may
be determined for future time periods or conditions as well as current operating conditions. It is important for users to
validate that the method used to calculate the POF is in fact thorough and adequate for the owner-users’ needs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10 Assessing Consequence of Failure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1 Introduction to Consequence Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The consequence analysis in an RBI program is performed to provide discrimination between equipment items on the
basis of the significance of a potential failure. The consequence analysis should be a repeatable, simplified, credible
estimate of what might be expected to happen if a failure were to occur in the equipment item being assessed. The
COF analysis shall be performed to estimate the consequences that are likely to occur due to a failure mode typically
resulting from an identified damage mechanism(s) (see Section 8). Consequence should typically be categorized as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) safety and health impacts,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) environmental impacts,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) economic impacts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, an RBI program will be managed by plant inspectors or inspection engineers, who will normally manage
risk by managing the POF with inspection and maintenance planning. They will not normally have much ability to
modify the COF. On the other hand, management and process safety personnel may desire to manage the
consequence side of the risk equation. Numerous methods for modifying the COF are mentioned in Section 13. For
all of these users, the consequence analysis is an aid in establishing a relative risk ranking of equipment items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>More or less complex and detailed methods of consequence analysis can be used, depending on the desired
application for the assessment. The consequence analysis method chosen should have a demonstrated ability to
provide the required level of discrimination between higher and lower consequence equipment items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1.2 Loss of Containment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The consequence of loss of containment is generally evaluated as loss of fluid to the external environment. The
consequence effects for loss of containment can be generally considered to be in the following categories:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) safety and health impact,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) environmental impact,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) production losses,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) maintenance and reconstruction costs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1.3 Other Functional Failures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although RBI is mainly concerned with loss of containment failures, other functional failures could be included in an
RBI study if a user desired. Other functional failures could include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Functional or mechanical failure of internal components of pressure-containing equipment (e.g. column trays, de-
mister mats, coalescer elements, distribution hardware, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_57>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
45<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Heat exchanger tube failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Situations where a heat exchanger tube failure could lead to a loss of containment of the heat exchanger or
ancillary equipment. These would typically involve leakage from a high-pressure side to a low-pressure side of the
exchanger and subsequent breach of containment of the low-pressure side. Heat exchanger tube failures may
result in contamination of the cooling water system with hydrocarbon/toxic materials and consequent loss of
containment with safety, health, and environmental impacts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Pressure-relief device failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Rotating equipment failure (e.g. seal leaks, impeller failures, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These other functional failures are usually covered within RCM programs and therefore are not covered in detail in
this document.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2 Types of Consequence Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following paragraphs discuss different approaches to the determination of COF. For the purposes of the
discussion, these approaches have been categorized as “qualitative” or “quantitative.” However, it should be
recognized that “qualitative” and “quantitative” are the end points of a continuum rather than distinctive approaches
(see Figure 3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.2 Qualitative Consequences Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A qualitative method involves identification of the units, systems, or equipment, and the hazards present as a result of
operating conditions and process fluids. On the basis of expert knowledge and experience, the consequences of
failure (safety, health, environmental, and financial impacts) can be estimated separately for each unit, system,
equipment group, or individual equipment item.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For a qualitative method, a consequences category (such as “A” through “E” or “high,” “medium,” or “low”) is typically
assigned for each unit, system, grouping, or equipment item. It may be appropriate to associate a numerical value,
such as cost (see 10.3.3), with each consequence category.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.3 Quantitative Consequences Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A quantitative method involves using a logic model depicting combinations of events to represent the effects of failure
on people, property, the business, and the environment. Quantitative models usually contain one or more standard
failure scenarios or outcomes and calculate COF based on the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) type of process fluid in equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) state of the process fluid inside the equipment (solid, liquid, or gas);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) key properties of process fluid (molecular weight, boiling point, autoignition temperature, ignition energy, density,
flammability, toxicity, etc.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) process operating variables such as temperature and pressure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) mass of inventory available for release in the event of a leak;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
failure mode and resulting leak size;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) state of fluid after release in ambient conditions (solid, gas, or liquid).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_58>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>46
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Results of a quantitative analysis are usually numeric. Consequence categories may be also used to organize more
quantitatively assessed consequences into manageable groups.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3 Units of Measure in Consequence Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Different types of consequences may be described best by different measures. The RBI analyst should consider the
nature of the hazards present and select appropriate units of measure. However, the analyst should bear in mind that
the resultant consequences should be comparable, as much as possible, for subsequent risk prioritization and
inspection planning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following provide some units of measure of consequence that can be used in an RBI assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.2 Safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety consequences are often expressed as a numerical value or characterized by a consequence category
associated with the severity of potential injuries that may result from an undesirable event.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For example, safety consequences could be expressed based on the severity of an injury (e.g. fatality, serious injury,
medical treatment, first aid) or expressed as a category linked to the injury severity (e.g. A through E). An approach
for assigning monetary values to safety and health consequences is included in API 581. However, the FAA has
published material on this topic. If it is necessary to convert safety and health consequences into monetary units for
subsequent risk ranking or analysis, the analyst should document the basis for the values assigned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.3 Cost<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cost is commonly used as an indicator of potential consequences. Consequence may be expressed in relative
monetary units (e.g. dollars) to the maximum extent practical with an understanding that the numbers are typically not
absolute. For example, low, moderate, and high categories could be assigned values of $100,000; $1,000,000; and
$10,000,000, respectively. This will permit adding the different consequences of a single event and facilitate
comparisons of risk from one process unit to another. Potential injuries and fatalities may be considered separately,
with a maximum acceptable probability of occurrence assigned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is possible, although not always credible, to assign costs to almost any type of consequence. Typical consequences
that can be expressed in “cost” include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) production loss due to rate reduction or downtime;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) deployment of emergency response equipment and personnel;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) lost product from a release;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The above list is reasonably comprehensive, but in practice some of these costs are neither practical nor necessary
to use in an RBI assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cost generally requires fairly detailed information to fully assess. It is possible, although not always practical, to assign a
monetary value to almost any type of consequence. The cost associated with most of the consequences listed above
can be calculated using standard methods. Information such as product value, capacity, equipment costs, repair costs,
personnel resources, and environmental damage may be difficult to derive, and the manpower required to perform a
complete financial-based consequence analysis may be limited depending on the complexity of the relationship of failure
to lost opportunity cost. However, expressing consequences in monetary units has the advantage of permitting a direct
comparison of the various categories of consequences on a common basis. Therefore, it is often better to provide
approximations or “best estimates” than to use only verbal descriptions (see 10.2.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instead of determining point values or unique ranges of economic loss for each consequence scenario,
consequences may be placed into categories that have pre-defined ranges. Table 3 provides an example of this. The
ranges may be adjusted for the unit or plant to be considered. For example, $10,000,000 may be considered a severe
loss for a small company, but a severe loss for a large company may be considered greater than $1,000,000,000.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.4 Affected Area<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Affected area is also used to describe potential consequences in the field of risk assessment. As its name implies,
affected area represents the amount of surface area of the plot plan that experiences an effect (toxic dose, thermal
radiation, explosion overpressure, etc.) greater than a pre-defined limiting value. Based on the thresholds chosen,
anything (i.e. personnel, equipment, and environment) within the area will be affected by the consequences of the
hazard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to rank consequences according to affected area, it is typically assumed that equipment or personnel at risk
are evenly distributed throughout the unit. A more rigorous approach would assign a population density with time or
equipment value density to different areas of the unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The units for affected area consequence (square feet or square meters) do not readily translate into our everyday
experiences and thus there is some reluctance to use this measure. It has, however, several features that merit<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>consideration. The affected area approach has the characteristic of being able to compare toxic and flammable
consequences by relating to the physical area impacted by a release. A drawback for area consequences is that it
does not include the business impact of failure, which can often be the largest portion of total consequence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.5 Environmental Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Environmental consequence measures are the least developed among those currently used for RBI. A common unit
of measure for environmental damage is not available in the current technology, making environmental
consequences difficult to assess. Typical parameters used that provide an indirect measure of the degree of
environmental damage are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) acres of land affected per year;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) miles of shoreline affected per year;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) number of biological or human-use resources consumed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) portrayal of environmental damage almost invariably leads to the use of cost, in terms of dollars per year, for the
loss and restoration of environmental resources.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.6 Categorizing Safety, Health, and Environmental Consequences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of placing safety, health, and environmental consequences into categories are provided in Table 4 and

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) future insurability,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) regulatory actions curtailing production or raising costs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4 Volume of Fluid Released<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most consequence evaluations, a key element in determining the magnitude of the consequence is the volume of
fluid released. The volume released is typically derived from a combination of the following items below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) volume of fluid available for release (Volume of fluid in the piece of equipment and connected equipment items. In
theory, this is the amount of fluid between isolation valves that can be quickly closed.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) failure mode;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) leak rate;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) detection and isolation time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some cases, the volume released will be the same as the volume available for release. Usually, there are
safeguards and procedures in place so that the breach of containment can be isolated and the volume released will
be less than the volume available for release. The cost of the lost fluid may be calculated by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>loss of fluid = volume of fluid lost  ×  value of fluid per unit volume<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5 Consequence Effect Categories<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The failure of the pressure boundary and subsequent release of fluids may cause safety, health, environmental,
facility, and business damage. The RBI analyst should consider the nature of the hazards and assure that appropriate
factors are considered for the equipment, system, unit, or plant being assessed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Regardless of whether a more qualitative or quantitative analysis is used, the major factors to consider in evaluating
the consequences of failure shall include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) flammable events (fire and explosion),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) toxic releases,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) release of other hazardous fluids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Additionally, other impacts that may be considered include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) environmental consequences,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) production consequences (business interruption),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) maintenance and reconstruction impact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5.2 Flammable Events (Fire and Explosion)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flammable events occur when both a leak and ignition occur. The ignition could be through an ignition source or auto-
ignition. Flammable events can cause damage in two ways: thermal radiation and blast overpressure. Most of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_62>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>50
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>damage from thermal effects tends to occur at close range, but blast effects can cause damage over a larger distance
from the blast center. The following are typical categories of fire and explosion events:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) vapor cloud explosion,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) pool fire,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) jet fire,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) flash fire,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The flammable events consequence is typically derived from a combination of the following elements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) inherent tendency to ignite,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) volume of fluid released,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) ability to flash to a vapor,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) possibility of auto-ignition,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) effects of higher pressure or higher temperature operations,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
engineered safeguards,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) personnel and equipment exposed to damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5.3 Toxic Releases<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In RBI, toxic releases are only addressed when they affect personnel (site and public). These releases can cause
effects at greater distances than flammable events. Unlike flammable releases, toxic releases do not require an
additional event (e.g. ignition, as in the case of flammables) to cause personnel injuries. The RBI program typically
focuses on acute toxic risks that create an immediate danger, rather than chronic risks from low-level exposures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The toxic consequence is typically derived from the following elements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) volume of fluid released and toxicity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) ability to disperse under typical process and environmental conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) detection and mitigation systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) population in the vicinity of the release.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5.4 Releases of Other Hazardous Fluids<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other hazardous fluid releases are of most concern in RBI assessments when they affect personnel. These materials
can cause thermal or chemical burns if a person comes in contact with them. Common fluids, including steam, hot
water, acids, and caustics can have a safety consequence of a release and should be considered as part of an RBI
program. Generally, the consequence of this type of release is significantly lower than for flammable or toxic releases<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_63>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
51<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>because the affected area is likely to be much smaller and the magnitude of the hazard is less. Key parameters in this
evaluation are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) volume of fluid released;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) personnel density in the area;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) type of fluid and nature of resulting injury;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) safety systems (e.g. personnel protective clothing, showers, etc.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) environmental damage if the spill is not contained;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
equipment damage (for some reactive fluids, contact with equipment or piping may result in aggressive
deterioration and failure).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5.5 Environmental Consequences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Environmental consequences are an important component to any consideration of overall risk in a processing plant.
The RBI program typically focuses on acute and immediate environmental risks, rather than chronic risks from low-
level emissions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The environmental consequence is typically derived from the following elements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) volume of fluid released;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) ability to flash to vapor;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) leak containment safeguards;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) environmental resources affected;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) regulatory consequence (e.g. citations for violations, fines, potential shutdown by authorities).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Liquid releases may result in contamination of soil, groundwater, and/or open water. Gaseous releases are equally
important but more difficult to assess since the consequence typically relates to local regulatory constraints and the
penalty for exceeding those constraints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The consequences of environmental damage are best understood by cost. The cost may be calculated as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>environmental cost = cost for cleanup + fines + other costs<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cleanup cost will vary depending on many factors. Some key factors are listed as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) type of spill—aboveground, belowground, surface water, etc.,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) type of liquid,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) method of cleanup,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) volume of spill,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) accessibility and terrain at the spill location.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fine component cost will depend on the regulations and laws of the applicable local and federal jurisdictions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_64>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>52
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The other cost component would include costs that may be associated with the spill such as litigation from
landowners or other parties. This component is typically specific to the locale of the facility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5.6 Production (Business Interruption) Consequences<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Production consequences generally occur with any loss of containment of the process fluid and often with a loss of
containment of a utility fluid (water, steam, fuel gas, acid, caustic, etc.). These production consequences may be in
addition to or independent of flammable, toxic, hazardous, or environmental consequences. The main production
consequences for RBI are financial.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The financial consequences could include the value of the lost process fluid and business interruption. The cost of the
lost fluid can be calculated fairly easily by multiplying the volume released by the value of the fluid lost. Calculation of
the business interruption is more complex. The selection of a specific method depends on the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the scope and level of detail of the study,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) availability of business interruption data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This equation is a simple method for estimating the business interruption consequence:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>business interruption = process unit daily value  ×  downtime (days)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The unit daily value could be on a revenue or profit basis. The downtime estimate would represent the time required
to get back into production. The Dow Fire and Explosion Index is a typical method of estimating downtime after a fire
or explosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>More rigorous methods for estimating business interruption consequences may take into account factors such as the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) ability to compensate for damaged equipment (e.g. spare equipment, rerouting, etc.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) potential for damage to nearby equipment (knock-on damage);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) potential for production loss to other units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Site-specific circumstances should be considered in the business interruption analysis to avoid overstating or under-
stating this consequence. Examples of these considerations include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Lost production may be compensated at another under-utilized or idle facility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Loss of profit could be compounded if other facilities use the unit’s output as a feedstock or processing fluid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Repair of small damage cost equipment may take as long as large damage cost equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Extended downtime may result in losing customers or market share, thus extending loss of profit beyond
production restart.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Loss of hard-to-get or unique equipment items may require extra time to obtain replacements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.5.7 Maintenance and Reconstruction Impact<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Maintenance and reconstruction impact represents the effort required to correct the failure and to fix or replace
equipment damaged in the subsequent events (e.g. fire, explosion). The maintenance and reconstruction impact
should be accounted for in the RBI program. Maintenance impact will generally be measured in monetary terms and
typically includes the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) repairs,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) equipment replacement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6 Determination of COF<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The consequences of releasing a hazardous material can be estimated in six steps (see Figure 5), with each step
performed using the assumption of a specific scenario, and the steps should be repeated for each credible scenario.
The steps are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) estimate the release rate;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) estimate total volume of fluid that will be released;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) determine if the fluid is dispersed in a rapid manner (instantaneous) or slowly (continuous);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) determine if the fluid disperses in the atmosphere as a liquid or a gas;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) estimate the impacts of any existing mitigation system;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
estimate the consequences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6.2 Factors for Estimating Consequence<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Estimate the consequence of a failure from equipment items considering such factors as physical properties of the
contained material, its toxicity and flammability, type of release and release duration, weather conditions and
dispersion of the released contents, escalation effects, and mitigation actions. Consider the impact on plant personnel
and equipment, population in the nearby communities, and the environment. Lost production, loss of raw material,
and other losses should also be considered. Several credible consequence scenarios may result from a single failure
mode (release), and consequences should be determined by constructing one or more scenarios to describe a
credible series of events following the initial failure. For example, a failure may be a small hole resulting from general
corrosion. If the contained fluid is flammable, the consequence scenarios could include: small release without ignition,
small release with ignition, and small release with ignition and subsequent failure (rupture) of the equipment item. The
following shows how a consequence scenario may be constructed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Consequence Phase 1—Discharge: Consider the type of discharge (sudden vs slow release of contents) and its
duration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Consequence Phase 2—Dispersion: Consider the dispersion of the released contents due to weather conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Consequence Phase 3—Flammable Events: The consequences should be estimated for the scenario based on
the flammability of the released contents (i.e. impact of a resulting fire or explosion on plant personnel and
equipment, community, environment); see 10.5.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Consequence Phase 4—Toxic Releases: The consequences should be estimated for the scenario based on the
toxicity of the released contents (i.e. impact due to toxicity on plant personnel, community, and the environment);
see 10.5.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Consequence Phase 5—Releases of Other Hazardous Fluids: The consequences should be estimated for the
scenario based on the characteristics of the released contents (i.e. impact due to thermal or chemical burns on
plant personnel, community, and the environment); see 10.5.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Consequence Phase 6—The potential number of fatalities and injuries resulting from each scenario should be
estimated. Different scenarios, with different associated probabilities, should be developed as appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6.3 Factors for More Rigorous Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each scenario will have an associated overall probability of occurrence that will be lower than the probability of the
failure itself so that the POF and COF should be developed interactively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the scenarios have been developed and potential consequences estimated, acceptable ways to list
consequences include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11 Risk Determination, Assessment, and Management<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 Purpose<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section describes the process of determining risk by combining the results of work done as described in the
previous two sections. It also provides guidelines for prioritizing and assessing the acceptability of risk with respect to
risk criteria. This work process leads to creating and implementing a risk management plan (RMP).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk shall be determined by combining the POF (results of work done as described in Section 9) and the COF (results
of the work done as described in Section 10). The general form of the risk equation shall be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>risk = probability  ×  consequence<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2 Determination of Risk<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.1 Determination of the Probability of a Specific Consequence<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once the POF and failure mode(s) have been determined for the relevant damage mechanisms (see Section 9), the
probability of each credible consequence scenario should be determined. In other words, the loss of containment
failure may only be the first event in a series of events that lead to a specific consequence. The probability of credible
events leading up to the specific consequence should be factored into the probability of the specific consequence
occurring. For example, after a loss of containment, a series of events may be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) first, initiation or failure of safeguards (isolation, alarms, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) second, dispersion, dilution, or accumulation of the fluid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_68>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>56
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) third, initiation of or failure to initiate preventative action (shutting down nearby ignition sources, neutralizing the
fluid, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) additional events until the specific consequence event (fire, toxic release, injury, environmental release, etc.)
occurs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important to understand this linkage between the POF and the probability of possible resulting incidents. The
probability of a specific consequence is tied to the severity of the consequence and may differ considerably from the
probability of the equipment failure itself. Probabilities of incidents generally decrease with the severity of the incident.
For example, the probability of an event resulting in a fatality will generally be less than the probability that the event
will result in a first aid or medical treatment injury. It is important to understand this relationship.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Personnel unqualified in risk assessment methods often link the POF with the most severe consequences that can be
envisioned. An extreme example would be coupling the POF of a damage mechanism where the mode of failure is a
small hole leak with the consequence of a major fire. This linkage would lead to an overly conservative risk assessment
since a small leak will rarely lead to a major fire. Each type of damage mechanism has its own characteristic failure
mode(s). For a specific damage mechanism, the expected mode of failure should be considered when determining the
probability of incidents in the aftermath of an equipment failure. For instance, the consequences expected from a small
leak could be very different than the consequences expected from a brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The example in Figure 6 serves to illustrate how the probability of a specific consequence could be determined. The
example has been simplified and the numbers used are purely hypothetical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.2 Calculating the Probability of a Specific Consequence<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E XA MPLE<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An equipment item containing a flammable fluid is being assessed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The probability of a specific consequence should be the product of the probability of each event that could result in the specific
consequence. In this example, the specific consequence being evaluated is a fire (an example event tree starting with a loss of
containment is shown below). The probability of a fire would be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>probability of fire = probability of failure  ×  probability of ignition<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>probability of fire = 0.001 per year  ×  0.01<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>probability of fire = 0.00001 or 1.00E–05<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The probability of no fire encompasses two scenarios (loss of containment without ignition and no loss of containment). The
probability of no fire would be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>probability of no fire = (probability of failure  ×  probability of non-ignition) + probability of no failure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>probability of no fire = (0.001 per year  ×  0.99) + 0.999 per year<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>probability of no fire = 0.99999 per year<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The probability of all consequence scenarios should equal 1.0. In the example, the probability of the specific consequence of a fire
(1E10 –5  per year) plus the probability of no fire (0.999999 per year) equals 1.0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the consequence of a fire had been assessed at $1E07, then the resulting risk would be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>risk of fire =1.00E–05 per year  ×  $1E07 = $100 per year<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The overall risk includes the probability of loss of containment. For example, if the probability of loss of containment is 0.1, the overall risk
above is 0.1  ×  $100/year = $10/year.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Typically, there will be other credible consequences that should be evaluated. However, it is often possible to
determine a dominant probability/consequence pair, such that it is not necessary to include every credible scenario in
the analysis. Engineering judgment and experience should be used to eliminate trivial cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.3 Calculate Risk<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Referring back to the risk equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>risk = probability  ×  consequence,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>it is now possible to calculate the risk for each specific consequence. The risk equation can now be stated as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>risk of a specific consequence = probability of a specific consequence  ×  specific consequence<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total risk is the sum of the individual risks for each specific consequence. Often one probability/consequence pair
will be dominant and the total risk can be approximated by the risk of the dominant scenario.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the example mentioned in 11.2.1, if the consequence of a fire had been assessed at $1E07, then the resulting risk
would be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>risk of fire = 1.00E–05 per year  ×  $1E07 = $100 per year<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If probability and consequence are not expressed as numerical values, risk is usually determined by plotting the
probability and consequence on a risk matrix (see 11.6). Probability and consequence pairs for various scenarios may
b e  plotted to determine risk of each scenario. Note that when a risk matrix is used, the probability to be plotted should
be the probability of the associated consequence, not the POF. Also note that the overall risk shall include the
probability of loss of containment. For example, if the probability of loss of containment is 0.1, the overall risk above is
0.1  ×  $100/year = $10/year.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3 Risk Management Decisions and Acceptable Levels of Risk<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3.1 Risk Acceptance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI is a tool to provide an analysis of the risk of loss of containment of equipment. Many companies have corporate
risk criteria defining acceptable and prudent levels of safety, environmental, and financial risks. These risk criteria
should be used when making RBI decisions. Because each company may be different in terms of acceptable risk
levels, risk management decisions can vary among companies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_70>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>58
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cost-benefit analysis is a powerful tool that is being used by many companies, governments, and regulatory
authorities as one method in determining risk acceptance. Users are referred to ASME PVRC Project 99-IP-01 for
more information on risk acceptance. Risk acceptance may vary for different risks. For example, risk tolerance for an
environmental risk may be higher than for a safety/health risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3.2 Using Risk Assessment in Inspection and Maintenance Planning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of risk assessment in inspection and maintenance planning is unique in that consequence information, which
is traditionally operations based, and POF information, which is typically engineering, maintenance, or inspection
based, is combined to assist in the planning process. Part of this planning process is the determination of what to
inspect, how to inspect (technique), where to inspect (location), how much to inspect (coverage), and when to
inspect. Determining the risk of process units, or individual process equipment items, facilitates this, as the
inspections are now prioritized based on the risk value. The second part of this process is determining when to
inspect the equipment. Understanding how risk varies with time facilitates this part of the process. Refer to Section 12
for a more detailed description of inspection planning based on risk analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.4 Sensitivity Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Understanding the value of each variable and how it influences the risk calculation is key to identifying which input
variables deserve closer scrutiny versus other variables which may not have significant effects. This is more important
when performing risk analyses that are more detailed and quantitative in nature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sensitivity analysis typically involves reviewing some or all input variables to the risk calculation to determine the
overall influence on the resultant risk value. Once this analysis has been performed, the user can see which input
variables significantly influence the risk value. Those key input variables deserve the most attention.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It often is worthwhile to gather additional information on such variables. Typically, the preliminary estimates of
probability and consequence may be too conservative or too pessimistic; therefore, the information-gathering
performed after the sensitivity analysis should be focused on developing more certainty for the key input variables.
This process should ultimately lead to a reevaluation of the key input variables. As such, the quality and accuracy of
the risk analysis should improve. This is an important part of the data validation phase of risk assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.5 Assumptions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assumptions or estimates of input values are often used when consequence and/or POF data are not available. Even
when data are known to exist, conservative estimates may be used in an initial analysis pending input of future
process or engineering modeling information, such as a sensitivity analysis. Caution is advised in being too
conservative, as overestimating consequences and/or POF values will unnecessarily inflate the calculated risk
values. Presenting over inflated risk values may mislead inspection planners, management, and insurers and can
create a lack of credibility for the user and the RBI process. Appropriate members of the RBI team as outlined in
Section 15 should agree on the assumptions made for RBI analysis and the potential impacts on the risk results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.6 Risk Presentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once risk values are developed, they can then be presented in a variety of ways to communicate the results of the
analysis to decision-makers and inspection planners. One goal of the risk analysis is to communicate the results in a
common format that a variety of people can understand. Using a risk matrix or plot is helpful in accomplishing this goal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.6.2 Risk Matrix<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For risk ranking methodologies that use consequence and probability categories, presenting the results in a risk
matrix is a very effective way of communicating the distribution of risks throughout a plant or process unit without
numerical values. An example risk matrix is shown in Figure 7. In this figure, the consequence and probability<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_71>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
59<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>categories are arranged such that the highest risk ranking is toward the upper right-hand corner. It is usually desirable
to associate numerical values with the categories to provide guidance to the personnel performing the assessment
(e.g. probability category C ranges from 0.001 to 0.01). Different sizes of matrices may be used (e.g. 5  ×  5, 4  ×  4,
etc.). Regardless of the matrix selected, the consequence and probability categories should provide sufficient
discrimination between the items assessed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk categories may be assigned to the boxes on the risk matrix. An example risk categorization (higher, medium,
and lower) of the risk matrix is shown in Figure 7. In this example, the risk categories are symmetrical. They may also
be asymmetrical where for instance the consequence category may be given higher weighting than the probability
category. A risk matrix depicts results at a particular point in time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.6.3 Risk Plots<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When more quantitative consequence and probability data are being used, and where showing numeric risk values is
more meaningful to the stakeholders, a risk plot (or graph) is used (see Figure 7). This graph is constructed similarly
to the risk matrix in that the highest risk is plotted toward the upper right-hand corner. Often a risk plot is drawn using
log-log scales for a better understanding of the relative risks of the items assessed. In the example plot in Figure 8, 10
pieces of equipment are shown, as well as an ISO-risk line. If this line is the acceptable threshold of risk in this
example, then equipment items 1, 2, and 3 should be mitigated so that their resultant risk levels fall below the line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.6.4 Using a Risk Plot or Matrix<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Equipment items residing toward the upper right-hand corner of the plot or matrix (in the examples presented) will
most likely take priority for inspection planning because these items have the highest risk. Similarly, items residing
toward the lower left-hand corner of the plot (or matrix) will tend to take lower priority because these items have the
lowest risk. Once the plots have been completed, the risk plot (or matrix) can then be used as a screening tool during
the prioritization process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk may be described in terms of dollars or other numerical values as described in 9.2 even if a qualitative analysis
has been performed, and the results have been plotted on a risk matrix. Numerical values associated with each of the
probability and consequence categories on the risk matrix may be used to calculate the risk. For cost-related risk, a
net present value savings vs inspection time plot may be used to time the inspection activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.7 Establishing Acceptable Risk Thresholds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the risk analysis has been performed, and risk values plotted, the risk evaluation process begins. Risk plots and
matrices can be used to screen and initially identify higher, intermediate, and lower risk equipment items. The
equipment can also be ranked (prioritized) according to its risk value in tabular form. Thresholds that divide the risk
plot, matrix, or table into acceptable and unacceptable regions of risk can be developed. Corporate safety and
financial policies and constraints or risk criteria influence the placement of the thresholds. Regulations and laws may
also specify or assist in identifying the acceptable risk thresholds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reduction of some risks to a lower level may not be practical due to technology and cost constraints. An as low as
reasonably practical (ALARP) approach to risk management or other risk management approach may be necessary
for these items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.8 Risk Management<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Based on the ranking of items and the risk threshold, the risk management process begins. For risks that are judged
acceptable, no mitigation may be required and no further action necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_73>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
61<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For risks considered unacceptable and therefore requiring risk mitigation, there are various mitigation categories that
should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Decommission—Is the equipment really necessary to support unit operation?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Inspection and Repairs—Can a cost-effective inspection program, with repair as indicated by the inspection
results, be implemented that will reduce risks to an acceptable level?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Consequence Mitigation—Can actions be taken to lessen the COF related to an equipment failure such as
operational changes or design changes (e.g. isolation, detection system) that can reduce the COF?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Probability Mitigation—Can actions be taken to lessen the POF such as material of construction changes,
operational changes, or equipment redesign?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk management decisions can now be made on which mitigation action(s) to take. Risk management/mitigation is
covered further in Section 12 and Section 13.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12 Risk Management with Inspection Activities<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.1 Managing Risk by Reducing Uncertainty Through Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In previous sections, it was noted that risk can be managed by inspection. Obviously, inspection itself does not arrest
or mitigate damage mechanisms or reduce risk, but the information gained though effective inspection can better
quantify the actual risk. Impending failure of pressure equipment is not avoided by inspection activities unless the
inspection precipitates risk mitigation activities that change the POF. Inspection serves to identify, monitor, and
measure the damage mechanism(s). It is invaluable input in the prediction of when the damage will reach a critical
point. Correct application of inspections will improve the user's ability to predict the damage mechanisms and rates of
deterioration. The better the predictability, the less uncertainty there will be as to when a failure may occur. Mitigation
(repair, replacement, changes, etc.) can then be planned and implemented prior to the predicted failure date. The
reduction in uncertainty and increase in predictability through inspection translates directly to a better estimate of the
probability of a failure and therefore a reduction in the calculated risk. However, users should be diligent to assure that
temporary inspection alternatives, in lieu of more permanent risk reductions, are actually effective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The foregoing does not imply that RBI plans and activities are always the answer to monitoring degradation and
reducing risks associated with pressure equipment. Some damage mechanisms are very difficult or impossible to
monitor with just inspection activities (e.g. metallurgical deterioration that may result in brittle fracture, many forms of
stress corrosion cracking, and even fatigue). Other damage mechanisms precipitated by short-term, event-driven
operating changes can happen too fast to be monitored with normal inspection plans, be they risk based, condition
based, or time based, hence the need for establishing and implementing a comprehensive program for IOWs, along
with adequate communications to inspection personnel when deviations occur and a rigorous MOC program for
changes from the established parameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk mitigation (by the reduction in uncertainty) achieved through inspection presumes that the organization will act
on the results of the inspection in a timely manner. Risk mitigation is not achieved if inspection data that is gathered is
not properly analyzed and acted upon where needed. The quality of the inspection data and the analysis or
interpretation will greatly affect the level of risk mitigation. Proper inspection methods and data analysis tools are
therefore critical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2 Identifying Risk Management Opportunities from RBI Results<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As discussed in Section 11, typically a risk priority list is developed as a result of the RBI process. RBI will also identify
whether consequence or POF or both is driving risk. In the situations where risk is being driven by POF, there is
usually potential for risk management through inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_74>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>62
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once an RBI assessment has been completed, the items with unacceptable risk to the owner-user shall be assessed
for potential risk management through inspection plans or other risk management strategies. Higher risk items should
also be assessed for potential risk management actions. Whether inspections will be effective or not will depend on
the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) equipment type;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) active and credible damage mechanism(s);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) rate of deterioration or susceptibility;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) inspection methods, coverage, and frequency;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) accessibility to expected damage areas;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
shutdown requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) amount of achievable reduction in POF (i.e. a reduction in POF of a low POF item is usually difficult to achieve
through inspection).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depending on factors such as the remaining life of the equipment and type of damage mechanism, risk management
through inspection may have little or no effect. Examples of such cases are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) corrosion rates well-established with equipment nearing end of life;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) instantaneous failures related to operating conditions such as brittle fracture;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) inspection technology that is not sufficient to detect or quantify deterioration adequately;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) too short a timeframe from the onset of deterioration to final failure for periodic inspections to be effective (e.g.
high-cycle fatigue cracking);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) event-driven failures (circumstances that cannot be predicted).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases such as these, an alternative form of mitigation may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most practical and cost-effective risk mitigation strategy can then be developed for each item. Usually, inspection
provides a major part of the overall risk management strategy, but not always.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3 Establishing an Inspection Strategy Based on Risk Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The results of an RBI assessment are normally used as the basis for the development of an overall inspection
strategy for the group of items included. The inspection strategy should be designed in conjunction with other
mitigation plans so that all equipment items will have resultant risks that are acceptable. For the development of their
inspection strategy, users should consider the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) risk criteria and ranking;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) risk drivers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) equipment history;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) number and results of inspections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) type and effectiveness of inspections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
equipment in similar service and remaining life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_75>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
63<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection is only effective if the examination technique chosen is sufficient for detecting the damage mechanism and
its severity. As an example, spot thickness readings on a piping circuit would be considered to have little or no benefit
if the damage mechanism results in unpredictable localized corrosion (e.g. pitting, ammonia bisulfide corrosion, local
thin area, etc.). In this case, ultrasonic scanning, radiography, and/or other approaches would be more effective. The
level of risk reduction achieved by inspection will depend on the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) mode of failure of the damage mechanism,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) time interval between the onset of deterioration and failure (i.e. speed of deterioration),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) detection capability of examination technique,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) scope and extent of inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) frequency of inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organizations should be deliberate and systematic in assigning the level of risk management achieved through
inspection and should be cautious not to assume that there is an unending capacity for risk management through
inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection strategy shall be a documented, iterative process to assure that inspection activities are continually
focused on items with higher risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.4 Managing Risk with Inspection Activities<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effectiveness of past inspections is part of the determination of the present risk. The future risk can now be
influenced by future inspection activities. RBI can be used as a “what if” tool to determine when, what, and how
inspections should be conducted to yield an acceptable future risk level. Key parameters and examples that can
affect the future risk are as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Frequency of Inspection—Increasing the frequency of inspections may serve to better define, identify, or monitor
the damage mechanism(s) and therefore better quantify the risk. Both routine and turnaround inspection
frequencies can be optimized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Coverage—Different zones or areas of inspection of an item or series of items can be modeled and evaluated to
determine the coverage that will produce an acceptable level of risk. For example:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) a higher risk piping system may be a candidate for more extensive inspection, using one or more NDE
techniques targeted to locating the identified damage mechanisms;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) an assessment may reveal the need for focus on parts of a vessel where the highest risk may be located and
focus on quantifying this risk rather than focusing on the rest of the vessel where there are perhaps only low
risk deterioration processes occurring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Tools and Techniques—The selection and usage of the appropriate inspection tools and techniques can be
optimized to cost-effectively and safely quantify the POF. In the selection of inspection tools and techniques,
inspection personnel should take into consideration that more than one technology may achieve risk mitigation.
However, the level of mitigation achieved can vary depending on the choice. As an example, profile radiography
would typically be more effective than digital ultrasonics for thickness monitoring in cases of localized corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Procedures and Practices—Inspection procedures and the actual inspection practices can impact the ability of
inspection activities to identify, measure, and/or monitor damage mechanisms. If the inspection activities are
executed effectively by well-trained and qualified inspectors, the expected risk management benefits should be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

to take steps to assure that they have the appropriate level of qualifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Internal, On-stream, or External Inspection—Risk quantification by internal, on-stream, and external inspections
should be assessed. Often external inspection with effective on-stream inspection techniques can provide useful
data for risk assessment. It is worth noting that invasive inspections, in some cases, may cause deterioration and
increase the risk of the item. Examples where this may happen include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) moisture ingress to equipment leading to stress corrosion cracking or PASCC;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) internal inspection of glass lined vessels;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) removal of passivating films;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) human errors in start-up (re-streaming);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5) increased risks associated with shutting down and starting up equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Th e  user can adjust these parameters to obtain the optimum inspection plan that manages risk, is cost-effective, and
is practical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.5 Managing Inspection Costs with RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection costs can be more effectively managed through the use of RBI. Resources can be applied or shifted to
those areas identified as a higher risk or targeted based on the strategy selected. Consequently, this same strategy
allows consideration for reduction of inspection activities in those areas that have a lower risk or where the inspection
activity has little or no effect on the associated risks. This results in inspection resources being applied where they are
needed most and thereby increased inspection cost-effectiveness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another opportunity for managing inspection costs is by identifying items in the inspection plan that can be inspected
non-intrusively on-stream. If the non-intrusive inspection provides sufficient risk management, there is a potential for a
net savings based on not having to blind, open, clean, and internally inspect during downtime. If the item considered
is the main driver for bringing an operational unit down, the non-intrusive inspection may contribute to increased
uptime of the unit. The user should recognize that while there is a potential for the reduction of inspection costs
through the utilization of RBI, increased equipment integrity and inspection cost optimization should remain the focus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.6 Assessing Inspection Results and Determining Corrective Action<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection results such as the identification of damage mechanisms, rate of deterioration, and equipment tolerance to
the types of deterioration shall be used as variables in assessing remaining life and future inspection plans. The
results can also be used for comparison or validation of the models that may have been used for POF determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A documented mitigation action plan should be developed for any equipment item requiring repair or replacement.
The action plan should describe the extent of repair (or replacement), recommendations, the proposed repair
method(s), appropriate QA/QC, and the date the plan should be completed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7 Achieving Lowest Life Cycle Costs with RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Not only can RBI be used to optimize inspection costs that directly affect life cycle costs, but it can also assist in
lowering overall life cycle costs through various cost benefit assessments. The following examples can give a user
ideas on how to lower life cycle costs through RBI with cost benefit assessments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) RBI should enhance the prediction of failures caused by damage mechanisms. This in turn should give the user
confidence to continue to operate equipment safely, closer to the predicted failure date. By doing this, the
equipment cycle time should increase and life cycle costs decrease.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_77>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
65<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) RBI can be used to assess the effects of changing to a more aggressive fluid. A subsequent plan to upgrade
construction material or replace specific items can then be developed. The construction material plan would
consider the optimized run length safely attainable along with the appropriate inspection plan. This could equate to
increased profits and lower life cycle costs through reduced maintenance, optimized inspections, and increased
unit/equipment uptime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Turnaround and maintenance costs also have an effect on the life cycle costs of an equipment item. By using the
results of the RBI inspection plan to identify more accurately where to inspect and what repairs and replacements
to expect, turnaround and maintenance work can be preplanned and, in most cases, executed at a lower cost
than if unplanned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13 Other Risk Mitigation Activities<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As described in the previous section, inspection is often an effective method of risk management. However,
inspection may not always provide sufficient risk mitigation or may not be the most cost-effective method. The
purpose of this section is to describe other methods of risk mitigation. This list is not meant to be all inclusive. These
risk mitigation activities fall into one or more of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) reduce the magnitude of consequence;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) reduce the POF;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) enhance the survivability of the facility and people to the consequence;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) mitigate the primary source of consequence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.2 Equipment Replacement and Repair<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When equipment deterioration has reached a point that the risk of failure cannot be managed to an acceptable level,
replacement/repair is often the only way to mitigate the risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.3 Evaluating Flaws for Fitness-For-Service<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection may identify flaws in equipment. A Fitness-For-Service assessment (e.g. API 579-1/ASME FFS-1) may be
performed to determine if the equipment may continue to be safely operated, under what conditions, and for what
time period. A Fitness-For-Service analysis can also be performed to determine what size flaws, if found in future
inspections, would require repair or equipment replacement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.4 Equipment Modification, Redesign, and Rerating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Modification and redesign of equipment, utilizing a rigorous MOC process, can provide mitigation of POF. Examples
include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) change of metallurgy;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) addition of protective linings and coatings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) removal of deadlegs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) increased corrosion allowance;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>g) injection point design changes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) resizing of the relief device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sometimes equipment is over designed for the process conditions. Rerating the equipment may result in a reduction
of the POF assessed for that item.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.5 Emergency Isolation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Emergency isolation capability can reduce toxic, explosion, or fire consequences in the event of a release. Proper
location of the isolation valves is key to successful risk mitigation. Remote operation is usually required to provide
significant risk reduction. To mitigate flammable and explosion risk, operators need to be able to detect the release
and actuate the isolation valves quickly (within a few minutes). Longer response times may still mitigate effects of
ongoing fires or toxic releases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6 Emergency Depressurizing/Deinventorying<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method reduces the amount and rate of release. Like emergency isolation, the emergency depressurizing and/or
de-inventory should be achieved within a few minutes to reduce the risk from an explosion/fire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.7 Modify Process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mitigation of the primary source of consequence may be achieved by changing the process toward less hazardous
conditions. As with physical modifications, any process changes should be conducted only after the application of a
rigorous MOC process. Some examples include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Reduce temperature to below atmospheric pressure boiling point to reduce size of cloud.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Substitute a less hazardous material (e.g. high flash solvent for a low flash solvent).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Use a continuous process instead of a batch operation, where applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Dilute or eliminate hazardous substances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mitigation of the sources of corrosion can be achieved by changing the process toward less corrosive conditions.
Some examples include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) process water washing to remove corrosive materials (e.g. salts);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) addition of neutralizing or inhibitor chemicals;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) removal of contaminants with process equipment (e.g. absorbers, filters);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) protection of downtime corrosion (e.g. PASCC protection).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.8 Establish Integrity Operating Windows<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IOWs should be established for process parameters (both physical and chemical) that could impact equipment
integrity if not properly controlled. Examples of the process parameters include temperatures, pressures, fluid<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_79>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
67<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>velocities, pH, flow rates, chemical or water injection rates, levels of corrosive constituents, chemical composition, etc.
Key process parameters for IOWs should be identified and implemented, upper and lower limits established, as
needed, and deviations from these limits should be brought to the attention of inspection/engineering personnel.
Particular attention to monitoring IOWs should also be provided during start-ups, shutdowns, and significant process
upsets (reference API 584).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.9 Reduce Inventory<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method reduces the magnitude of consequence. Some examples include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Reduce/eliminate storage of hazardous feedstocks or intermediate products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Modify process control to permit a reduction in inventory contained in surge drums, reflux drums, or other in-
process inventories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Modify process operations to require less inventory/hold-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Substitute gas phase technology for liquid phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.10 Water Spray/Deluge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method can reduce fire damage and minimize or prevent escalation. A properly designed and operating system
can greatly reduce the probability that a vessel exposed to fire will BLEVE.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.11 Water Curtain<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water sprays entrap large amounts of air into a cloud. Water curtains mitigate water soluble vapor clouds by
absorption as well as dilution and insoluble vapors (including most flammables) by air dilution. Early activation is
required in order to achieve significant risk reduction. The curtain should preferably be between the release location
and ignition sources (e.g. furnaces) or locations where people are likely to be present. Design is critical for
flammables, since the water curtain can enhance flame speed under some circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.12 Blast-resistant Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Utilizing blast resistant construction provides mitigation of the damage caused by explosions and may prevent
escalation of the incident. When used for buildings (see API 752), it may provide personnel protection from the effects
of an explosion. This may also be useful for equipment critical to emergency response, critical instrument/control
lines, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.13 Others<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other risk mitigation methods include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) spill detector;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) steam or air curtains;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) fireproofing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>14 Reassessment and Updating RBI Assessments<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.1 RBI Reassessments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI is a dynamic tool that can provide current and projected future risk evaluations. However, these evaluations are
based on data and knowledge at the time of the assessment. As time goes by, changes are inevitable and the results
from the RBI assessment shall be updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important to maintain and update an RBI program to ensure that the most recent inspection, process, and
maintenance information is included. The results of inspections, changes in process conditions, and implementation
of maintenance practices can all have significant effects on risk, and therefore the inspection plan, and can trigger the
need to perform a reassessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.2 Why Conduct an RBI Reassessment?<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are several events that will change risk and make it prudent to conduct an RBI reassessment. It is important
that the facility have an effective work process that identifies when a reassessment is necessary. Sections 14.2.2
through 14.2.5 provide guidance on some key factors that could trigger an RBI reassessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_81>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R ISK - BASED  I NSPECTION
69<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.2.2 Damage Mechanisms and Inspection Activities<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many damage mechanisms are time dependent. Typically, the RBI assessment will project deterioration at a constant
rate. In reality, the deterioration rate may vary over time. Through inspection activities, the rate of deterioration (both
short-term and long-term) may be better defined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some damage mechanisms are independent of time (i.e. they occur only when there are specific conditions present).
When those intermittent conditions occur, an RBI reassessment may be appropriate. As part of the reassessment, it
is important to review the operating histories over the past run, including IOW exceedances and trends, to better
predict if non-time-dependent damage mechanisms could have occurred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection activities will increase information on the condition of the equipment. When inspection activities have been
performed, the results shall be reviewed to determine if an RBI reassessment is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.2.3 Process and Hardware Changes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Changes in process conditions and hardware, such as equipment modifications or replacement, frequently can
significantly alter the risks and dictate the need for a reassessment. Process changes, in particular, have been linked
to equipment failure from rapid or unexpected corrosion or cracking. This is particularly important for damage
mechanisms that depend heavily on process conditions. Typical examples include chloride stress corrosion cracking
of stainless steel, wet H 2 S cracking of carbon steel, and accelerated corrosion at points of salt deposition or at dew
points and sour water corrosion. In each case, a change in process conditions can dramatically affect the corrosion
rate or cracking tendencies. Hardware changes can also have an effect on risk. For example:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) POF can be affected by changes in the design of internals in a vessel or size and shape of piping systems that
accelerate velocity related corrosion effects;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) COF can be affected by the relocation of a vessel to an area near an ignition source;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) process conditions can be changed by hardware modifications, additions, deletions, or bypassing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.2.4 RBI Assessment Premise Change<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The premises for the RBI assessment could change and have a significant impact on the risk results. Some of the
possible changes could be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) increase or decrease in population density in the process unit;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) change in construction material and repair/replacement costs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) change in product values;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) revisions in safety and environmental laws and regulations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) revisions in the users RMP (such as changes in risk criteria);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
change in feed amount or composition;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) changes in operating conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) change in unit operating lengths between maintenance turnarounds;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
changes in inspection codes/standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>14.2.5 The Effect of Mitigation Strategies<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Strategies to mitigate risk such as installation of safety systems, repairs, and other approaches when utilized should
be monitored to ensure that they have successfully achieved the desired mitigation. Once a mitigation strategy is
implemented, a reassessment of the risk may be performed to update the RBI program with the new current risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.3 When to Conduct an RBI Reassessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.3.1 After Significant Changes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As discussed in 14.2, significant changes in risk can occur for a variety of reasons. Qualified personnel should evaluate
each significant change to determine the potential for a change in risk. It may be desirable to conduct an RBI
reassessment after significant changes in process conditions, damage mechanisms/rates/severities, or RBI premises.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.3.2 After a Set Time Period<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although significant changes may not have occurred, over time many small changes may occur and cumulatively
cause significant changes in the RBI assessment. Users should set default maximum time periods for
reassessments. The governing inspection codes (such as API 510, API 570, and API 653) and jurisdictional
regulations, if any, shall be reviewed in this context.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.3.3 After Implementation of Risk Mitigation Strategies<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once a mitigation strategy is implemented, it is prudent to determine how effective the strategy was in reducing the
risk to an acceptable level. This should be reflected in a reassessment of the risk and appropriate update in the
documentation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.3.4 Before and After Maintenance Turnarounds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As part of the planning for a maintenance turnaround, it is usually useful to perform an RBI reassessment. This can
become a first step in planning the turnaround to ensure that the work effort is focused on the higher risk equipment
items and on issues that might affect the ability to achieve the premised operating run time in a safe, economic, and
environmentally sound manner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since a large number of inspection, repairs, and modifications are performed during a typical maintenance
turnaround, it may be useful to update an assessment soon after the turnaround to reflect the new risk levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15 Roles, Responsibilities, Training, and Qualifications<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.1 Team Approach<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RBI requires data gathering from many sources: specialized analysis, such as risk analysis, financial analysis,
materials and corrosion engineering, mechanical engineering, inspection, and other areas followed by risk
management decision-making. Generally, one individual does not have the background or skills to single-handedly
conduct the entire study effectively. Usually, a team of people, with the requisite skills and background, is needed to
conduct an effective RBI assessment. The initial implementation of an RBI program will normally require additional
resources to supplement the inspection group, which will be composed of the types of members depicted in 15.2.2
through 15.2.10. After the initial implementation, the level of resources should revert to a lower number in order to
sustain the RBI program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>15.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depending on the application, some of the disciplines listed below may not be required. Some team members may be
part-time due to limited input needs. It is also possible that not all the team members listed may be required if other
team members have the required skill and knowledge of multiple disciplines. It is usually useful to have one of the
team members serve as a facilitator for discussion sessions and team interactions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.2.2 Team Leader<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The team leader may be any one of the below mentioned team members. The team leader should be a full-time team
member and should preferably be a stakeholder in the facility/equipment being analyzed. In cases where the team
leader is unfamiliar with the facility to be evaluated, he or she should be familiar with the RBI methodology employed
and the types of processes to be assessed. The team leader may be qualified in one of the specialized fields required
for RBI. The main function of the team leader should be to integrate the inputs, outputs, organizational structure, and
communications of the assessment team and to carry out the following responsibilities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Formation of the team and verification that the team members have the necessary skills, experience, and
knowledge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Following up to assure that the appropriate risk mitigation actions have been implemented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Assure adequate documentation of the teams activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.2.3 Equipment Inspector or Inspection Specialist<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The equipment inspector or inspection specialist is generally responsible for gathering data on the condition and
history of equipment in the study. This data should include the design condition when new and the current condition.
Generally, this information will be located in equipment inspection and maintenance files. If condition data is
unavailable, the inspector/specialist, in conjunction with the corrosion specialist, should provide predictions of the
current condition. The inspector/specialist and materials and corrosion specialist are also responsible for assessing
the effectiveness of past inspections. The equipment inspector/inspection specialist is usually responsible for
implementing the recommended inspection plan derived from the RBI assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.2.4 Corrosion Specialist<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A qualified corrosion specialist shall be responsible for assessing the types of damage mechanisms and their
applicability and severity to the equipment considering the process conditions, environment, metallurgy, age, and
other relevant data pertaining to of the equipment. This specialist should compare this assessment to the actual
condition of the equipment, determine the reason for differences between predicted and actual condition, and provide<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>72
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  580<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>guidance on damage mechanisms, rates, or severity to be used in the RBI assessment. Part of this comparison
should include evaluating the appropriateness of the inspections in relation to the damage mechanism. This specialist
also should provide recommendations on methods of mitigating the POF (such as changes in metallurgy, addition of
inhibition, addition of coatings/linings) and methods of monitoring the process for possible changes in damage rates
(such as pH monitoring, corrosion rate monitoring, contaminant monitoring).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.2.5 Process Specialist<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The process specialist is responsible for the provision of process condition information. This information generally will
be in the form of process flow sheets. The process specialist is responsible for documenting variations in the process
conditions due to normal occurrences (such as start-ups and shutdowns) and abnormal occurrences. The process
specialist is responsible for describing the composition and variability of all the process fluids/gases as well as their
potential toxicity and flammability. The process specialist should evaluate/recommend methods of risk mitigation
(probability or consequence) through changes in process conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.2.6 Operations and Maintenance Personnel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Operations personnel are responsible for verifying that the facility/equipment is being operated within the parameters
set out in the process operating window. They are responsible for providing data on occurrences when process
deviated from the limits of the operating windows, and on any trends in the operating data over the past unit run,
including IOW parameters. They are also responsible for verifying that equipment repairs/replacements/additions
have been included in the equipment condition data supplied by the equipment inspector. Operations and
maintenance are responsible for implementing recommendations that pertain to process or equipment modifications
and monitoring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.2.7 Management<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Management’s role is to provide sponsorship and resources (personnel and funding) for the RBI assessment. They
are responsible for making decisions on risk management, establishing risk acceptance criteria, and/or providing the
framework/mechanism for others to make these decisions based on the results of the RBI assessment. Finally,
management is responsible for providing the resources and follow-up system to implement the risk mitigation
decisions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and be able to document that their personnel are suitably qualified. Facility owner-users that have internal risk
assessment personnel to conduct RBI analysis should have a procedure to document that their personnel are
sufficiently qualified. The qualifications and training of the risk assessment personnel should be documented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15.3.2 Other Team Members<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The other team members should receive basic training on RBI methodology and on the software program(s) being
used, to the extent they need to understand software to make their contribution. This training should be geared
primarily to an understanding and effective application of RBI, as well as an understanding of how the data quality that
is input by other team members can affect the results. This training could be provided by the risk assessment
personnel on the RBI team or by another person qualified on RBI methodology and on the program(s) being used. An
owner-user may request that one or more team members be certified to the API Supplemental Individual Certification
Program for API 580 to demonstrate understanding of the concepts in this RP.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16 RBI Documentation and Recordkeeping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A documented management system to implement and sustain RBI program shall be developed and typically would
include the following elements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) procedures covering implementation, maintenance, and reassessment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) roles/responsibilities, experience/training requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) documented assumptions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) timeframe for RBI analysis applicability;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) data requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>g) program audit requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) scope and boundary limits;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
triggers for reassessment (e.g. process changes, equipment damage, failures, IOW exceedances, etc.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
timeframe for reassessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important that sufficient information is captured to fully document the RBI assessment. Typically, this
documentation should include the following data and information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) type of assessment, objectives, and boundaries;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) procedure for how the selected RBI methodology will be applied at the site (e.g. how to deal with all the options
provided by the methodology);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) team members performing the assessment and their skill set relative to RBI;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) timeframe over which the assessment is applicable;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) inputs and sources used to determine risk;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
assumptions made during the assessment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) risk assessment results (including information on probability and consequence);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) follow-up mitigation strategy, if applicable, to manage risk;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
mitigated risk levels (i.e. residual risk after mitigation is implemented);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
references to in-service codes or standards being applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sufficient data shall be captured and maintained such that the assessment can be recreated or updated at a later time
by others who were not involved in the original assessment. To facilitate this, it is preferable to store the information in
a computerized database. This will enhance the analysis, retrieval, and stewardship capabilities. The usefulness of
the database will be particularly important in stewarding recommendations developed from the RBI assessment and
managing overall risk over the specified timeframe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.2 RBI Methodology<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The methodology used to perform the RBI analysis should be documented so that it is clear what type of assessment
was performed. The basis for both the probability and COF shall be documented. If a specific software program is
used to perform the assessment, this also should be documented. The documentation should be sufficiently complete
so that the basis and the logic for the decision-making process can be checked or replicated at a later time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.3 RBI Personnel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The assessment of risk will depend on the knowledge, experience, and judgment of the personnel or team performing
the analysis. Therefore, a record of the team members involved should be captured, as well as the skill set that they
bring to the team for RBI purposes. This will be helpful in understanding the basis for the risk assessment when the
analysis is repeated or updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

75<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.4 Timeframe<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The level of risk is usually a function of time. This is either a result of the time dependence of a damage mechanism or
simply the potential for changes in the operation of equipment. Therefore, the timeframe over which the RBI analysis
is applicable should be defined and captured in the final documentation. This will permit tracking and management of
risk effectively over time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.5 Basis for the Assignment of Risk<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The various inputs used to assess both the probability and COF shall be captured. This should include, but not
necessarily be limited to, the following information:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) basic equipment data and inspection history critical to the assessment (e.g. operating conditions, materials of
construction, service exposure, corrosion rate, inspection history);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) operative and credible damage mechanisms;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) criteria used to judge the severity of each damage mechanism;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) anticipated failure mode(s) (e.g. leak, crack, or rupture);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) key factors used to judge the severity of each failure mode;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
criteria used to evaluate the various consequence categories, including safety, health, environmental, and
financial;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) risk criteria used to evaluate the acceptability of the risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.6 Assumptions Made to Assess Risk<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk analysis, by its very nature, requires that certain assumptions be made regarding the nature and extent of
equipment deterioration. Moreover, the assignment of failure mode and the severity of the contemplated event will
invariably be based on a variety of assumptions, regardless of whether the analysis is quantitative or qualitative. To
understand the basis for the overall risk, it is essential that these factors be captured in the final documentation.
Clearly documenting the key assumptions made during the analysis of probability and consequence will greatly
enhance the capability to either recreate or update the RBI assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.7 Risk Assessment Results<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The probability, consequence, and risk results shall be captured in the documentation. For items that require risk
mitigation, the recommendations for and results after mitigation should be documented as well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.8 Mitigation and Follow-up<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the most important aspects of managing risk through RBI is the development and use of mitigation strategies.
Therefore, the specific risk mitigation required to reduce either probability or consequence should be documented in
the assessment. The mitigation “credit” assigned to a particular action should be captured along with any time
dependence. The methodology, process, and person(s) responsible for implementation of any mitigation should also
be documented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16.9 Applicable Codes, Standards, and Government Regulations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since various codes, standards, and governmental regulations cover the inspection for most pressure equipment, it
will be important to reference these documents as part of the RBI assessment. This is particularly important where
implementation of RBI is used to reduce either the extent or frequency of inspection. See Section 2 for a listing of
some relevant codes and standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
