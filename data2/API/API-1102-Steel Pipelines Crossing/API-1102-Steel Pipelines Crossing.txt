<<HEADING level=3>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The need for an industry-recommended practice to address installation of pipeline crossings under railroads was first
recognized by the publication of American Petroleum Institute (API) Code 26 in 1934. This code represented an
understanding between the pipeline and railroad industries regarding the installation of the relatively small-diameter
lines then prevalent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,``,`,``,,,,``,,,,```````,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rapid growth of pipeline systems after 1946 using large-diameter pipe led to the reevaluation and revision of API
Code 26 to include pipeline design criteria. A series of changes were made between 1949 and 1952, culminating in
the establishment in 1952 of Recommended Practice 1102. The scope of Recommended Practice 1102 (1952)
included crossings of highways in anticipation of the cost savings that would accrue to the use of thin-wall casings in
conjunction with the pending construction of the Defense Interstate Highway System.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommended Practice 1102 (1968) incorporated the knowledge gained from known data on uncased carrier pipes
and casing design and from the performance of uncased carrier pipes under dead and live loads, as well as under
internal pressures. Extensive computer analysis was performed using Spangler’s Iowa Formula [1] to determine the
stress in uncased carrier pipes and the wall thickness of casing pipes in instances where cased pipes are required in
an installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The performance of carrier pipes in uncased crossings and casings installed since 1934, and operated in accordance
with API Code 26 and Recommended Practice 1102, has been excellent. There is no known occurrence in the
petroleum industry of a structural failure due to imposed earth and live loads on a carrier pipe or casing under a
railroad or highway. Pipeline company reports to the U.S. Department of Transportation in compliance with 49  Code
of Federal Regulations  Part 195 corroborate this record.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The excellent performance record of uncased carrier pipes and casings may in part be due to the design process
used to determine the required wall thickness. Measurements of actual installed casings and carrier pipes using
previous Recommended Practice 1102 design criteria demonstrate that the past design methods are conservative. In
1985, the Gas Research Institute (GRI) began funding a research project at Cornell University to develop an
improved methodology for the design of uncased carrier pipelines crossing beneath railroads and highways. The
research scope included state-of-the-art reviews of railroad and highway crossing practices and performance records
[2, 3]. three-dimensional finite element modeling of uncased carrier pipes beneath railroads and highways, and
extensive field testing on full-scale instrumented pipelines. The results of this research are the basis for the new
methodology for uncased carrier pipe design given in this edition of Recommended Practice 1102. The GRI summary
report,  Technical Summary and Database for Guidelines for Pipelines Crossing Railroads and Highway  by Ingraffea
et al. [4], includes the results of the numerical modeling, the full derivations of the design curves used in this
recommended practice, and the data base of the field measurements made on the experimental test pipelines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This recommended practice contains tabular values for the wall thickness of casings where they are required in an
installation. The loading values that were employed are Cooper E-80 with 175% impact for railroads and 10,000 lbs
(44.5 kN) per tandem wheel with 150% impact for highways. Due notice should be taken of the fact that external loads
on flexible pipes can cause failure by buckling. Buckling occurs when the vertical diameter has undergone 18% to
22% deflection. Failure by buckling does not result in rupture of the pipe wall, although the metal may be stressed far
beyond its elastic limit. Recommended Practice 1102 (1993) recognizes this performance of a properly installed
flexible casing pipe, as opposed to heavy wall rigid structures, and has based its design criteria on a maximum
vertical deflection of 3% of the vertical diameter. Measurement of actual installed casing pipe using Recommended
Practice 1102 (1981) design criteria demonstrates that the Iowa Formula is very conservative, and in most instances,
the measures long-term vertical deflection has been 0.65% or less of the vertical diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommended Practice 1102 has been revised and improved repeatedly using the latest research and experience in
measuring actual performance of externally loaded uncased pipelines under various environmental conditions and
using new materials and construction techniques developed since the recommended practice was last revised. The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This recommended practice,  Steel Pipelines Crossing Railroads and Highways , gives primary emphasis to provisions
for public safety. It covers the design, installation, inspection, and testing required to ensure safe crossings of steel
pipelines under railroads and highways. The provisions apply to the design and construction of welded steel pipelines
under railroads and highways. The provisions of this practice are formulated to protect the facility crossed by the
pipeline, as well as to provide adequate design for safe installation and operation of the pipeline.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2 Application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions herein should be applicable to the construction of pipelines crossing under railroads and highways and
to the adjustment of existing pipelines crossed by railroad or highway construction. This practice should not be
applied retroactively. Neither should it apply to pipelines under contract for construction on or prior to the effective
date of this edition. Neither should it be applied to directionally drilled crossings or to pipelines installed in utility
tunnels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.3 Type of Pipeline<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This practice applies to welded steel pipelines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.4 Provisions for Public Safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions give primary emphasis to public safety. The provisions set forth in this practice adequately provide for
safety under conditions normally encountered in the pipeline industry. Requirements for abnormal or unusual
conditions are not specifically discussed, nor are all details of engineering and construction provided. The applicable
regulations of federal [5, 6], state, municipal, and regulatory institutions having jurisdiction over the facility to be
crossed shall be observed during the design and construction of the pipeline.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.5 Approval for Crossings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to the construction of a pipeline crossing, arrangements should be made with the authorized agent of the facility
to be crossed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Type of Crossing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The decision to use an uncased crossing must be predicated on careful consideration of the stresses imposed on
uncased pipelines, versus the potential difficulties associated with protecting cased pipelines from corrosion. This
section focuses specifically on the design of uncased carrier pipelines to accommodate safely the stresses and
deformations imposed at railroad and highway crossings. The provisions apply to the design and construction of
welded steel pipelines under railroads and highways.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1  The carrier pipe should be as straight as practicable and should have uniform soil support for the entire length
of the crossing.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2  The carrier pipe should be installed so as to minimize the void between the pipe and the adjacent soil.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.3  The carrier pipe shall be welded in accordance with the latest approved editions of API Standard 1104,
Welding of Pipelines and Related Facilities  [7], and ASME B31.4 or B31.8 [8, 9], whichever is applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Location and Alignment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1  The angle of intersection between a pipeline crossing and the railroad or highway to be crossed should be as
near to 90 degrees as practicable. In no case should it be less than 30 degrees.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2  Crossings in wet or rock terrain, and where deep cuts are required, should be avoided where practicable.<<HEADING_END>>

permit maintenance of the pipeline and the structure or facility.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To ensure safe operation, the stresses affecting the uncased pipeline must be accounted for comprehensively,
including both circumferential and longitudinal stresses. The recommended design procedure is shown schematically
in Figure 2. It consists of the following steps:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Begin with the wall thickness for the pipeline of given diameter approaching the crossing. Determine the pipe, soil,
construction, and operational characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Use the Barlow formula to calculate the circumferential stress due to internal pressure,  S Hi   (Barlow) . Check
S Hi  (Barlow)  against the maximum allowable value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Calculate the circumferential stress due to earth load,  S He .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,``,`,``,,,,``,,,,```````,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Calculate the external live load,  w , and determine the appropriate impact factor,  F i .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Calculate the cyclic circumferential stress,  Δ S H , and the cyclic longitudinal stress,  Δ S L  due to live load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) Calculate the circumferential stress due to internal pressure,  S Hi .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Check effective stress,  S eff  as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Calculate the principal stresses,  S 1  in the circumferential direction,  S 2  in the longitudinal direction, and  S 3 , in the
radial direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Calculate the effective stress,  S eff .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Check by comparing  S eff  against the allowable stress,  SMYS   ×   F .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Check welds for fatigue as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Check with weld fatigue by comparing  Δ S L  against the girth weld fatigue limit,  S FG   ×   F .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Check longitudinal weld fatigue by comparing,  Δ S H  against the longitudinal weld fatigue limit,  S FL   ×   F .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) If any check fails, modify the design conditions in Item a appropriately and repeat the steps in Items b through h.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommended methods for performing the steps in Items b through h, above, are described in 4.6 through 4.8. In 4.6
through 4.8, several figures give design curves for specific material properties or geometric conditions.  Interpolations
between the design curves may be done. Extrapolations beyond the design curve limits are not recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6 Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1.1  A carrier pipe at an uncased crossing will be subjected to both internal load from pressurization and external
loads from earth forces (dead load) and train or highway traffic (live load). An impact factor should be applied to the
live load. Recommended methods for calculating these loads and impact factors are described in the following
subsections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6.1.2  Other loads may be present as a result of temperature fluctuations caused by changes in season;
longitudinal tension due to end effects; fluctuations associated with pipeline operating conditions, unusual surface
loads associated with specialized equipment; and ground deformations arising from various sources, such as
shrinking and swelling soils, frost heave, local instability, nearby blasting, and undermining by adjacent excavations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

11<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipe stresses induced by temperature fluctuations can be included. All other loads are a result of special conditions.
Loads of this nature must be evaluated on a site-specific basis and, therefore, are outside the scope of this
recommended practice. Ingraffea et al. [4] describe how pipeline stresses can be influenced by longitudinal bends
and tees in the vicinity of the crossing, and they give equations to evaluate such effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6.2 External Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6.2.1 Earth Load<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The earth load is the force resulting from the weight of the overlying soil that is conveyed to the top of pipe. The earth
load is calculated according to the procedures widely adopted in practice for ditch conduits [10]. Such procedures
have been used in pipeline design for many years and have been included in specifications adopted by various
professional organizations [11, 12, 13].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6.2.2 Live Load<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6.2.2.1 Railroad Crossing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is assumed that the pipeline is subjected to the load from a single train as would be applied on either track shown in
Figure 1. For simultaneous loading of both tracks, stress increment factors for the cyclic longitudinal and cyclic
circumferential stress are used. The crossing is assumed to be oriented at 90 degrees with respect to the railroad and
is an embankment-type crossing as illustrated in Figure 1. This type of orientation generally is preferred in new
pipeline construction and is likely to result in pipeline stresses larger than those associated with pipelines crossing at
oblique angles to the railroad.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6.2.2.2 Highway Crossing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is assumed that the pipeline is subjected to the loads from two trucks traveling in adjacent lanes, such that there are
two sets of tandem or single axles in line with each other. The crossing is assumed to be oriented at 90 degrees with
respect to the highway and is an embankment-type crossing, as shown in Figure 1. This type of orientation generally
is preferred in new pipeline construction and is likely to result in pipeline stresses larger than those associated with
pipelines crossing at oblique angles to the highway.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6.3 Internal Load<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The internal load is produced by internal pressure,  p , in pounds per square inch (psi) or kilopascals (kPa). The
maximum allowable operating pressure,  MAOP  or maximum operating pressure,  MOP  should be used in the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7 Stresses<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For detailed information on the methods used to develop the design approaches and design curves for determining
stresses, see Ingraffea et al. [4].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7.2 Stresses Due to External Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External loading on the carrier pipe will produce both circumferential and longitudinal stresses. Recommended
procedures for calculating each component of these stresses follow. It is assumed that all external loads are
conveyed vertically across a 90 degree arc centered on the pipe crown and resisted by a vertical reaction distributed
across a 90 degree arc centered on the pipe invert.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is the stiffness factor for circumferential stress from earth load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

is the soil unit weight, in lb/in. 3  or kN/m 3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D
is the pipe outside diameter, in in. or m.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recommended that  γ  be taken as 120 lb/ft 3  (18.9 kN/m 3 ) (equivalent to 0.069 lb/in. 3 ) for most soil types unless a
higher value is justified on the basis of field or laboratory data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The earth load stiffness factor,  K He , accounts for the interaction between the soil and pipe and depends on the pipe
wall thickness to diameter ratio,  t w / D , and modulus of soil reaction,  E ' . Figure 3 shows  K He  plotted for various  E ' , as a
function of  t w / D . Values of  E '  appropriate for auger borer construction may range from 0.2 to 2.0 kips/in. 2  (1.4 to 13.8
mPa). It is recommended that  E '  be chosen as 0.5 kips/in. 2  (3.4 mPa), unless a higher value is judged more
appropriate by the designer. Table A-1 in Annex A gives typical values for  E ' .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The burial factor,  B e , is presented as a function of the ratio of pipe depth to bored diameter,  H / B d  for various soil
conditions in Figure 4. If the bored diameter is unknown or uncertain at the time of design, it is recommended that  B d
be taken as  D  + 2 in. (51 mm). For trenched construction and new structures constructed over existing pipelines,
B d  =  D  can be assumed, recognizing that soil compaction in the trench would lead to higher  E '  values than those for
auger bored installations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The excavation factor,  E e , is presented as a function of the ratio of bored diameter to pipe diameter,  B d / D  in Figure 5.
If the bored diameter is unknown or uncertain at the time of design,  E e  should be assumed equal to 1.0. For trenched
construction and new structures constructed over existing pipelines,  E e  can be assumed equal to 1.0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7.2.2 Stresses Due to Live Load<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7.2.2.1 Surface Live Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The live, external rail load is the vehicular load,  w , applied at the surface of the crossing. It is recommended that
Cooper E-80 loading of  w  = 13.9 psi (96 kPa) be used, unless the loads are known to be greater. This is the load
resulting from the uniform distribution of four 80-kip (356-kN) axles over an area 20 ft by 8 ft (6.1 m by 2.4 m).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The live external highway load,  w,  is due to the wheel load,  P , applied at the surface of the roadway. For design, only
the load from one of the wheel sets needs to be considered. The design wheel load should be either the maximum
wheel load from a truck’s single axle,  P s , or the maximum wheel load from a truck’s tandem axle set,  P t . Figure 6
shows the methods by which axle loads are converted into equivalent single wheel loads  P s  and  P t . For example, a
truck with a single axle load of 24 kips (106.8 kN) would have a design single wheel load of  P s  = 12 kips (53.4 kN) and
a truck with a tandem axle load of 40 kips (177.9 kN) would have a design tandem wheel load of  P t  = 10 kips
(44.5 kN). The maximum single axle wheel load recommended for design is  P s  = 12 kips (53.4 kN). The maximum
tandem axle wheel load recommended for design is  P t  = 10 kips (44.5 kN). The decision as to whether single or
tandem axle loading is more critical depends on the carrier pipe diameter,  D ; the depth of burial,  H ; and whether the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.8.2.1.1 Railroad Crossing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8.2.1.1.1  Equation 14 is the general form of the girth weld fatigue check. Since the value of  Δ S L  =  Δ S Lr  is
influenced by whether a single or double track crossing was selected, this must be accounted for in the fatigue
checks. It is overly conservative to assume that all of the applied load cycles will be those generated by simultaneous
loading of both tracks, with the train wheel sets always in phase directly above the crossing. Therefore, the cyclic
longitudinal stress used in the girth weld fatigue check at railroad crossings is based on the live load stress from a
single track loading situation. The resulting equation is given by the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(15)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Δ S Lr  N L
S FG
F<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Δ S Lr  is the cyclic longitudinal stress determined from Equation 4, in psi or kPa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N L
is the single or double track factor used in Equation 4 (see note).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S FG
is the fatigue endurance limit of girth weld = 12,000 psi (82,740 kPa).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F
is the design factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE    N L  = 1.00 for single track crossings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8.2.1.1.2  Equation 15 is applicable to railroad crossings in which a girth weld is located at a distance,  L G  less than
5 ft (1.5 m) from the centerline of the track. For other locations of a girth weld. Equation 15 is replaced by the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(16)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R F Δ S Lr  N L
S FG
F<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R F
is the longitudinal stress reduction factor for fatigue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R F  is obtained from Figures 18-A and 18-B. Figure 18-A is for values of  L G   greater than or equal to 5 ft (1.5 m) but less
than 10 ft (3 m). Figure 18-B is for values of  L G  greater than or equal to 10 ft (3 m).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.8.2.1.2 Highway Crossing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Longitudinal stress reduction factors to account for girth weld locations are not used, nor are double lane factors
used, since adjacent truck loadings already are considered in the design curves. The cyclic longitudinal stress for
highway crossings is determined using Equation 6. The girth weld fatigue check is given by the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.8.2.2 Longitudinal Weld<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.8.2.2.1  The cyclic stress that must be checked for potential fatigue in a longitudinal weld located beneath a
railroad or highway crossing is the circumferential stress due to live load. The check may be accomplished by
assuring that the live load cyclic circumferential stress is less than the factored fatigue endurance limit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The fatigue endurance limit of longitudinal welds,  S FL , is dependent on the type of weld and the minimum ultimate
tensile strength. Table 3 gives the fatigue endurance limits for seamless, ERW, and SAW longitudinal welds made in
various grade steels. For  SMYS  values intermediate to those listed in Table 3, the fatigue endurance limits for the
closest  SMYS  listed that is lower than the particular intermediate value should be used. For example, if the  SMYS  is
54,000 psi (372 mPa), the fatigue endurance limits for X52 grade steel would be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Equation 18 is the general form of the longitudinal weld fatigue check. As described in 4.8.2.1.1 dealing with girth
weld fatigue at railroad crossings, it is overly conservative to use double track cyclic stresses for fatigue purposes.
Therefore, the cyclic circumferential stress used in the longitudinal weld fatigue check at railroad crossings is the live
load stress from a single track loading situation. The resulting equation is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.9 Orientation of Longitudinal Welds at Railroad and Highway Crossings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design checks against longitudinal weld fatigue in this recommended practice are based on the maximum value
of the cyclic circumferential stress,  Δ S H . Thus, if the design check against longitudinal weld fatigue is satisfactory,
locating the weld at any location is acceptable. However, it may be advantageous to consider the circumferential
orientation of the pipeline welds during construction. The optimal location of all longitudinal welds is at the 45, 135,
225, or 315 degree position with the crown at the zero degree position. For any of these orientations, Equations 3 and
5 will predict conservative values of cyclic circumferential stress. Accordingly, these optimal weld locations listed
provide an additional margin of safety against longitudinal weld fatigue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.10 Location of Girth Welds at Railroad Crossings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The optimal location of a girth weld at railroad crossings is at a distance,  L G , of at least 10 ft (3 m) from the centerline
of the track for a single track crossing. As indicated in 4.8.2.1.1, substantial reductions in the value of applied cyclic
longitudinal stress may be obtained in this case. No reduction factor should be taken for the fatigue check when
evaluating pipeline crossings beneath two or more adjacent tracks. No reduction factor should be taken for the fatigue
check associated with highway crossings. The variable positioning of highway traffic makes it impractical to locate
girth welds for minimum cyclic loading effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Carrier Pipe Installed within a Casing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design procedures for casings beneath railroad and highway crossings have been established and used in practice
for many years. The relevant specifications for selecting minimal wall thickness in casings under railroads are given
by the American Railway Engineering Association [11], and design practices suitable for casings beneath railroads
and highways are provided by the American Society of Civil Engineers [13] and the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers [8, 9, 12]. Carrier pipe for cased crossings should conform to the material and design requirements of the
latest edition of ASME B31.4 or B3.1.8. Casings may be coated or bare.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Casings for Crossings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Suitable materials for casings are new or used line pipe, mill reject pipe, or other available steel tubular goods,
including longitudinally split casings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Minimum Internal Diameter of Casing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>T he  inside diameter of the casing pipe should be large enough to facilitate installation of the carrier pipe, to provide
proper insulation for maintenance of cathodic protection, and to prevent transmission of external loads from the
casing to the carrier pipe. The casing pipe should be at least two nominal pipe sizes larger than the carrier pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

steel casing for bored crossings in Annex C may be used. If the requirements of 5.7 cannot be met, installation of
casing at greater depths, the use of heavier wall casing pipe, stabilized backfill, or other accepted methods should be
utilized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.1  Carrier pipe installed in a casing should be held clear of the casing pipe by properly designed supports,
insulators, or other devices, and installed so that no external load will be transmitted to the carrier pipe. This also may
be accomplished by building up a ring of layers of coating and outer wrap, or by a concrete jacket. Where
manufactured insulators are used, they should be uniformly spaced and securely fastened to the carrier pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.2  Multiple carrier pipes may be installed with one casing pipe where restricted working areas, structural

<<HEADING level=3>>5.9 Casing Seals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The casing should be fitted with end seals at both ends to reduce the intrusion of water and fines from the
surrounding soil. It should be recognized that a water-tight seal may not always be possible under field conditions,
and in some circumstances water infiltration should be anticipated. The seal should be formed with a flexible material
that will inhibit the formation of a waterway through the casing,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should be welded to the casing, and should project through the ground surface at the right-of-way line or fence line

<<PARAGRAPH>>Supervision and inspection should be provided during construction of the crossing. Before installation, the section of
carrier pipe used at the crossing should be inspected visually for defects. All girth welds should be inspected by
radiographic or other nondestructive methods. After a cased crossing is installed, a test should be performed to
determine that the carrier pipe is electrically isolated from the casing pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Trenchless Installation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipe jacking with an auger borer is the predominant means in U.S. practice of pipeline installation beneath railroads
and highways. Percussive molding also is used but is restricted to small pipelines, typically less than 6 in. (150 mm) in
diameter. For trenchless construction techniques that excavate an oversized hole relative to the size of the pipe, the
diameter of the bored hole,  B d , needs to be known or specified before construction. By means of Figure 5, the
designer can account for the influence of the bored hole diameter,  B d , on the earth load transmitted to the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the auger is adjusted to excavate a hole equal in size to the pipe, or when percussive molding or a similar
insertion method is used, the designer should assume that the bored diameter is equal to the pipe diameter,  B d  =  D .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2 Boring, Jacking, or Tunneling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2.1  Auger boring for a pipeline crossing often is performed with an auger that is a fraction of an inch to as much
as 2 in. (51 mm) larger in diameter than the pipe, under circumstances in which the auger is advanced in front of the
casing. Modifications of the method, such as reducing the auger size and fitting the pipe or casing with stops to
prevent the auger from leading the pipe, can substantially reduce overexcavation. Reduction in the amount of
overexcavation will decrease the chances of disturbing the surrounding soil and overlying facility and can diminish the
amount of earth load imposed on the pipe. It should be recognized, however, that reductions in overcutting generally
will increase frictional and adhesive resistance to the advance of the pipe. It may be necessary, therefore, to require<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

pipe where it enters the backfilled launching and receiving pits. Good backfilling practice includes, but is not limited to,
removing remolded and disturbed soil from the bedding of the carrier pipe and placing fill compacted in sufficiently
small lifts to achieve a dense bedding for the carrier. Earth- or sand-filled bags or other suitable means should be
used to firmly support the carrier pipe adjacent to the crossing prior to backfill. Support materials subject to biological
attack, such as wooden blocking, may decompose and increase the chance of local corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1.1  Work on all trenched crossings from ditching to restoration of road surface should be scheduled to minimize
interruption of traffic.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.2  Where an open cut is used, the trench shall be sloped or shored in accordance with Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements. The pipe as laid should be centered in the ditch so as to provide
equal clearance on both sides between the pipe and the sides of the ditch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1.3  The bottom of the trench should be prepared to provide the pipe with uniform bedding throughout the length
of the crossing. In addition to being properly compactable, padding and backfill must be of appropriate quality to
prevent damage to pipeline and/or casing coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2 Backfill<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Backfill should be compacted sufficiently to prevent settlement detrimental to the facility to be crossed. Backfill should
be placed in layers of 12 in. (305 mm) or less (uncompacted thickness) and compacted thoroughly around the sides
and over the pipe to densities consistent with that of the surrounding soil. Trench soil used for backfill (or a substituted
backfill material) must be capable of producing the required compaction. In addition to being properly compactable,
padding and backfill must be of appropriate quality to prevent damage to pipeline and/or casing coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3 Surface Restoration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface of pavement that has been cut should be restored promptly in accordance with the appropriate highway
or railroad authority’s specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The considerations listed in 6.3.1 through 6.3.7 apply to trenchless and open cut pipeline installation, irrespective of
uncased or cased crossings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1 Construction Supervision<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Construction should be supervised by personnel qualified to oversee the welding of line pipe and the types of pipeline
installation referred to in 6.1 and 6.2. The work should be coordinated, and close communication should be
maintained between construction supervisors in the field and authorized agents of the railroad or highway to be
crossed. Precautionary measures should be taken when transporting construction equipment across railroads and
highways. Railroad and highway facilities should be protected at all times, and drainage ditches should be maintained
to avoid flooding or erosion of the roadbed and adjacent properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2 Inspection and Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection should be provided during the construction of the crossing. Before installation, the section of carrier pipe
used at the crossing should be inspected visually for defects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.3 Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carrier pipe at railroad or highway crossings should be welded with welding procedures developed in accordance
with the latest approved edition of API Standard 1104,  Welding, of Pipelines and Related Facilities  [7]. Nondestructive
testing in accordance with the aforementioned specification is required for all girth welds beneath or adjacent to the
crossing. At uncased crossings, nondestructive testing normally will be required for girth welds within a horizontal
distance of 50 ft (15 m) from either the outside or inside rail and from either the outside or inside highway pavement
line. For cased crossings, the same applies for welds within 50 ft (15 m) of the end seals of the casing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4 Pressure Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The carrier pipe section should be pressure tested before startup in accordance with 49  CFR , Part 192 or Part 195
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.5 Pipeline Markers and Signs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipeline markers and signs should be installed as set forth in the latest approved edition of API Recommended
Practice 1109,  Marking, Liquid Petroleum Pipeline Facilities  [17].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.6 Cathodic Protection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.6.1  Cathodic protection systems at cased crossings should be reviewed carefully. Casings may reduce or
eliminate the effectiveness of cathodic protection. The introduction of a casing creates a more complicated electrical
system than would prevail for uncased crossings, so there may be difficulties in securing and interpreting cathodic
protection measurements at cased crossings. Test stations with test leads attached to the carrier pipe and casing pipe
should be provided at each cased crossing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.6.2  A cased carrier pipe can be exposed to atmospheric corrosion as a result of air circulation through vents
attached to the casing and moisture condensation in the casing annulus. A proper coating, jeep testing, proper
spacing and end seals reduce the potential for atmospheric corrosion or electrical shorts. This problem may be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

accomplished immediately after construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.7 Pipe Coatings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipeline coatings should be selected with due consideration of the construction technique and the abrasion and
contact forces associated with pipeline installation. There are a variety of coatings that are tough and exhibit good
resistance to surface stress, moisture adsorption, and cathodic disbondment. In areas where damage to the
protective coating is likely, consideration should be given to applying an additional protective coating, such as
concrete, over the carrier pipe coating prior to installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 Railroads and Highways Crossing Existing Pipelines<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Adjustment of Pipelines at Crossings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If an existing pipeline at a proposed railroad or highway crossing complies with the requirements of this practice, no
adjustment of the pipeline is necessary. However, other considerations outside the scope of this recommended
practice may necessitate an adjustment to an existing pipeline. If adjustments are required, the pipeline crossing
should be lowered, repaired, reconditioned, replaced, or relocated in accordance with this practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Adjustment of In-service Pipelines<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.1 Lowering Operations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If lowering of the pipeline at a crossing in place is required, care should be exercised during the design phase and the
lowering operation to prevent undue stress on the pipeline, in accordance with the latest approved edition of API
Recommended Practice 1117,  Lowering In-Service Pipelines  [18]. The pipeline should be uncovered for a sufficient
distance on either side of the crossing so that the carrier pipe may be uniformly lowered to fit the ditch at the required
depth by natural sag. All movements of liquid petroleum pipelines should comply with the U.S. Department of
Transportation’s required maximum operating pressures, as contained in 49  Code of Federal Regulations  Part
195 [6].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.2 Split Casings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where stress due to external loads of the railroad or highway necessitates casing of a pipeline, the casing may be
installed by using the split casing method. This method provides for cutting the casing into two longitudinal segments
and welding the segments together over the carrier pipe after the coating is repaired and casing insulators are
installed. Precautions should be taken to prevent weld splatter from the welding operation from causing damage to
the carrier pipe coating or the insulating spacers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.3 Temporary Bypasses<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A temporary bypass utilizing suitable mechanical means to isolate the section to be adjusted may be installed to avoid
interruption of service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Adjustments of Pipelines Requiring Interruption of Service<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a pipeline cannot be taken out of service for more than a few hours for a required adjustment, a new separate
crossing generally is constructed. In such cases, the only shutdown required is the time necessary for making the tie
in connections of the new pipeline to the existing line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Protection of Pipelines During Highway or Railroad Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An agreement between the pipeline company and the party constructing the crossing should be made to protect the
pipeline from excessive loads or damage from grading (cut or fill) by work equipment during the construction of the
railroad or highway. The pipeline alignment should be clearly marked with suitable flags, stakes, or other markers at
the crossing. This recommended practice should be used to determine expected stresses on the pipeline. As
necessary, suitable bridging, reinforced concrete slabs, or other measures should be employed to protect the
pipeline.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(44.5 kN), the critical axle configuration may be different than given in Table 1. Figure A-1 is used to determine
whether single or tandem axle configurations produce greater carrier pipe live load stresses. If the design  P s  and  P t
coordinate ties above the line in Figure A-1 for a particular design pavement type, burial depth,  H , and carrier pipe
diameter,  D , then single axle configurations are more critical. If the design  P s  and  P t  coordinate lies below the line in
Figure A-1 for a particular design pavement type, then tandem axle configurations are more critical. In Figure A-1, the
plotted points represent the recommended design loads of  P s  = 12 kips (53.4 kN) and  P t  = 10 kips (44.5 kN), with the
resulting critical axle configurations as given in Table 1 in the main body of this recommended practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A 12.75-in. (324-mm) diameter liquid product pipeline with a wall thickness of 0.250 in. (6.4 mm) is intended to cross
a major highway that is paved with asphaltic concrete. The pipe is constructed of Grade X42 steel with ERW welds
and will operate at a maximum pressure of 1000 psi (6.9 MPa). The pipeline will be installed without a casing at a
design depth of 6 ft (1.8 m), using auger boring construction with a 2-in. (51-mm) overbore. The soil at the site was
determined to be a loose sand with a resilient modulus of 10 kips/in. 2  (69 MPa).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
