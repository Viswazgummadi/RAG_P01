<<HEADING level=3>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Standard is based on the accumulated knowledge and experience of Purchasers and Manufacturers of welded
oil storage tanks of various sizes and capacities for internal pressures not more than 17.2 kPa (2 1 / 2  pounds per
square inch) gauge. This Standard is meant to be a purchase specification to facilitate the manufacture and
procurement of storage tanks for the petroleum industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the tanks are purchased in accordance with this Standard, the Purchaser is required to specify certain basic
requirements. The Purchaser may want to modify, delete, or amplify sections of this Standard, but reference to this
Standard shall not be made on the nameplates of or on the Manufacturer’s certification for tanks that do not fulfill the
minimum requirements of this Standard or that exceed its limitations. It is strongly recommended that any
modifications, deletions, or amplifications be made by supplementing this Standard rather than by rewriting or
incorporating sections of it into another complete standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design rules given in this Standard are minimum requirements. More stringent design rules specified by the
Purchaser or furnished by the Manufacturer are acceptable when mutually agreed upon by the Purchaser and the
Manufacturer. This Standard is not to be interpreted as approving, recommending, or endorsing any specific design or
as limiting the method of design or construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shall: As used in a standard, “shall” denotes a minimum requirement in order to conform to the specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Should: As used in a standard, “should” denotes a recommendation or that which is advised but not required in order
to conform to the specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Standard is not intended to cover storage tanks that are to be erected in areas subject to regulations more
stringent than the specifications in this Standard. When this Standard is specified for such tanks, it should be followed
insofar as it does not conflict with local  requirements. The Purchaser is responsible for specifying any jurisdictional
requirements applicable to the design and construction of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After revisions to this Standard have been issued, they may be applied to tanks that are to be completed after the date
of issue. The tank nameplate shall state the date of the edition of the Standard and any revision to that edition to
which the tank has been designed and constructed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each edition, revision, or addenda to this API Standard may be used beginning with the date of issuance shown on
the cover page for that edition, revision, or addenda. Each edition, revision, or addenda to this API Standard becomes
effective six months after the date of issuance for equipment that is certified as being constructed, and inspected per
this Standard. During the six-month time between the date of issuance of the edition, revision, or addenda and the
effective date, the Purchaser and the Manufacturer shall specify to which edition, revision, or addenda the equipment
is to be constructed and inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Important Information Concerning Use of Asbestos or Alternative Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Asbestos is specified or referenced for certain components of the equipment described in some API standards. It has
been of extreme usefulness in minimizing fire hazards associated with petroleum processing. It has also been a
universal sealing material, compatible with most refining fluid services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain serious adverse health effects are associated with asbestos, among them the serious and often fatal diseases
of lung cancer, asbestosis, and mesothelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings). The degree of exposure
to asbestos varies with the product and the work practices involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consult the most recent edition of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), U.S. Department of
Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Standard for Asbestos, Tremolite, Anthophyllite, and Actinolite, 29  Code of
Federal Regulations  Section 1910.1001; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Emission Standard for
Asbestos, 40  Code of Federal Regulations  Sections 61.140 through 61.156; and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) rule on labeling requirements and phased banning of asbestos products (Sections 763.160-179).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are currently in use and under development a number of substitute materials to replace asbestos in certain
applications. Manufacturers and users are encouraged to develop and use effective substitute materials that can
meet the specifications for, and operating requirements of, the equipment to which they would apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SAFETY AND HEALTH INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR PRODUCTS OR MATERIALS CAN BE
OBTAINED FROM THE EMPLOYER, THE MANUFACTURER OR SUPPLIER OF THAT PRODUCT OR MATERIAL,
OR THE MATERIAL SAFETY DATASHEET.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Plates produced and tested in accordance with the requirements of a recognized national standard and within the
mechanical and chemical limitations of one of the grades listed in Table 4.2 are acceptable when approved by the
Purchaser. The requirements of this group do not apply to the ASTM, CSA, ISO, and EN specifications listed in 4.2.2,
4.2.3, 4.2.4, and 4.2.5. For the purposes of this standard, a  national standard  is a standard that has been sanctioned
by the government of the country from which the standard originates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7 General Requirements for Delivery<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7.1  The material furnished shall conform to the applicable requirements of the listed specifications but is not
restricted with respect to the location of the place of manufacture.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.7.2  This material is intended to be suitable for fusion welding. Welding technique is of fundamental importance,
and welding procedures must provide welds whose strength and toughness are consistent with the plate material
being joined. All welding performed to repair surface defects shall be done with low-hydrogen welding electrodes
compatible in chemistry, strength, and quality with the plate material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7.3  When specified by the plate purchaser, the steel shall be fully killed. When specified by the plate purchaser,
fully killed steel shall be made to fine-grain practice.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.7.4  For plate that is to be made to specifications that limit the maximum manganese content to less than 1.60 %,
the limit of the manganese content may be increased to 1.60 % (heat) at the option of the plate producer to maintain
the required strength level, provided that the maximum carbon content is reduced to 0.20 % (heat) and the weldability
of the plate is given consideration. The material shall be marked “Mod” following the specification listing. The material
shall conform to the product analysis tolerances of Table B in ASTM A6M/A6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.7.5  The use or presence of columbium, vanadium, nitrogen, copper, nickel, chromium, or molybdenum shall not
exceed the limitations of Table 4.1 for all Group VI materials (see Table 4.4a and Table 4.4b) and CSA G40.21 Grades

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8 Heat Treatment of Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.8.1  When specified by the plate purchaser, fully killed plates shall be heat treated to produce grain refinement by
either normalizing or heating uniformly for hot forming. If the required treatment is to be obtained in conjunction with
hot forming, the temperature to which the plates are heated for hot forming shall be equivalent to and shall not
significantly exceed the normalizing temperature. If the treatment of the plates is not specified to be done at the plate
producer’s plant, testing shall be carried out in accordance with 4.2.8.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.8.2  When a plate purchaser elects to perform the required normalizing or fabricates by hot forming (see 4.2.8.1),
the plates shall be accepted on the basis of mill tests made on full-thickness specimens heat treated in accordance
with the plate purchaser’s order. If the heat-treatment temperatures are not indicated on the contract, the specimens
shall be heat treated under conditions considered appropriate for grain refinement and for meeting the test
requirements. The plate producer shall inform the plate purchaser of the procedure followed in treating the specimens
at the steel mill.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8.3  On the purchase order, the plate purchaser shall indicate to the plate producer whether the producer shall

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.9.2  When it is necessary to prepare test specimens from separate coupons or when plates are furnished by the
plate producer in a hot-rolled condition with subsequent heat treatment by the fabricator, the procedure shall conform
to ASTM A20.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.9.3  An impact test shall be performed on three specimens taken from a single test coupon or test location. The
average value of the specimens (with no more than one specimen value being less than the specified minimum
value) shall comply with the specified minimum value. If more than one value is less than the specified minimum
value, or if one value is less than two-thirds the specified minimum value, three additional specimens shall be tested,
and each of these must have a value greater than or equal to the specified minimum value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9.4  The test specimens shall be Charpy V-notch Type A specimens (see ASTM A370), with the notch
perpendicular to the surface of the plate being tested.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.9.5  For a plate whose thickness is insufficient to permit preparation of full-size specimens [10 mm  ×  10 mm
(0.394 in.  ×  0.394 in.], tests shall be made on the largest subsize specimens that can be prepared from the plate.
Subsize specimens shall have a width along the notch of at least 80 % of the material thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9.6  The impact energy values obtained from subsize specimens shall not be less than values that are
proportional to the energy values required for full-size specimens of the same material.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.9.7  The testing apparatus, including the calibration of impact machines and the permissible variations in the
temperature of specimens, shall conform to ASTM A370 or an equivalent testing apparatus conforming to national
standards or ISO standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.10 Toughness Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.10.1  The thickness and design metal temperature of all shell plates, shell reinforcing plates, shell insert plates
and thickened insert plates, bottom plates welded to the shell, plates used for manhole and nozzle necks, plate-ring
shell-nozzle flanges, blind flanges, and manhole cover plates shall be in accordance with Figure 4.1a and Figure
4.1b. Notch toughness evaluation of plate-ring flanges, blind flanges, and manhole cover plates shall be based on
“governing thickness” as defined in 4.5.4.3. In addition, plates more than 40 mm (1.5 in.) thick shall be of killed steel
made to fine-grain practice and heat treated by normalizing, normalizing and tempering, or quenching and tempering,
and each plate as heat treated shall be impact tested according to 4.2.11.2. Each TMCP A841 plate-as-rolled shall be
impact tested. Impact test temperature and required energy shall be in accordance with 4.2.11.2 in lieu of the default
temperature and energy given in A841.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.10.2  Subject to the Purchaser’s approval, thermo-mechanical-control-process (TMCP) plates (plates produced
by a mechanical-thermal rolling process designed to enhance notch toughness) may alternatively be used where
heat treated plates are normally required by 4.2.10.1 because of thickness over 40 mm (1.5 in.). In this case, each
TMCP plate-as-rolled shall receive Charpy V-notch impact energy testing in accordance with 4.2.9, 4.2.10, and
4.2.11. When TMCP steels are used, consideration should be given to the service conditions outlined in 5.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.10.3  Plates less than or equal to 40 mm (1.5 in.) thick may be used at or above the design metal temperatures
indicated in Figure 4.1a and Figure 4.1b without being impact tested. To be used at design metal temperatures lower
than the temperatures indicated in Figure 4.1a and Figure 4.1b, plates shall demonstrate adequate notch toughness
in accordance with 4.2.11.3 unless 4.2.11.2 or 4.2.11.4 has been specified by the Purchaser. For heat-treated material<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11.1  When a material’s toughness must be determined, it shall be done by one of the procedures described in
4.2.11.2, 4.2.11.3, and 4.2.11.4, as specified in 4.2.10.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.11.2  Each plate as rolled or heat treated shall be impact tested in accordance with 4.2.9 at or below the design
metal temperature to show Charpy V-notch longitudinal (or transverse) values that fulfill the minimum requirements of
Table 4.5a and Table 4.5b (see 4.2.9 for the minimum values for one specimen and for subsize specimens). As used
here, the term plate as rolled refers to the unit plate rolled from a slab or directly from an ingot in its relation to the
location and number of specimens, not to the condition of the plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5.4.1
Lap-welded bottom plates shall be reasonably rectangular .  Additionally, plate may be either square cut or
may have mill edges. Mill edges to be welded shall be relatively smooth and uniform, free of deleterious deposits, and
have a shape such that a full fillet weld can be achieved. Unless otherwise specified by the Purchaser, lap welded
plates on sloped bottoms shall be overlapped in a manner to reduce the tendency for liquid to puddle during draw-
down.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5.4.2
Three-plate laps in tank bottoms shall be at least 300 mm (12 in.) from each other, from the tank shell, and
from joints between annular plates and the bottom. A three-plate lap is created where three plates come together and
all plates are joined to one another by lap welds. A location where a pair of bottom plates are lap-welded to each other
and are lapped onto an annular plate constitutes a three-plate lap, but lapping a single bottom plate onto a butt-
welded annular plate splice does not constitute a three-plate lap weld since the two annular plates are not joined
together by a lap weld. These lap joint connections to the butt-weld annular plate are illustrated in Figure 5.3d.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Purchaser shall specify any applicable special metallurgical requirements pertaining to the selection of materials
and the fabrication processes as required by any anticipated service conditions. When the service conditions might
include the presence of hydrogen sulfide or other conditions that could promote hydrogen-induced cracking, notably
near the bottom of the shell at the shell-to-bottom connections, care should be taken to ensure that the materials of
the tank and details of construction are adequate to resist hydrogen-induced cracking. The Purchaser should
consider limits on the sulfur content of the base and weld metals as well as appropriate quality control procedures in
plate and tank fabrication. The hardness of the welds, including the heat-affected zones, in contact with these
conditions should be considered. The weld metal and adjacent heat-affected zone often contain a zone of hardness
well in excess of Rockwell C 22 and can be expected to be more susceptible to cracking than unwelded metal is. Any
hardness criteria should be a matter of agreement between the Purchaser and the Manufacturer and should be
based on an evaluation of the expected hydrogen sulfide concentration in the product, the possibility of moisture
being present on the inside metal surface, and the strength and hardness characteristics of the base metal and weld
metal. See the Data Sheet, Line 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

When the bottom shell course is designed using the allowable stress for materials in Group IV, IVA, V, or VI,
butt-welded annular bottom plates shall be used (see 5.1.5.6). When the bottom shell course is of a material in Group
IV, IVA, V, or VI and the maximum product stress (see 5.6.2.1) for the first shell course is less than or equal to 160
MPa (23,200 lbf/in. 2 ) or the maximum hydrostatic test stress (see 5.6.2.2) for the first shell course is less than or
equal to 171 MPa (24,900 lbf/in. 2 ), lap-welded bottom plates (see 5.1.5.4) may be used in lieu of butt-welded annular
bottom plates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.2
Annular bottom plates shall have a radial width that provides at least 600 mm (24 in.) between the inside of the

The steps described in 5.6.4.6 and 5.6.4.7 shall be repeated using the calculated value of  t x  as  t u  until there
is little difference between the calculated values of  t x  in succession (repeating the steps twice is normally sufficient).
Repeating the steps provides a more exact location of the design point for the course under consideration and,
consequently, a more accurate shell thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

There are two examples provided in Annex K. Example #1 are step-by-step calculations illustrating an
application of the variable-design-point method to a tank with a diameter of 85 m (280 ft) and a height of 19.2 m (64 ft)
to determine shell-plate thicknesses for the first three courses for the hydrostatic test condition only. Example #2
demonstrates the variable-design-point design method in US Customary units for a tank with a diameter of 280 ft and
a height of 40 ft with varying corrosion allowances and varying materials for both the design and hydrostatic test
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Calculation of Thickness by Elastic Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For tanks where  L/H  is greater than 1000/6 (2 in USC units), the selection of shell thicknesses shall be based on an
elastic analysis that shows the calculated circumferential shell stresses to be below the allowable stresses given in
Table 5.2a and Table 5.2b. The boundary conditions for the analysis shall assume a fully plastic moment caused by
yielding of the plate beneath the shell and zero radial growth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The following requirements for shell openings are intended to restrict the use of appurtenances to those
providing for attachment to the shell by welding. See Figure 5.6.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.1.2
The shell opening designs described in this standard are required, except for alternative designs allowed in
5.7.1.8.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7.1.4
When a size intermediate to the sizes listed in Tables 5.3a through 5.12b is specified by the Purchaser, the
construction details and reinforcements shall conform to the next larger opening listed in the tables. The size of the
opening or tank connection shall not be larger than the maximum size given in the appropriate table.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7.1.5
Openings near the bottom of a tank shell will tend to rotate with vertical bending of the shell under
hydrostatic loading. Shell openings in this area that have attached piping or other external loads shall be reinforced
not only for the static condition but also for any loads imposed on the shell connections by the restraint of the attached
piping to the shell rotation. The external loads shall be minimized, or the shell connections shall be relocated outside
the rotation area. Annex P provides a method for evaluating openings that conform to Table 5.6a and Table 5.6b.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If a shell plate thicker than required is used for the product and hydrostatic loading (see 5.6), the excess shell-plate thickness, within a
vertical distance both above and below the centerline of the hole in the tank shell plate equal to the vertical dimension of the hole in the tank
shell plate, may be considered as reinforcement, and the thickness  T  of the manhole reinforcing plate may be decreased accordingly. In such
cases, the reinforcement and the attachment welding shall conform to the design limits for reinforcement of shell openings specified in 5.7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b
The minimum neck thickness shall be the required corroded thickness of the shell plate or the minimum flange thickness of the bolting flange
(see Table 5.3a), whichever is thinner. If the neck thickness is greater than the required minimum, the manhole reinforcing plate thickness
may be deceased accordingly. In such cases the reinforcement and the attachment welding shall conform to the design limits of the
reinforcement of the shell opening in 5.7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If a shell plate thicker than required is used for the product and hydrostatic loading (see 5.6), the excess shell-plate thickness, within a vertical
distance both above and below the centerline of the hole in the tank shell plate equal to the vertical dimension of the hole in the tank shell
plate, may be considered as reinforcement, and the thickness  T  of the manhole reinforcing plate may be decreased accordingly. In such
cases, the reinforcement and the attachment welding shall conform to the design limits for reinforcement of shell openings specified in 5.7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b
The minimum neck thickness shall be the required corroded thickness of the shell plate or the minimum flange thickness of the bolting flange
(see Table 5.3b), whichever is thinner. If the neck thickness is greater than the required minimum, the manhole reinforcing plate thickness
may be deceased accordingly. In such cases the reinforcement and the attachment welding shall conform to the design limits of the
reinforcement of the shell opening in 5.7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The reinforcing plate. Reinforcing plates for manholes, nozzles, and other attachments shall be of the same
nominal composition (i.e. same ASME P-number and Group Number) as the tank part to which they are attached,
unless approved otherwise by the Purchaser (refer to 9.2.1.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The portion of the neck of the fitting that may be considered as reinforcement according to 5.7.2.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Excess shell-plate thickness. Reinforcement may be provided by any shell-plate thickness in excess of the
thickness required by the governing load condition within a vertical distance above and below the centerline of the
hole in the shell equal to the vertical dimension of the hole in the tank shell plate as long as the extra shell-plate
thickness is the actual plate thickness used less the required thickness, calculated at the applicable opening,
considering all load conditions and the corrosion allowance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) The material in the nozzle neck. The strength of the material in the nozzle neck used for reinforcement should
preferably be the same as the strength of the tank shell, but lower strength material is permissible as
reinforcement as long as the neck material has minimum specified yield and tensile strengths not less than 70 %
and 80 %, respectively, of the shell-plate minimum specified yield and tensile strengths. When the material
strength is greater than or equal to the 70 % and 80 % minimum values, the area in the neck available for
reinforcement shall be reduced by the ratio of the allowable stress in the neck, using the governing stress factors,
to the allowable stress in the attached shell plate. No credit may be taken for the additional strength of any
reinforcing material that has a higher allowable stress than that of the shell plate. Neck material that has a yield or
tensile strength less than the 70 % or 80 % minimum values may be used, provided that no neck area is
considered as effective reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The following portions of the neck of a fitting may be considered part of the area of reinforcement, except
where prohibited by 5.7.2.3, Item e:<<HEADING_END>>

For extra-strong pipe, see ASTM A53M or A106M for other wall thicknesses; however, piping material must conform to 4.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b
The width of the shell plate shall be sufficient to contain the reinforcing plate and to provide clearance from the girth joint of the shell course.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c
Low type reinforced nozzles shall not be located lower than the minimum distance shown in Column 9. The minimum distance from the bottom
shown in Column 9 complies with spacing rules of 5.7.3 and Figure 5.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d
Regular type reinforced nozzles shall not be located lower than the minimum distance  H N  shown in Column 8 when shell thickness is equal to
or less than 12.5 mm. Greater distances may be required for shells thicker than 12.5 mm to meet the minimum weld spacing of 5.7.3 and
Figure 5.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e
See Table 5.7a, Column 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f
Flanged nozzles and couplings in pipe sizes NPS 2 or smaller do not require reinforcing plates.  D R  will be the diameter of the hole in the shell
plate, and Weld  A  will be as specified in Table 5.7a, Column 6. Reinforcing plates may be used if the construction details comply with
reinforced nozzle details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g
A coupling in an NPS 3 requires reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For extra-strong pipe, see ASTM A53 or A106 for other wall thicknesses; however, piping material must conform to 4.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b
The width of the shell plate shall be sufficient to contain the reinforcing plate and to provide clearance from the girth joint of the shell course.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c
Low type reinforced nozzles shall not be located lower than the minimum distance shown in Column 9. The minimum distance from the bottom
shown in Column 9 complies with spacing rules of 5.7.3 and Figure 5.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d
Regular type reinforced nozzles shall not be located lower than the minimum distance  H N  shown in Column 8 when shell thickness is equal to
or less than  1 / 2  in. Greater distances may be required for shells thicker than  1 / 2  in. to meet the minimum weld spacing of 5.7.3 and Figure 5.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e
See Table 5.7b, Column 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f
Flanged nozzles and couplings in pipe sizes NPS 2 or smaller do not require reinforcing plates.  D R  will be the diameter of the hole in the shell
plate, and Weld  A  will be as specified in Table 5.7b, Column 6. Reinforcing plates may be used if the construction details comply with
reinforced nozzle details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If a shell plate thicker than required is used for the product and hydrostatic loading (see 5.6), the excess shell-plate thickness, within a vertical
distance both above and below the centerline of the hole in the tank shell plate equal to the vertical dimension of the hole in the tank shell
plate, may be considered as reinforcement, and the thickness  T  of the nozzle reinforcing plate may be decreased accordingly. In such cases,
the reinforcement and the attachment welding shall conform to the design limits for reinforcement of shell openings specified in 5.7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If a shell plate thicker than required is used for the product and hydrostatic loading (see 5.6), the excess shell-plate thickness, within a
vertical distance both above and below the centerline of the hole in the tank shell plate equal to the vertical dimension of the hole in the tank
shell plate, may be considered as reinforcement, and the thickness  T  of the nozzle reinforcing plate may be decreased accordingly. In such
cases, the reinforcement and the attachment welding shall conform to the design limits for reinforcement of shell openings specified in 5.7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The attachment weld to the shell along the outer periphery of a reinforcing plate or proprietary connection

lines drawn tangent to the shell opening; however, the outer peripheral weld shall be applied completely around the
reinforcement. See 5.7.2.8 for allowable stresses. All of the inner peripheral weld shall be considered effective. The
strength of the effective attachment weld shall be considered as the weld’s shear resistance at the stress value given
for fillet welds in 5.7.2.8. The size of the outer peripheral weld shall be equal to the thickness of the shell plate or
reinforcing plate, whichever is thinner, but shall not be greater than 40 mm (1 1 / 2  in.). When low-type nozzles are used
with a reinforcing plate that extends to the tank bottom (see Figure 5.8), the size of the portion of the peripheral weld
that attaches the reinforcing plate to the bottom plate shall conform to 5.1.5.7. The inner peripheral weld shall be large
enough to sustain the remainder of the loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

range of 600 °C to 650 °C (1100 °F to 1200 °F) for 1 hour per 25 mm (1 in.) of thickness prior to installation. The
stress-relieving requirements need not include the flange-to-neck welds or other nozzle-neck and manhole-neck
attachments, provided the following conditions are fulfilled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The welds are outside the reinforcement (see 5.7.2.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

welding-neck flange does not exceed 19 mm ( 3 / 4  in.). If the material is preheated to a minimum temperature of
90 °C (200 °F) during welding, the weld limits of 16 mm ( 5 / 8  in.) and 19 mm ( 3 / 4  in.) may be increased to 32 mm
and 40 mm (1 1 / 4  in. and 1 1 / 2  in.), respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7.4.3  When the shell material is Group IV, IVA, V, or VI, all opening connections requiring reinforcement in a shell
plate or thickened insert plate more than 13 mm ( 1 / 2  in.) thick shall be prefabricated into the shell plate or thickened
insert plate, and the prefabricated assembly shall be thermally stress relieved within a temperature range of 600 °C to
650 °C (1100 °F to 1200 °F) for 1 hour per 25 mm (1 in.) of thickness prior to installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When connections are installed in quenched and tempered material, the maximum thermal stress-relieving
temperature shall not exceed the tempering temperature for the materials in the prefabricated stress-relieving
assembly. The stress-relieving requirements do not apply to the weld to the bottom annular plate, but they do apply to
flush-type cleanout openings when the bottom reinforcing plate is an annular-plate section. The stress-relieving

When it is impractical to stress relieve at a minimum temperature of 600 °C (1100 °F), it is permissible,
subject to the Purchaser’s agreement, to carry out the stress-relieving operation at lower temperatures for longer
periods of time in accordance with the tabulation below. The lower temperature/longer time PWHT may not provide
material toughness and residual stresses equivalent to that using the higher temperature/shorter time PWHT;
therefore, a review by a knowledgeable metallurgist and possible verification by mill testing of heat-treated coupons
and/or testing of welded plates shall be considered. See Line 23 of the Data Sheet for any Purchaser-specified
requirements applicable to this heat-treatment option.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Unless otherwise specified, shell nozzle flanges, excluding manholes, in sizes NPS 1 1 / 2  through
NPS 20 and NPS 24 shall meet the requirements of ASME B16.5. For sizes larger than NPS 24 but not greater
than NPS 60, flanges shall meet the requirements of ASME B16.47 ,  Series A or Series B. Series A and Series
B flanges are not compatible in all sizes and must be carefully selected to match the mating flange. If
diameters, materials of construction, and flange styles of ASME B16.47 are unavailable, fabricated flanges with
drilling template (bolt circle diameter, number of holes, and hole diameter) matching Series A or Series B shall
be used. These fabricated flanges shall be designed in accordance with the ASME  Boiler and Pressure Vessel
Code,  Section VIII, Division 1, Section UG-34 and Annex 2. The allowable stresses for design shall be a matter
of agreement between the Purchaser and the Manufacturer. Bolt holes shall straddle the vertical centerline of
the flange.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Shell nozzles (and flanges, if specified by the Purchaser as an alternate to a. above) shall conform to
Figure 5.7b, Figure 5.8, and Figure 5.10 and Tables 5.6a through 5.8b, but other shapes are permitted by 5.7.1.8. An
alternative connection design is permissible for the nozzle end that is not welded to the shell, if it provides equivalent
strength, toughness, leak tightness, and utility and if the Purchaser agrees to its use in writing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

provided the width of the reinforcing plate ( W  or  D o  in Figure 5.8 and Table 5.6a and Table 5.6b) is increased by the
amount that the horizontal chord of the opening cut in the shell plate ( D p  in Figure 5.8 and Table 5.7a and Table 5.7b)
increases as the opening is changed from circular to elliptical for the angular installation. In addition, nozzles not
larger than NPS 3—for the insertion of thermometer wells, for sampling connections, or for other purposes not
involving the attachment of extended piping—may be installed at an angle of 15 degrees or less off perpendicular in a
vertical plane without modification of the nozzle reinforcing plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Shell Attachments<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8.1.1
Shell attachments shall be made, inspected, and removed in conformance with Section 7.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Permanent attachments are items welded to the shell that will remain while the tank is in its intended service.
These include items such as wind girders, stairs, gauging systems, davits, walkways, tank anchors, supports for
internal items such as heating coils and other piping supports, ladders, floating roof supports welded to the shell,
exterior piping supports, grounding clips, insulation rings, and electrical conduit and fixtures. Items installed above
the maximum liquid level of the tank are not permanent attachments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Temporary attachments are items welded to the shell that will be removed prior to the tank being commissioned
into its intended service. These include items such as alignment clips, fitting equipment, stabilizers, and lifting
lugs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.1.2
When attachments are made to shell courses of material in Group IV, IVA, V, or VI, the movement of the
shell (particularly the movement of the bottom course) under hydrostatic loading shall be considered, and the
attachments shall meet the following requirements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Permanent attachments may be welded directly to the shell with fillet welds having a maximum leg dimension of
13 mm ( 1 / 2  in.). The edge of any permanent attachment welds shall be at least 75 mm (3 in.) from the horizontal
joints of the shell and at least 150 mm (6 in.) from the vertical joints, insert-plate joints, thickened insert plate joints,
or reinforcing-plate fillet welds. Permanent attachment welds may cross shell horizontal or vertical butt welds
providing the welds are continuous within these limits and the angle of incidence between the two welds is greater
than or equal to 45 degrees. Additionally, any splice weld in the permanent attachment shall be located a
minimum of 150 mm (6 in.) from any shell weld unless the splice weld is kept from intersecting the shell weld by
acceptable modifications to the attachment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Cover Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.3.1
Unreinforced openings less than or equal to NPS 2 pipe size are permissible in flat cover plates without
increasing the cover plate thickness if the edges of the openings are not closer to the center of the cover plate than
one-fourth the height or diameter of the opening. Requirements for openings NPS 2 pipe size and smaller that do not
satisfy the location requirement and for larger reinforced openings are given in 5.8.3.2 through 5.8.3.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.3.2
Reinforced openings in the cover plates of shell manholes and flush-type clean outs shall be limited to one-
half the diameter of the manhole or one-half the least dimension of the flush-type clean out opening but shall not
exceed NPS 12 pipe size. The reinforcement added to an opening may be a reinforcing plate or an increased
thickness of the cover plate, but in either case, the reinforcement shall provide an added reinforcing area no less than
the cutout area of the opening in the cover plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A cover plate with a nozzle attachment for product-mixing equipment shall have a thickness at least 1.4 times greater
than the thickness required by Table 5.3a and Table 5.3b. The added thickness (or pad plate) for replacement of the
opening cutout in the cover plate shall be based on Table 5.3a and Table 5.3b. The 40 % increase in thickness within
a radius of one diameter of the opening may be included as part of the area of replacement required. The mixer-
nozzle attachment to the cover plate shall be a full-penetration weld. The manhole bolting-flange thickness shall not
be less than 1.4 times the thickness required by Table 5.3a and Table 5.3b. The manhole nozzle neck shall be
designed to support the mixer forces with a minimum thickness not less than the requirements of Table 5.4a and
Table 5.4b without comparison to the increased bolting-flange thickness noted in this section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.3.3
When cover plates (or blind flanges) are required for shell nozzles, the minimum thickness shall be that
given for flanges in Table 5.8a and Table 5.8b. Reinforced openings in the cover plates (or blind flanges) of shell
nozzles shall be limited to one-half the diameter of the nozzle. The reinforcement added to an opening may be an
added pad plate or an increased thickness of the cover plate, but in either case, the reinforcement shall provide an
added reinforcing area no less than 50 % of the cutout area of the opening in the cover plate. Mixer nozzles may be
attached to cover plates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.3.4
Openings in the cover plates of flush-type cleanout fittings shall be located on the vertical centerline of the
cover plate and shall be in accordance with 5.8.3.1 and 5.8.3.2. Adequate provisions should be made for free
movement of connected piping to minimize thrusts and moments on the cover plate to 2225 N (500 lbs) and 60 N-m
(500 ft-lbs). Analysis or load leak test may be used to accept greater loads or moments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.3.5
Shell manhole covers shall have two handles. Those covers weighing more than 34 kg (75 lb) shall be

All free vents shall be provided with corrosion-resistant coarse-mesh bird screens of a maximum opening
size of (19 mm [ 3 / 4  in.] nominal opening). It is recommended that in areas where snow drifting or icing may be an
issue, special attention to vent details (such as profile, diameter, capacity, arrangement, or increased screen size)
should be made. In these situations the Purchaser shall specify modified venting requirements based on anticipated
needs for a specific environment. The smallest dimension of the opening in any mesh used for bird screen is the
governing size for the opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Rectangular roof openings shall conform to Figure 5.17 and Figure 5.18 and/or this section. The effects of
loads (other than normal personnel access) applied at the roof opening and supporting roof structure shall be
considered. Examples of such loads may include fall protection anchorage, hoisting, or personnel retrieval. The roof
structure and plate around the opening shall be reinforced as necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.6.2
The cover plate thickness and/or structural support shall be designed to limit maximum fiber stresses in
accordance with this standard, however, cover plate thickness shall not be less than 5 mm ( 3 / 16  in.). In addition to
other expected design loads, consider a 112 kg (250 lb) person standing in the center of the installed/closed cover.
The designer shall consider wind in the design of hinged openings and how removed covers will be handled without
damage (adequate rigidity).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.6.3
Rectangular openings, other than shown in Figure 5.17 and Figure 5.18, and openings larger than indicated
shall be designed by an engineer experienced in tank design in accordance with this standard. Hinged covers
prescribed in Figure 5.18 may not be used on roofs designed to contain internal pressure. Flanged covers prescribed
in Figure 5.17 may not be used on tanks with internal pressures (acting across the cross sectional area of the tank
roof) that exceed the weight of the roof plates. This section applies only to fixed steel roofs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

At handrail openings, any space wider than 150 mm (6 in.) between the tank and the platform should be floored.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A tank runway that extends from one part of a tank to any part of an adjacent tank, to the ground, or to another structure
shall be supported so that free relative movement of the structures joined by the runway is permitted. This may be
accomplished by firm attachment of the runway to one tank and the use of a slip joint at the point of contact between the
runway and the other tank. (This method permits either tank to settle or be disrupted by an explosion without the other
tank being endangered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Other Appurtenances and Attachments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.11.1
Floating suction lines shall be provided when specified on the Data Sheet, Table 4. Floating suction lines
using rigid articulated (having one or more swing joints) pipe shall be designed to travel in a vertical plane and prevent
damage to the floating roof and the suction line through its design range of travel. These lines shall be designed so
that the vertical plane is as close as possible to, and in no case greater than 10 degrees off, a radial line from the tank
centerline to the nozzle. Adjustments shall be made to clear internal structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.11.2
Inlet diffusers shall be provided when specified by the Purchaser or the floating roof manufacturer.
Traditional diffuser sizing to limit exit velocity to 3 ft/sec provides protection for tank internal components and reduces
static electricity build up due to splashing and misting however does not limit static electricity build up in tanks due to
higher velocity product flow in external inlet and outlet piping. See API 2003. Requirements shall be included in the
Data Sheet (Table 4 or Table 5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.11.3
If required by the Purchaser, grounding lugs shall be provided in the quantity specified on the Data Sheet,
Table 4, and comply with Figure 5.23. The lugs shall be equally spaced around the base of the tank. Provide a
minimum of four lugs. The suggested maximum lug spacing is 30 m (100 ft).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Tanks that rest directly on a foundation of soil, asphalt or concrete are inherently grounded for purposes of dissipation of
electrostatic charges. The addition of grounding rods or similar devices will not reduce the hazard associated with electrostatic
charges in the stored product. API Recommended Practice 2003 contains additional information about tank grounding issues as
well as comments about lightning protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Top and Intermediate Stiffening Rings<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An open-top tank shall be provided with stiffening rings to maintain roundness when the tank is subjected to wind
loads. The stiffening rings shall be located at or near the top of the top course, preferably on the outside of the tank
shell. This design for rings used as wind girders also applies to floating-roof tanks covered in Annex C. The top angle
and the wind girders shall conform, in material and size, to the requirements of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.2
Types of Stiffening Rings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stiffening rings may be made of structural sections, formed plate sections, sections built up by welding, or
combinations of such types of sections assembled by welding. The outer periphery of stiffening rings may be circular
or polygonal (see Figure 5.24).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.3
Restrictions on Stiffening Rings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.3.1
The minimum size of angle for use alone or as a component in a built-up stiffening ring shall be 65  ×  65  ×  6
mm (2 1 / 2   ×  2 1 / 2   ×   1 / 4  in.). The minimum nominal thickness of plate for use in formed or built-up stiffening rings shall be
6 mm (0.236 in.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.3.2
When the stiffening rings are located more than 0.6 m (2 ft) below the top of the shell, the tank shall be
provided with a 65  ×  65  ×  6 mm (2 1 / 2   ×  2 1 / 2   ×   3 / 16  in.) top curb angle for shells 5 mm ( 3 / 16  in.) thick, with a 75  ×  75  ×  6
mm (3  ×  3  ×   1 / 4  in.) angle for shells more than 5 mm ( 3 / 16  in.) thick, or with other members of equivalent section
modulus.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The section modulus of the stiffening ring shall be based on the properties of the applied members and may
include a portion of the tank shell for a distance of 16 t  below and, if applicable, above the shell-ring attachment where
t  is the as-built shell thickness, unless otherwise specified. When curb angles are attached to the top edge of the shell
ring by butt-welding, this distance shall be reduced by the width of the vertical leg of the angle (see Figure 5.24 and

to the opening shall be stiffened with an angle or a bar, the wide side of which is placed in a horizontal plane. The
other sides of the opening shall also be stiffened with an angle or a bar, the wide side of which is placed in a vertical
plane. The cross-sectional area of these rim stiffeners shall be greater than or equal to the cross-sectional area of the
portion of shell included in the section-modulus calculations for the stiffening ring. These rim stiffeners or additional
members shall provide a suitable toe board around the opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The stiffening members shall extend beyond the end of the opening for a distance greater than or equal to the
minimum depth of the regular ring sections. The end stiffening members shall frame into the side stiffening
members, and the end and side stiffening members shall be connected to ensure that their full strength is
developed. Figure 5.25 shows the opening described in this section. Alternative details that provide a load-carrying
capacity equal to that of the girder cross-section away from the opening may be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

This formula is intended to cover tanks with either open tops or closed tops and is based on the following factors (for the

<<PARAGRAPH>>K z
equals the velocity pressure exposure coefficient = 1.04 for exposure  C  at a height of 40 ft;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>K zt
is 1.0 for all structures except those on isolated hills or escarpments;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>K d
is the directionality factor  =  0.95 for round tanks;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V

<<PARAGRAPH>>G
equals the gust factor  =  0.85 for exposure  C .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A 0.24 kPa (5 lbf/ft 2 ) internal vacuum is added for inward drag on open-top tanks or for external pressure on closed top tanks for a

If the height of the transformed shell is greater than the maximum height  H 1 , an intermediate wind girder is
required.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.7.3.1
For equal stability above and below the intermediate wind girder, the girder should be located at the mid-
height of the transformed shell. The location of the girder on the actual shell should be at the same course and same
relative position as the location of the girder on the transformed shell, using the thickness relationship in 5.9.7.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.7.3.2
Other locations for the girder may be used, provided the height of unstiffened shell on the transformed
shell does not exceed  H 1  (see 5.9.7.5).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.7.4
If half the height of the transformed shell exceeds the maximum height  H 1 , a second intermediate girder
shall be used to reduce the height of unstiffened shell to a height less than the maximum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.7.5
Intermediate wind girders shall not be attached to the shell within 150 mm (6 in.) of a horizontal joint of the
shell. When the preliminary location of a girder is within 150 mm (6 in.) of a horizontal joint, the girder shall preferably
be located 150 mm (6 in.) below the joint; however, the maximum unstiffened shell height shall not be exceeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

4, using the allowable stresses given in this section for  S m . The method of attachment shall take into consideration the
effect of deflection and rotation of the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.8
Allowable stresses for anchorage parts shall be in accordance with the ANSI/AISC 360 using allowable
strength design methodology (ASD). A 33 % increase of the allowable stress may be used for wind or seismic loading
conditions. Wind loading need not be considered in combination with seismic loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.9
The maximum allowable local stress in the shell at the anchor attachment shall be in accordance with Table
5.21a and Table 5.21b unless an alternate evaluation is made in accordance with 5.12.7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12.10
When specified by the Purchaser, the anchors shall be designed to allow for thermal expansion of the tank
resulting from a temperature greater than 93 °C (200 °F).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.11
Any anchor bolts shall be uniformly tightened to a snug fit (nuts hand tight in contact with anchor chair top
plate plus maximum of  1 / 8  turn with wrench) and any anchor straps shall be welded while the tank is filled with test
water but before any pressure is applied on top of the water. Measures such as peening the threads, or adding
locking nuts, or tack welding nuts to chairs, shall be taken to prevent the nuts from backing off the threads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.12
The embedment strength of the anchor in the foundation shall be sufficient to develop the specified
minimum yield strength of the anchor. Hooked anchors or end plates may be used to resist pullout. See E.6.2.1.2
restrictions for hooked anchors for Annex E tanks. When mechanical anchorage is required for seismic, the anchor
embedment or attachment to the foundation, the anchor attachment assembly and the attachment to the shell shall
be designed for anchor attachment design load  P A . The anchor attachment design load,  P A , shall be the lesser of the
load equal to the minimum specified yield strength multiplied by the nominal root area of the anchor or three times
seismic design uplift load per anchor,  t b , defined in 5.12.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12.13
The foundation shall provide adequate counterbalancing weight to resist the design uplift loads in
accordance with the following.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.13.1
The counterbalancing weight, such as a concrete ringwall, shall be designed so that the resistance to net
uplift is in accordance with Table 5.21a and Table 5.21b. When considering uplift due to a wind or seismic moment, an
evaluation shall be made to insure overturning stability of the foundation and to insure soil-bearing pressures are
within allowable stress levels as determined using the recommendations of Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12.13.2
When a footing is included in the ringwall design, the effective weight of the soil above the footing may be
included in the counterbalancing weight.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12.14
Anchor strap design provisions include the following.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.14.1
When anchor straps are utilized, the anchorage into the foundation shall be mechanical, and not rely on
bond strength. The ability of the detail selected to yield the anchor strap prior to over-stressing the shell shall be
demonstrated. Anchor strap embedment shall terminate in an anchor plate welded to the bottom of the strap. The
minimum thickness of the anchor plate shall match the thickness of the embedded anchor strap. The minimum width
and length of the anchor plate shall match the embedded anchor strap width. Additionally, shear studs may be added
to the embedded anchor strap to help develop the anchorage design load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.14.2
The design and detailing of the strap shall account for corrosion of the strap near the foundation, while not
providing excessive steel area that reduces the desirable ductile stretching of the strap under overload. One solution is to
contour the strap to produce reduced area over a portion of the strap length. See Figure 5.29 and Figure 5.30. Another
solution is to specify stainless steel for the hold down strap portion cast in the foundation as shown in item 2.1 of Figure
5.29 and Figure 5.30. The cross-sectional area of any strap portion cast in the foundation shall be large enough to
intentionally yield the upper portion of the strap under overload condition, irrespective of strap materials of construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.14.3
Straps may contain a splice weld located above the embedded portion. The splice shall be a double-
welded butt joint or single-welded butt joint with back-up bar in accordance with Figure 5.31. Butt welds with or
without a back-up bar shall be 100 % radiographic examined, and fillet welds attaching the back-up bar shall be
100 % magnetic particle examined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.12.14.4
The details of the anchor strap connection to the tank shell are critical. Attaching the strap with a single
horizontal fillet weld is not recommended. Attaching the strap to a thicker reinforcing plate may be necessary to avoid
over-stressing the shell. One method of detailing a strap is shown is Figure 5.29. Caulking shall be provided at
crevices for carbon steel field attachments inaccessible for welding and those where welding is not part of the
prescribed detail; see top of strap detail in Figure 5.30.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12.14.5
The design slope of the anchor strap from vertical shall not exceed 5 degrees.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1 Workmanship<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.1  All work of fabricating API e.g. 650 tanks shall be done in accordance with this standard and with the
permissible alternatives specified in the Purchaser’s inquiry or order. The workmanship and finish shall be first class
in every respect and subject to the closest inspection by the Manufacturer’s inspector even if the Purchaser has
waived any part of the inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.2  When material requires straightening, the work shall be done by pressing or another noninjurious method
prior to any layout or shaping. Heating or hammering is not permissible unless the material is maintained at forging
temperature during straightening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1.3  Materials used to aid in the fabrication of tanks shall not have a detrimental effect on the structural integrity
of the tank. Lubricants, crayons, adhesives, and anti-weld spatter compounds shall not contain materials that will be
detrimental to the tank, e.g. sulfur and chloride compounds for stainless steel materials. Attachments that will be
welded to the pressure boundary shall not have a zinc or cadmium coating in the weld area within 12 mm (0.5 in.) of
the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2 Finish of Plate Edges<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The edges of plates may be sheared, machined, chipped, or machine gas cut. Shearing shall be limited to plates less
than or equal to 10 mm ( 3 / 8  in.) thick used for butt-welded joints and to plates less than or equal to 16 mm ( 5 / 8  in.)
thick used for lap-welded joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   With the Purchaser’s approval, the shearing limitation on plates used for butt-welded joints may be increased to a
thickness less than or equal to 16 mm ( 5 / 8  in.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When edges of plates are gas cut, the resulting surfaces shall be uniform and smooth and shall be freed from scale
and slag accumulations before welding. After cut or sheared edges are wire brushed, the fine film of rust adhering to
the edges need not be removed before welding. Circumferential edges of roof and bottom plates may be manually
gas cut.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3 Shaping of Shell Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 6.1 provides criteria for shaping of plates to the curvature of the tank prior to installation in the tank. Shaping of
plates concurrently with installation in the tank shell is permitted if the tank diameter exceeds the limit in Figure 6.1 or
if the Manufacturer’s alternate procedure for any diameter has been accepted by the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.4 Marking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All special plates that are cut to shape before shipment as well as roof-supporting structural members shall be
marked as shown on the Manufacturer’s drawings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.5 Shipping<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Plates and tank material shall be loaded in a manner that ensures delivery without damage. Bolts, nuts, nipples, and
other small parts shall be boxed or put in kegs or bags for shipment. All flange faces and other machined surfaces
shall be protected against corrosion and from physical damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1  The Purchaser’s inspector shall be permitted free entry to all parts of the Manufacturer’s plant that are
concerned with the contract whenever any work under the contract is being performed. The Manufacturer shall afford
the Purchaser’s inspector all reasonable facilities to assure the inspector that the material is being furnished in
accordance with this standard. Also, the Manufacturer shall furnish samples or specimens of materials for the
purpose of qualifying welders in accordance with 9.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified, inspection shall be made at the place of manufacture prior to shipment. The Manufacturer
shall give the Purchaser ample notice of when the mill will roll the plates and when fabrication will begin so that the
Purchaser’s inspector may be present when required. The usual mill test of plates shall be deemed sufficient to prove
the quality of the steel furnished (except as noted in 6.2.2). Mill test reports or certificates of compliance, as provided
for in the material specification, shall be furnished to the Purchaser only when the option is specified in the original
contract that they be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2  Mill and shop inspection shall not release the Manufacturer from responsibility for replacing any defective
material and for repairing any defective workmanship that may be discovered in the field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3  Any material or workmanship that in any way fails to meet the requirements of this standard may be rejected
by the Purchaser’s inspector, and the material involved shall not be used under the contract. Material that shows
injurious defects subsequent to its acceptance at the mill, subsequent to its acceptance at the Manufacturer’s works,
or during erection and inspecting of the tank will be rejected. The Manufacturer will be notified of this in writing and will
be required to furnish new material promptly and make the necessary replacements or suitable repairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4.a  The Manufacturer shall visually inspect all edges of shell and roof plates before installing the plates in the
tank or before inserting a nozzle into the plate to determine if laminations are present. If a lamination is visually
detected, the Manufacturer shall ultrasonically examine the area to determine the extent of the laminatio ns  and shall
reject the plate or make repairs in accordance with 6.2.4b.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4.b  For laminations found not exceeding 75 mm (3 in.) in length or 25 mm (1 in.) in depth, repairs may be made
by edge gouging and rewelding to seal the lamination. The Manufacturer shall submit the edge repair procedure for
Purchaser acceptance prior to the start of fabrication. For laminations exceeding these limits, the Manufacturer shall
either reject the plate or repair the plate by entirely removing the lamination. Before making such repairs the
Manufacturer shall document the extent of the lamination and submit a case-specific repair procedure for Purchaser
approval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Except when omitted under the provisions of A.3.4, radiographs shall be taken as specified in 8.1.2 through
8.1.9.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.2.2
The following requirements apply to vertical joints.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For butt-welded joints in which the thinner shell plate is less than or equal to 10 mm ( 3 / 8  in.) thick, one spot
radiograph shall be taken in the first 3 m (10 ft) of completed vertical joint of each type and thickness welded by
each welder or welding operator. The spot radiographs taken in the vertical joints of the lowest course may be
used to meet the requirements of Note 3 in Figure 8.1 for individual joints. Thereafter, without regard to the
number of welders or welding operators, one additional spot radiograph shall be taken in each additional 30 m
(100 ft) (approximately) and any remaining major fraction of vertical joint of the same type and thickness. At least
25 % of the selected spots shall be at junctions of vertical and horizontal joints, with a minimum of two such
intersections per tank. In addition to the foregoing requirements, one random spot radiograph shall be taken in
each vertical joint in the lowest course (see the top panel of Figure 8.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

25 mm (1 in.) in thickness, spot radiographs shall be taken according to Item a. In addition, all junctions of vertical
and horizontal joints in plates in this thickness range shall be radiographed; each film shall clearly show not less
than 75 mm (3 in.) of vertical weld and 50 mm (2 in.) of weld length on each side of the vertical intersection. In the
lowest course, two spot radiographs shall be taken in each vertical joint: one of the radiographs shall be as close
to the bottom as is practicable, and the other shall be taken at random (see the center panel of Figure 8.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Vertical joints in which the shell plates are greater than 25 mm (1 in.) thick shall be fully radiographed. All junctions
of vertical and horizontal joints in this thickness range shall be radiographed; each film shall clearly show not less

One spot radiograph shall be taken in the first 3 m (10 ft) of completed horizontal butt joint of the same type
and thickness (based on the thickness of the thinner plate at the joint) without regard to the number of welders or
welding operators. Thereafter, one radiograph shall be taken in each additional 60 m (200 ft) (approximately) and any
remaining major fraction of horizontal joint of the same type and thickness. These radiographs are in addition to the
radiographs of junctions of vertical joints required by Item c of 8.1.2.2 (see Figure 8.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2.5
It is recognized that in many cases the same welder or welding operator does not weld both sides of a butt
joint. If two welders or welding operators weld opposite sides of a butt joint it is permissible to examine their work with
one spot radiograph. If the radiograph is rejected, additional spot radiographs shall be taken to determine whether
one or both of the welders or welding operators are at fault.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.2.6
An equal number of spot radiographs shall be taken from the work of each welder or welding operator in

When bottom annular plates are required by 5.5.1, or by M.4.1, the radial joints shall be radiographed as
follows: (a) For double-welded butt joints, one spot radiograph shall be taken on 10 % of the radial joints; (b) For
single-welded butt joints with permanent or removable back-up bar, one spot radiograph shall be taken on 50 % of the
radial joints. Extra care must be exercised in the interpretation of radiographs of single-welded joints that have a
permanent back-up bar. In some cases, additional exposures taken at an angle may determine whether questionable
indications are acceptable. The minimum radiographic length of each radial joint shall be 150 mm (6 in.). Locations of
radiographs shall preferably be at the outer edge of the joint where the shell plate and annular plate join.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

weld at either of the adjacent sections fails to comply with the requirements of 8.1.5, additional spots shall be
examined until the limits of unacceptable welding are determined, or the erector may replace all of the welding
performed by the welder or welding operator on that joint. If the welding is replaced, the inspector shall have the
option of requiring that one radiograph be taken at any selected location on any other joint on which the same welder

<<PARAGRAPH>>A.1.1
This Annex provides requirements for field-erected tanks of relatively small capacity in which the stressed
components have a nominal thickness of no more than 13 mm ( 1 / 2  in.). The stressed components include the shell
and reinforcing plates, shell reinforcing plates for flush-type cleanout fittings and flush-type shell connections, and
bottom plates that are welded to the shell. The nominal thickness limit of 13 mm ( 1 / 2  in.) does not apply to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) bottom plates not welded to the shell;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) the bottom reinforcing plate of flush-type cleanouts and flush-type shell connections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) flanges and cover plates of flush-type cleanouts;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) flush-type shell connection necks attached to shell and flanges and cover plates of flush-type shell connections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5) nozzle and manhole necks, their flanges and cover plates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6) anchor bolt chair components and shell compression ring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1.2
This Annex is applicable only when specified by the Purchaser and is limited to design metal temperatures
above –30 °C (–20 °F) [above –40 °C (–40 °F) when killed, fine-grain material is used].<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1.3
This Annex is applicable to any of the Section 4 materials, although the single allowable stress does not
provide any advantage to higher strength steels.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.1.4
This Annex states only the requirements that differ from the basic rules in this standard. When differing
requirements are not stated, the basic rules must be followed; however, the overturning effect of a wind load should
be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.1.5
Typical sizes, capacities, and shell-plate thicknesses are listed in Tables A.1a through A.4b for a design in
accordance with A.4 (joint efficiency = 0.85; design specific gravity = 1.0; and corrosion allowance = 0).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The nominal capacities given in this table were calculated using the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In USC units:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C  = 0.14 D 2 H<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>C
is the capacity of tank, 42-gal barrels;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D
is the diameter of tank, in ft (see A.4.1);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H
is the height of tank, in ft (see A.4.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The capacities and diameters in italics (Columns 4 through 9) are the maximums for the tank heights given in the column heads, based on a
maximum permissible shell-plate thickness of  1 / 2  in., a maximum allowable design stress of 21,000 lbf/in. 2 , a joint efficiency of 0.85, and no
corrosion allowance (see A.4.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Recommendations for Design and Construction of Foundations for
Aboveground Oil Storage Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.1  This Annex provides important considerations for the design and construction of foundations for aboveground
steel oil storage tanks with flat bottoms. Recommendations are offered to outline good practice and to point out some
precautions that should be considered in the design and construction of storage tank foundations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.2  Since there is a wide variety of surface, subsurface, and climatic conditions, it is not practical to establish
design data to cover all situations. The allowable soil loading and the exact type of subsurface construction to be
used must be decided for each individual case after careful consideration. The same rules and precautions shall be
used in selecting foundation sites as would be applicable in designing and constructing foundations for other
structures of comparable magnitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2 Subsurface Investigation and Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.1  At any tank site, the subsurface conditions must be known to estimate the soil bearing capacity and
settlement that will be experienced. This information is generally obtained from soil borings, load tests, sampling,
laboratory testing, and analysis by an experienced geotechnical engineer familiar with the history of similar structures
in the vicinity. The subgrade must be capable of supporting the load of the tank and its contents. The total settlement
must not strain connecting piping or produce gauging inaccuracies, and the settlement should not continue to a point
at which the tank bottom is below the surrounding ground surface. The estimated settlement shall be within the
acceptable tolerances for the tank shell and bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.2  When actual experience with similar tanks and foundations at a particular site is not available, the following
ranges for factors of safety should be considered for use in the foundation design criteria for determining the
allowable soil bearing pressures. (The owner or geotechnical engineer responsible for the project may use factors of
safety outside these ranges.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) From 2.0 to 3.0 against ultimate bearing failure for normal operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) From 1.5 to 2.25 against ultimate bearing failure during hydrostatic testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) From 1.5 to 2.25 against ultimate bearing failure for operating conditions plus the maximum effect of wind or
seismic loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.3  Some of the many conditions that require special engineering consideration are as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) sites on hillsides, where part of a tank may be on undisturbed ground or rock and part may be on fill or another
construction or where the depth of required fill is variable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) sites on swampy or filled ground, where layers of muck or compressible vegetation are at or below the surface or
where unstable or corrosive materials may have been deposited as fill.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) sites underlain by soils, such as layers of plastic clay or organic clays, that may support heavy loads temporarily
but settle excessively over long periods of time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) sites adjacent to water courses or deep excavations, where the lateral stability of the ground is questionable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_230>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B-2
API S TANDARD  650<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) sites immediately adjacent to heavy structures that distribute some of their load to the subsoil under the tank sites,
thereby reducing the subsoil’s capacity to carry additional loads without excessive settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
sites where tanks may be exposed to flood waters, possibly resulting in uplift, displacement, or scour.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) sites in regions of high seismicity that may be susceptible to liquefaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) sites with thin layers of soft clay soils that are directly beneath the tank bottom and that can cause lateral ground
stability problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.4  If the subgrade is inadequate to carry the load of the filled tank without excessive settlement, shallow or
superficial construction under the tank bottom will not improve the support conditions. One or more of the following
general methods should be considered to improve the support conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Removing the objectionable material and replacing it with suitable, compacted material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Compacting the soft material with short piles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Compacting the soft material by preloading the area with an overburden of soil. Strip or sand drains may be used
in conjunction with this method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Stabilizing the soft material by chemical methods or injection of cement grout.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Transferring the load to a more stable material underneath the subgrade by driving piles or constructing
foundation piers. This involves constructing a reinforced concrete slab on the piles to distribute the load of the tank
bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Constructing a slab foundation that will distribute the load over a sufficiently large area of the soft material so that
the load intensity will be within allowable limits and excessive settlement will not occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Improving soil properties by vibro-compaction, vibro-replacement, or deep dynamic-compaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Slow and controlled filling of the tank during hydrostatic testing. When this method is used, the integrity of the tank
may be compromised by excessive settlements of the shell or bottom. For this reason, the settlements of the tank
shall be closely monitored. In the event of settlements beyond established ranges, the test may have to be
stopped and the tank releveled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.5  The fill material used to replace muck or other objectionable material or to build up the grade to a suitable
height shall be adequate for the support of the tank and product after the material has been compacted. The fill
material shall be free of vegetation, organic matter, cinders, and any material that will cause corrosion of the tank
bottom. The grade and type of fill material shall be capable of being compacted with standard industry compaction
techniques to a density sufficient to provide appropriate bearing capacity and acceptable settlements. The placement
of the fill material shall be in accordance with the project specifications prepared by a qualified geotechnical engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3 Tank Grades<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.3.1  The grade or surface on which a tank bottom will rest should be constructed at least 0.3 m (1 ft) above the
surrounding ground surface. This will provide suitable drainage, help keep the tank bottom dry, and compensate for
some small settlement that is likely to occur. If a large settlement is expected, the tank bottom elevation shall be
raised so that the final elevation above grade will be a minimum of 150 mm (6 in.) after settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.3.2  There are several different materials that can be used for the grade or surface on which the tank bottom will
rest. To minimize future corrosion problems and maximize the effect of corrosion prevention systems such as<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_231>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDED  T ANKS   FOR  O IL  S TORAGE
B-3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cathodic protection, the material in contact with the tank bottom should be fine and uniform. Gravel or large particles
shall be avoided. Clean washed sand 75 mm to 100 mm (3 in. to 4 in.) deep is recommended as a final layer because
it can be readily shaped to the bottom contour of the tank to provide maximum contact area and will protect the tank
bottom from coming into contact with large particles and debris. Large foreign objects or point contact by gravel or
rocks could cause corrosion cells that will cause pitting and premature tank bottom failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During construction, the movement of equipment and materials across the grade will mar the graded surface. These
irregularities should be corrected before bottom plates are placed for welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adequate provisions, such as making size gradients in sublayers progressively smaller from bottom to top, should be
made to prevent the fine material from leaching down into the larger material, thus negating the effect of using the fine
material as a final layer. This is particularly important for the top of a crushed rock ringwall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   For more information on tank bottom corrosion and corrosion prevention that relates to the foundation of a tank, see
API 651.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.3.3  Unless otherwise specified by the Purchaser, the finished tank grade shall be crowned from its outer
periphery to its center at a slope of 1 in. in 10 ft. The crown will partly compensate for slight settlement, which is likely
to be greater at the center. It will also facilitate cleaning and the removal of water and sludge through openings in the
shell or from sumps situated near the shell. Because crowning will affect the lengths of roof-supporting columns, it is
essential that the tank Manufacturer be fully informed of this feature sufficiently in advance. (For an alternative to this
paragraph, see B.3.4.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.4  As an alternative to B.3.3, the tank bottom may be sloped toward a sump. The tank Manufacturer must be
advised as required in B.3.3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.4 Typical Foundation Types<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.4.1 Earth Foundations Without a Ringwall<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.4.1.1  When an engineering evaluation of subsurface conditions that is based on experience and/or exploratory
work has shown that the subgrade has adequate bearing capacity and that settlements will be acceptable,
satisfactory foundations may be constructed from earth materials. The performance requirements for earth
foundations are identical to those for more extensive foundations. Specifically, an earth foundation should accomplish
the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) provide a stable plane for the support of the tank;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) limit overall settlement of the tank grade to values compatible with the allowances used in the design of the
connecting piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) provide adequate drainage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) not settle excessively at the perimeter due to the weight of the shell wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.4.1.2  Many satisfactory designs are possible when sound engineering judgment is used in their development.
Three designs are referred to in this Annex on the basis of their satisfactory long-term performance. For smaller
tanks, foundations can consist of compacted crushed stone, screenings, fine gravel, clean sand, or similar material
placed directly on virgin soil. Any unstable material must be removed, and any replacement material must be
thoroughly compacted. Two recommended designs that include ringwalls are illustrated in Figure B.1 and Figure B.2
and described in B.4.2 and B.4.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.4.2 Earth Foundations With a Concrete Ringwall<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.4.2.1  Large tanks and tanks with heavy or tall shells and/or self-supported roofs impose a substantial load on the
foundation under the shell. This is particularly important with regard to shell distortion in floating-roof tanks. When
there is some doubt whether a foundation will be able to carry the shell load directly, a concrete ringwall foundation
should be used. As an alternative to the concrete ringwall noted in this section, a crushed stone ringwall (see B.4.3)
may be used. A foundation with a concrete ringwall has the following advantages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) It provides better distribution of the concentrated load of the shell to produce a more nearly uniform soil loading
under the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) It provides a level, solid starting plane for construction of the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) It retains the fill under the tank bottom and prevents loss of material as a result of erosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) It minimizes moisture under the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A disadvantage of concrete ringwalls is that they may not smoothly conform to differential settlements. This
disadvantage may lead to high bending stresses in the bottom plates adjacent to the ringwall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.4.2.2  When a concrete ringwall is designed, it shall be proportioned so that the allowable soil bearing is not
exceeded. The ringwall shall not be less than 300 mm (12 in.) thick. The centerline diameter of the ringwall should
equal the nominal diameter of the tank; however, the ringwall centerline may vary if required to facilitate the
placement of anchor bolts or to satisfy soil bearing limits for seismic loads or excessive uplift forces. The depth of the
wall will depend on local conditions, but the depth must be sufficient to place the bottom of the ringwall below the
anticipated frost penetration and within the specified bearing strata. As a minimum, the bottom of the ringwall, if
founded on soil, shall be located 0.6 m (2 ft) below the lowest adjacent finish grade. Tank foundations must be
constructed within the tolerances specified in 7.5.5. Recesses shall be provided in the wall for flush-type cleanouts,
drawoff sumps, and any other appurtenances that require recesses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.4.2.3  A ringwall should be reinforced against temperature changes and shrinkage and reinforced to resist the
lateral pressure of the confined fill with its surcharge from product loads. ACI 318 is recommended for design stress
values, material specifications, and rebar development and cover. The following items concerning a ringwall shall be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The ringwall shall be reinforced to resist the direct hoop tension resulting from the lateral earth pressure on the
ringwall’s inside face. Unless substantiated by proper geotechnical analysis, the lateral earth pressure shall be
assumed to be at least 50 % of the vertical pressure due to fluid and soil weight. If a granular backfill is used, a lateral
earth pressure coefficient of 30 % may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The ringwall shall be reinforced to resist the bending moment resulting from the uniform moment load. The
uniform moment load shall account for the eccentricities of the applied shell and pressure loads relative to the
centroid of the resulting soil pressure. The pressure load is due to the fluid pressure on the horizontal projection of
the ringwall inside the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The ringwall shall be reinforced to resist the bending and torsion moments resulting from lateral, wind, or seismic
loads applied eccentrically to it. A rational analysis, which includes the effect of the foundation stiffness, shall be
used to determine these moments and soil pressure distributions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

0.0025 times the vertical cross-sectional area of the ringwall or the minimum reinforcement for walls called for in
ACI 318, Chapter 14.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) For ringwalls, the vertical steel area required for temperature changes and shrinkage is 0.0015 times the
horizontal cross-sectional area of the ringwall or the minimum reinforcement for walls called for in ACI 318,
Chapter 14. Additional vertical steel may be required for uplift or torsional resistance. If the ring foundation is wider

When the ringwall width exceeds 460 mm (18 in.), using a footing beneath the wall should be considered.
Footings may also be useful for resistance to uplift forces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Structural backfill within and adjacent to concrete ringwalls and around items such as vaults, undertank piping,

<<HEADING level=3>>B.4.3 Earth Foundations With a Crushed Stone and Gravel Ringwall<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.4.3.1  A crushed stone or gravel ringwall will provide adequate support for high loads imposed by a shell. A
foundation with a crushed stone or gravel ringwall has the following advantages.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) It provides better distribution of the concentrated load of the shell to produce a more nearly uniform soil loading
under the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) It provides a means of leveling the tank grade, and it is capable of preserving its contour during construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) It retains the fill under the tank bottom and prevents loss of material as a result of erosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) It can more smoothly accommodate differential settlement because of its flexibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A disadvantage of the crushed stone or gravel ringwall is that it is more difficult to construct it to close tolerances and
achieve a flat, level plane for construction of the tank shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.4.3.2  For crushed stone or gravel ringwalls, careful selection of design details is necessary to ensure satisfactory
performance. The type of foundation suggested is shown in Figure B.2. Significant details include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The 0.9 m (3 ft) shoulder and berm shall be protected from erosion by being constructed of crushed stone or

<<HEADING level=3>>B.5 Tank Foundations for Leak Detection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex I provides recommendations on the construction of tank and foundation systems for the detection of leaks
through the bottoms of storage tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.6 Tank Foundations for Elevated Temperature Service<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design and construction of foundations for tanks operating at elevated temperatures [> 93  ° C (200  ° F)] should
address the following considerations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When subjected to elevated operating temperatures, an unanchored tank may tend to move in one or more
directions over time. This movement must be accommodated in the design of the tank fittings and attachments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Elevated temperature service may evaporate moisture in the soil supporting the tank and lead to increased, and
possibly non-uniform, settlement. Such settlement may include differential settlement between the ringwall and
soil under the tank bottom immediately adjacent to the ringwall resulting from non-uniform shrinkage of the soil
with respect to the stone or concrete ringwall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) In cases where there is high groundwater table, elevated temperatures may vaporize groundwater and generate
undesirable steam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Attachments between the tank and the foundation must accommodate the thermal expansion and contraction of
the tank without resulting in unacceptable stress levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) The elevated temperature must be accounted for in the design of concrete ringwall foundations. The ringwall is
subject to a moment due to the higher temperature at the top of the ringwall with respect to the temperature at the
bottom of the ringwall. If not adequately accounted for in the design of the ringwall, this moment can lead to
cracking of the concrete foundation and loss of tank support.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>D.7 Interpretations Responding to Inquiries<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D.7.1  An interpretation is written by the Subcommittee to provide the specific answer to an inquiry. If the inquiry is
properly phrased, the interpretation can be a one-word response. With many inquiries, there may be a need to
provide clarifying statements, such as the limits on the applicability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D.7.2  Although it is not possible to develop interpretations quickly to remedy immediate needs, the industry benefits
as a whole when inquiries are utilized as a means of trying to understand the technical requirements in the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D.7.3  The API inquiry process is intended to help users understand the technical requirements in the standard
without providing the intent, background, and technical basis. The posted interpretations (responses) to inquiries are
based on the standard’s edition/addendum in effect when the interpretation was prepared. Before applying any
interpretation, always look for a later interpretation (if one exists). If there is a conflict between interpretations, use the
latest interpretation. If there is a conflict between an interpretation and the current issue of the standard, use the
current standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>D.9.1  A “Suggestion for Change” is not an inquiry; it is simply a communication (email preferred) from a reader to
API proposing that a specific change be made to the standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.9.2  Any format is acceptable, as long as the content is clear.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.9.3  The most effective means to submit suggestions is to send an email to the API Coordinator
(standards@api.org).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D.9.4  The content of a suggestion must include the standard number, edition, and addendum in question. The
relevant paragraph numbers, table number, figure number, etc must also be stated. Provide as much explanation as
necessary to be sure the Subcommittee understands the technical issues. Provide specific language that you think is
needed to implement the change. Last, include your name, company affiliation if any, and your return email or mailing
address.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D.9.5  API will forward all suggestions that are suitably written to the Subcommittee for consideration. The

<<HEADING level=2>>Seismic Design of Storage Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex provides a number of design options requiring decisions by the Purchaser; standard requirements;
recommendations; and information that supplements the basic standard. This annex becomes a requirement only
when the Purchaser specifies an option covered by this annex or specifies the entire annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Part I—Provisions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex provides minimum requirements for the design of welded steel storage tanks that may be subject to
seismic ground motion. These requirements represent accepted practice for application to welded steel flat-bottom
tanks supported at grade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fundamental performance goal for seismic design in this Annex is the protection of life and prevention of
catastrophic collapse of the tank. Application of this standard does not imply that damage to the tank and related
components will not occur during seismic events.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex is based on the allowable stress design (ASD) methods with the specific load combinations given herein.
Application of load combinations from other design documents or codes is not recommended, and may require the
design methods in this Annex be modified to produce practical, realistic solutions. The methods use an equivalent
lateral force analysis that applies equivalent static lateral forces to a linear mathematical model of the tank based on a
rigid wall, fixed based model.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ground motion requirements in this Annex are derived from ASCE 7, which is based on a maximum considered
earthquake ground motion defined as the motion due to an event with a 2 % probability of exceedance within a 50-
year period (a recurrence interval of approximately 2500 years). Application of these provisions as written is deemed
to meet the intent and requirements of ASCE 7. Accepted techniques for applying these provisions in regions or
jurisdictions where the regulatory requirements differ from ASCE 7 are also included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pseudo-dynamic design procedures contained in this Annex are based on response spectra analysis methods
and consider two response modes of the tank and its contents—impulsive and convective. Dynamic analysis is not
required nor included within the scope of this Annex. The equivalent lateral seismic force and overturning moment
applied to the shell as a result of the response of the masses to lateral ground motion are determined. Provisions are
included to assure stability of the tank shell with respect to overturning and to resist buckling of the tank shell as a
result of longitudinal compression.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design procedures contained in this Annex are based on a 5 % damped response spectra for the impulsive mode
and 0.5 % damped spectra for the convective mode supported at grade with adjustments for site-specific soil
characteristics. Application to tanks supported on a framework elevated above grade is beyond the scope of this
Annex. Seismic design of floating roofs is beyond the scope of this Annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Optional design procedures are included for the consideration of the increased damping and increase in natural
period of vibration due to soil-structure interaction for mechanically-anchored tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks located in regions where  S 1  is less than or equal to 0.04 and  S S  less than or equal to 0.15, or the peak ground
acceleration for the ground motion defined by the regulatory requirements is less than or equal to 0.05 g , need not be
designed for seismic forces; however, in these regions, tanks in SUG III shall comply with the freeboard requirements

V ery dense soil and soft rock with 360 m/s <   v s   ≤  760 m/s (1200 ft/sec <   v s   ≤  2500 ft/sec) or with either  N  > 50 or
s u  > 100 kPa (2000 psf)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D
Stiff soil with 18 0  m/s  ≤   v s   ≤  360 m/s (600 ft/sec  ≤   v s   ≤  1200 ft/sec) or with either 15  ≤   N   ≤  50 or 50 kPa  ≤   s u   ≤  100
kPa (1000 psf  ≤   s u   ≤  2000 psf)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E
A soil profile with  v s  < 180 m/s (600 ft/sec) or with either  N  < 15,  s u  <  50  kPa (1000 psf), or any profile with more
than 3 m (10 ft) of soft clay defined as soil with  PI  > 20,  w   ≥  40%, and   s u  < 25 kPa (500 psf)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F
Soils requiring site-specific evaluations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading such as liquefiable soils, quick and highly
sensitive clays, collapsible weakly cemented soils .  However, since tanks typically have an impulsive period of
0.5 secs or less, site-specific evaluations are not required but recommended to determine spectral accelerations
for liquefiable soils. The Site Class may be determined as noted below, assuming liquefaction does not occur,
and the corresponding values of   F a   and  F v  determined from Table E.1 and Table E.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Peats and/or highly organic clays ( H S  > 3 m [10 ft] of peat and/or highly organic clay, where  H  = thickness of
soil).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Very high plasticity clays ( H S   > 8 m [25 ft] with  PI  > 75).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) Very thick, soft/medium stiff clays ( H S  > 36 m [120 ft])<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The parameters used to define the Site Class are based on the upper 30 m (100 ft) of the site profile. Profiles
containing distinctly different soil layers shall be subdivided into those layers designated by a number that ranges
from 1 to  n  at the bottom where there are a total of  n  distinct layers in the upper 30 m (100 ft). The symbol  i  then refers
to any one of the layers between 1 and  n .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>STEPS FOR CLASSIFYING A SITE:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 1:
Check for the four categories of Site Class F requiring site-specific evaluation. If the site corresponds to any
of these categories, classify the site as Site Class F and conduct a site-specific evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 2:
Check for the existence of a total thickness of soft clay > 3 m (10 ft) where a soft clay layer is defined by:   s u
< 25 kPa (500 psf)  w   ≥  40 %, and  PI  > 20. If these criteria are satisfied, classify the site as Site Class E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Step 3:
Categorize the site using one of the following three methods with  v s ,  N , and  s u  computed in all cases see
Table E.3:<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>a)
v s  for the top 30 m (100 ft)  ( v s  method) .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
N   for the top 30 m (100 ft) ( N  method).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
N  for cohesionless soil layers ( PI  <  20) in the top 30 m (100 ft) and average  s u  for cohesive soil layers
( PI  > 20) in the top 30 m (100 ft)  ( s u  method).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If the   s u  method is used and the  N ch  and  s u  criteria differ, select the category with the softer soils (for example, use Site
Class E instead of D).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assignment of Site Class B shall be based on the shear wave velocity for rock. For competent rock with moderate
fracturing and weathering, estimation of this shear wave velocity shall be permitted. For more highly fractured and
weathered rock, the shear wave velocity shall be directly measured or the site shall be assigned to Site Class C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assignment of Site Class A shall be supported by either shear wave velocity measurements on site or shear wave
velocity measurements on profiles of the same rock type in the same formation with an equal or greater degree of

<<HEADING level=3>>E.4.6.1 Spectral Acceleration Coefficients<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When probabilistic or mapped design methods are utilized, the spectral acceleration parameters for the design
response spectrum are given in Equations E.4.6.1-1 through E.4.6.1-5. Unless otherwise specified by the Purchaser,
T L  shall be taken as the mapped value found in ASCE 7. For tanks falling in SUG I or SUG II, the mapped value of  T L
shall be used to determine convective forces except that a value of  T L  equal to 4 seconds shall be permitted to be
used to determine the sloshing wave height. For tanks falling in SUG III, the mapped value of  T L  shall be used to
determine both convective forces and sloshing wave height except that the importance factor,  I , shall be set equal to
1.0 in the determination of sloshing wave height. In regions outside the USA, where the regulatory requirements for
determining design ground motion differ from the ASCE 7 methods prescribed in this Annex,  T L  shall be taken as 4
seconds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For sites where only the peak ground acceleration is defined, substitute  S P  for  S 0  in Equations E.4.6.1-1 through
E.4.6.2-1. The scaling factor,  Q , is defined as  2 / 3  for the ASCE 7 methods.  Q  may be taken equal to 1.0 unless
otherwise defined in the regulatory requirements where ASCE 7 does not apply. Soil amplification coefficients,  F a  and
F v ; the value of the importance   factor,  I ; and the ASD response modification factors,  R wi   and  R wc , shall be as defined
by the local regulatory requirements. If these values are not defined by the regulations, the values in this Annex shall

<<HEADING level=3>>EC.3 Performance Basis<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.3.1 Seismic Use Group<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks are classified in the appropriate Seismic Use Group based on the function and hazard to the public. Tank
owner/operators may elect to specify a higher SUG as part of their risk management approach for a tank or facility.
Specifying a higher SUG increases the Importance Factor, I, used to define the design acceleration parameters and
indirectly influences the performance level expected of the tank. Selection of the appropriate SUG is by the owner or
specifying engineer who is familiar with the risk management goals, the surrounding environment, the spill
prevention, control and countermeasures plans and other factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SUG I is the default classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.3.1.1  Seismic Use Group III<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks assigned the SUG III designation are those whose function are deemed essential (i.e. critical) in nature for
public safety, or those tanks that store materials that may pose a very serious risk to the public if released and lack
secondary control or protection. For example, tanks serving these types of applications may be assigned SUG III
unless an alternative or redundant source is available:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) fire, rescue, and police stations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) hospitals and emergency treatment facilities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) power generating stations or other utilities required as emergency backup facilities for Seismic Use Group III
facilities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) designated essential communication centers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5) structures containing sufficient quantities of toxic or explosive substances deemed to be hazardous to the public
but lack secondary safeguards to prevent widespread public exposure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6) water production, distribution, or treatment facilities required to maintain water pressure for fire suppression
within the municipal or public domain (not industrial).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is unlikely that petroleum storage tanks in terminals, pipeline storage facilities and other industrial sites would be
classified as SUG III unless there are extenuating circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.3.1.2 Seismic Use Group II<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tanks assigned the SUG II designation are those that should continue to function, after a seismic event, for public
welfare, or those tanks that store materials that may pose a moderate risk to the public if released and lack secondary
containment or other protection. For example, tanks serving the following types of applications may be assigned SUG
II unless an alternative or redundant source is available:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) power generating stations and other public utility facilities not included in Seismic Use Group III and required for
continued operation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) water and wastewater treatment facilities required for primary treatment and disinfection for potable water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.3.1.3  Seismic Use Group I<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SUG I is the most common classification. For example, tanks serving the following types of applications may be
assigned SUG I unless an alternative or redundant source is available:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1) storage tanks in a terminal or industrial area isolated from public access that has secondary spill prevention and
control;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) storage tanks without secondary spill prevention and control systems that are sufficiently removed from areas of
public access such that the hazard is minimal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.4  Site Ground Motion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The definition of the considered ground motion at the site is the first step in defining acceleration parameters and
loads. The philosophy for defining the considered ground motion in the U.S. began changing about 1997. This new
approach, which began with the evolution of the 1997 UBC and advanced through the efforts of the National
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program, was the basic resource for the new model building codes. Subsequent to the
International Building Code  2000, ASCE 7 adopted the methods and is presently the basis for the US model building
codes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, regulations governing seismic design for tank sites outside the U.S. may not follow this ASCE 7 approach.
Therefore, this revision was written to be adaptable to these regulations. Consequently, there is no longer a definition
of the “minimum” design ground motion based on US standards that applies to all sites regardless of the local
regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Historically, this Annex (and the U.S. standards) was based on ground motion associated with an event having a
10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years. This is an event that has a recurrence interval of 475 years. In seismically
active areas where earthquakes are more frequent, such as the west coast of the US, this was a reasonable
approach. In regions where earthquakes are less frequent, engineers and seismologists concluded that the hazard
was under-predicted by the 475 year event. Thus, the maximum considered ground motion definition was revised to a
2 % probability of exceedance in 50 years, or a recurrence interval of about 2500 years. The economic
consequences of designing to this more severe ground motion was impractical so a scaling factor was introduced
based on over-strength inherently present in structures built to today’s standards. See the NEHRP Provisions for a
more extensive discussion of this rationale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The API Seismic Task Group considered setting the 475 year event as the “minimum” for application of this standard.
Given the variations worldwide in defining the ground motion, it was decided that the local regulation should set the
requirements. However, the owner/specifying engineer for the tank should carefully consider the risk in selecting the
appropriate design motion in areas outside the U.S. The API Seismic Task Group suggests that the 475 year event be
the minimum basis for defining the site ground motion for tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.4.1  Mapped ASCE 7 Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ASCE 7 maximum considered earthquake response spectrum is shown in Figure EC.1. Figure EC.2 illustrates
the notations used in developing the response spectrum for the maximum considered ground motion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.4.2  Site-specific Spectral Response Accelerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most situations, a site-specific response spectrum approach is not required. See Figure EC.3. In the rare cases
that a site-specific approach is necessary, the ASCE 7 approach was adopted into the Annex. To utilize this
procedure, both a probabilistic and deterministic response spectrum is developed. The site specific value is then the
lesser  of the two values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The methods and equations in this Annex are best illustrated by a response spectrum curve. When the only definition
of ground motion is the peak ground acceleration, the shape of the response spectrum is approximated to determine
the spectral accelerations parameters. Consequently, the API Seismic Task Group recommended the relationship of
S 1  and  S p  defined in Equation E.4.3-2 as an approximation based on typical response spectrum curves encountered
in design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, if the applicable regulations have a means of determining the spectral response at the appropriate
periods and damping values, those values (i.e. response spectrum) can be used, assuming that the other
requirements of the Annex are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.4.4  Modifications for Site Soil Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ground motions must be amplified when the founding soils are not rock. In previous editions of the Annex, these
adjustments only applied to the constant velocity and acceleration portions of the response. Since the mid-1990s,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_287>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDED  T ANKS   FOR  O IL  S TORAGE
EC-7<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>there have been dual site factors as found in ASCE 7 to define the influence of the soil on the shape and values of the
ground motions. The Annex utilizes this ASCE 7 approach.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Outside the U.S., local regulations may have alternate methods of defining the influence of the soil. Such alternate
methods may be used; however, if no site amplifications are defined in the local regulations, then the ASCE 7 method
of addressing site amplification is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.4.5  Structural Period of Vibration<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.4.5.1  Impulsive Natural Period<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To use the methods in this Annex, the impulsive seismic acceleration parameter is independent of tank system period
unless a site-specific analysis or soil structure interaction evaluation is performed. The impulsive period of the tank is
nearly always less than  T s , placing it on the plateau of the response spectra. Thus, the impulsive acceleration
parameter is based directly on  S DS . For special circumstances, a simplified procedure was included in the Annex to
determine the impulsive period which was taken from the following reference:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A “ Q ” term not included in the ASCE 7 is introduced in this Annex. “ Q ” is the scaling factor from the MCE, which is
equal to  2 / 3  for the ASCE 7 method. When using a recurrence interval of other than 2500 years, or another regulatory
basis, “ Q ” should be set to the appropriate value; for most cases this is 1.0. For example, in a region outside the U.S.
using the 475 year event,  Q  = 1.0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For site-specific analysis, the impulsive spectral acceleration is limited to 1.5 g . This is based on practical experience
and observations of tank behavior. When tanks are lower profile, i.e.,  H/D  < 0.8 and are either self- anchored or have
long anchor bolt projections, the tanks can slide at the high impulsive accelerations. This sliding effectively limits the
amount of force transferred into the tank. This limitation should not apply if the tank is prevented from sliding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EC.5.1.1  Response Modification Factor<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex differentiates the response modification factors for impulsive and convective forces. The force reduction
factor mimics the nonlinear response of the tank. There are three components to the force reduction factor  R : (1)
ductility  R µ , (2) damping  R β , and (3) over-strength  R Ω .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(EC.5.1.1-1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R

=<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ductility reduction is to account for the force reduction associated with a more flexible response. The damping
reduction is to account for the force reduction associated with increased system damping. The over-strength
reduction is to account for the fact that the actual strength is higher than the calculated strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The convective response is generally so flexible (period between 2 and 10 seconds) that any increased flexibility due
to non-linearity has negligible influence on the period and damping of the convective response. It is, therefore, not
justified to apply the ductility and damping reductions to the convective response—however, the over-strength
reduction can still be applied. In the absence of raw data, NEHRP Technical Subcommittee 13—Non-building
Structures proposed a reduction in  R w  for the convective forces. After additional discussion in the ASCE Seismic Task
Group,  R  = 1.5 (or  R WC  of approximately 2.0) was accepted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EC.6 Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.6.1 Design Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Historically, steel tank standards in the US have used the direct sum of the impulsive and convective forces. Other
standards do not. For example, the SRSS method of combining the impulsive and convective components is used the
New Zealand Standard NZS 3106. Here is what C2.2.9.4 (Commentary) of that standard says:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>“ The periods of the inertia (ed. note: impulsive) and convective responses are generally widely separated, the
impulsive period being much shorter than the convective period. When responses are widely separated, near-
simultaneous occurrence of peak values could occur. However, the convective response takes much longer to build
up than the impulsive response, consequently the impulsive component is likely to be subsiding by the time the
convective component reaches its peak. It is thus recommended that the combined impulsive and convective
responses be taken as the square root of the sum of the squares of the separate components. ”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A numerical study was undertaken by the NEHRP Technical Subcommittee 13—Non-building Structures to
investigate the relative accuracy of “direct sum” and SRSS methods for combining the impulsive and convective
responses. In this study: (1) the impulsive period was varied between 0.05 seconds and 1 second, (2) the convective
period was varied between 1 second and 20 seconds; (3) the impulsive and convective masses were assumed equal,
and (4) eight different ground motions from Northridge and Landers earthquake data were used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While, the SRSS modal combination rule does not provide the worst possible loading, it does provide the most likely
loading. It has been shown that this rule is suitable for combining the impulsive and convective (sloshing) responses
in tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_290>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EC-10
API S TANDARD  650<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Furthermore, it should be remembered that different portions of a site response spectrum are not controlled by the
same seismic event. Whereas, the short-period spectral values, which determine the impulsive response, are
controlled by the closer earthquakes, the long-period spectral values, which determine the convective response, are
controlled by distant, larger earthquakes. Therefore, there is already some conservatism inherent in assuming that
the impulsive and convective responses will occur simultaneously.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EC.6.1.3 Vertical Seismic Effects<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The vertical seismic acceleration parameter,  A v  is defined by E.2.2 as  A v  = ( 2 / 3 ) x 0.7 x  S DS  = 0.47  S DS . The  2 / 3  factor
represents the typically applied relation between horizontal and vertical design acceleration. The 0.7 (or more
precisely, 1.0 divided by 1.4) factor is the ASCE 7 adjustment for allowable stress design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASCE 7 sets  A v  = 0.2  S DS . As compared to API, this value does not include the 0.7 allowable stress factor and it does
include a load combination factor of 0.3.  A v  = ( 2 / 3 ) x 0.3 x  S DS  = 0.2  S DS . The load combination factor is not included in
the API definition, because the individual load and stress equations in E.6.2.1, E.6.2.2, and E.6.2.3 include load
combination effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Increasing  A v  to 0.47  S DS  from the previous 0.14  S DS  causes the vertical seismic component of equation E.6.1.4-6 to
become the largest component for determining dynamic hoop stress. This equation incorporates  R w  for the impulsive
and convective forces but not for vertical force. Although applying an  R w  value greater than 1.0 to vertical seismic
applications is not appropriate for any actions that involve buckling, applying the fully amplified elastic response of the
shell hoop tension caused by the breathing response mode is also not correct. Therefore, the vertical component of
the hoop stress equation is conservatively divided by a factor of 2.5. For situations where the  R wi  is less than 2.5, the
adjusting factor should be reduced to  R wi .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.6.1.4 Dynamic Liquid Hoop Forces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Calculations of hydrodynamic hoop forces were not included in previous editions of the Annex since it was not usually
a governing condition for the typical petroleum storage tank. However, with larger diameter tanks, products with
higher specific gravity, and vertical seismic effects, this additional check for hoop stresses was deemed to be
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>See the NEHRP Provisions, Chapter 5 for additional information. This is applicable to mechanically anchored tanks in
this Annex. The complexity and state of technology for soil structure interaction evaluations of uplifting tanks and
tanks with berm foundations was considered as beyond the scope of this Annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.6.2  Resistance To Design Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.6.2.1 Anchorage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Anchorage for overturning loads may be accomplished by the inherent tank configuration and product weight (self-
anchored) or by adding mechanical devices (mechanically-anchored) such as anchor bolts or straps. If a tank
satisfies the requirements for self anchorage, it should not be anchored.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The methods and load combinations used to design tank anchorage have proven to be satisfactory. Alternative
methods for predicting annular plate behavior and anchor bolt loads have been proposed by various researchers. The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API S TANDARD  650<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API Seismic task Group believes that while some of these methods may more accurately depict the actual behavior of
the tank, the added complexity does not significantly alter the anchorage design for the tanks usually constructed to
API standards. Consequently, the simplified, but proven, method is retained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EC.6.2.3 Foundation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Using the calculated maximum toe pressure in the tank shell to satisfy equilibrium on self anchored flatbottom tanks
produces impractical ringwall dimensions. Some yielding of soil (settlement) may occur under the shell requiring re-
leveling of the tank after a seismic event. The foundations under flatbottom tanks, even tanks resting directly on earth
foundations, have fared well under seismic loadings. Therefore, the seismic loading does not alter the foundation
design criteria or provide justification for increased foundations for ringbearing plates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A requirement for a mechanically-anchored tank stability check was added. This check assumes that the tank,
product and foundation behave as a rigid body and is over-turning about the toe (i.e., base of the tank). This is not the
actual behavior of the tank system but is a convenient model to use for checking the gross stability of the foundation.
See Figure EC.10. The required factor of safety is 2.0 for this model.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EC.7.2 Freeboard<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Freeboard is provided to reduce potential operational damage to the upper shell and roof by the impingement of the
sloshing wave. In some circumstances, this damage may include tearing of the roof to shell connection and release a
small amount of product. However, in almost all cases, this damage is not a structural collapse mechanism but rather
an issue of operational risk and repair cost. Designing the typical API style roof and shell to resist the sloshing wave is
impractical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the rare situation that the these provisions are applied to a tank that is completely filled and no sloshing space is
provided above the maximum operating level, the entire contents of the tank should be considered an impulsive
mass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>EC.7.3  Piping Flexibility<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lack of sufficient piping flexibility has been one of the leading causes of product loss observed after an earthquake.
Piping designers may not recognize the movements that the tank and foundation may experience and may not
provide sufficient flexibility in the piping system and supports. This overstresses the pipe and tank shell, usually
causing a piping break.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping designers should not assume that the tank is an anchor point to resist piping loads without carefully evaluating
the mechanical loads on the tank, including the compatibility of displacement. While the tank shell is relatively stiff in
reacting to loads applied in the vertical direction, in most cases it is not stiff relative to the piping for radial or rotational
loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A table of design displacements is included in the Annex. See Table E.8. These values are a compromise of practical
design considerations, economics and the probability that the piping connection will be at the point of maximum uplift. If
one “estimated” the tank uplift using the simplified model in the Annex, the uplift will often exceed the values in Table E.8
unless the tank is in lower ground motion regions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mechanically anchoring the tank to reduce piping flexibility demands should be a “last resort.” The cost of anchoring a
tank that otherwise need not be anchored will often be larger than altering the piping configuration. The cost of the
anchors, the foundation, and the attachment details to the shell must be weighed against piping flexibility devices or
configuration changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some tank designers incorporate under-bottom connections attached to the bottom out of the uplift zone. This is
potentially problematic in areas where high lateral impulsive ground motion may cause the tank to slide. The tank
sliding may cause a bottom failure. Properly detailed connections though the cylindrical shell are preferred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Buckling of the roof rafters perpendicular to the primary direction of the lateral ground motion has been observed after

API S TANDARD  650<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>liquid. Presently, this buckling behavior is believed to be the result of the tendency of the flexible tank wall to oval,
creating a compressive force perpendicular to the direction of the ground motion. Allowing these rafter to slip, or
including an “accidental” compression load in the design of the rafter is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>F.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F.1.1  The maximum internal pressure for closed-top API Standard 650 tanks may be increased to the maximum
internal pressure permitted (18 kPa [2.5 lbf/in. 2 ]) gauge when the additional requirements of this Annex are met. This
Annex applies to the storage of nonrefrigerated liquids (see also API 620, Annex Q and Annex R). For maximum
design temperatures above 93 °C (200 °F), see Annex M.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F.1.2  When the internal pressure multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the nominal tank diameter does not
exceed the combined nominal weight of the shell, roof plate, any structural members attached to the roof plate, and
any framing supported by the shell, the design requirements in F.2 through F.7 shall be met. Overturning stability with
respect to seismic conditions shall be determined independently of internal pressure uplift. Seismic design shall meet
the requirements of Annex E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F.1.3  Internal pressures that exceed the combined nominal weight of the shell, roof plate, any structural members
attached to the roof plate, and any framing supported by the shell shall also meet requirements of F.8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.1.4  Tanks designed according to this Annex shall comply with all the applicable rules of this standard unless the
rules are superseded by the requirements of F.8.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.1.5  The tank nameplate (see Figure 10.1) shall indicate whether the tank has been designed in accordance with
F.1.2 or F.1.3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.1.6  Figure F.1 is provided to aid in the determination of the applicability of various sections of this Annex.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.2 Design Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F.2.1  In calculating shell thickness for Annex F tanks and when selecting shell manhole thicknesses in Table 5.3a
and Table 5 3b and flush-type cleanout fitting thicknesses in Table 5.10a and Table 5.10b,  H   shall be increased by the
quantity  P /(9.8 G )  for SI units, or  P /(12 G )  for USC units—where  H   is the design liquid height, in m (ft),  P   is the design
pressure kPa (in. of water), and  G   is the design specific gravity. Design pressures less than 1 kPa (4 in. of water) do
not need to be included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F.2.2  The required compression area at the roof-to-shell junction shall be calculated as in F.5.1, and the participating
compression area at the junction shall be determined by Figure F.2. Full penetration butt welds shall be used to
connect sections of the compression ring. For self-supporting roofs, the compression area shall not be less than the
cross-sectional area calculated in 5.10.5 or 5.10.6 as applicable. Materials for compression areas may be selected
from API 650, Section 4, and need not meet toughness criteria of 4.2.9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.2.3  Roof plate, manway and nozzle materials shall conform to the specifications in this standard. Materials
selected from API-650, Section 4 need not meet toughness criteria of 4.2.9.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F.2.4  For design pressures greater than 2 kPa (8 in. of water), roof manways and roof nozzles shall meet the
requirements of API 650, 5.7.1 through 5.7.6, for shell manways and nozzles. When using values from API 650 Table
5.3, the lowest values for the maximum design liquid level (H) may be used. When using equations from API 650
5.7.5.6, maximum design liquid level ( H ) shall be a minimum of 5 m (18 ft). Alternatively, roof manways and nozzles
may be designed per API 620 using all the rules for API 620 roof manways and nozzles, including the 250 °F
maximum design temperature limitation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.1.1 Purpose<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex establishes minimum criteria for the design, fabrication, and erection of structurally-supported aluminum
dome roofs. When this Annex is applicable, the requirements of 5.10 and the paragraphs in Annex F that deal with
roof design are superseded. All other requirements of API Standard 650 shall apply, except that the maximum design
temperature shall not exceed 90 °C (200 °F).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.1.2 Definition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A structurally-supported aluminum dome roof is a fully triangulated aluminum space truss with the struts joined at
points arrayed on the surface of a sphere. Aluminum closure panels are firmly attached to the frame members. The
roof is attached to and supported by the tank at mounting points equally spaced around the perimeter of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.1.3 General Application<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.1.3.1 New Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When this Annex is specified for a new tank, the tank shall be designed to support the aluminum dome roof. The roof
Manufacturer shall supply the magnitude and direction of all the forces acting on the tank as a result of the roof loads,
together with details of the roof-to-shell attachment. The tank shall be designed as an open-top tank, and its wind
girder shall meet the requirements of 5.9. The top of the tank shell shall be structurally suitable for attachment of the
dome roof structure. The tank Manufacturer and the foundation designer shall be responsible for designing the tank
and foundation, respectively, for the loads and moments transmitted from the roof, as provided by the roof
manufacturer. If the Purchaser specifies a roof with fixed supports, the supports shall be rigidly attached directly to the
tank and the top of the tank shall be designed to sustain the horizontal thrust transferred from the roof (see G.5.2).
The as-built minimum and maximum diameter at the top of the tank shall be reported to the roof manufacturer by the
Purchaser or the tank Manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.1.3.2 Existing Tanks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When this Annex is specified for an aluminum dome roof to be added to an existing tank (with or without an existing
roof), the roof Manufacturer shall verify that the tank has sufficient strength to support a new roof and meet the
applicable requirements of Section 5.11. Information on the existing tank shall be provided by the Purchaser including
minimum tank shell course thicknesses, tank shell course heights, design corrosion allowance, and existing
anchorage details. The Purchaser shall specify the existing or new appurtenances to be accommodated by the roof
Manufacturer. The roof Manufacturer shall supply the values of the forces acting on the tank as a result of the roof
loads. The Purchaser shall verify the adequacy of the foundations. Unless otherwise specified, any reinforcement
required to enable the tank to support the roof shall be the responsibility of the Purchaser. The design and erection of
the roof shall accommodate the actual tank shape. The responsibility for determining the tank shape shall be
specified by the Purchaser. The existing tank shall be equipped with a wind girder that meets the requirements of 5.9
for an open-top tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H.1.1  This Annex provides minimum requirements that apply to a tank with an internal floating roof and a fixed
roof at the top of the tank shell, and to the tank appurtenances. This Annex is intended to limit only those factors
that affect the safety and durability of the installation and that are considered to be consistent with the quality
and safety requirements of this standard. Types of internal floating roofs (listed under H.2) and materials (listed
under H.3) are provided as a basic guide and shall not be considered to restrict the Purchaser option of
employing other commonly accepted or alternative designs, as long as all design loading is documented to meet
the minimum requirements herein, and all other criteria are met (except alternative materials and thicknesses as
permitted by H.3.1). The requirements apply to the internal floating roof of a new tank and may be applied to an
existing fixed-roof tank. Section 5.10 of this standard is applicable, except as modified in this Annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.1.2  The Purchaser is required to provide all applicable jurisdictional requirements that apply to internal floating roofs
(see 1.3).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.1.3  See Annex W for bid requirements pertaining to internal floating roofs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.2 Types of Internal Floating Roofs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H.2.1  The internal floating roof type shall be selected by the Purchaser after consideration of both proposed and
future product service, operating conditions, maintenance requirements, regulatory compliance, service life
expectancy, ambient temperature, maximum design temperature, product vapor pressure, corrosion conditions and
other compatibility factors. Other operating conditions requiring consideration include (but are not limited to)
anticipated pumping rates, roof landing cycles, and the potential for turbulence resulting from upsets, such as vapor
slugs injected into the tank. Safety and risk factors associated with the roof types shall also be evaluated. 26  The type
of roof, which shall be designated by the Purchaser on the Data Sheet, Line 30, shall be one of the types described in
H.2.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.2.2  The following types of internal floating roofs are described in this Annex.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Metallic pan internal floating roofs  27,28,29  have a peripheral rim above the liquid for buoyancy. These roofs are in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>full contact with the liquid surface and are typically constructed of steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Metallic open-top bulk-headed internal floating roofs  26,27  have peripheral open-top bulk-headed compartments
for buoyancy. Distributed open-top bulk-headed compartments shall be used as required. These roofs are in full
contact with the liquid surface and are typically constructed of steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>26  Internal floating roof tanks generally have reduced fire risk, and the use of fixed fire suppression systems is often not mandatory.
Various internal floating roof materials will have unique flammability characteristics, melting points and weights (perhaps with
reduced buoyancy being required). If fire suppression systems are used, certain roof types need to be evaluated for full surface
protection. NFPA 11  Standard for Low-Expansion Foam  can provide guidance for this evaluation.
27  The Purchaser is cautioned that this design does not have multiple   flotation compartments necessary to meet the requirements
of H.4.2.1.3.
28  These designs contain no closed buoyancy compartments, and are subject to flooding during sloshing or during application of
fire-fighting foam/water solution.   Also, without bracing of the rim being provided by the pontoon top plate, design to resist
buckling of the rim must be evaluated.
29  If the floating roof is a) a metallic pan roof with or without bulkheads, or b) a non-metallic roof with or without closed buoyancy
compartments, then the tank is considered a fixed-roof tank (i.e., having no internal floating roof) for the requirements of NFPA
30. See NFPA 30 for spacing restrictions on floating roof tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Distributed closed-top bulk-headed compartments shall be used as required. These roofs are in full contact with
the liquid surface and are typically constructed of steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Metallic double-deck internal floating roofs have continuous closed top and bottom deck s,  which contain bulk-
headed compartments for buoyancy. These roofs are in full contact with the liquid surface and are typically
constructed of steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Metallic internal floating roofs on floats have their deck above the liquid, supported by closed pontoon
compartments for buoyancy. These roof decks are not in full contact with the liquid surface and are typically
constructed of aluminum alloys or stainless steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Metallic sandwich-panel/composite internal floating roofs have metallic or composite material panel modules for
buoyancy compartments. Panel modules may include a honeycomb or closed cell foam core; however, cell walls
within the panel module are not considered “compartments” for purposes of inspection and design buoyancy
requirements (see H.4.1.7 and H.4.2.1). 30  These roofs are in full contact with the liquid surface and are typically
constructed of aluminum alloys or Purchaser approved composite materials. 27<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Hybrid internal floating roofs shall, upon agreement between the Purchaser and the Manufacturer, be a design<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>combination of roof types described in H.2.2.b and H.2.2.c, having bulkhead compartments with closed-top
perimeter pontoon and open-top center compartments for buoyancy. These roofs are in full contact with the liquid

<<HEADING level=3>>I.1 Scope and Background<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.1.1  This Annex provides acceptable construction details for the detection of product leaks through the bottoms of
aboveground storage tanks, and provides guidelines for tanks supported by grillage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   API supports a general position of installation of a Release Prevention Barrier (RPB) under new tanks during initial
construction. An RPB includes steel bottoms, synthetic materials, clay liners, and all other barriers or combination of barriers
placed in the bottom of or under an aboveground storage tank, which have the following functions: (a) preventing the escape of
contaminated material, and (b) containing or channeling released material for leak detection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.1.2  Several acceptable construction details are provided for detection of leaks through the tank bottom and details
for tanks supported by grillage (see Figures I.1 through I.11). Alternative details or methods may be used if agreed

<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.1.3  The tank owner shall determine whether the undertank area is to be constructed for leak detection. If leak
detection is required, the owner shall specify the method or methods to be employed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.1.4  The bottoms of aboveground storage tanks may leak as a result of product side corrosion, soil side corrosion,
or a combination of both. The extent of product side corrosion can be detected using standard inspection techniques
during an internal inspection, but determining the nature and extent of soil side corrosion is more difficult. Therefore,
in certain services and tank locations, it may be desirable to provide for undertank monitoring of leakage through the
tank bottom plates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.1.5  For additional information on the use of internal linings to prevent internal bottom corrosion, see API 652.
Similarly, see API 651 for guidelines and requirements relating to preventing corrosion from the soil side of the bottom
plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.1.6  When the appropriate tank foundation design is being selected, it is important to consider the environmental
and safety regulatory implications of leakage of tank contents into the containment space below the tank bottom.
Specifically, the contamination of permeable material such as sand used as a floor support may constitute the
generation of a hazardous waste. The treatment or disposal costs of such contaminated material must be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.1.7  The requirements for secondary containment as it relates to diked areas and impoundments are not within the

<<PARAGRAPH>>I.4.1  If a double steel bottom is used, the details of construction shall provide for the proper support of the primary
bottom and shell for all operating conditions. The design shall be evaluated to verify that the primary bottom and shell
are not overstressed. The evaluation shall consider all anticipated operating conditions such as design metal
temperature, maximum design temperature, fill height, hydrostatic testing, seismic conditions, and tank settlement.
The evaluation is not required if the primary bottom is uniformly supported on both sides of the shell and is not
structurally attached to the secondary bottom or primary bottom support.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.4.2  For double steel bottom systems that use steel members (such as grating, structural shapes, or wire mesh) to
separate the bottoms, ingress of water between the bottoms will result in local accelerated corrosion rates. If the
perimeter of the bottoms is not sealed, corrosion protection of the tank bottoms shall be provided. See Figure I.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>J.3.6.1  Manholes, nozzles, and other connections in the shell shall be constructed and attached as specified in 5.7,
but it is unlikely that reinforcing plates will be required for manholes and nozzles in the tank shell. The need for
reinforcement shall be checked according to the procedure given in 5.7.2. Since the nominal shell-plate thicknesses
required by J.3.3 will normally exceed the calculated thickness, the excess material in the shell should satisfy the
reinforcement requirements in nearly all cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>J.3.6.2  The requirements of 5.7.3 for the spacing of welds do not apply except for the requirement that the spacing
between the toes of welds around a connection shall not be less than 2.5 times the shell thickness at the connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>J.3.6.3  The roofs of tanks constructed in accordance with this Annex will be inherently strong because of the
limitations in diameter required for shipping clearances. Thus, reinforcement of roof manholes and nozzles is not
required unless specifically requested by the Purchaser or unless roof loads exceed 1.2 kPa (25 lbf/ft 2 ), in which case
the amount and type of reinforcement shall be agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>J.3.6.4  For shell manholes and nozzles the radiographic requirements of 5.7.3.4 do not apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>J.3.6.5  For flush-type cleanout fittings, the provisions for stress relief specified in 5.7.4 and 5.7.7.3 are not required
unless any plate in the assembly has a thickness greater than 16 mm ( 5 / 8  in.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>J.3.6.6  For flush-type shell connections, the provisions for stress relief specified in 5.7.4 and 5.7.8.3 are not
required unless any plate in the assembly has a thickness greater than 16 mm ( 5 / 8  in.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

allowance is to be added shall be specified. If a corrosion allowance is specified without an indication of the area to
which it is to be added, the Manufacturer shall assume that it is to be added only to the calculated shell-plate
thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Thermal Effects<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex does not provide detailed rules for limiting loadings and strains resulting from thermal effects, such as
differential thermal expansion and thermal cycling, that may exist in some tanks operating at elevated temperatures.
Where significant thermal effects will be present, it is the intent of this Annex that the Purchaser define such effects.
The Manufacturer shall propose, subject to the Purchaser’s acceptance, details that will provide strength and utility
equivalent to those provided by the details specified by this standard in the absence of such effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API S TANDARD  650<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For a maximum design temperature above 93 °C (200 °F), particular consideration should be given to the following
thermal effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Temperature differences between the tank bottom and the lower portion of the shell. Such thermal differences may
result from factors such as the method and sequence of filling and heating or cooling, the degree of internal
circulation, and heat losses to the foundation and from the shell to the atmosphere. With such temperature
differences, it may be necessary to provide for increased piping flexibility, an improved bottom-to-shell joint, and a
thicker annular ring or bottom sketch plates to compensate for increased rotation of the bottom-to-shell joint (see
M.4.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The ability of the bottom to expand thermally, which may be limited by the method of filling and heating. With such
a condition, it may be necessary to provide improved bottom welding in addition to the details suggested in Item a.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Temperature differences or gradients between members, such as the shell and the roof or stairways, the shell and
stiffeners, the roof or shell and the roof supports, and locations with insulation discontinuities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Whether or not the contents are allowed to solidify and are later reheated to a liquid, including the effect on
columns, beams, and rafters. The possible build-up of solids on these components and the potential for plugging
of the vent system should also be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) The number and magnitude of temperature cycles the tank is expected to undergo during its design life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.3
Modifications in Stress and Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.3.1
For a maximum design temperature not exceeding 93 °C (200 °F), the allowable stress specified in 5.6.2 (see
Table 5.2a and Table 5.2b) for calculating shell thickness need not be modified.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>M.3.2
For a maximum design temperature exceeding 93 °C (200 °F), the allowable stress specified in 5.6.2 shall be
modified as follows: The allowable stress shall be two-thirds the minimum specified yield strength of the material
multiplied by the applicable reduction factor given in Table M.1a and Table M.1b or the value given in Table 5.2a and
Table 5.2b for product design stress, whichever is less.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.3.3
For operating temperatures exceeding 93  ° C (200  ° F), the yield strength  F y  in 5.10.4.4 shall be multiplied by
the applicable reduction factor given in Table M.1a and Table M.1b.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.3.4
The allowable stress of 145 MPa (21,000 lbf/in 2 ) in the equation for shell-plate thickness in A.4.1 shall be
multiplied by the applicable reduction factor given in Table M.1a and Table M.1b.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>M.3.5
The requirements of 5.7.5 for shell manholes, 5.7.7 for flush-type cleanout fittings and of 5.7.8 for flush-type
shell connections shall be modified. The thickness of bottom reinforcing plate for flush-type shell cleanouts and flush-
type shell connections and bolting flange and cover plates for shell manhole and flush-type shell cleanouts shall be
multiplied by the ratio of 205 MPa (30,000 lbf/in. 2 ) to the material yield strength at the maximum design temperature if
the ratio is greater than one.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>M.3.6
The structural allowable stresses specified in 5.10.3 shall be calculated using Yield Strength ( F y ) and Modulus
of Elasticity ( E ) at the maximum design temperature. Refer to Table M.1a and Table M.1b for corrections to be applied
t o Yield Strength ( F y ) and Table M.2a and Table M.2b for values of Modulus of Elasticity ( E ) at maximum design

The following simplified procedure is offered as a recommended design practice for elevated-temperature
tanks where significant temperature differences between the tank bottom and the lowest shell course are expected.
The use of the procedure is not intended to be mandatory. It is recognized that other analytical procedures can be
employed as well as that operating conditions may preclude the need for such a procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shell-to-bottom junctions in elevated-temperature tanks may be evaluated for liquid head and temperature cycles with
the formulas, procedures, and exclusions given below. (See Conditions a and b in the note below, which exclude
tanks from such analyses.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
A cyclic design life evaluation need not be made if all the criteria of either of the following conditions are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The design temperature difference ( T ) is less than or equal to 220 °C (400 °F),  K  is less than or equal to 2.0, and
C  is less than or equal to 0.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A heated liquid head, in feet, greater than or equal to 0.3( Dt ) 0.5  is normally maintained in the tank, except for an
occasional cool-down (about once a year) to ambient temperatures;  T  is less than or equal to 260 °C (500 °F); and
K  is less than or equal to 4.0. (For background information on the development of the stress formulas, design life
criteria, and C and B factors, see G.G. Karcher, “Stresses at the Shell-to-Bottom Junction of Elevated-Temperature
Tanks.”)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Use of New Materials That Are Not Identified<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>New or unused plates and seamless or welded pipe that are not completely identified as complying with any listed
specification may be used in the construction of tanks covered by this standard, under the conditions specified in N.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N.2 Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N.2.1  A material may be used if an authentic test record for each heat or heat-treating lot of material is available that
proves that the material has chemical requirements and mechanical properties within the permissible range of a
specification listed in this standard. If the test requirements of the listed specification are more restrictive than any
specification or authentic tests that have been reported for the material, more restrictive tests shall be performed in
accordance with the requirements of the listed specification, and the results shall be submitted to the Purchaser for
approval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N.2.2  If an authentic test record is not available or if all the material cannot be positively identified with the test
record by legible stamping or marking, the following requirements apply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Each plate shall be subjected to the chemical analysis and physical tests required by the designated specification,
with the following modifications: The carbon and manganese contents shall be determined in all check analyses.
When the designated specification does not specify carbon and manganese limits, the Purchaser shall decide
whether these contents are acceptable. When the direction of rolling is not definitely known, two tension
specimens shall be taken at right angles to each other from a corner of each plate, and one tension specimen
shall meet the specification requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Each length of pipe shall be subjected to a chemical check analysis and sufficient physical tests to satisfy the
Purchaser that all of the material is properly identified with a given heat or heat-treatment lot and that the chemical
and physical requirements of the designated specification are met. Material specified as suitable for welding, cold
bending, close coiling, and the like shall be given sufficient check tests to satisfy the Purchaser that each length of
material is suitable for the fabrication procedure to be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N.2.3  Charpy V-notch impact tests must be performed when required by Figure 4.1 to verify that the material
possesses the toughness required by Table 4.4a and Table 4.4b.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N.2.4  After a material is properly identified with a designated specification and the Purchaser is satisfied that the
material complies with the specification in all respects, the testing agency shall stencil or otherwise mark, as permitted
by the specification, a serial  S  number on each plate or each length of pipe (or as alternatively provided for small
sizes in the specification) in the presence of the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N.2.5  Suitable report forms clearly marked “Report on Tests of Nonidentified Materials” shall be furnished by the
tank Manufacturer or testing agency. The forms shall be properly filled out, certified by the testing agency, and
approved by the Purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>N.2.6  The Purchaser shall have the right to accept or reject the testing agency or the test results.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>N.2.7  The requirements for fabrication applicable to the designated specification to which the nonidentified material
corresponds shall be followed, and the allowable design stress values shall be those specified in this standard for the
corresponding specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(normative)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>Under-Bottom Connections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex provides a number of design options requiring decisions by the Purchaser; standard requirements;
recommendations; and information that supplements the basic standard.  This annex becomes a requirement only
when the Purchaser specifies an option covered by this annex or specifies the entire annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>O.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex contains recommendations to be used for the design and construction of under-bottom connections for
storage tanks. The recommendations are offered to outline good practice and to point out certain precautions that are
to be observed. Reference should be made to Annex B for considerations involving foundation and subgrade.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>O.2 Recommendations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.2.1  The recommendations of this Annex are intended for use only where significant foundation settlement is not
expected. It is not possible to establish precise limits, but if predicted settlement exceeds 13 mm ( 1 / 2  in.), the
recommendations should be subjected to detailed engineering review for possible additions, modifications, or
elimination of bottom connections. Particular consideration shall be given to possible differential settlement in the
immediate area of the bottom connection and with respect to connecting piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.2.2  The arrangement and details of bottom connections may be varied to achieve the utility, tightness, and
strength required for the prevailing foundation conditions. The details shown in Figure O.1, Figure O.2, and Figure
O.3 are examples. Figure O.1 and Figure O.2 show details used on a concrete ringwall foundation, but similar
designs may be used on earth foundations. Figure O.3 shows another detail used on earth foundations. Other
arrangements of foundation and connection (including combination sump and pipe) may be used under the
provisions of O.2.6. When required by the Purchaser, seismic considerations (see Annex E) shall be included.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.2.3  Support of the pipe by the soil and bottom connection shall be evaluated to confirm adequacy and resistance
to liquid, static, and dynamic loads. Both deflection and stress shall be considered in the evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>O.2.4  Consideration shall be given to predicted settlement that would affect the relative positions of the tank and
pipe or pipe supports outside the tank (see O.2.1).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>O.2.5  Bottom connections used in floating-roof tanks shall be provided with a baffle to prevent impingement of the
inlet product stream directly against the floating roof.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>O.2.6  All details are subject to agreement between the Purchaser and the Manufacturer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>O.3 Guideline Examples<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>O.3.1 Concrete Vault and Ringwall (See Figure O.1 and Figure O.2)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.3.1.1  The concrete ceiling vault shown in Figure O.2 provides improved support of the tank bottom and shell and
provides more uniform reinforcing-bar distribution around the ringwall opening than the details shown in Figure O.1
provide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.3.1.2  Particular attention is required for the backfill specifications and placement of the backfill around the vault
area and around the inside of the entire ringwall. Compaction shall be adequate to prevent significant localized
settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.3.1.3  Consideration should be given to the soil characteristics at the different elevations at the bottom of the
ringwall and the vault, especially for the deeper vaults to accommodate the larger connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API S TANDARD  650<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O.3.1.4  Recommended details and dimensions are shown in Figure O.1 and Figure O.2, and Table O.1a and Table
O.1b. Dimension  K  is considered adequate to place the connection out of the influence of shell-to-bottom rotation
when the tank is statically loaded. Seismic loading shall be analyzed for additional considerations. The method shall
be a matter of agreement between the Manufacturer and the Purchaser. When the tank bottom has annular plates
(thicker than the tank bottom), it is recommended either to provide at least 300 mm (12 in.) between the edge of the
pipe connection or reinforcing plate and the inner edge of the annular plate or to locally extend the annular plate,
thickened if necessary, to encompass the bottom connection. The dimensions in Tables O.1a and O.1b may be
changed to achieve desired clearances for installations, inspections, and the like.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Allowable External Loads on Tank Shell Openings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex provides a number of design options requiring decisions by the Purchaser; standard requirements;
recommendations; and information that supplements the basic standard.  This annex becomes a requirement only
when the Purchaser specifies an option covered by this annex or specifies the entire annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex shall be used (unless specified otherwise by the Purchaser on Line 29 of the Data Sheet) for tanks larger
than 36 m (120 ft) in diameter, and only when specified by the Purchaser for tanks 36 m (120 ft) in diameter and
smaller. See W.2(5) for additional requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex presents two different procedures to determine external loads on tank shells. Section P.2 establishes limit
loads and P.3 is based on allowable stresses. This Annex is based on H. D. Billimoria and J. Hagstrom’s “Stiffness
Coefficients and Allowable Loads for Nozzles in Flat Bottom Storage Tanks” and H. D. Billimoria and K. K. Tam’s
“Experimental Investigation of Stiffness Coefficients and Allowable Loads for a Nozzle in a Flat Bottom Storage Tank.”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.2 Limit Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.2.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Annex establishes requirements for the design of storage-tank openings that conform to Table 5.6a and
Table 5.6b and will be subjected to external piping loads. The requirements of this Annex represent accepted
practice for the design of shell openings in the lower half of the bottom shell course that have a minimum
elevation from the tank bottom and meet the requirements of Table 5.6a and Table 5.6b. It is recognized that the
Purchaser may specify other procedures, special factors, and additional requirements. Any deviation from these
requirements shall be mutually agreed upon by the Purchaser and the Manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.2.2 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design of an external piping system that will be connected to a thin-walled, large-diameter cylindrical vertical
storage tank may pose a problem in the analysis of the interface between the piping system and the tank opening
connections. The piping designer must consider the stiffness of the tank shell and the radial deflection and meridional
rotation of the shell opening at the opening-shell connection resulting from product head, pressure, and uniform or
differential temperature between the shell and the bottom. The work of the piping designer and the tank designer
must be coordinated to ensure that the piping loads imposed on the shell opening by the connected piping are within
safe limits. Although three primary forces and three primary moments may be applied to the mid-surface of the shell
at an opening connection, only one force,  F R , and two moments,  M L  and  M C , are normally considered significant
causes of shell deformation (see P.2.3 for a description of the nomenclature).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>P.2.7.2 Determination of Allowable Loads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.2.7.2.1  Use the values for  F R ,  M L , and  M C  obtained from the piping analyses to determine the quantities ( λ / 2 Y F )
( F R / F P ), ( λ / aY L )( M L / F P ), and ( λ / aY C )( M C / F P ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.2.7.2.2  Plot the point ( λ / 2 Y F ) ( F R / F P ), ( λ / aY L )( M L / F P ) on the nomogram constructed as shown in Figure P.5a.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.2.7.2.3  Plot the point ( λ / 2 Y F ) ( F R / F P ), ( λ / aY L )( M C / F P ) on the nomogram constructed as shown in Figure P.5b.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.2.7.2.4  The external piping loads  F R ,  M L , and  M C  to be imposed on the shell opening are acceptable if both points
determined from P.2.7.2.2 and P.2.7.2.3 lie within the boundaries of the nomograms constructed for the particular
opening-tank configuration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.2.8 Manufacturer and Purchaser Responsibility<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.2.8.1  The Manufacturer is responsible for furnishing to the Purchaser the shell stiffness coefficients (see P.2.4)
and the unrestrained shell deflection and rotation (see P.2.5). The Purchaser is responsible for furnishing to the
Manufacturer the magnitude of the shell-opening loads (see P.2.6). The Manufacturer shall determine, in accordance
with P.2.7, the acceptability of the shell-opening loads furnished by the Purchaser. If the loads are excessive, the
piping configuration shall be modified so that the shell-opening loads fall within the boundaries of the nomograms
constructed as in P.2.7.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>P.3 Alternative Procedure for the Evaluation of External Loads on Tank Shell Openings<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.3.1.1  This section provides guidelines for the use of alternative methods in determining local stresses in nozzles
and cylindrical shells from external loads. Localized stresses at nozzle locations in shells shall be evaluated using one
of the methods listed below. For each method, the acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with P.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Stress calculations shall be in accordance with WRC 297 or ASME Section VIII Division 2, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Stress calculations shall be performed using a numerical analysis such as the finite element analysis (FEA).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.3.1.2  The guidelines of this section regarding FEA, only apply to analysis utilizing shell elements. The use of solid
continuum elements requires different analysis procedures including stress linearization of the results and is beyond
the scope of this section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.3.1.3  The guidelines of this section do not address all details of good FEA modeling practice. In addition to the
subjects addressed, selection of element type, element size, aspect ratio, and application of boundary conditions and
loadings, for example, can have a significant effect on the results. Skill and experience on the part of the engineer are
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.2 Parameters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For comparative analysis, modeling shall utilize the following parameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.3.2.1  Any reinforcing plate shape that meets the requirements of this Standard is acceptable. Using a thickened
insert plate is considered equivalent to using two separate plates, shell plus reinforcing plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.2.2  Welds do not need to be modeled.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.3.2.3  Loads are applied at end of the nozzle. Evaluate the perimeter surface and membrane stresses at a
distance that is 1.50 times the thickness being considered away from the junction. In addition, local primary
membrane stress shall be evaluated at a distance 1.0( RT ) 0.5  from the discontinuity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.3.2.4  Load cases shall include product and hydrostatic conditions at design liquid level. Loads on nozzles result-
ing from thermal movement of the tank shall be considered. Internal pressure shall be added as additional product
head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.2.5  Use Figure P.1 sign convention (“right-hand rule”). Loads are mechanical and all loads shall be taken
simultaneously. Minimum load combinations are:<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) – F R + M C + M L<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P.3.2.6  FEA will frequently show the neck is overstressed due to product loading alone, however, the stress is self-
limiting and neck strains can be shown to be low. Neck stresses need not be analyzed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.2.7  Bottom of shell plate shall be considered radially fixed and shall be free to rotate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.2.8  Thermal stress in the shell need not be included in this analysis.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.2.9  Tank size is a non-essential variable. Therefore the entire tank does not need to be modeled.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.3 Allowable Stress Limits<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.3.1  For membrane stress, limit stress to 1.5( S d ). Local primary membrane stress, including primary bending,
shall be limited to 1.1( S d ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>P.3.3.2  For surface stress, limit stress to the greater of 2( F y ) and 3( S d ), but shall not exceed the tensile (ultimate)
strength.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>S.1.2  This Annex applies only to tanks in nonrefrigerated services with a maximum design temperature not
exceeding 260 °C (500 °F). Tanks designed to this Annex shall be assigned a maximum design temperature no less
than 40 °C (100 °F). It is cautioned that exothermic reactions occurring inside unheated storage tanks can produce
temperatures exceeding 40 °C (100 °F).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>S.1.3  The minimum thicknesses specified in this Annex are corroded thicknesses unless otherwise stated.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>S.1.4  This Annex states only the requirements that differ from the basic rules in this standard. For requirements not
stated, the basic rules must be followed.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>SC.1.1  This Annex covers materials, design, fabrication, erection, and testing requirements for vertical, cylindrical,
aboveground, closed- and open-top, welded, storage tanks constructed with stainless steel and carbon steel.
Generally, in this Annex the term stainless steel includes austenitic or duplex unless noted otherwise. Stainless steel
and carbon steel may be used in the same tank for shell rings, bottom plates, roof structure and other parts of a tank
to provide product storage for conditions that require only certain portions of the tanks to provide added corrosion
resistance. These tanks are mixed material tanks. Stainless steel and carbon steel plates may be mixed in the
bottom, roof or within any shell course. This Annex does not cover stainless steel clad plate or strip lined construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SC.1.2  This Annex applies to tanks in non-refrigerated services with a maximum design temperature not exceeding
260  ° C (500  ° F). For the purposes of this Annex, the design temperature shall be the maximum design temperature
as specified by the Purchaser. It is cautioned that exothermic reactions occurring inside unheated storage tanks can
produce temperatures exceeding 40  ° C (100  ° F).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SC.1.3  This Annex states only the requirements that differ from the basic rules in this standard. For requirements
not stated, the basic rules must be followed including Annex S and Annex X as applicable. References to paragraphs
in this Annex shall be to the basic document unless stipulated otherwise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SC.1.4  For limitations due to thermal effects see S.3.6 and X.3.7.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>1) If the total design external pressure force on the bottom plate exceeds the sum of the weight of the bottom
plates plus the weight of any product required by the Purchaser to remain in the tank when external pressure is
acting, membrane stresses in the bottom must be evaluated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) If the area around the tank will be subject to flooding with liquid, provisions should be included in the design of
the tank and its operating procedures to ensure that the tank contains sufficient liquid to counteract bottom uplift
resulting from external flooding conditions. If the tank cannot be filled with liquid of sufficient depth to counteract
the uplift from the liquid pressure under the bottom of the tank, membrane stresses in the bottom must be
evaluated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V.9.2  In both of the above cases, the bottom may be evaluated as a membrane subjected to uniform loading and

<<HEADING level=3>>V.9.3.1  Calculation of external (flooding) pressure:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The calculation of the hydrostatic external pressure due to flooding is performed using the equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P  =  G out H<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rule 1:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When flooding of the area surrounding a tank is possible, the most effective way to prevent damage to the shell or
bottom is to maintain an equivalent or higher level of liquid inside the tank whenever flooding occurs. The required

<<PARAGRAPH>>( G in   x   H in ) +  W bott   / (p  x   R 2 ) ³  G out   ×   H out<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rule 2:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When it is not possible to satisfy the equation in Rule 1, the tank and anchorage, if used, shall be designed to safely
resist the unbalanced pressure resulting from flood liquid. As a minimum, the following components shall be evaluated:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_494>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V-18
API S TANDARD  650<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V.9.3.2 allowable stress:  Unless otherwise specified, the flooding described above may be considered a
temporary loading and the allowable stress increased accordingly. However, the increase in allowable stress shall not
exceed 33 % of the basic allowable stress for the subject component when evaluating the component for flood
loading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V.9.3.3 anchorage:  For tanks that are mechanically anchored, the anchorage devices shall be adequate to resist
the uplift and shear forces resulting from the pressure due to external flood liquid. If the tank is not mechanically
anchored, provisions should be made to guide the tank back into its original position when the flooding conditions
recede.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V.9.3.4 attached piping and sump:  Piping and other components connecting the tank to the ground or another
structure shall be capable of withstanding, without damage or failure, loads and movements due to any unbalanced
pressures resulting from flooding of the area around the tank. If a sump is used, the design of the sump shall consider
the possibility of the sump floating out of its pit during a flooding event.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V.9.3.5 bottom plate:  Under the pressure of external flood liquid without counterbalancing internal liquid, the
bottom plate will tend to deform or “balloon” upwards. As the bottom deforms and is subject to additional unbalanced
pressure, membrane stresses increase in the bottom plate. The bottom plate shall be capable of withstanding this
deformation without overstress of the plate or the attaching welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>V.9.3.6 corner joint:  As the bottom plate deforms upwards, compressive stresses and bending stresses in the shell-
to-bottom joint increase. The shell plate and bottom plate components of the shell-to-bottom joint within the effective
compression ring limits shall be proportioned to maintain combined stresses within the yield strength corresponding to
the weaker of the two components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Intermediate stiffener spacings on 0.328 in. and 0.395 in. shell plate are,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>L s  = [ H Safe ]( t sx /t smin ) 2.5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>L s  = [5.84](0.328/0.3125) 2.5  = 6.59 ft<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>L s  = [5.84](0.395/0.3125) 2.5  = 10.49 ft<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For equal transposed width we would like to locate 5 stiffeners on 0.3125 in. shell at spacing = 5.44 ft. However, this
causes the 3 rd  stiffener (location = 5.44 ft  ×  3 = 16.32 ft) to be closer to the horizontal shell seam than we would prefer.
Therefore, we will try to locate the 5 stiffeners on the 0.3125 in. shell at spacing = 5.75 ft (must be less than or equal
to  L S  = 5.84 ft).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Locate the 6 th  stiffener as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Available 0.3125-in. shell plate = (4  ×  8 ft) – (5  ×  5.75 ft) = 3.25 ft<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Maximum length of 0.328-in. shell = (5.84 – 3.25)  ×  (0.328 / 0.3125) 2.5  = 2.92 ft<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6 th  stiffener must be located no more than 2.92 ft on 0.328-in. shell. Stiffener can be located 1.5 ft on 0.328-in. shell<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Location of 6 th  stiffener = 32 + 1.5 = 33.5 ft from top of tank<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Locate the 7 th  stiffener as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Available 0.328-in. shell = (5  ×  8) – 33.5 = 6.5 ft<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Maximum spacing on 0.328-in. shell =  L s  = 6.59 ft<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To keep stiffener away from horizontal shell seam, locate stiffener less than 6.59 ft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Location of 7 th  stiffener = 33.5 + 5.75 = 39.25 ft<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Check the remaining unstiffened shell:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Difference between actual and transformed shell height = 48 – 43.54 = 4.45 ft<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Length of 0.328-in. shell below stiffener = 40 – 39.25 = 0.75 ft<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Transformed shell stiffener spacing = 0.75  ×  (0.3125/0.328) 2.5  + 8.0  ×  (0.3125/0.395) 2.5  = 5.12 ft. Must be less than or
equal to 5.84 ft ( H Safe ) - OK<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9) If fewer stiffeners and thicker shell plates is a more economical solution, the design can be adjusted as
follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assume, for this example, a uniform shell thickness equal to the thickness of the lowest shell course, i.e.
t avg  = 0.395 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

opposite the notch not less than 0.38 mm (0.015 in.) at design metal temperature (DMT) or lower. In addition to lateral
expansion, impact test energy values in Joules (ft-lbf) shall be measured and reported on test reports. If the value of
lateral expansion for one specimen of a set is less than 0.38 mm (0.015 in.) but not less than 0.25 mm (0.01 in.) and
the average value of the three specimens equals or exceeds 0.38 mm (0.015 in.), a retest of three additional
specimens may be made, each of which must equal or exceed 0.38 mm (0.015 in.). If the required values are not
obtained in the retest or if the values in the initial test are less than minimum required for retest, the material may be
reheat treated. After reheat treatment, new sets of specimens shall be made and retested; all specimens must meet

Fabrication and Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.4.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Special precautions must be observed to minimize the risk of loss of the corrosion resistance and toughness of duplex
stainless steel. Duplex stainless steel shall be handled so as to minimize contact with iron or other types of steel
during all phases of fabrication, shipping, and construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thermal history of the material must also be controlled. The following sections describe the major precautions that
should be observed during fabrication, and handling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.4.2
Storage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Storage should be under cover and well removed from shop dirt and fumes from pickling operations. If outside
storage is necessary, provisions should be made for rainwater to drain and allow the material to dry. Duplex stainless
steel should not be stored in contact with carbon steel. Materials containing chlorides, including foods, beverages,
oils, cleaners and greases, should not come in contact with duplex stainless steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.4.3
Thermal Cutting<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>X.4.3.1
Thermal cutting of duplex stainless steel shall be by the plasma-arc method or by laser cutting.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>●<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X.4.3.2
Thermal cutting of duplex stainless steel may leave a heat-affected zone with intermetallic precipitates. This
heat-affected zone may have reduced corrosion resistance and toughness unless removed by machining or grinding.
Normally the HAZ from thermal cutting is thin enough to be removed by edge preparation machining and adjacent
base metal melting during welding. The Purchaser shall specify if the heat-affected zone is to be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
