<<HEADING level=2>>Welding of Pipelines and Related Facilities<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers the gas and arc welding of butt, fillet, and socket welds in carbon and low-alloy steel piping used
in the compression, pumping, and transmission of crude petroleum, petroleum products, fuel gases, carbon dioxide,
nitrogen, and where applicable, covers welding on distribution systems. It applies to both new construction and in-
service welding. The welding may be done by a shielded metal arc welding, submerged arc welding, gas tungsten arc
welding, gas metal arc welding, flux-cored arc welding, plasma arc welding, oxyacetylene welding, or flash butt-
welding process or by a combination of these processes using a manual, semiautomatic, mechanized, or automatic
welding technique or a combination of these techniques. The welds may be produced by position or roll welding or by
a combination of position and roll welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard also covers the procedures for radiographic, magnetic particle, liquid penetrant, and ultrasonic testing,
as well as the acceptance standards to be applied to production welds tested to destruction or inspected by
radiographic, magnetic particle, liquid penetrant, ultrasonic, and visual testing methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The values stated in either U.S. customary units (USC) units or metric units (SI) are to be regarded separately as
standard. Each system is to be used independently of the other, without combining values in any way.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The figures depicted in this standard are not drawn to scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is intended that all work performed in accordance with this standard meets or exceeds the requirements of this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While this standard is comprehensive, it may not address all issues that may arise. The absence of guidance or
requirements  is not to be considered prohibitive to  a particular activity or approach that is based upon sound
engineering judgment. For example, other industry standards, reliable engineering tests and analyses, or established
industry practices may provide useful reference to establish sound engineering judgment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Essential Variables<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A welding procedure shall be reestablished as a new welding procedure specification and shall be completely
requalified when any of the essential variables listed in 5.4.2 are changed. Changes other than those given in 5.4.2
may be made in the procedure without the need for requalification, provided the welding procedure specification is
revised to show the changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2 Changes Requiring Requalification<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2.1 Welding Process or Method of Application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A change from the welding process or method of application established in the welding procedure specification (see
5.3.2.1) constitutes an essential variable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2.2 Base Material<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A change in base material constitutes an essential variable. When welding materials of two separate material groups,
the procedure for the higher strength group shall be used. For the purposes of this standard, all materials shall be
grouped as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) SMYS less than or equal to that of the material specified as API 5L Grade X42;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) for materials with a SMYS greater than or equal to that of the material specified as API 5L Grade X65, each grade
shall receive a separate qualification test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1  The groupings specified in 5.4.2.2 do not imply that base materials or filler metals of different analyses within a group
may be indiscriminately substituted for a material that was used in the qualification test without consideration of the compatibility of
the base materials and filler metals from the standpoint of metallurgical and mechanical properties and requirements for preheat
and PWHT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2  When base material with multiple grade markings is being used, the company designates, before using the material, the
selected single grade to be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2.3 Joint Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A major change in joint design (e.g. from V groove to U groove) constitutes an essential variable. Minor changes in
the angle of bevel or the land of the welding groove are not essential variables.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 Testing of Welded Joints—Butt Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.1 Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To test the butt-welded joint, test specimens shall be cut from the joint at the locations shown in Figure 3. The
minimum number of test specimens and the tests to which they shall be subjected are given in Table 2. For pipe less
than 2.375 in. (60.3 mm) in OD, two test welds shall be performed to obtain the required number of test specimens.
The specimens shall be air cooled to ambient temperature prior to being tested. The full-section specimen shall be
tested in accordance with 5.6.2.2 and shall meet the requirements of 5.6.2.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2 Tensile Strength Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2.1 Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The full-thickness tensile strength test specimens shall be either of the types shown in Figure 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The standard specimens shall be prepared as shown in Figure 4 a). They may be machine cut or oxygen cut, and
no other preparation is needed unless the sides are notched or are not parallel. If necessary, the specimens shall
be machined so that the sides are smooth and parallel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The reduced section specimens shall be prepared as shown in Figure 4 b). The weld reinforcement may be
removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2.2 Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tensile strength test specimens shall be broken under tensile load using equipment capable of measuring the
load at which failure occurs. The tensile strength shall be computed by dividing the maximum load at failure by the
smallest cross-sectional area of the specimen, as measured before the load is applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2.3 Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tensile strength of the weld, including the fusion zone of each specimen, shall be greater than or equal to the
specified minimum tensile strength (SMTS) of the pipe material but need not be greater than or equal to the actual
tensile strength of the material. If the specimen breaks outside the weld and fusion zone (i.e. in the parent metal) at a
tensile strength not less than 95 % of that of the SMTS of the pipe material, the weld shall be accepted as meeting the
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the specimen breaks in the weld or fusion zone and the observed strength is greater than or equal to the SMTS of
the pipe material and meets the soundness requirements of 5.6.3.3, the weld shall be accepted as meeting the
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the specimen breaks in the weld and below the SMTS of the pipe material, the weld shall be set aside and a new
test weld shall be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a specimen breaks outside of both the weld and the heat-affected zone (HAZ) at a tensile strength not less than
95 % of that of the SMTS of the pipe material, that specimen shall be accepted as meeting the test requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any specimen that fails due to improper specimen preparation or testing may be replaced and retested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

One nick break and one root bend specimen are taken from each of two test welds, or for pipe less than or equal to 1.315 in. (33.4   mm) in
diameter, one full-section tensile strength specimen is taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b
For materials with SMYS’s greater than the material specified as API 5L Grade X42, a minimum of one tensile test is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.3 Nick Break Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.3.1 Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nick break test specimens (see Figure 5, top) shall be approximately 9 in. (230 mm) long and approximately 1 in.
(25 mm) wide and may be machine cut or oxygen cut. They shall be notched with a hacksaw on each side at the
center of the weld, and each notch shall be approximately  1 / 8  in. (3 mm) deep and the edges shall be smooth and
parallel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nick break specimens prepared in this manner from welds made with certain mechanized and semiautomatic
processes may fail through the pipe instead of the weld. When previous testing experience indicates that failures
through the pipe can be expected, the external reinforcement may be notched to a depth of not more than  1 / 16  in.
(1.6 mm), measured from the original weld surface (see Figure 5, bottom).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the company’s option, nick break specimens for qualification of a procedure using a semiautomatic or mechanized
welding process may be macroetched prior to being nicked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.3.2 Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nick break specimens shall be broken through the weld by any convenient method (i.e. pulling, bending, or
striking). This does not exclude other testing methods. The exposed area of the fracture shall be at least  3 / 4  in.
(19 mm) wide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.3.3 Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The exposed surfaces of each nick break specimen shall show complete penetration and fusion. The greatest
dimension of any gas pocket shall not exceed  1 / 16  in. (1.6 mm), and the combined area of all gas pockets shall not
exceed 2 % of the exposed surface area. Slag inclusions shall not be more than  1 / 32  in. (0.8 mm) in depth and shall
not be more than  1 / 8  in. (3 mm) or one-half the specified wall thickness in length, whichever is smaller. There shall be
at least  1 / 2  in. (13 mm) separation between adjacent slag inclusions of any size. The dimensions should be measured
as shown in Figure 6. Fisheyes, as defined in AWS A3.0, are not cause for rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6 Qualification of Welders<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of the welder qualification test is to determine the ability of welders to make sound butt or fillet welds
using previously qualified procedures. Before any production welding is performed, welders shall be qualified
according to the applicable requirements of 6.2 through 6.8. It is the intent of this standard that a welder who
satisfactorily completes the procedure qualification test is a qualified welder, provided the number of test specimens
required by 6.5 has been removed, tested, and meet the acceptance criteria of 5.6, for each welder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to starting the qualification tests, the welder shall be allowed reasonable time to adjust the welding equipment to
be used. The welder shall follow the requirements of the applicable qualified welding procedure specification. The
qualification of welders shall be conducted in the presence of a representative acceptable to the company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A welder shall qualify for welding by performing a test on segments of pipe nipples or on full-size pipe nipples, as
specified in 6.2.1. When segments of pipe nipples are used, they shall be supported so that typical flat, vertical, and
overhead welds are produced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The essential variables associated with procedure and welder qualifications are not identical. The essential variables
for welder qualification are specified in 6.2.2 and 6.3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Single Qualification<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For qualification to a single weld procedure specification, a welder shall make a test weld using a qualified procedure
to join pipe nipples or segments of pipe nipples. The welder shall make a butt weld in either the rolled or the fixed
position. When the welder is qualifying in the fixed position, the axis of the pipe shall be horizontal, vertical, or inclined
from horizontal at an angle of not more than 45°.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A welder making a single-qualification test for branch connections, fillet welds, or other similar configurations shall
follow the specific welding procedure specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Changes in the essential variables described in 6.2.2 require requalification of the welder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The weld shall be acceptable if it meets the requirements of 6.4 and either 6.5 or 6.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A welder who has successfully completed the qualification test described in 6.2.1 shall be qualified within the limits of
the essential variables described below. If any of the following essential variables are changed, the welder shall be
requalified using an applicable qualified procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A change from one welding process to another welding process or combination of processes, as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) a change from one welding process to a different welding process; or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) a change in the combination of welding processes, unless the welder has qualified on separate qualification
tests, using each of the welding processes that are to be used for the combination of welding processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A change in the direction of welding from vertical uphill to vertical downhill or vice versa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Group 1 or 2 (see Table 1). A change of filler metal classification not listed in Table 1 to any other filler metal
classification or vice versa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) A change from one specified OD group to another. These groups are defined as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) specified OD less than 2.375 in. (60.3 mm),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) specified OD from 2.375 in. (60.3 mm) through 12.750 in. (323.9 mm),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) specified OD greater than 12.750 in. (323.9 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) A change from one specified wall thickness group to another. These groups are defined as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) specified pipe wall thickness less than 0.188 in. (4.8 mm),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) specified pipe wall thickness from 0.188 in. (4.8 mm) through 0.750 in. (19.1 mm),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) specified pipe wall thickness greater than 0.750 in. (19.1 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
A change in position from that for which the welder has already qualified (e.g. a change from rolled to fixed or a
change from vertical to horizontal or vice versa). A welder who qualifies in the fixed position shall also be qualified
to perform rolled welds within the essential variables qualified. A welder who qualifies on a butt weld shall also be
qualified to make lap fillet welds within the essential variables qualified. A welder who successfully passes a butt
weld qualification test in the fixed position with the axis inclined 45° from horizontal shall be qualified to do butt
welds and lap fillet welds in all positions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) A change in the joint design (e.g. the elimination of a backing strip or a change from V bevel to U bevel).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Multiple Qualification<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For multiple qualification, a welder shall successfully complete the two tests described below, using qualified
procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the first test, the welder shall make a butt weld in the fixed position with the axis of the pipe either horizontal or
inclined from horizontal at an angle of not more than 45°. This butt weld shall be made on pipe with an OD of at least
6.625 in. (168.3 mm) and with a wall thickness of at least 0.250 in. (6.4 mm) without a backing strip. The weld shall be
acceptable if it meets the requirements of 6.4 and either 6.5 or 6.6. Specimens may be removed from the test weld at
the locations shown in Figure 12, or they may be selected at the relative locations shown in Figure 12 but without
reference to the top of the pipe, or they may be selected from locations that are spaced equidistantly around the entire
pipe circumference. The sequence of adjacent specimen types shall be identical to that shown in Figure 12 for the
various pipe diameters. Specimens shall not include the longitudinal weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the second test, the welder shall lay out, cut, fit, and weld a branch-on-pipe connection in which the specified
diameters of the run and the branch pipes are equal. This test shall be performed with a pipe diameter of at least
6.625 in. (168.3 mm) and with a specified wall thickness of at least 0.250 in. (6.4 mm). A hole with specified diameter
approximately equal to the inside diameter (ID) of the branch pipe shall be cut in the run. The weld shall be made with
the run pipe axis horizontal and the branch pipe axis extending vertically downward from the run pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The completed weld shall exhibit complete penetration around the entire circumference. Completed root beads shall
not contain any burn-through (BT) of more than  1 / 4  in. (6 mm). The sum of the maximum dimensions of separate
unrepaired BTs in any continuous 12 in. (300 mm) length of weld shall not exceed  1 / 2  in. (13 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The specimens shall be prepared for tensile strength, nick break, and bend tests, and the tests shall be performed as
described in 5.6. However, for the purpose of welder qualification under Section 6, it is not necessary to calculate the
tensile strength of the coupons. The tensile strength test may even be omitted; in which case the specimens
designated for the tensile test shall be subjected to the nick break test. For qualification of welding equipment and
operators under Section 12, the tensile strength test shall not be omitted and the tensile strength shall be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.3 Tensile Strength Test Requirements for Butt Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the tensile strength test, if any of the reduced section specimens or the full section specimen breaks in the weld or
at the junction of the weld and the parent material and fails to meet the soundness requirements of 5.6.3.3, the welder
shall be disqualified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.4 Nick Break Test Requirements for Butt Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the nick break test, if any specimen shows imperfections that exceed those allowed by 5.6.3.3, the welder shall
be disqualified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For the bend tests, if any specimen shows imperfections that exceed those allowed by 5.6.4.3 or 5.6.5.3, the welder
shall be disqualified. Welds in high strength pipe may not bend to the full U shape. These welds shall be considered
acceptable if the specimens that crack are broken apart and their exposed surfaces meet the requirements of 5.6.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If one of the bend test specimens fails to meet these requirements and, in the company’s opinion, the imperfection
observed is not representative of the weld, the test specimen may be replaced by an additional specimen cut adjacent
to the one that failed. The welder shall be disqualified if the additional specimen also shows imperfections that exceed
the specified limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.6 Sampling of Test Fillet Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To test fillet welds, specimens shall be cut from each test weld. Figure 10 shows the locations from which the
specimens are to be removed if the test weld is a complete circumferential weld. If the test weld consists of segments
of pipe nipples, an approximately equal number of specimens shall be removed from each segment. The specimens
shall be air cooled to ambient temperature prior to testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.7 Test Method and Requirements for Fillet Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fillet weld specimens shall be prepared and the test shall be performed as described in 5.8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6 Nondestructive Testing (NDT)—Butt Welds Only<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the company’s option, the qualification butt weld may be examined by radiography or automatic ultrasonic testing
using a qualified NDT procedure in lieu of the tests specified in 6.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6.2 Inspection Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When radiography is utilized, radiographs shall be made of each of the test welds. The welder shall be disqualified if
any of the test welds do not meet the requirements of 9.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When automatic ultrasonic testing is utilized, each test weld shall be fully examined. The welder shall be disqualified if
any of the test welds do not meet the requirements of 9.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiographic testing or automatic ultrasonic testing shall not be used for the purpose of locating sound areas or areas
that contain imperfections and subsequently making tests of such areas to qualify or disqualify a welder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7 Retesting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If, in the mutual opinion of the company and the contractor’s representatives, a welder fails to pass the qualification
test because of unavoidable conditions or conditions beyond the welder’s control, the welder may be given a second
opportunity to qualify. No further retests shall be given until the welder has submitted proof of subsequent welder
training that is acceptable to the company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.8 Records<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A record shall be maintained of the tests given to each welder and of the detailed results of each test. A form similar
to that shown in Figure 2 should be used. (This form should be developed to suit the needs of the individual company
but must be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that the qualification test met the requirements of this standard.) A list
of qualified welders and the procedures for which they are qualified shall be maintained. A welder may be required to
requalify if a question arises about the welder’s competence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 Design and Preparation of a Joint for Production Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping shall be welded by qualified welders using qualified procedures. The surfaces to be welded shall be smooth,
uniform, and free from laminations, tears, scale, slag, grease, paint, and other deleterious material that might
adversely affect the welding. The joint design and spacing between abutting ends shall be in accordance with the
welding procedure specification used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_40>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>32
API S TANDARD  1104<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Alignment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The alignment of abutting ends shall minimize the offset between surfaces. For pipe ends of the same specified
thickness, the offset should not exceed  1 / 8  in. (3 mm). Larger variations are permissible provided the variation is
caused by variations of the pipe end dimensions within the pipe purchase specification tolerances, and such
variations have been distributed essentially uniformly around the circumference of the pipe. Hammering of the pipe to
obtain proper lineup should be kept to a minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Use of Lineup Clamp for Butt Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lineup clamps shall be used for butt welds in accordance with the welding procedure specification. When it is
permissible to remove the lineup clamp before the root bead is completed, the completed part of the bead shall be in
approximately equal segments spaced approximately equally around the circumference of the joint. However, when
an internal lineup clamp is used and conditions make it difficult to prevent movement of the pipe or if the weld will be
unduly stressed, the root bead shall be completed before clamp tension is released. Root bead segments used in
connection with external clamps should be uniformly spaced around the circumference of the pipe and shall have an
aggregate length of at least 50 % of the pipe circumference before the clamp is removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Bevel<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.1 Mill Bevel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All mill bevels on pipe ends shall conform to the joint design used in the welding procedure specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.2 Field Bevel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipe ends should be field beveled by machine tool or machine oxygen cutting. If authorized by the company, manual
oxygen cutting may also be used. The beveled ends shall be reasonably smooth and uniform, and dimensions shall
be in accordance with the welding procedure specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 Weather Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding shall not be done when the quality of the completed weld would be impaired by the prevailing weather
conditions, including but not limited to airborne moisture, blowing sands, or high winds. Windshields may be used
when practical. The company shall decide if weather conditions are suitable for welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Clearance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the pipe is welded above ground, the working clearance around the pipe at the weld should not be less than
16 in. (400 mm). When the pipe is welded in a trench, the bell hole shall be large enough to provide the welder or
welders with ready access to the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7 Cleaning Between Beads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Scale and slag shall be removed from each bead and groove. Power tools shall be used when called for in the
welding procedure specification; otherwise, cleaning may be performed with either hand or power tools.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When semiautomatic or mechanized welding is used, surface porosity clusters, bead starts, and high points shall be
removed by grinding before weld metal is deposited over them. When requested by the company, heavy glass
deposits shall be removed before weld metal is deposited over them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.8.1 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All position welds shall be made with the parts to be joined secured against movement and with adequate clearance
around the joint to allow the welder or welders space in which to work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8.2 Filler and Finish Beads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For position welding, the number of filler and finish beads shall allow the completed weld a substantially uniform cross
section around the entire circumference of the pipe. At no point shall the crown surface fall below the outside surface
of the pipe, nor should it be raised above the parent metal by more than  1 / 16  in. (1.6 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two beads shall not be started at the same location. The face of the completed weld should be approximately  1 / 8  in.
(3 mm) wider than the width of the original groove. The completed weld shall be thoroughly brushed and cleaned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9 Roll Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.1 Alignment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the company’s option, roll welding shall be permitted, provided alignment is maintained by the use of skids or a
structural framework with an adequate number of roller dollies to prevent sag in the supported lengths of pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.2 Filler and Finish Beads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For roll welding, the number of filler and finish beads shall be such that the completed weld has a substantially
uniform cross section around the entire circumference of the pipe. At no point shall the crown surface fall below the
outside surface of the pipe, nor should it be raised above the parent metal by more than  1 / 16  in. (1.6 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The face of the completed weld should be approximately  1 / 8  in. (3 mm) wider than the width of the original groove. As
the welding progresses, the pipe shall be rolled to maintain welding at or near the top of the pipe. The completed weld
shall be thoroughly brushed and cleaned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_42>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>34
API S TANDARD  1104<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>on the basis of either Section 9 or, at the company’s option, Annex A. In the latter case, more extensive inspection to
determine the imperfection size is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Destructive testing shall consist of the removal of completed welds, sectioning of the welds into specimens, and the
examination of the specimens. The specimens shall be prepared in accordance with and shall meet the requirements
of 6.5. The company shall have the right to accept or reject any weld that does not meet the requirements for the
method by which it was inspected. The welder who makes a weld that fails to comply with the requirements may be
disqualified from further work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Operators of nondestructive inspection equipment may be required to demonstrate the inspection procedure’s
capability to detect defects and the operator’s ability to properly interpret the indications given by the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Trepanning methods of testing shall not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Qualification of Inspection Personnel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding inspection personnel shall be qualified by experience and training for the specified inspection task they
perform. Their qualifications shall be acceptable to the company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9 Acceptance Standards for NDT<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance standards presented in this section apply to imperfections located by radiographic, magnetic particle,
liquid penetrant, and ultrasonic test methods. They may also be applied to visual inspection. NDT shall not be used to
select welds that are subjected to destructive testing in accordance with 6.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2 Rights of Rejection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All nondestructive test methods are limited in the information that can be derived from the indications they produce.
The company may therefore reject any weld that appears to meet these acceptance standards if, in its opinion, the
depth of an imperfection may be detrimental to the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.3 Repairs of Defects Other Than Cracks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Defects other than cracks in the root, filler, and finish beads may be repaired with prior company authorization. A
qualified repair procedure shall be required whenever a repair is made by welding when:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) using a welding process, combination of welding processes, or method of application or filler metals different from
that used to make the original weld; or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) repairs are made in a previously welded repaired area; or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) required by the company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.4 Grinding Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grinding repairs may be used to remove defects in the reinforcement of root beads and cover passes provided:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— there is a smooth transition free of undercutting and other imperfections between the ground area and the
original weld, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— pipe surface contour and the minimum wall and weld thickness requirements are not violated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the minimum wall/weld thickness is not known, the grinding depth is limited to the excess root bead penetration or
external reinforcement. The grinding repair length and number of grinding repair areas is not limited. Grinding repairs
do not require use of a qualified repair procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>When back weld repairs are permitted by the company, a repair procedure shall be qualified in accordance with 10.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.6 Welded Double Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A double repair requires prior company authorization. For repair procedure qualification purposes, this is a partial
thickness or full thickness repair that tests a HAZ that has received three full thermal cycles from welding. A grinding
repair is not considered to be one of the thermal cycles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Subsequent repair of a double repair weld is not permitted unless specifically authorized by the company and repaired
with a qualified repair procedure appropriate for the number of thermal cycles used. A qualified repair procedure for a double repair
may be used for a single repair with prior company authorization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a repair procedure is required, the procedure shall be established and qualified to demonstrate that a repair
weld with suitable mechanical properties and soundness can be produced. The repair weld shall meet the minimum
requirements of the production weld or as otherwise specified by the company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.2 Types of Repair Procedures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Types of repair procedures may include, but are not limited to, the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) full thickness repair,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) internal partial thickness repair,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) external partial thickness repair,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) cover pass repair,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) back weld repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3.3 Qualification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repair procedures shall be qualified by visual and destructive testing. NDT may be required at the discretion of the
company. For repair procedure qualification, sample preparation and destructive and nondestructive testing shall not
commence until the repair weld has been allowed to cool to ambient temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum total number of specimens and the types of destructive tests to which each repair procedure shall be
submitted are shown in Table 5. At the discretion of the company, additional types and number of tests may be
required. When the production welding procedure was qualified with Charpy impact testing, Charpy impact testing
shall also be performed to qualify partial thickness and full thickness repair procedures. As noted in Table 5, when
wall thickness is over 0.500 in. (12.7 mm), the side bend tests shall be substituted for face bend or root bend tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Dependent on pipe material or welding process, the company may require additional cooling time prior to destructive and
nondestructive testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Repairs shall be documented and maintained by the company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6 Acceptance Criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repaired areas shall be inspected and evaluated by the same NDT methods previously used to determine a defect.
Visual inspection is considered adequate when the defect was rejected by visual means and repaired by grinding
without additional welding. NDT of a repair weld includes as a minimum the total repair area plus 10 % of the total
repair weld length, or 2 in. (50 mm); whichever is longer on each side of the repair area. Repairs shall be considered
acceptable when the repair area meets the standards of acceptability of Section 9 or more stringent acceptance
criteria specified by the company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   A repair weld of a weld originally inspected and rejected using alternative acceptance criteria derived in accordance with
Annex A must be reinspected and meet the standards of acceptability of Section 9 or more stringent acceptance criteria as
specified by the company. Repair of the total length of defect(s) rejected by Annex A alternative acceptance criteria is required. A
partial length repair of a defect is prohibited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) a satisfactory identification system,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) an acceptable technique and setup,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) compatibility with acceptance standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All requirements that refer to the quality of the resulting images shall apply equally to X-rays and gamma rays. The
use of radiographic testing and the frequency of its use shall be at the option of the company.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The company and the radiographic contractor should agree on the radiographic procedure or procedures to be used
prior to the performance of production radiography. The company shall require the contractor to demonstrate that the
proposed procedures produce acceptable images and shall require the contractor to use such procedures for
production radiography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.3 Exposure Geometry<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.3.1 Film Radiography<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a radiographic source is centered in the pipe for exposing a butt weld, one exposure is adequate for the
radiographic testing of the complete weld (SWE/SWV). When the radiographic source is outside but not more than  1 / 2  in.
(13 mm) from the weld surface, at least three exposures separated by 120° shall be made for the radiographic testing of
a complete weld (DWE/SWV). When the radiographic source is outside and more than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm) from the weld
surface, at least four exposures separated by 90° shall be made for the radiographic testing of a complete weld (DWE/
SWV). When the OD of the piping containing the weld is 3.500 in. (88.9 mm) or less, a DWE/DWV procedure may be
used. When this procedure is used and the radiation beam is offset so that the source-side and film-side portions of the
weld do not overlap in the areas of the radiograph being evaluated, at least two exposures separated by 90° shall be
made for the radiographic testing of a complete weld. When the source-side and film-side portions of the weld are
superimposed, at least three exposures separated by 60° shall be made for the radiographic testing of a complete weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_66>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>58
API S TANDARD  1104<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D
is the minimum distance, in inches (mm), between the source or focal spot and the source side of the object
being radiographed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S
is the size, in inches (mm), of the effective source or focal spot;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t
is the thickness of the weld, in inches (mm), including reinforcement, plus the distance between the film side
of the weld and the film;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k
is the geometric unsharpness factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When  t  is determined for SWE/SWV and DWE/SWV procedures, the thickness of the single wall and its weld
reinforcement shall be used. When  t  is determined for DWE/DWV procedures, the OD of the weld (i.e. the OD of the
pipe plus twice the average height of the weld crown) shall be used;  k  is defined as 0.02 in. (0.5 mm) for material with
a thickness of less than or equal to 2.000 in. (50.8 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.3.2 Other Imaging Media<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-motion imaging, the exposure geometry shall be evaluated at the maximum scanning speed to be used during
the radiographic testing of the complete weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.4 Type of IQIs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IQIs shall conform to the requirements of either ASTM E747 or ISO 19232-1 wire IQI. The company shall define
which type of IQI (ASTM or ISO) is to be used. The IQI shall be made of a material that is radiographically similar to
the material being welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.5 Selection of IQIs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The IQI shall consist of either a series of six (6) wires for ASTM E747 wire type or a series of seven (7) wires for ISO
19232-1 wire type IQI, arranged in order of increasing diameter. The essential wire diameter to be used, based on the
thickness of the weld is shown in Table 8 for ASTM E747 wire type IQI and Table 9 for ISO 19232-1 wire type IQI. At
the option of the company, smaller wire diameter IQI than those specified above may be used, provided the required
radiographic sensitivity is obtained. The radiographic images of the IQI identifying style number and ASTM set letter
or ISO designation shall appear clearly. The image of the essential wire diameter shall appear clearly across the
entire area of interest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   For purposes of IQI selection, when the SWE/SWV or DWE/SWV technique is used, the thickness of the weld means
specified wall thickness plus the weld reinforcement (internal plus external combined). When the "elliptical" DWE/DWV technique
is used, the thickness of the weld means twice the specified wall thickness plus the single weld reinforcement (internal plus
external combined). When the “superimposed” DWE/DWV technique is used, the thickness of the weld means twice the specified
wall thickness plus twice the weld reinforcement (internal plus external combined).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.6 Placement of IQIs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.6.1 Film<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The IQIs shall be placed as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When a complete weld is radiographed in a single exposure using a source inside the piping, at least four IQIs
placed across the weld and spaced approximately equally around the circumference shall be used. For the DWE/
DWV procedure, one IQI shall be placed on the source side of the pipe and across the weld so that the essential
wire image is superimposed onto the weld images. For the DWE/SWV or SWE/SWV procedures requiring
multiple exposures or multiple films for complete inspection of the weld, and where the length of film to be
interpreted is greater than 5 in. (130 mm), two IQIs placed across the weld and located on the film side shall be
used. One shall be within 1 in. (25 mm) of the end of the film length to be interpreted and the other shall be at the
center of the film. When the film length to be interpreted is 5 in. (130 mm) or less, one IQI shall be placed on the
film side, across the weld and located at the center of the length to be interpreted. When a repaired weld is
radiographed, an additional IQI shall be placed across each repaired area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) When it is not practical to place an IQI on the weld due to weld configuration or size, the IQI may be placed on a
separate block. Separate blocks shall be made of the same or radiographically similar material and may be used
to facilitate IQI positioning. The thickness of the separate block material should be the same as the thickness of
the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Heat shields—IQI may be placed on a heat shield rather than in contact with the pipe, provided that the
acceptability of such IQI placement is demonstrated during procedure qualification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.6.2 Other Imaging Media<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For imaging media other than film, IQI placement shall be the same as that required by 11.1.6.1. The IQI may be
placed above the surface of the pipe or held in position between the surface of the pipe and the imager by a fixture
attached to the imager or scanning device. Acceptability of such IQI placement shall be demonstrated during
procedure qualification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1.7 Production Radiography<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Only Level II or III radiographers shall interpret the radiographic images of production welds. Radiographers shall
report to the company all defects observed in the images unless the company requires that all imperfections observed
be reported. The radiographer shall indicate whether the weld meets the requirements of Section 9. The company
shall determine the final disposition of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Annex A
(normative)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>Alternative Acceptance Standards for Girth Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance standards given in Section 9 are based on empirical criteria for workmanship and place primary
importance on imperfection length. Such criteria have provided an excellent record of reliability in pipeline service for
many years. The use of fracture mechanics analysis and fitness-for-purpose criteria for determining acceptance
criteria is an alternative method and incorporates the evaluation of both imperfection height and imperfection length.
Typically, but not always, the fitness-for-purpose criteria provide more generous allowable imperfection length.
Additional qualification tests, stress analysis, and inspection are required to use the fitness-for-purpose criteria.
Performing analysis based on the principles of fitness-for-purpose is alternatively termed engineering critical
assessment, or ECA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fitness-for-purpose criteria in the prior versions of this annex required a minimum crack tip opening displacement
(CTOD) toughness of either 0.005 in. or 0.010 in. (0.13 mm or 0.25 mm) and were independent of any higher values
of fracture toughness. Improvements in welding consumables and with more precise welding procedures, especially,
with the increased use of mechanized welding devices have resulted in higher and more uniform toughness and
ductility in most welds. At the same time, toughness values below 0.005 in. (0.13 mm) have been observed,
particularly with more stringent notching procedures of CTOD specimens than those in the prior versions of this
annex. Welds with CTOD toughness below 0.005 in. (0.13 mm) have shown to perform adequately when the
acceptance criteria are properly adjusted to account for the lower toughness. The acceptance criteria are revised so
that they are commensurate with the measured toughness and applied load levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex includes three options for the determination of acceptance limits of planar imperfections. In numerical
order, the options are increasingly complex in application but offer wider range of applicability. Option 1 provides the
simplest methodology. Option 2 allows for the full utilization of the toughness of the materials thus providing a more
accurate criterion but requires more calculation. The first two options were developed with a single set of underlying
procedures but are limited to applications with a low to moderate fatigue loading as described in A.2.2.1. 7  Option 3 is
provided primarily for those cases where fatigue loading exceeds the limit established for the first two options.
Option 3 is not prescriptive, and its consistency could be significantly less than Options 1 and 2. Option 3 should only
be exercised, when necessary, by skilled practitioners with demonstrated knowledge of fracture mechanics and
pipeline load analysis. With these three options, this current revision of the annex should provide a more complete
approach to determine inspection and acceptance limits for imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is usually impractical to qualify individual pipeline welds for the alternative acceptance limits after a defect under
Section 9 is detected, because destructive testing is required to establish the required mechanical properties for the
welding procedure under consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex provides procedures to determine the maximum allowable imperfection sizes. It does not prevent the use
of Section 9 for determining imperfection acceptance limits for any weld. Use of this annex is completely at the
company’s option.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this annex, the use of the phrase imperfection acceptance limits and other phrases containing the word
imperfection is not intended to imply a defective condition or any lack of weld integrity. All welds contain certain
features variously described as artifacts, imperfections, discontinuities, or flaws. These terms are widely accepted
and used interchangeably. The primary purpose of this annex is to define, on the basis of a technical analysis, the
effect of various types, sizes, and shapes of such anomalies on the suitability of the whole weld for a specific service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.2 Stress Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.1 Axial Design Stress<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To use this annex, a stress analysis shall be performed to determine the maximum axial design stresses to which the
girth welds may be subjected to during construction and operation. The stress analysis shall include stresses during
pipeline installation and stresses induced by operational and environmental conditions. Under typical onshore
construction conditions, the highest axial stress may occur during the pipe lowering-in process. The lowering-in stress is
predominantly controlled by the lift height of the pipe relative to the bottom of the trench. The stresses from horizontal
directional drilling can be estimated from the curvature of the pipe path, pull force, and the interaction between the pipe
and surrounding soil (including friction). 8  These stresses may reach their peak values at different times. The maximum
axial design stress is the maximum total axial stress at any given time during the design life of the pipeline. 9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.2 Cyclic Stress<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.2.1 Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cyclic stress analysis shall include the determination of the predicted fatigue spectrum to which the pipeline will
be exposed over its design life. This spectrum shall include but is not limited to stresses imposed by hydrostatic
testing, operation pressure, installation stresses, and where applicable, thermal, seismic, and subsidence stresses.
The spectrum should consist of several cyclic axial stress levels and the number of cycles applicable to each. If the
stress levels vary from cycle to cycle, a suitable counting method, such as the rainflow method, should be used to
determine cyclic stress levels and cycle count.  10<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fatigue spectrum severity,  S *, is computed from the following equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>N i
is the number of cycles at the  i th cyclic stress level;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Lowering-in Process During Construction,” Proceedings of the 7th International Pipeline Conference, Paper No. IPC2008-

For consistency with the computation of material’s flow stress in this annex, stress-strain relations based on minimum specified
values are recommended when converting axial strains to axial stresses. Using actual stress-strain relations may result in the
overestimation of the applied load level, as the flow stress is computed from the minimum specified values (e.g. see A.5.1.3).
10  For an example of the use of the rainflow method, see N. E. Dowling, “Fatigue Failure Predictions for Complicated Stress-Strain
Histories,”  Journal of Materials , Volume 7, Number 1, pp. 71 to 87, March 1972.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If the spectrum severity is less than 5 × 10 6  and if the use of “steel in-air” crack growth curves, such as those defined
in Table 4 of BS 7910, is appropriate, Options 1 and 2 acceptance criteria (A.5.1.3 and A.5.1.4) may be applied
without any further fatigue analysis.  11  If the spectrum severity exceeds 5 × 10 6  and/or in-air crack growth curves are
not applicable, Options 1 and 2 may be used with further analysis, or Option 3 procedures may be applied.  12<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.2.2 Environmental Effects on Fatigue<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The enlargement of weld imperfections due to fatigue is a function of stress intensity, cycles of loading, imperfection
size, and the environment at the crack tip. In the absence of contaminating elements, oil and hydrocarbons are
considered no worse than air. Water, brine, and aqueous solutions that contain CO 2  or H 2 S may, however, increase
the growth rate. It is normal for minor amounts of these components to be present in nominally noncorrosive
pipelines. When the concentration of either CO 2  or H 2 S exceeds typical historical levels experienced in noncorrosive
pipelines, this annex shall not be used, unless evidence exists that the proposed levels do not result in acceleration of
fatigue crack growth or adequate corrosion inhibition is applied. The effects of environment on fatigue crack growth
external to the pipe at girth welds are normally mitigated by external coating and cathodic protection and do not limit
the use of this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain environments may enhance imperfection growth in service at sustained load or induce brittleness in the material
surrounding the imperfection to the point that an otherwise dormant imperfection becomes critical. These environments
typically contain H 2 S but may contain strong hydroxides, nitrates, or carbonates. When these materials are present
inside the pipe, a minimum threshold stress shall be established, and this annex shall not be used if the calculated stress
exceeds the threshold value. With respect to H 2 S service, the definition of such service shall be that given in
NACE MR0175. Although external exposure to carbonates and nitrates in the soil has been shown to produce stress
corrosion cracking (SCC) in a small number of cases, the cracking is normally axial and is associated with
circumferential stress rather than axial stress. However, circumferential SCC failures may occur at locations where
longitudinal stresses have increased over the life of the pipeline, for example, at overbends above unstable slopes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency and severity of SCC can be mitigated by the use of proper coating and proper cathodic protection. The
use of this annex is not precluded when direct exposure to the aggressive environment is prevented by a coating
designed to resist the environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.4 Dynamic Loading<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The stress analysis shall include consideration of potential dynamic loading on girth welds, such as loads from
closure of check valves. This annex does not apply to welds strained at a strain rate greater than 10 –3  second (a
stress rate of 30 ksi/sec for steel).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>11  The implied safety factor in the fatigue spectrum severity limit for Options 1 and 2 varies, depending on, for example, the pipe
wall thickness and distribution of fatigue spectrum. For a wide range of onshore and offshore pipeline scenarios, the spectrum
severity limit is estimated to provide a safety factor of more than 2 or 5 on cycles when the fatigue growth rates are based on
mean+2 standard deviation or mean values of BS 7910 (Table 4,  R  > 0.5), respectively.
12  Options 1 and 2 provide an adequate safety factor against fracture due to moderate cyclic loading provided aforementioned
“steel-in-air” curve is applicable. In other environments, for example, when determining allowable defect sizes at the OD of an
offshore pipeline with fusion-bonded epoxy field joint coating and under cathodic protection, use of the “steel-in-air” curve is not
appropriate and use of Option 1 or 2 may not be sufficiently conservative. Similarly, if cyclic loading exceeds the defined
spectrum severity of 5 × 10 6 , for example, due to cyclic stresses from offshore installation loads on a pipe lay stinger, use of
Option 1 or 2 may also not be sufficiently conservative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.5 Residual Stress<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effects of welding residual stress are accounted for by specifying minimum CTOD toughness and Charpy energy
and by incorporating appropriate safety factor in Options 1 and 2 procedures (A.5.1.3 and A.5.1.4). The determination
of residual stress is not required under these conditions. The effects of residual stress shall be evaluated for all time-
dependent failure mechanisms, such as fatigue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The controls of the variables necessary to ensure an acceptable level of fracture toughness in a welding procedure
are more stringent than those controlling welding procedures without minimum toughness requirements. An
appropriate quality control program shall be established to ensure welding is performed within the parameters of the
qualified welding procedure. Qualification of welding procedures to be used with this annex shall be in accordance
with Section 5 or Section 12 of this standard, with the additional mechanical property testing in accordance with A.3.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements for the weld based on the mechanical property test results are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) If the specimen breaks at a strength equal to or greater than the SMTS of the pipe, the result is acceptable and no

requirement is met, gross weld strength undermatching should be avoided.  14<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) If the specimen breaks in the weld or HAZ at a strength below the SMTS of the pipe material, the weld shall be
rejected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) If a specimen breaks outside the weld or HAZ at a tensile strength less than 100 %, but not less than (lower than)
95 % of the SMTS of the pipe material, then two additional specimens may be tested. Both retest specimens shall
meet the SMTS of the pipe material. If either retest specimen fails to meet the minimum tensile strength
requirement, no retesting is permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Any specimen that breaks outside the weld or HAZ at a tensile strength less than (lower than) 95 % of the SMTS

<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.4.2.1 Specimen Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Charpy V-notch impact test specimens shall be prepared with their lengths parallel to the pipe axis. The largest size
specimens permitted by the pipe wall thickness should be used. The thickness of subsized specimens should have at
least 80 % of the wall thickness. Six specimens shall be removed from each of the following positions: 12, 6, and 3 or
9 o’clock, for a total of 18 specimens. For each of these positions, three specimens shall have the V-notch placed in
the weld centerline; and the other three shall have the V-notch placed in the HAZ as shown in Figure A.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.4.2.2 Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At least nine valid specimens for each notch location (weld metal or HAZ) shall be tested at or below the minimum

<<PARAGRAPH>>The impact energy for each notch location (weld metal or HAZ) is acceptable when the following criteria are met:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the average absorbed energy for each set of three specimens equals or exceeds 30 ft-lb (40 J);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the minimum individual absorbed energy for each set of three specimens equals or exceeds 22 ft-lb (30 J);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in Items a) and b) above shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.4.2.4 Retesting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Retesting is permitted when no more than one specimen in each group of nine specimens (weld metal or HAZ)
generates an absorbed energy less than 22 ft-lb (30 J), but the average absorbed energy from the set of three
specimens that contains the low individual value exceeds 30 ft-lb (40 J). The retest requirements are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the three retest specimens shall be extracted from a location as close as possible to the location of the specimen
that generated the low result,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the absorbed energy of all three retest specimens shall meet or exceed 30 ft-lb (40 J).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the above retest criteria are satisfied, the Charpy results are acceptable. If the above criteria are not satisfied, no
further retesting is permitted and the weld is rejected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Figure A.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the HAZ tests, the fatigue precracks shall be aimed to intersect the largest unrefined coarse grain HAZ regions
within the central 70 % of the specimen thickness (see Figure A.6). Each of the three HAZ specimens should be
aimed at different coarse grained regions within the central 70 %. If there are fewer than three such regions in the
central 70 %, then multiple specimens may be aimed at the same region. Multiple specimen sampling of the cap pass
coarse grain HAZ should be avoided. No more than one specimen should be devoted to the cap pass HAZ. To
identify coarse grain HAZ regions, it may be useful to conduct a microhardness survey to locate the coarsest HAZ
regions that have undergone the least amount of tempering by subsequent weld passes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.4.3.3 CTOD Toughness Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For each welding procedure, both the weld metal and the HAZ shall be tested. Each set of tests (of weld metal or

three specimens shall consist of one each from the nominal 12, 3 or 9, and 6 o’clock positions on the test weld and
should be permanently marked to identify the original position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After testing, particular attention should be given to the qualification criteria in 12.4 (particularly 12.4.3) of BS EB ISO

Particular attention should be given to reporting the position of the test specimen in the qualification weld and to
distinguishing whether the reported CTOD value represents  δ c ,  δ u , or  δ m . The test report shall also include a legible
copy of the load-displacement record and a record of the appearance of the fracture surfaces; the latter requirement
can be satisfied by a clear photograph of one or both fracture surfaces or by retaining one or both fracture surfaces

<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1 Planar Imperfections<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The length and height of an imperfection, and its depth below the surface, shall be established by appropriate
nondestructive inspection techniques or otherwise justified before a decision to accept or reject can be made.
Conventional radiography, as described in 11.1, is adequate for measuring imperfection length but is insufficient for
determining height, particularly for planar imperfections such as cracks, lack of fusion, undercutting, and some types
of lack of penetration. The use of ultrasonic techniques, radiographic techniques that employ densitometers or
comparative visual reference standards, acoustic imaging, inherent imperfection-size limitations due to weld-pass
geometry, or any other technique for determining imperfection height is acceptable, provided the technique’s
accuracy has been established (e.g. see 11.4.4) and any potential inaccuracy is included in the measurement; that is,
the determination of imperfection height shall be conservative. The use of conventional radiography (see 11.1) to
identify imperfections that require height measurement by other means is acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.2 Structure of the Procedures to Determine the Maximum Acceptable Imperfection Size<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedures to determine the maximum acceptable planar imperfection size are given in three options. Option 1 is
a simplified approach in graphical format. It relies on theoretically sound and experimentally validated plastic collapse
criteria, and has been modified by the Option 2 approach when appropriate. Option 2 is in the form of a failure
assessment diagram, or FAD. The FAD format allows the simultaneous consideration of brittle fracture, plastic
collapse, and the interaction between those two failure modes (elastic-plastic fracture). Options 1 and 2 are limited to
pipelines with limited fatigue loads as specified in A.2.2. Option 3 permits the use of validated fitness-for-purpose
procedures when the cyclic loading exceeds the spectrum requirements of Options 1 and 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Option 1 procedures are limited to CTOD toughness equal or greater than 0.004 in. (0.10 mm). The Options 2
and 3 procedures may be applied at any CTOD toughness level greater than the minimum required value of 0.002 in.
(0.05 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basis of the Options 1 and 2 procedures places no limit on pipe diameter or diameter to wall thickness ratio ( D / t
ratio). Theoretical validation has shown that the procedures are valid for  D / t   ≥  10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Line pipes with ultrahigh  Y / T  ratio ( Y / T  > 0.95) are often associated with low uniform strain (engineering strain at
ultimate tensile stress) and low ductility. Additional testing and validation may be necessary to use the alternative
acceptance criteria in this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.3 Determination of Acceptable Imperfection Size by Option 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two sets of acceptance criteria are given, depending on the CTOD toughness value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the CTOD toughness is equal to or greater than 0.010 in. (0.25 mm), the maximum acceptable imperfection
size is given in Figure A.7 at various load levels ( P r ). If the load level is not given in Figure A.7, the maximum<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_99>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES
91<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>acceptable imperfection size can be obtained by interpolating the adjacent curves or by taking the value of the next
higher load level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the CTOD toughness is equal to or greater than 0.004 in. (0.10 mm) and less than 0.010 in. (0.25 mm), the
maximum acceptable imperfection size is given in Figure A.8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptable imperfection size may be more limiting than that from the Option 2 procedure as the limits in
Figure A.7 and Figure A.8 were calibrated to a CTOD toughness of 0.010 in. (0.25 mm) and 0.004 in. (0.10 mm),
respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total imperfection length shall be no greater than 12.5 % of the pipe circumference. The maximum imperfection
height shall be no greater than 50 % of the pipe wall thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The allowable height of the buried imperfections is treated the same as the allowable height of the surface-breaking
imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The built-in safety factor in the acceptable imperfection size can accommodate certain amount of undersizing of
imperfection height without negatively impacting weld integrity. The assumed height uncertainty is the lesser of
0.060 in. (1.5 mm) and 8 % of pipe wall thickness. No reduction in allowable imperfection size is necessary if the
allowance for inspection (alternatively termed inspection error) is better than the assumed height uncertainty.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The allowable imperfection height shall be reduced by the difference between the allowance for inspection and the
assumed height uncertainty if the above condition cannot be met.  15<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.4.1 Background<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The underlining Option 2 procedure is the FAD. There are three key components in the assessment in FAD format,
see Figure A.10:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) failure assessment curve (FAC);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) stress or load ratio,  S r  or  L r ; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) toughness ratio,  K r .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The FAC is a locus that defines the critical states in terms of the stress and toughness ratios. The stress ratio defines
the likelihood of plastic collapse. The toughness ratio is the ratio of applied crack driving force over the material’s
fracture toughness. It defines the likelihood of brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The FAD approach is computationally complex. Proficiency and understanding of fracture mechanics is necessary to
ensure the procedure is applied correctly. A validated computer program should greatly simplify the computation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.4.2 Determination of Critical Imperfection Size<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The critical imperfection size can be computed iteratively using equations provided in A.5.1.4.3. The following steps
may be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 1) Select an imperfection size as a start point. A reasonable start point is an imperfection with the maximum
allowed height,  η  = 0.5, and a small imperfection length that represents the smallest imperfection length
that the selected inspection methods can confidently detect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 2) Determine the assessment point in the FAD format in accordance with A.5.1.4.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 3) If the assessment point falls inside the safe region, increase the imperfection length and repeat Step 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 4) If the assessment point falls outside the safe region, decrease the imperfection length and repeat Step 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 5) If the assessment point falls on the FAC:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) this represents a critical state with the combination of load, material property, and imperfection size.
Make a note of the imperfection height and length;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) reduce the imperfection height by a small increment, say  Δη  = 0.05. Start from the imperfection length
determined in Item a) and repeat Step 2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 6) Make a table of critical imperfection height and length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 7) Apply a safety factor of 1.5 on the imperfection length to produce a draft table of the allowable imperfection
height versus imperfection length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 8) Make necessary adjustment to the draft table to ensure detectability of the selected inspection methods  17<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and sound welding practice.  18  Produce the final table of the allowable imperfection height versus
imperfection length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total imperfection length shall be no greater than 12.5 % of the pipe circumference. The maximum imperfection
height shall be no greater than 50 % of the pipe wall thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The allowable height of the buried imperfections is treated the same as the allowable height of the surface-breaking
imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The built-in safety factor in the acceptable imperfection size can accommodate certain amount of undersizing of
imperfection height without negatively impacting weld integrity. The assumed height uncertainty is the lesser of
0.060 in. (1.5 mm) and 8 % of pipe wall thickness. No reduction in allowable imperfection size is necessary if the
allowance for inspection is better than the assumed height uncertainty.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The allowable imperfection height shall be reduced by the difference between the allowance for inspection and the
assumed height uncertainty if the above condition cannot be met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.5 Determination of Acceptable Imperfection Size by Option 3<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most offshore pipelines and flowlines, cyclic loading during construction and operation is present. The Option 3
procedures are permitted when significant imperfection growth is expected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Subject to company approval, validated fitness-for-purpose procedures may be used to develop imperfection
acceptance criteria. One of the most widely accepted procedures is BS 7910. The procedures shall be applied by
well-qualified analysts/engineers who have the demonstrated command of the principles of fracture mechanics,
pipeline welding, and NDT. Any selected procedure shall be taken as a whole in developing the acceptance criteria
with appropriate considerations of safety factors. It should be recognized that the basic assumptions of various public-<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_107>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES
99<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>accessible assessment procedures may be different from those of Options 1 and 2. Mixing parts of different
procedures is discouraged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.5.2 Fatigue Flaw Growth<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Appropriate fatigue analysis shall be conducted to determine the starting flaw acceptance criteria. Various public-
accessible procedures and software are available to determine the flaw growth (e.g. Section 8 of BS 7910). Static
fracture resistance shall be checked for all peak loads during the entire fatigue loading spectrum. Available software
programs may be used by skilled practitioners to conduct this fatigue analysis and check the static failure conditions
during the entire application of the cyclic loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The allowable flaw size from Option 1 may be used as the starting flaw sizes for both buried and surface-breaking
flaws. If the critical flaw size is reached or failure from static peak loads occurs prior to the end of the service life (with
the appropriate design or safety factor), the starting flaw sizes need to be reduced. Care should be taken to select the
appropriate flaw growth curves (da/dN curves) for the type of service. Tables 4 and 5 of BS 7910 provide guidance for
selection of these curves, and company may provide supplemental information used to generate flaw growth curves
for different product conditions inside the pipe. For small  D / t  ratio pipes through-thickness stress is not uniform.
Analyses from multiple initial flaw locations are necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.5.3 Inspection Error and Safety Factor on Allowable Imperfect Size<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The allowable flaw height shall be reduced by the inspection error extracted from NDT qualification results of qualified
inspection system/procedure/operator for the specific project or project with similar material and welding procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1.6 Transverse Planar Imperfections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Transverse planar imperfections shall be repaired or removed. The height of imperfections that are indicative of
stacked weld bead starts and stops shall not exceed the lesser of  1 / 4  in. (6.4 mm) or 50 % of the wall thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.2 Acceptable Limits of Volumetric Imperfections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Buried volumetric imperfections, such as slag or porosity, contained in material with high fracture toughness are much
less likely to cause failure than planar imperfections. These imperfections may be treated and evaluated as planar
imperfections or by the simplified method of Table A.4. Surface-breaking imperfections, and buried imperfections that
are recategorized as surface-breaking by the imperfection interaction rules, shall be treated and evaluated as planar
imperfections. The minimum CTOD toughness and Charpy impact energy requirements are applicable regardless
how the imperfections are evaluated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.3 Arc Burns<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Arc burns may occur on the internal or external surface of the pipe as a result of inadvertent arc strikes or improper
grounding. They generally appear as a pit or cavity visible to the eye or as a dense area on the radiograph. The cavity
may be surrounded by a hard HAZ that may be of lower toughness than the base material or the weld deposit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance limits for unrepaired arc burns are given in Table A.5 and are based on the premise that the HAZ has
zero toughness but that any planar imperfection originating within the HAZ is blunted at the edge of the zone.
Substantial data indicate that the total depth of the arc burn, including the HAZ, is less than half the width of the burn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>In-service Welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex covers recommended welding practices for making repairs to or installing appurtenances on pipelines and
piping systems that are in service. For the purposes of this annex, in-service pipelines and piping systems are defined
as those that contain crude petroleum, petroleum products, or fuel gases that may be pressurized and/or flowing. In-
service welds are defined as those that fuse directly into the wall of an in-service pipeline or piping system. This
annex does not cover pipelines and piping systems that have been fully isolated and decommissioned or that have
not been commissioned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are two primary concerns with welding onto in-service pipelines. The first concern is to avoid “burn-through,”
where the welding arc causes the pipe wall to be breached. The second concern is for hydrogen cracking, since welds
made in service cool at an accelerated rate as the result of the flowing contents’ ability to remove heat from the pipe wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Burn-through is unlikely when installing an appurtenance if the wall thickness is 0.250 in. (6.4 mm) or greater,
provided that low-hydrogen electrodes (EXX18 type) and normal welding practices are used. Welding onto thinner-
wall in-service pipelines is possible and considered routine by many companies; however, special precautions, such
as the use of a procedure that limits heat input, are often specified. Burn-through becomes more likely when welding
directly onto the pipe, which may occur when depositing the buttering layers of a temper bead deposition sequence or
when performing weld deposition repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For hydrogen cracking to occur, three conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. These conditions are: hydrogen in
the weld, the development of a crack-susceptible weld microstructure, and tensile stress acting on the weld. To
prevent hydrogen cracking, at least one of the three conditions necessary for its occurrence must be minimized or
eliminated. For welds made onto in-service pipelines, success has been achieved using low-hydrogen electrodes or a
low-hydrogen process and, since low hydrogen levels cannot always be guaranteed, using procedures that minimize
the formation of crack-susceptible microstructures. The most common procedures use a sufficiently high heat input
level to overcome the effect of the flowing contents. Several heat input prediction methods have been developed,
including thermal analysis computer models. 20  While these or other proven methods are useful in predicting the heat
input required for a given in-service welding application, they are not a substitute for procedure qualification (see B.2).
Preheating, where practicable, and/or the use of a temper bead deposition sequence, can also reduce the risk of
hydrogen cracking. For some pipeline operating conditions, the ability of the flowing contents to remove heat from the
pipe wall tends to make the effective use of preheating difficult. Examples of typical temper bead deposition
sequences are shown in Figure B.1. To minimize the stress acting on the weld, attention should also be given to
proper fit-up to minimize the stress concentration at the root of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The successful application of in-service welding must achieve a balance between safety on one hand and the
prevention of unsatisfactory material properties on the other. For example, if the pipe wall is thin [i.e. less than
0.250 in. (6.4 mm)], it may be necessary to limit heat input to minimize the risk of burn-through; however, a low heat
input level may be insufficient to overcome the ability of the contents to remove heat from the pipe wall, resulting in
excessive weld cooling rates and a subsequent risk of hydrogen cracking. Thus, a compromise must be reached.
When the maximum allowable heat input to avoid burn-through is insufficient to provide adequate protection against
hydrogen cracking, then alternative precautions (e.g. a temper bead deposition sequence) must be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The majority of this annex pertains to preventing hydrogen cracking in in-service welds. If the pipe wall thickness is
less than 0.250 in. (6.4 mm), the risk of burn-through should be considered. The previously mentioned thermal<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>analysis computer models  20  or another proven method should be used to determine heat input limits for these
applications. Additional consideration should also be given for welding onto in-service pipelines and piping systems
that contain products that become explosively unstable upon the application of heat or that contain products that will
affect the pipe material by rendering it susceptible to ignition, stress corrosion cracking, or embrittlement. Additional
guidance can be found in API 2201.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the side(s) that will be prepared. For each macrosection test specimen, at least one face should be ground to at least
a 600 grit finish and etched with a suitable etchant, such as Nital, ammonium persulfate, or dilute hydrochloric acid, to
give a clear definition of the weld structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.5.4.2 Visual Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cross section of the weld is to be visually examined with lighting that will sufficiently reveal the details of the weld
soundness. The use of optical devices or dye penetrants is not necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.5.4.3 Hardness Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two of the four macro test specimens for branch and sleeve welds and both macro test specimens for weld
deposition repairs should be prepared for hardness testing in accordance with ASTM E384. A minimum of five
indentations should be made using a Vickers indenter and a 10-kg load to determine the maximum hardness value in
the coarse-grained HAZ at the weld toe of each specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.5.4.4 Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A visual examination of the cross section of the weld should show that it is completely fused at the root and free of
cracks. The fillet weld should have leg lengths that are at least equal to the lengths specified in the procedure
qualification and should not deviate in concavity or convexity by more that  1 / 16  in. (1.6 mm). The depth of the
undercutting should not exceed  1 / 32  in. (0.8 mm) or 12  1 / 2  % of the pipe wall thickness, whichever is smaller.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.3 In-service Welder Qualification<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-service welding, the welder should be qualified to apply the specific procedure being used according to the
requirements of 6.2, except for the alternative/additional requirements specified in this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A welder qualified on pipe having an OD of less than 12.750 in. (323.9 mm) should be qualified for all diameters less
than or equal to the diameter used in the qualification test. A welder qualified on pipe having an OD of greater than or
equal to 12.750 in. (323.9 mm) should be qualified for all pipe diameters. A welder who has an existing multiple
qualification to 6.3 and an in-service qualification to B.3 should be qualified as an in-service branch or sleeve welder
for all positions, all diameters, and all wall thicknesses within the limits of the essential variables in 6.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For weld deposition repairs, welders who perform test welds on the bottom of the pipe are qualified for welding in all
positions. Welders who perform test welds on the side of the pipe are qualified for welding only on the side and top of
the pipe. Welders who perform test welds on the top of the pipe are qualified for welding only on the top of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.2 Welding of Test Joint<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-service welding, pipeline operating conditions that affect the ability of the flowing contents to remove heat from
the pipe wall should be simulated while test joints are being made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Filling the test section with water and allowing water to flow through the test section while the test joint is being made has
been shown to produce thermal conditions equivalent to or more severe than typical in-service welding applications (see<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_119>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>W ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES
111<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure B.2). Welders qualified under these conditions are therefore qualified for any typical in-service application. Other media
(e.g. motor oil) may be used to simulate less severe thermal conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to making the test joint used for the destructive testing described in B.3.3, the welder should demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the company the ability to comply with aspects of the welding procedure specification that are
intended to avoid the development of crack-susceptible microstructures and/or prevention of burn-through. For
example, for heat input control procedures, the company may choose to require the welder to demonstrate the ability
to maintain a heat input level within the range specified in the welding procedure specification. For temper bead and
weld deposition repair procedures, the company may choose to require the welder to demonstrate bead placement
within the dimensional tolerances specified in the welding procedure specification and the ability to maintain a heat
input level within the range specified in the welding procedure specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.3 Testing of Welded Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The weld should be tested and considered to be acceptable if it meets the requirements of 6.4 and 6.5. For
longitudinal seam welds, the minimum number of specimens and the tests to which they should be subjected is

<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements for production welding in Section 7 should be applied to in-service welds, except for the alternative/
additional requirements specified in this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before welding onto an in-service pipeline or piping system, welders should consider aspects that affect safety, such
as operating pressure, flow conditions, and wall thickness at the location of the welding. The areas to be welded
should be inspected to ensure that imperfections are not present and that the wall thickness is adequate. All welders
performing repair work should be familiar with the safety precautions associated with cutting and welding on piping
that contains or has contained crude petroleum, petroleum products, or fuel gases. Additional guidance can be found
in API 2201.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.4.2 Alignment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.4.2.1 Fit-up<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For sleeve and saddle welds, the gap between the sleeve or saddle and the carrier pipe should not be excessive.
Clamping devices should be used to obtain proper fit-up. When necessary, weld metal build-up on the carrier pipe can
be used to minimize the gap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.4.2.2 Root Opening—Longitudinal Seam Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For longitudinal butt welds of full encirclement sleeves, when 100 % penetration is required, the root opening (the
space between abutting edges) should be sufficient. These joints should be fitted with a mild steel back-up strip or
suitable tape to prevent penetration of the weld into the carrier pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Penetration of the longitudinal butt weld into the carrier pipe is undesirable since any crack that might develop is exposed
to the hoop stress in the carrier pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.4.3 Welding Sequence<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Suggested sleeve and branch welding sequences are shown in Figure B.7 through Figure B.12. For full-encirclement
fittings requiring circumferential fillet welds, the longitudinal seams should be completed before beginning the
circumferential welds. The circumferential weld at one end of the fitting should be completed before beginning the
circumferential weld at the other end. For other types of fittings, a welding sequence that minimizes residual stress
should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guidelines for weld deposition repair have been developed which include preparation prior to welding and weld
deposition sequence.  23  For example, a perimeter pass should be used to establish a boundary beyond which no
subsequent welding is allowed. The first layer of fill passes should be deposited using established heat input limits to
minimize the risk of burn-through. A second perimeter pass should be used to temper the HAZ at the toe of the first
perimeter pass. Higher heat input fill passes should be used for subsequent layers to further temper the initial passes,
again observing established heat input limits if necessary. Additional layers should be deposited, as necessary, for
proper filling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

procedures, have been shown to be effective at detecting hydrogen cracks at the toe of sleeve-, saddle-, and branch-to-carrier
pipe welds. Ultrasonic testing, radiographic testing, or a combination of both are effective for volumetric inspection for weld
deposition repairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When determining appropriate delay times prior to inspection for hydrogen cracking, the time-dependant nature of
cracking should be considered, as well as the probability of the weld to cracking. Longer delay times decrease the
chance that cracking can occur after inspection has been completed. The probability of cracking, and thus the
importance of determining an appropriate delay time, can be minimized by using more conservative welding
procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.6 Standards of Acceptability: NDT (Including Visual)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The standards of acceptability in Section 9 for imperfections located by NDT should be applied to in-service welds.
For weld deposition repair, the weld length is defined as the maximum weld length in the direction in which the defect
is oriented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.7 Repair and Removal of Defects<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements in Section 10 for the repair and removal of defects should be applied to in-service welds. Care
should be taken during the removal of the defect to ensure that the wall thickness is not reduced to less than that
which is acceptable for the operating pressure of the carrier pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Requests for Interpretation and Request for Revision to the Document<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The API-AGA Joint Committee on Oil and Gas Pipeline Field Welding Practices will consider written requests for
interpretations and revisions in a formal manner. The Committee’s activities in this regard are limited strictly to
interpretations of this standard, or to the consideration of revisions to this standard on the basis of new data or
technology. Such requests are handled as expeditiously as possible, but due to the complexity of the work and the
procedures that shall be followed, some responses may require considerable time. As a matter of policy, API does not
approve, certify, rate, or endorse any item, construction, proprietary device, or activity related to the use of this
standard. Accordingly, any requests for interpretation requiring such consideration shall not be addressed. API does
not act as a consultant on specific welding problems or on the general application or understanding of this standard.
If, based on the information submitted in the request for interpretation, it is the opinion of the Committee that the
inquirer should seek professional assistance, the request for interpretation is not addressed with the recommendation
that such assistance be obtained. Requests for interpretation that do not provide the information needed for the
Committee’s full understanding shall not be addressed, and the inquirer is so notified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2 Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requests for interpretation shall be limited strictly to interpretations of this standard (and not include interpretations of
any normative references), or to the consideration of revisions to this standard on the basis of new data or technology.
Requests shall be submitted in writing. Requests shall contain the name, address, and affiliation of the inquirer and
shall provide enough information for the committee to fully understand the point of concern in the inquiry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requests for interpretation or proposed revisions to the documentshould be directed to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.4 Content<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inquiry should be concise, yet complete, to enable the Committee to quickly and fully understand the point of the
inquiry. Omit superfluous background information. The inquiry should be technically and editorially correct. If the point
of the inquiry is to obtain an interpretation, the inquiry shall be stated in such a manner that the response to the inquiry
is either “yes” or “no”.  The Committee shall not address inquiries that pose questions of “how” or “why”. If the point of
the inquiry is to obtain a revision of the standard, the inquiry shall provide technical justification for that revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.5 Proposed Reply<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A request for interpretation may include a proposed reply, stating a believed interpretation of the requirements of the
provision in question, or recommended wording for a revision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.6 Additional/New Proposed Processes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Processes other than those described in this document can be considered for inclusion in this standard. Persons who
wish to have other processes included shall submit, as a minimum, the following information for the committee’s
consideration:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) a description of the welding process,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) a proposal on the essential variables,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) a welding procedure specification,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) weld inspection methods,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) types of weld imperfections and their proposed acceptance limits,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
