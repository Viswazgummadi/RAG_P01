<<HEADING level=3>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In December 1931, API and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) created the Joint API/ASME
Committee on Unfired Pressure Vessels. This committee was created to formulate and prepare for publication a code
for safe practices in the design, construction, inspection, and repair of pressure vessels to be used in the petroleum
industry. Entitled API/ASME  Code for Unfired Pressure Vessels for Petroleum Liquids and Gases  (commonly called
the API/ASME  Code for Unfired Pressure Vessels  or API/ASME  Code ), the First Edition of the API/ASME  Code  was
approved for publication in 1934. From its inception, the API/ASME  Code  contained Section I, which covered
recommended practices for vessel inspection and repair and for establishing allowable working pressures for vessels
in service. Section I recognized and afforded well-founded bases for handling various problems associated with the
inspection and rating of vessels subject to corrosion. Although the provisions of Section I (like other parts of the API/
ASME  Code ) were originally intended for pressure vessels installed in the plants of the petroleum industry, especially
those vessels containing petroleum gases and liquids, these provisions were actually considered to be applicable to
pressure vessels in most services. ASME’s Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee adopted substantially identical
provisions and published them as a nonmandatory appendix in the 1950, 1952, 1956, and 1959 editions of Section
VIII of the ASME  Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the API/ASME  Code  was discontinued in 1956, a demand arose for the issuance of Section I as a separate
publication, applicable not only to vessels built in accordance with any edition of the API/ASME  Code  but also to
vessels built in accordance with any edition of Section VIII of the API/ASME  Code . Such a publication appeared to be
necessary to assure industry that the trend toward uniform maintenance and inspection practices afforded by
Section I of the API/ASME  Code  would be preserved. API 510, first published in 1958, is intended to satisfy this need.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedures in Section I of the 1951 edition of the API/ASME  Code , as amended by the March 16, 1954
addendum, have been updated and revised in API 510. Section I of the API/ASME  Code  contained references to
certain design or construction provisions, so these references have been changed to refer to provisions in the API/
ASME  Code . Since the release of the 1960 edition of the National Board Inspection Code, elements of the API/ASME
Code  have also been carried by the National Board Inspection Code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is the intent of API to keep this publication up to date. All pressure vessel owners and operators are invited to report
their experiences in the inspection and repair of pressure vessels whenever such experiences may suggest a need
for revising or expanding the practices set forth in API 510.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This edition of API 510 supersedes all previous editions of API 510. Each edition, revision, or addendum to this API
code may be used beginning with the date of issuance shown on the cover page for that edition, revision, or
addendum. Each edition, revision, or addendum to this API code becomes effective six months after the date of
issuance for equipment that is rerated, reconstructed, relocated, repaired, modified (altered), inspected, and tested
per this code. During the six-month time between the date of issuance of the edition, revision, or addendum and the
effective date, the user shall specify to which edition, revision, or addendum the equipment is to be rerated,
reconstructed, relocated, repaired, modified (altered), inspected, and tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nothing contained in any API publication is to be construed as granting any right, by implication or otherwise, for the
manufacture, sale, or use of any method, apparatus, or product covered by letters patent. Neither should anything
contained in the publication be construed as insuring anyone against liability for infringement of letters patent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Pressure Vessel Inspection Code: In-service Inspection,
Rating, Repair, and Alteration<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 General Application<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1.1 Coverage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This inspection code covers the in-service inspection, repair, alteration, and rerating activities for pressure vessels
and the pressure-relieving devices protecting these vessels. This inspection code applies to all hydrocarbon and
chemical process vessels that have been placed in service unless specifically excluded per 1.2.2; but it could also be
applied to process vessels in other industries at owner/user discretion. This includes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) vessels constructed in accordance with an applicable construction code [e.g. ASME  Boiler and Pressure Vessel
Code  (ASME  Code )];<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) vessels constructed without a construction code (noncode vessels)—a vessel not fabricated to a recognized
construction code and meeting no known recognized standard;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) vessels constructed and approved as jurisdictional special based upon jurisdiction acceptance of particular
design, fabrication, inspection, testing, and installation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) nonstandard vessels—a vessel fabricated to a recognized construction code but has lost its nameplate or
stamping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, vessels that have been officially retired from service and abandoned in place (i.e. no longer are an asset of
record from a financial/accounting standpoint) are no longer covered by this “in-service inspection” code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ASME  Code  and other recognized construction codes are written for new construction; however, most of the
technical requirements for design, welding, NDE, and materials can be applied to the inspection, rerating, repair, and
alteration of in-service pressure vessels. If for some reason an item that has been placed in service cannot follow the
construction code because of its new construction orientation, the requirements for design, material, fabrication, and
inspection shall conform to API 510 rather than to the construction code. If in-service vessels are covered by
requirements in the construction code and API 510 or if there is a conflict between the two codes, the requirements of
API 510 shall take precedence. As an example of the intent of API 510, the phrase “applicable requirements of the
construction code” has been used in API 510 instead of the phrase “in accordance with the construction code.”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2
API 510<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors are to be certified as stated in this inspection code (see Annex B). Since other codes covering specific
industries and general service applications already exist (e.g. NB-23), the refining and petrochemical industry has
developed this inspection code to fulfill their own specific requirements for vessels and pressure-relieving devices that
fit within the restrictions listed in the scope.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The intent of this code is to specify the in-service inspection and condition-monitoring program that is needed to
determine the integrity of pressure vessels and pressure-relieving devices. The program should provide reasonably
accurate and timely assessments to determine if any changes in the condition of pressure equipment could
compromise continued safe operation. The owner/users shall respond to any inspection results that require corrective
actions to assure the continued safe operation of pressure vessels and pressure-relieving devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1.3 Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adoption and use of this inspection code does not permit its use in conflict with any prevailing regulatory
requirements. However, if the requirements of this code are more stringent than the requirements of the regulation,
then the requirements of this code shall govern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2 Specific Applications<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2.1 Exploration and Production (E&P) Vessels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All pressure vessels used for E&P service [e.g. drilling, producing, gathering, transporting, lease processing, and
treating liquid petroleum, natural gas, and associated salt water (brine)] may be inspected under the alternative rules
set forth in Section 9. Except for Section 6, all of the sections in this inspection code are applicable to pressure
vessels in E&P service. The alternative rules in Section 9 are intended for services that may be regulated under
safety, spill, emission, or transportation controls by the U.S. Coast Guard; the Office of Hazardous Materials
Transportation of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and other units of DOT; the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation, and Enforcement, formerly the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of
the Interior; state and local oil and gas agencies; or any other regulatory commission.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2.2 Excluded and Optional Services<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Vessels excluded from the specific requirements of this inspection code are listed in Annex A. However, each owner/
user has the option of including any excluded pressure vessel in their inspection program as outlined in this code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some vessels exempted in accordance with the criteria in ASME  Code , Section VIII, Division 1 should be considered
for inclusion based on risk (probability and consequence of failure) as determined by the owner/user. An example of
such vessels might be vacuum flashers in refining service or other large vessels operating in vacuum service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.3 Recognized Technical Concepts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For inspection planning and engineering assessment of in-service pressure vessels, this inspection code recognizes
the applicability of Fitness-For-Service (FFS) assessment and risk-based inspection (RBI) methodologies. API 579-1/
ASME FFS-1 provides detailed assessment procedures for specific types of damage that are referenced in this code.
API 580 provides guidelines for conducting a risk-based assessment program. API 581 provides a method of
conducting RBI in accordance with the principles in API 580.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.3 Management of Change (MOC)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user is responsible for implementing and executing an effective MOC process that reviews and controls
changes to the process and to the hardware. An effective MOC review process is vital to the success of any pressure
vessel integrity management program as it allows the inspection group<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) to be able to address issues concerning the adequacy of the pressure equipment design and current condition
for the proposed changes,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) to anticipate changes in corrosion or other types of damage, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) to update the inspection plan and records to account for those changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When pressure equipment integrity may be affected, the MOC process shall include the appropriate inspection,
materials/corrosion, and mechanical engineering experience and expertise in order to effectively identify pressure
equipment design issues and forecast what changes might affect pressure vessel integrity. The inspection group shall
be involved in the approval process for changes that may affect pressure vessel integrity. Changes to the hardware
and the process shall be included in the MOC process to ensure its effectiveness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.4 Integrity Operating Windows (IOWs)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user should implement and maintain an effective program for creating, establishing, and monitoring
integrity operating windows. IOWs are implemented to avoid process parameter exceedances that may have an
unanticipated impact on pressure equipment integrity. Future inspection plans and intervals have historically been
based on prior measured corrosion rates resulting from past operating conditions. Without an effective IOW and
process control program, there often is no warning of changing operating conditions that could affect the integrity of
equipment or validation of the current inspection plan. Deviations from and changes of trends within established IOW
limits should be brought to the attention of inspection/engineering personnel so they may modify or create new
inspection plans depending upon the seriousness of the exceedance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IOWs should be established for process parameters (both physical and chemical) that could impact equipment
integrity if not properly controlled. Examples of the process parameters include temperatures, pressures, fluid
velocities, pH, flow rates, chemical or water injection rates, levels of corrosive constituents, chemical composition, etc.
IOWs for key process parameters may have both upper and lower limits established, as needed. Particular attention
to monitoring IOWs should also be provided during start-ups, shutdowns, and significant process upsets. See API
584 for more information on issues that may assist in the development of an IOW program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Engineer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pressure vessel engineer is responsible to the owner/user for activities involving design, engineering review,
analysis, or evaluation of pressure vessels and pressure-relieving devices as specified in this inspection code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Repair Organization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All repairs and alterations shall be performed by a qualified repair organization. The repair organization is responsible
to the owner/user and shall provide the materials, equipment, QC, and workmanship that is necessary to maintain
and repair the vessel or pressure-relieving device in accordance with the requirements of this inspection code. See
definition of a repair organization in 3.1.62.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Inspector<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector is responsible to the owner/user to assure that the inspection, NDE, repairs, and pressure testing
activities meet API 510 code requirements. The inspector shall be directly involved in the inspection activities,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>especially visual inspections, which in most cases will require field activities to ensure that procedures and inspection
plans are followed but may be assisted in performing inspections by other properly trained and qualified individuals
who are not inspectors (e.g. examiners and operating or maintenance personnel). However, all NDE results shall be
evaluated and accepted by the inspector who will then make appropriate recommendations for repairs, replacements,
or fitness for continued service. Inspectors shall be certified in accordance with the provisions of Annex B. The
inspector can be an employee of the owner/user or be a contractor acceptable to the owner/user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Examiners<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1  The examiner shall perform the NDE in accordance with job requirements, NDE procedures, and owner/user
specifications.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2  The examiner does not need API 510 inspector certification and does not need to be an employee of the
owner/user. The examiner does need to be trained and competent in the NDE procedures being used and may be
required by the owner/user to prove competency by holding certifications in those procedures. Examples of
certifications that may be required include ASNT SNT-TC-1A, ASNT CP-189, CGSB, and AWS QC1. Inspectors
conducting their own examinations with NDE techniques shall also be appropriately qualified in accordance with
owner/user requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.3  The examiner’s employer shall maintain certification records of the examiners employed, including dates and
results of personnel qualifications. These records shall be available to the inspector who is responsible to the owner/
user to determine that all NDE examiners are properly qualified for the work they perform.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6 Other Personnel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Operating, maintenance, engineering (process and mechanical), or other personnel who have special knowledge or
expertise related to particular pressure vessels shall be responsible for timely notification to the inspector or engineer
of potential issues that may affect vessel integrity such as the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) any action that requires MOC;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) operations outside defined IOW;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) changes in source of feedstock and other process fluids that could increase process related corrosion rates or
introduce new damage mechanisms;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) vessel failures, repair actions conducted, and failure analysis reports;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) cleaning and decontamination methods used or other maintenance procedures that could affect pressure vessel
integrity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
reports of experiences that may come to their attention that other plants have experienced with similar or same
service pressure vessel failures;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) any unusual conditions that may develop (e.g. noises, leaks, vibration, movements, insulation damage, external
vessel deterioration, support structure deterioration, significant bolting corrosion, etc.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) any engineering evaluation, including FFS assessments, that might require current or future actions to maintain
mechanical integrity until next inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7 Inspection Organization Audits<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each owner/user organization should be audited periodically to determine if the authorized inspection agency is

<<PARAGRAPH>>user chooses to conduct a RBI assessment, it shall include a systematic evaluation of both the probability of failure
and the consequence of failure in accordance with API 580. API 581 details an RBI methodology that has all of the
key elements defined in API 580, Section 1.1.1. Identifying and evaluating potential damage mechanisms, current
equipment condition, and the effectiveness of the past inspections are important steps in assessing the probability of
a pressure vessel failure. Identifying and evaluating the process fluid(s), potential injuries, environmental damage,
equipment damage, and equipment downtime are important steps in assessing the consequence of a pressure
vessel failure. Identifying IOWs for key process variables is a useful adjunct to RBI, as well as any other method of
planning and scheduling inspections. See 4.1.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2 Probability Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The probability assessment shall be based on all forms of damage that could reasonably be expected to affect a
vessel in any particular service. Examples of those damage mechanisms include: internal or external metal loss from
localized or general corrosion, all forms of cracking, and any other forms of metallurgical, corrosion, or mechanical
damage (e.g. fatigue, embrittlement, creep, etc.) Additionally, the effectiveness of the inspection practices, tools, and
techniques used for finding the potential damage mechanisms shall be evaluated. Other factors that should be
considered in a probability assessment include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) appropriateness of the materials of construction;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) vessel design conditions, relative to operating conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) appropriateness of the design codes and standards utilized;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) effectiveness of corrosion monitoring programs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) the quality of maintenance and inspection QA/QC programs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
both the pressure retaining and structural requirements; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) operating conditions, both past and projected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Equipment failure data will also be important information for this assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3 Consequence Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The consequence of a release is dependent on type and amount of process fluid contained in the equipment. The
consequence assessment shall consider the potential incidents that may occur as a result of fluid release, the size of
a potential release, and the type of a potential release, (includes explosion, fire, or toxic exposure.) The assessment
shall also determine the potential incidents that may occur as a result of fluid release, which may include: health
effects, environmental damage, equipment damage, and equipment downtime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4 Documentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is essential that all RBI assessments be thoroughly documented in accordance with API 580, Section 17, clearly
defining all the factors contributing to both the probability and consequence of a failure of the vessel. After an RBI
assessment is conducted, the results can be used to establish the vessel inspection plan and better define the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the most appropriate inspection and NDE methods, tools, and techniques;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the extent of NDE (e.g. percentage of vessel to examine);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

process changes, inhibitors, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.5 Frequency of RBI Assessments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When RBI assessments are used to set vessel inspection intervals, the assessment shall be updated after each
vessel inspection as defined in API 580, Section 15. The RBI assessment shall also be updated each time process or
hardware changes are made that could significantly affect damage rates or damage mechanisms and anytime an
unanticipated failure occurs due to a damage mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Preparation for Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety precautions are important in pressure vessel inspection and maintenance activities because some process
fluids are harmful to human health. Also, pressure vessels are enclosed spaces, and internal activities involve
exposure to all of the hazards of confined space entry. Applicable regulations (e.g. those administered by OSHA)
govern many aspects of vessel entry and shall be followed. In addition, the owner/user’s safety procedures shall be
reviewed and followed. Refer to API 572, Section 8 for more information on inspection safety.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2 Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All tools, equipment, and personal protective equipment used during vessel work (inspection, NDE, pressure testing,
repairs, and alterations) should be checked prior to use. NDE equipment and the repair organization’s equipment is
subject to the owner/user’s safety requirements for electrical equipment. Other equipment that might be needed for
the vessel work, such as planking, scaffolding, and portable ladders, should be checked before being used. Personal
protective equipment shall be worn when required either by regulations, the owner/user, or the repair organization.
Refer to API 572, Section 8 for more information on inspection tools.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.3 Communication<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before starting any vessel inspection and maintenance activities (e.g. NDE, pressure testing, repair, or alteration),
personnel should obtain permission to work in the vicinity (internal or external) from operating personnel responsible
for the pressure vessel. When individuals are inside a vessel, all persons working around the vessel should be
informed that people are working inside the vessel. Individuals working inside the vessel should be informed when
any work is going to be done on the interior or exterior of the vessel while they are inside the vessel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.4 Vessel Entry<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to entering a vessel, the vessel shall be positively isolated from all sources of liquids, gases, vapors, radiation,
and electricity. The vessel shall be drained, purged, cleaned, ventilated, and the atmosphere inside it gas tested
before it is entered. Procedures to ensure continuous safe ventilation and precautions to ensure safe egress/
emergency evacuation of personnel from the vessel should be clear and understood by all those entering the vessel.
Do cumentation of these precautions is required prior to any vessel entry. Before entering a vessel, individuals shall
o b tain permission from the responsible operating personnel. Where required, personnel protective equipment shall
be worn that will protect the eyes, lungs, and other parts of the body from specific hazards that may exist inside the
vessel. All safe entry procedures required by the operating site and the applicable jurisdiction shall be followed. The
inspector is responsible to assure him/herself that all applicable safety procedures, regulations, and permits for
confined space entry are being followed prior to their entry of the vessel. The inspector is encouraged to verify that all
connections to the vessel that could pose a possible hazard to those inside the vessel during inspection activities
have been properly disconnected or blinded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and characteristics of potential defects and/or damage mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.3  More detailed information and more damage mechanisms concerning corrosion, cracking, etc., including
critical factors, appearance, and typical inspection and monitoring techniques are found in API 571. Additional
recommended inspection practices for various damage mechanisms are described in API 572.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.4  Vessels in cyclic service (cycles of pressure, temperature, or combinations of both pressure and temperature)
should be evaluated for potential fatigue cracking failures and have appropriate inspections planned. The following
considerations should be evaluated where applicable for vessels in cyclic service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The fatigue design criteria from the original code of construction and any special precautions and/or fabrication
details (e.g. ground flush welds, limits on weld peaking, integral reinforcement, magnetic particle/dye penetrant
examinations of weld surface, volumetric weld examination, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The types of vessel internal and external attachments and nozzles (e.g. fillet welded attachments and nozzle
reinforcing pads), longitudinal and circumferential weld joint peaking, repairs, modifications, and damage (e.g.
dents, bulges, gouges, etc.), and their potential for fatigue cracking due to the stress intensification at these
locations. An engineering analysis may be required to determine the high stress locations for further evaluation
and inspection planning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The potential for internal or external corrosion (e.g. CUI) and environmental/stress corrosion cracking and their
potential effect on the fatigue life of the vessel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The appropriate NDE and inspection frequency to detect fatigue cracking (e.g. external ultrasonic angle beam flaw
detection, external and/or internal wet fluorescent magnetic particle examination, time-of-flight diffraction ultrasonics)
and the need for out-of-roundness measurements and measurements of weld seams for peaking or flattening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical examples of vessels in cyclic service include coke drums, mole sieves, and pressure swing adsorbers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.1 Types of Inspection and Surveillance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Different types of inspections, examinations and surveillance are appropriate depending on the circumstances and
the pressure vessel. These include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) internal inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) on-stream inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) external inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>e) CUI inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
operator surveillance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with the inspection plan for each vessel. Refer to Section 6 for the
interval/frequency and extent of inspection. Corrosion and other damage identified during inspections and
examinations shall be characterized, sized, and evaluated per Section 7 with deviations from the plan being approved
by the inspector or pressure vessel engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.2 Pressure Vessel Internal Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The internal inspection shall be performed by an inspector in accordance with the inspection plan; other properly
qualified personnel (e.g. NDE examiner) may assist the inspector (but not replace) in the internal inspection, when
approved and under the direction of the authorized inspector. An internal inspection is conducted from inside the
vessel and shall provide a thorough check of internal pressure boundary surfaces for damage. Manway or inspection
port inspections can be substituted for internal inspections only when the vessel is too small to safely enter or all
internal surfaces can be clearly seen and adequately examined from the manway or inspection port. Remote visual
inspection techniques may aid the check of internal surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A primary goal of the internal inspection is to find damage that cannot be found by regular monitoring of external CMLs
during on-stream inspections. Specific NDE techniques [e.g. wet fluorescent magnetic particle testing, alternating
current field measurement, eddy current examination (ET), PT, etc.] may be required by the owner/user to find damage
specific to the vessel or service conditions and when needed shall be specified in the inspection plan. API 572, Section
9.4 provides more information on pressure vessel internal inspection and should be used when performing this
inspection. Additionally refer to API 572, Annex B for extensive information on internal inspection of columns/towers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.2.2 Pressure Vessel Internals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When vessels are equipped with removable internals, internals may need to be removed, to the extent necessary, to
allow inspection of pressure boundary surfaces. The internals need not be removed completely as long as
reasonable assurance exists that damage in regions rendered inaccessible by the internals is not occurring to an
extent beyond that found in more accessible parts of the vessel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.2.3 Internal Deposits and Linings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector, in consultation with the corrosion specialist, should determine when it is necessary to remove deposits
or linings to perform adequate inspections. Whenever operating deposits, such as coke, are normally permitted to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

not cause deterioration of the surface. Spot examinations at selected areas, with the deposit thoroughly removed,
may be required to determine the vessel surface condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal linings (e.g. refractory, strip linings, plate linings, coatings) should be thoroughly examined. If internal linings
are in good condition and there is no reason to suspect that damage is occurring behind them, it is not necessary to
remove linings during the internal inspection. If the lining appears damaged, bulged, or cracked, it may be advisable
to remove portions of the linings to investigate the condition of the lining and the vessel surface beneath. External
NDE techniques may be advisable to explore for damage beneath linings. Refer to API 572, Section 4.3 and Sections
9.4.7 to 9.4.9 for more information on inspection of pressure vessel linings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.3 On-stream Inspection of Pressure Vessels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.1  The on-stream inspection may be required by the inspection plan. All on-stream inspections should be
conducted by either an inspector or examiner in accordance with the inspection plan. All on-stream inspection work
performed by an examiner shall be authorized and approved by the inspector. When on-stream inspections of the
pressure boundary are specified, the appropriate NDE techniques shall be specified to detect the damage
mechanisms and their associated flaw types identified in the inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.2  The inspection may include a number of examination techniques to assess damage mechanisms
associated with the service. Techniques used in on-stream inspections are chosen for their ability to identify particular
damage mechanisms from the exterior and their capabilities to perform at the on-stream conditions of the pressure
vessel (e.g. metal temperatures). The thickness examination described in 5.5.5 would typically be part of an on-
stream inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are inherent limitations when applying external NDE techniques trying to locate internal damage. Issues that
can affect those limitations include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) type of material of construction (alloy);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) type of parent material (plate, pipe, casting);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) weldments;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.3.3  On-stream inspection may be acceptable in lieu of internal inspection for vessels under the specific
circumstances defined in 6.5.2. In situations where on-stream inspection is acceptable, such inspection may be
conducted either while the vessel is depressurized or pressured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.4.1.1  Visual external inspections are normally performed by an inspector; however, other qualified personnel may
conduct the external inspection when acceptable to the inspector. In such cases, the persons performing the external
inspection in accordance with API 510 shall be qualified with appropriate training as specified by the owner/user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.4.1.2  External inspections are performed to check the condition of the outside surface of the vessel, insulation
systems, painting and coating systems, supports, and associated structure and to check for leakage, hot spots,
vibration, the allowance for expansion, and the general alignment of the vessel on its supports. During the external
inspection, particular attention should be given to welds used to attach components (e.g. reinforcement plates and
clips) for cracking or other defects. Any signs of leakage should be investigated so that the sources can be
established. Normally, weep holes in reinforcing plates should remain open to provide visual evidence of leakage as
well as to prevent pressure buildup behind the reinforcing plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.4.1.3  Vessels shall be examined for visual indications of bulging, out-of-roundness, sagging, and distortion. If
any distortion of a vessel is suspected or observed, the overall dimensions of the vessel shall be checked to
determine the extent of the distortion. API 572, Section 9.3 provides more information on external inspection of
pressure vessels and should be used when conducting this inspection. Any personnel who observe vessel
deterioration should report the condition to the inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.4.2 Inspection of Buried Vessels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Buried vessels shall be inspected to determine their external surface condition. The inspection interval shall be based
on an assessment of the cathodic protection system (if any exists) effectiveness and on corrosion rate information
obtained from one or more of the following methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) during maintenance activity on connecting piping of similar material,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) from the periodic examination of similarly buried corrosion test coupons of like material,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) from representative portions of the actual vessel, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) from a vessel in similar circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Excavation of buried vessels for the purpose of inspection should take into account the potential for damaging the
coating and or cathodic protection systems. Buried vessels in light hydrocarbon service should be risk assessed to
help determine the inspection frequency and plans, as well as the need for cathodic protection, coating system
maintenance, and other mitigation activities. Scanning UT thickness readings and/or other appropriate scanning NDE
methods for determining the condition of the external surface condition could be conducted on the vessel internally to
monitor for external corrosion. Refer to API 571, Section 4.3.9 on soil corrosion when conducting inspections of
buried vessels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.5 Thickness Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.5.1  Thickness measurements are taken to verify the thickness of vessel components. This data is used to
determine the corrosion rates and remaining life of the vessel. Thickness measurements shall be obtained by the
inspector or examiner as required and scheduled by the inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.5.2  Although thickness measurements are not required to be obtained while the pressure vessel is on-stream,
on-stream thickness monitoring is the primary method for monitoring corrosion rates.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.5.3  The inspector shall review the results of the thickness inspection data to look for possible anomalies and
should consult with a corrosion specialist when the short-term corrosion rate changes significantly from the
previous identified rate to determine the cause. Appropriate responses to accelerated corrosion rates may include
additional thickness readings, UT scans in suspect areas, corrosion/process monitoring, and revisions to the
vessel’s inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5.5.4  The owner/user is responsible to assure that all individuals taking thickness readings are trained and
qualified in accordance with the applicable procedure used during the examination. See API 572, Section 9.2 for
more information on thickness examination techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.6.1 Susceptible Temperature Range for CUI<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection for CUI shall be considered for externally insulated vessels and those that are in intermittent service or
operate at temperatures between:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) 10 °F (–12 °C) and 350 °F (175 °C) for carbon and low alloy steels,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) 140 °F (60 °C) and 350 °F (185 °C) for austenitic stainless steels,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) 280 °F (138 °C) and 350 °F (185 °C) for duplex stainless steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.6.2 Susceptible Locations for CUI on Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With carbon and low alloy steels, CUI usually causes localized corrosion. With austenitic and duplex stainless steel
materials, CUI usually is in the form of external chloride stress corrosion cracking. When developing the inspection
plan for CUI inspection, the inspector should consider areas that are most susceptible to CUI but be aware that
locations for CUI damage can be very unpredictable. On vessels, the most susceptible areas include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) above insulation or stiffening rings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) nozzles and manways;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
top and bottom heads;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) other areas that tend to trap water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If CUI damage is found, the inspector should inspect other susceptible areas on the vessel. See API 583 on CUI for
more detailed information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.6.3 Insulation Removal<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although external insulation may appear to be in good condition, CUI damage may still be occurring underneath it.
CUI inspection may require removal of some or all insulation (i.e. removing selected windows in the insulation). If
external coverings are in good condition and there is no reason to suspect damage behind them, it is not necessary to
remove them for inspection of the vessel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerations on the need for insulation removal are not limited to but include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) consequences of CUI leakage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) history of CUI for the vessel or comparable equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) visual condition of the external covering and insulation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) evidence of fluid leakage (e.g. stains);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 Condition Monitoring Locations (CMLs)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CMLs are designated areas on pressure vessels where periodic examinations are conducted to monitor the presence
and rate of damage. The type of CML selected and placement of CMLs shall consider the potential for localized
corrosion and service-specific damage as described in 5.4. Examples of different types of CMLs include locations for
thickness measurement, locations for stress corrosion cracking examinations, and locations for high-temperature
hydrogen attack examinations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2 CML Examinations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.2.1  Each pressure vessel shall be monitored by conducting a representative number of examinations at CMLs
to satisfy the requirements for an internal and/or on-stream inspection. For example, the thickness for all major
components (shells, heads, cone sections) and a representative sample of vessel nozzles should be measured and
recorded. Corrosion rates, the remaining life, and next inspection intervals should be calculated to determine the
limiting component. CMLs with the highest corrosion rates and least remaining life shall be part of those included in
next planned examinations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.2.2  Pressure vessels with high potential consequences if failure should occur, and those subject to higher
corrosion rates, localized corrosion, and high rates of damage from other mechanisms, will normally have more CMLs
and be monitored more frequently. The rate of corrosion/damage shall be determined from successive
measurements and the next inspection interval appropriately established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.2.3  Where thickness measurements are obtained at CMLs, the minimum thickness at a CML can be located by
ultrasonic measurements or radiography. Electromagnetic techniques also can be used to identify thin areas that may
then be measured by ultrasonic techniques or radiography. Additionally, when localized corrosion is expected or a
concern, it is important that examinations are conducted using scanning methods such as profile radiography,
scanning ultrasonic techniques, and/or other suitable NDE techniques that will reveal the scope and extent of
localized corrosion. When scanning with ultrasonics, scanning consists of taking several thickness measurements at
the CML searching for localized thinning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.2.4  The thinnest reading or an average of several measurement readings taken within the area of an
examination point shall be recorded and used to calculate the corrosion rates. If detailed thickness grids are needed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

location improves accuracy of the calculated damage rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.3 CML Selection and Placement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.3.1  A decision on the type, number, and location of the CMLs should consider results from previous inspections,
the patterns of corrosion and damage that are expected, and the potential consequence of loss of containment. CMLs
should be distributed appropriately over the vessel to provide adequate monitoring coverage of major components
and nozzles. Thickness measurements at CMLs are intended to establish general and localized corrosion rates in
different sections of the vessel. For pressure vessels susceptible to localized corrosion, corrosion specialists should
be consulted about the appropriate placement and number of CMLs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>More CMLs should be selected for pressure vessels with any of the following characteristics:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) higher potential for creating an immediate safety or environmental emergency in the event of a leak, unless the
internal corrosion rate is known to be relatively uniform and low;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) higher expected or experienced corrosion rates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,`,,``,`,```,`,`,,`,,,,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) higher potential for localized corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fewer CMLs can be selected for pressure vessels with any of the following three characteristics:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) low potential for creating a safety or environmental emergency in the event of a leak,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) relatively noncorrosive contents,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) generally uniform corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.3.2  CMLs may be eliminated or the number significantly reduced when the probability and/or consequence of
failure is low (e.g. clean noncorrosive hydrocarbon service). In circumstances where CMLs will be substantially
reduced or eliminated, a corrosion specialist should be consulted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>loss). Uniform corrosion may be difficult to detect visually, so thickness measurements are usually necessary to
determine its extent. Localized corrosion and pitted surfaces may be thinner than they appear visually, and when
there is uncertainty about the original surface location or depth of metal loss, thickness determinations may also be
necessary. Measurements may be obtained as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Any suitable NDE, such as ultrasonic or profile RT, may be used as long as it will provide minimum thickness
determinations. When a measurement method produces considerable uncertainty, other nondestructive thickness
measurement techniques, such as ultrasonic A-scan, B-scan, or C-scan, may be employed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The depth of corrosion may be determined by gauging from the uncorroded surfaces within the vessel when such
surfaces are in the vicinity of the corroded area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Ultrasonic thickness measuring instruments usually are the most accurate means for obtaining thickness
measurements. Proper repair of insulation and insulation weather coating following ultrasonic readings at CMLs is
recommended to reduce potential for CUI. Where practical, radiographic profile techniques, which do not require
removing insulation, may be considered as an alternative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.2.2  Ultrasonic scanning or radiographic profile techniques are preferred where corrosion is localized or the
remaining thickness is approaching the required thickness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7.2.3  Corrective procedures should be utilized when metal temperatures (typically above 150 °F [65 °C]) impact
the accuracy of the thickness measurements obtained. Instruments, couplants, and procedures should be used that
will result in accurate measurements at the higher temperatures. Typically, procedures will involve calibrating with hot
test plates or adjusting measurements by the appropriate temperature correction factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7.2.4  Inspectors and examiners should be aware of possible sources of measurement inaccuracies and make every
effort to eliminate their occurrence. As a general rule, each of the NDE techniques will have practical limits with respect
to accuracy. Factors that can contribute to reduced accuracy of ultrasonic measurements include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) improper instrument calibration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) external coatings or scale;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) excessive surface roughness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.3.1  When a code hydrostatic pressure test is required, the minimum test pressure should be in accordance with
the rules of the applicable code (construction code used to determine the MAWP). For this purpose, the minimum test
pressure for vessels that have been rerated using the design allowable stress published in the 1999 addendum or
later of ASME  Code ,   Section VIII, Division I, Code Case 2290, or Code Case 2278, is 130 % of MAWP and corrected
for temperature. The minimum test pressure for vessels rerated using the design allowable stress of ASME  Code ,
Section VIII, Division I, published prior to the 1999 addendum, is 150 % of MAWP and corrected for temperature. The
minimum test pressure for vessels designed using ASME  Code , Section VIII, Division I is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Test Pressure in psig (MPa) = 1.5 MAWP × ( S test  temp/ S design  temp), prior to 1999 addendum<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>S test  temp is the allowable stress at test temperature in ksi (MPa);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S design  temp is the allowable stress at design temperature in ksi (MPa).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.3.2  When a noncode related pressure test (leak/tightness test) is performed after repairs, the test pressure may
be conducted at pressures determined by the owner/user. Tightness test pressures are determined by the owner/user
but are generally not for the purpose of proving strength of repairs<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8.4 Pressure Test Preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.4.1  Before applying a pressure test, appropriate precautions and procedures should be taken to assure the
safety of personnel involved with the pressure test. A close visual inspection of pressure vessel components should
not be performed until the vessel pressure is at or below the MAWP. This review is especially important for in-service
pressure vessels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.4.2  When a pressure test is to be conducted in which the test pressure will exceed the set pressure of the
pressure-relieving device(s), the pressure-relieving device(s) should be removed. An alternative to removing the
pressure-relieving device(s) is to use test clamps to hold down the valve disks. Applying an additional load to the
valve spring by turning the compression screw is prohibited. Other appurtenances, such as gauge glasses, pressure
gauges, and rupture disks, that may be incapable of withstanding the test pressure should be removed or blanked off.
When the pressure test has been completed, pressure-relieving devices and appurtenances removed or made
inoperable during the pressure test shall be reinstalled or reactivated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8.5 Hydrostatic Pressure Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.5.1  Before applying a hydrostatic test, the supporting structures and foundation design should be reviewed to
assure they are suitable for the hydrostatic test load. All instruments and other components that might experience the
full hydrostatic test pressure should be checked to ensure that they are designed for the specified pressure test;
otherwise they must be blinded off from the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

water is not available or if immediate draining and drying is not possible, water having a very low chloride level (e.g.
steam condensate), higher pH (>10), and inhibitor addition should be considered to reduce the risk of pitting, chloride
stress corrosion cracking, and microbiologically induced corrosion. For sensitized austenitic stainless steel piping
subject to polythionic stress corrosion cracking, consideration should be given to using an alkaline-water solution for

<<PARAGRAPH>>Pneumatic testing (including combined hydropneumatic) may be used when hydrostatic testing is impracticable because
of limited supporting structure or foundation, refractory linings, or process reasons. When used, the potential personnel
and property risks of pneumatic testing shall be considered by an engineer before conducting the test. As a minimum,
the inspection precautions contained in the ASME  Code  shall be applied when performing any pneumatic test. A
pneumatic test procedure should be developed by the engineer following the steps outlined in ASME PCC-2, Article 5.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8.7 Test Temperature and Brittle Fracture Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.7.1  At ambient temperatures, carbon, low-alloy, and other ferritic steels may be susceptible to brittle failure. A
number of failures have been attributed to brittle fracture of steels that were exposed to temperatures below their
transition temperature and to pressures greater than 20 % of the required hydrostatic test pressure. Most brittle
fractures, however, have occurred on the first application of a high stress level (the first hydrostatic or overload). The
potential for a brittle failure shall be evaluated prior to hydrostatic or especially prior to pneumatic testing because or the
higher potential energy involved. Special attention should be given when testing low-alloy steels, especially 2  1 / 4  Cr-
1Mo, because they may be prone to temper embrittlement or any other metal that may be prone to embrittlement per the
damage mechanisms listed in API 571 or because of high triaxial stresses due to thickness or geometry considerations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.7.2  To minimize the risk of brittle fracture during a pressure test, the metal temperature should be maintained at
least 30 °F (17 °C) above the MDMT or MAT for vessels that are more than 2 in. (5 cm) thick and 10 °F (6 °C) above
the MDMT or MAT for vessels that have a thickness of 2 in. (5 cm) or less. The test temperature need not exceed
120 °F (50 °C) unless there is information on the brittle characteristics of the vessel material indicating a higher test
temperature is needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8.7.3  When hydrotesting solid or clad austenitic stainless steel, the water temperature should not exceed 120 °F
(50 °C) to prevent possible chloride stress corrosion cracking.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8.8 Pressure Testing Alternatives<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.8.1  Appropriate NDE (e.g. RT, UT, PT, MT, etc.) shall be specified and conducted when a pressure test is not
performed after a major repair or alteration. Substituting NDE procedures for a pressure test after an alteration or major
repair may be done only after the engineer and inspector have approved. In such cases, it is advisable to conduct a FFS
assessment to identify the critical flaw size(s) to specify the acceptance criteria for the specified NDE technique(s). Refer
to ASME PCC-2, Article 5.2 for guidance on NDE in lieu of pressure testing for repairs and alterations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8.8.2  For cases where manual UT is used to examine welds in lieu of pressure test, the owner/user shall specify
industry qualified angle beam examiners. For use of UT in lieu of RT, ASME Code Case 2235 or ASME  Code  Section
VIII, Division 2, 7.5.5 shall be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9 Material Verification and Traceability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.9.1  During repairs or alterations of pressure vessels, the inspector shall verify that all new materials (including
carbon steel as well as all alloys) are in compliance with the specifications. At the discretion of the owner/user or the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

extent of further verification will depend upon various factors including the consequences of failure and the probability
of further material errors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.10 Inspection of In-service Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.1  Inspection for weld quality is normally accomplished as a part of the requirements for new construction,
repairs, or alterations. However, welds and weld heat-affected zones are often inspected for corrosion and/or service-
induced cracking as part of the in-service inspections. When preferential weld corrosion or cracking is noted,
additional welds of the pressure vessel should be examined to determine the extent of damage. API 577 provides
additional guidance on weld inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.2  On occasion, radiographic profile and ultrasonic examinations may reveal what appears to be a flaw in an
existing weld. If crack-like flaws are detected while the pressure vessel is in operation, further inspection may be used
to assess the magnitude of the flaw. Additionally, an effort should be made to determine whether the crack-like flaws
are from original weld fabrication or caused by a service-related cracking mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.10.3  Crack-like flaws and environmental cracking shall be assessed by an engineer (refer to API 579-1/ASME
FFS-1, Part 9) and/or corrosion specialist. Preferential weld corrosion shall be assessed by the inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11 Inspection and Repair of Flanged Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.11.1  Flanged joints should be examined for evidence of leakage, such as stains, deposits, or drips. Process leaks
onto flange fasteners may result in corrosion or environmental cracking. This examination should include those
flanges enclosed with flange or splash-and-spray guards. Flanged joints that have been clamped and pumped with
sealant should be checked for leakage at the bolts. Fasteners subjected to such leakage may corrode or crack (e.g.
caustic cracking). If repumping is contemplated, considerations should be given to ultrasonic examination of the bolts
before repumping in order to assess their integrity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.11.2  Accessible flange faces should be examined for distortion and to determine the condition of gasket-seating
surfaces. Gasket-seating surfaces that are damaged and likely to result in a joint leak should be resurfaced prior to
being placed back in service. Special attention should be given to flange faces in high-temperature/high-pressure
hydroprocessing services that are prone to gasket leaks during start-up and on-stream. If flanges are excessively
bent or distorted, their markings and thicknesses should be checked against engineering requirements before taking
corrective action. Refer to ASME PCC-1, Appendix D for guidance on flange face evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.11.3  Flange fasteners should be examined visually for corrosion and thread engagement. Fasteners should be
fully engaged. Any fastener failing to do so is considered acceptably engaged if the lack of complete engagement is
not more than one thread.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.11.4  The markings on a representative sample of newly installed fasteners and gaskets should be examined to
determine whether they meet the material specification. The markings are identified in the applicable ASME and
ASTM standards. Questionable fasteners should be verified or renewed. If mismarked fasteners are located, they
should be brought to the attention of those involved in QA/QC of the vendor/supplier for corrective action, but may be
used if the proper specification is verified and the markings corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2.2  If both the ownership and the location of a vessel are changed, the vessel shall be internally and externally
inspected before it is reused. This inspection should include baseline examinations for any anticipated future
examinations planned as a result of the new service (e.g. if the vessel is going into a service where stress corrosion
cracking is a potential, then a baseline examination of weld cracking is advisable). Also, the allowable service
conditions and the inspection interval shall be established for the new service. The inspector should also assure that
adequate documentation (process safety information) for the vessel is on file.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2.3  In some cases (e.g. movement to a new location of ASME  Code , Section VIII, Division 2 vessels), a

may allow previously established inspection intervals to be exceeded from limits specified in 6.4 and 6.5 including the
10-year inspection and one-half remaining life limits for internal and on-stream inspections and the 5-year inspection
limit for the external inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2  When a RBI interval for the internal or on-stream inspection exceeds the 10-year limit, the RBI assessment

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4  RBI assessments should be in compliance with the recommended practices of API 580.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 External Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1  Unless justified by an RBI assessment, each aboveground vessel shall be given a visual external inspection at
an interval that does not exceed the lesser of five years or the required internal/on-stream inspection. It is preferred to
perform this inspection while the vessel is in operation. The interval is established by the inspector or engineer in
accordance with the owner/user’s QA system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.2  External inspection intervals for vessels in noncontinuous service are the same as for vessels in continuous
service because the external environment does not change during noncontinuous service. For equipment that is
retired and abandoned in place, the owner/user may need to conduct appropriate external inspections to make sure
that deterioration of insulation, vessel supports, and other pertinences do not deteriorate to the point where they
become a hazard to personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

inspection interval is within the maximum permitted as long as the projected MAWP of the limiting component is not
less than the lower of the nameplate or rerated MAWP plus applicable static head pressure. Unless an RBI
assessment is performed, the maximum inspection interval using this method is also 10 years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7) the vessel does not have a nonintegrally bonded liner such as strip lining or plate lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5.2.2  If the requirements of 6.5.2.1 b) are not met, the next inspection shall be an internal inspection. As an
alternate to the above limits, an on-stream inspection can be performed if an RBI assessment (per 6.3) determines
that risk associated with the vessel is acceptably low and the effectiveness of the external NDE technique(s) is
adequate for the expected damage mechanism. This assessment should include a review of past process conditions
and likely future process conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

pressure-relieving devices is determined by either the inspector, engineer, or other qualified individual per the owner/

date can be risk assessed and deferred for a specific period of time, where appropriate. A deferral procedure shall be
in place that defines a risk-based deferral process, including a corrective action plan and deferral date, plus
necessary approvals, if inspection of a piece of pressure equipment is to be deferred beyond the established interval.
That procedure should include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) concurrence with the appropriate pressure equipment personnel including the inspector and appropriate owner/
user management representative;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) any required operating controls needed to make the extended run;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) need for appropriate nonintrusive inspection with NDE, if any, as needed to justify the temporary extension; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) proper documentation of the deferral in the equipment records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Notwithstanding the above, an inspection or pressure relief device servicing interval may be deferred by the inspector,
without other approvals, based on a satisfactory review of the equipment history and appropriate risk analysis, when
the period of time for which the item is to be deferred does not exceed 10 % of the inspection/servicing interval or six
months, whichever is less.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For equipment with RBI intervals, the existing risk assessment should be updated to determine the change in risk that
may exist by not doing the originally planned inspection. A similar approval process used for equipment with non-RBI
intervals should be used to document the change in risk levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deferrals need to be completed and documented before the equipment is operated past the scheduled inspection
due date and owner/user management apprised of the increased risk (if any) of temporarily operating past the
scheduled inspection due date. Pressure equipment operated beyond the inspection due date without a documented
and approved deferral is not permitted by this code. The deferral of scheduled inspections should be the occasional
exception not a frequent occurrence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

documented in the inspection records and have the concurrence with the appropriate pressure equipment inspection
personnel including the inspector and the inspection supervisor. Inspection recommendations that have not been
completed by the required due date without a documented and approved change of date are not permitted by this
code and are considered overdue for completion. The deferral of inspection recommendations should be the
occasional exception not a frequent occurrence. Equipment must remain within the limits of the minimum required
thickness as determined in this code or by other engineering evaluation during the period of deferral.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.9 Review of Inspection Repair Recommendations<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.1 Existing Pressure Vessels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1.1.1  Corrosion rate for thinning damage mechanisms is determined by the difference between two thickness
readings divided by the time interval between the readings. The determination of corrosion rate may include thickness
data collected at more than two different times. Suitable use of short-term versus long-term corrosion rates shall be
determined by the inspector. Short-term corrosion rates are typically determined by the two most recent thickness
readings whereas long-term rates use the most recent reading and one taken earlier in the life of the equipment.
These different rates help identify recent corrosion mechanisms from those acting over the long-term. The long-term
(LT) corrosion rate shall be calculated from the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 FFS Analysis of Corroded Regions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The actual thickness and maximum corrosion rate for any part of a vessel can be adjusted at any inspection
considering the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.2 Evaluation of Locally Thinned Areas<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.2.1  For a corroded area of considerable size the wall thicknesses may be averaged over a length not exceeding
the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,`,,``,`,```,`,`,,`,,,,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— for vessels with inside diameters less than or equal to 60 in. (150 cm), one-half the vessel diameter or 20 in.
(50 cm), whichever is less;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— for vessels with inside diameters greater than 60 in. (150 cm), one-third the vessel diameter or 40 in. (100 cm),
whichever is less.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.2.2  Along the designated length, the thickness readings should be equally spaced. For areas of considerable
size, multiple lines in the corroded area may have to be evaluated to determine which length has the lowest average
thickness. The following criteria must be met in order to use thickness averaging:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the region of metal loss has relatively smooth contours without notches (i.e. negligible local stress
concentrations),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the equipment does not operate in the creep range,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the component is not in cyclic service,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— a minimum of 15 thickness readings should be included in the data set,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— minimum reading must be included in the thickness average;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— lowest individual reading cannot be less than 50 % of   t required .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.2.3  If circumferential stresses govern (typical for most vessels), the thickness readings are taken along a
longitudinal length. If longitudinal stresses govern (because of wind loads, saddle support in horizontal vessels, or
other factors), the thickness readings are taken along a circumferential length (an arc).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.2.4  When performing thickness averaging near structural discontinuities (e.g. a nozzle, conical section
transition, and flange connection), the limits for thickness averaging shall be considered separately for the
reinforcement window area (or other area of high local stress) and the area outside/adjacent to the reinforcement
window (or other area of high local stress).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When performing thickness averaging near a nozzle, the designated length shall not extend within the limits of the
reinforcement as defined in the construction code. Consideration shall be given to any extra reinforcement
included in the nozzle reinforcement design (e.g. a larger extended reinforcing pad diameter to address piping
load considerations or wind loads).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Technical considerations for thickness averaging within the reinforcement window for structural discontinuities are
provided in API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.2.5  When performing remaining life calculations in 7.2, the lowest average of any length in the corroded area is
substituted for tactual.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.3 Evaluation of Pitting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the current inspection, widely scattered pits may be ignored as long as all of the following are true:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the remaining thickness below the pit is greater than one-half the required thickness ( 1 / 2   t required ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the total area of the pitting that is deeper than the corrosion allowance does not exceed 7 in. 2  (45 cm 2 ) within any
8-in. (20-cm) diameter circle,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the sum of the pit dimensions that is deeper than the corrosion allowance along any straight 8-in. (20-cm) line
does not exceed 2 in. (5 cm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 6 may be used to evaluate different pit growth modes, estimate pitting propagation
rates, and evaluate the potential problems with pitting remediation versus component replacement. The maximum pit
depth and the extent of pitting are related in the API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Level 1 assessment pitting charts, which
may be used to evaluate the extent of pitting allowed before the next inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.4 Alternative Evaluation Methods for Thinning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.4.1  An alternative to the procedures in 7.4.2 and 7.4.3, components with thinning below the required thickness
may be evaluated by employing the design by analysis methods of either ASME  Code , Section VIII, Division 2,
Appendix 4 or API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Annex B-1. These methods may also be used to evaluate blend ground areas
where defects have been removed. It is important to ensure that there are no sharp corners in blend ground areas to
minimize stress concentration effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.4.2  When using ASME  Code , Section VIII, Division 2, Appendix 4, the stress value used in the original pressure
vessel design shall be substituted for the maximum allowable stress (Sm) value of Division 2 if the design stress is
less than or equal to two-thirds specified minimum yield strength at temperature. If the original design stress is greater
than two-thirds specified minimum yield strength at temperature, then two-thirds specified minimum yield strength
shall be substituted for Sm. When this approach is to be used, an engineer shall perform this analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.5 Joint Efficiency Adjustments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the vessel surface away from a weld is corroded and the joint efficiency is less than 1.0, an independent
calculation using the appropriate weld joint factor (typically 1.0) can be made. For this calculation, the surface at a
weld includes 1 in. (2.5 cm) on either side of the weld (measured from the toe) or twice the required thickness on
either side of the weld, whichever is greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.6 Corroded Areas in Vessel Heads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.6.1  The required thickness at corroded areas of ellipsoidal and torispherical heads can be determined as follows.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) In the knuckle region of the head, use the appropriate head formula in the construction code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) In the central portion of the head, use the hemispherical head formula in the construction code. The central portion
of the head is defined as the center of the head with a diameter equal to 80 % of the shell diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.6.2  For torispherical heads, the radius to use in the hemispherical head formula is the crown radius (equal to the
outside diameter of the shell for standard torispherical heads, though other radii have been permitted).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4.6.3  For ellipsoidal heads, the radius to use in the hemispherical head formula shall be the equivalent spherical
radius  K 1   ×   D , where  D  is the shell diameter (equal to the inside diameter) and  K 1  is given in Table 7.1. In Table 7.1,  h
is one-half the length of the minor axis (equal to the inside depth of the ellipsoidal head measured from the tangent
line). For many ellipsoidal heads,  D /2 h  = 2.0 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Required Thickness Determination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The required thickness shall be based on pressure, mechanical, and structural considerations using the appropriate
design formulae and code allowable stress. For services with high potential consequences if failure were to occur, the
engineer should consider increasing the required thickness above the calculated minimum thickness to provide for
unanticipated or unknown loadings, undiscovered metal loss, or resistance to normal abuse.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7 Evaluation of Existing Equipment with Minimal Documentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For pressure vessels that have no nameplate and minimal or no design and construction documentation, the
following steps may be used to verify operating integrity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Perform inspection to determine condition of the vessel including a complete dimensional checking of all
components necessary to determine the minimum required thickness and adequacy of the design of the vessel
[i.e. heads, shell(s), transitions, openings, reinforcement pads, saddle supports, etc.].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Define design parameters and prepare drawings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Perform design calculations based on applicable codes and standards. Do not use allowable stress values of
the current ASME  Code  (based on design factor of 3.5) for vessels designed to an edition or addendum of the
ASME  Code  earlier than the 1999 addendum and was not designed to ASME Code Case 2290 or ASME Code
Case 2278. For vessels designed to an edition or addendum of the ASME  Code  earlier than the 1999
addendum and were not designed to ASME Code Case 2290 or ASME Code Case 2278, use allowable stress
values of the pre-1999 ASME  Code  (based on design factor of 4.0 or 5.0). See ASME  Code , Section VIII,
Division 1, Paragraph UG-10(c) for guidance on evaluation of unidentified materials. If UG-10(c) is not followed,
then for carbon steels, use allowable stresses for SA-283 Grade C and for alloy and nonferrous materials, use
X-ray fluorescence analysis to determine material type on which to base allowable stress values. When the
extent of radiography originally performed is not known, use joint efficiency of 0.7 for Type No. (1) and 0.65 for
Type No. (2) butt welds and 0.85 for seamless shells, heads, and nozzles or consider performing radiography if
a higher joint efficiency is needed. (Recognize that performing radiography on welds in a vessel with minimal or
no design and construction documentation may result in the need for a FFS evaluation and significant repairs.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) Attach a nameplate or stamping showing the MAWP and temperature, MAT, and date.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,`,,``,`,```,`,`,,`,,,,,`,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.8 Reports and Records<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.1  Pressure vessel owners and users shall maintain permanent and progressive records of their pressure
vessels and pressure-relieving devices. Permanent records will be maintained throughout the service life of each
equipment item; progressive records will be regularly updated to include new information pertinent to the inspection
and maintenance history of the vessel and pressure relief devices, as well as operating information that may affect
equipment integrity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.8.2  Pressure vessel and pressure-relieving device records shall contain four types of information pertinent to
mechanical integrity. Those four types and some examples of useful records in each include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Construction and design information. For example, equipment serial number or other identifier, manufacturer’s
data reports, fabrication drawings, U-1 or other construction certification forms, nameplate photos/rubbings, heat

<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.2 Authorization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All repair and alteration work shall be authorized by the inspector before the work is started by a repair organization.
Authorization for alterations to pressure vessels that comply with ASME  Code , Section VIII, Divisions 1 and 2 and for
repairs to pressure vessels that comply with ASME  Code , Section VIII, Division 2 may not be given until an engineer
has also authorized the work. The inspector will designate the hold points that are required for repairs and alterations.
The inspector may give prior general authorization for limited or routine repairs on a specific vessel provided the
inspector is satisfied with the competency of the repair organization and the repairs are the kind that will not require a
pressure test [e.g. weld overlay of corrosion on a vessel that does not require postweld heat treatment (PWHT)].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.3 Approval<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.3.1  Before any repairs or alterations are performed, all proposed methods of design, execution, materials,
welding procedures, NDE, and testing shall be approved by the inspector or engineer. For alterations, major repairs,
and temporary repairs, approval by both the inspector and engineer is required. The inspector may establish hold
points to be implemented during the work execution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

applicable construction code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.8.3  New welds, as part of a repair or alteration in a pressure vessel that were originally required to be
radiographed (e.g. circumferential and longitudinal welds) by the construction code, shall be radiographically
examined in accordance with the construction code. In situations where it is not practical to perform radiography, the
accessible surfaces of each nonradiographed new weld shall be fully examined using UT in lieu of RT and/or other
appropriate NDE techniques to determine that no defects exist. UT in lieu of RT shall follow ASME Code Case 2235
or ASME  Code ,   Section VIII, Division 2, 7.5.5. If other techniques are used rather than the UT in lieu of RT, the joint
efficiency should be reduced to the value corresponding to no radiography. Where use of NDE techniques specified
by the construction code is not possible or practical, alternative NDE techniques may be used provided they are
approved by the engineer and inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.8.4  Acceptance criteria for welded repairs or alterations should be in accordance with the applicable sections of
the ASME  Code  or another applicable vessel rating code.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.9 Weld Inspection for Vessels Subject to Brittle Fracture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For vessels constructed of materials that may be subject to brittle fracture (per API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 3, or other
analysis) from either normal or abnormal service (including start-up, shutdown, and pressure testing), appropriate
inspection should be considered after welded repairs or alterations. Flaws, notches, or other stress risers could initiate a
brittle fracture in subsequent pressure testing or service. MT and other effective surface NDE methods should be
considered. Inspection techniques should be selected to detect critical flaws as determined by a FFS assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Rerating<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.1  Rerating a pressure vessel by changing its design temperature, minimum metal design temperature, or its
MAWP may be done only after all of the following requirements have been met.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Calculations performed by either the manufacturer or an owner/user engineer (or his/her designated
representative) experienced in pressure vessel design, fabrication, or inspection shall justify rerating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) A rerating shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of the vessel’s construction code. Alternately,
calculations can be made using the appropriate formulas in the latest edition of the applicable construction code
provided all of the vessel’s essential details comply with the applicable requirements of the ASME  Code . If the
vessel was designed to an edition or addendum of the ASME  Code  earlier than the 1999 addendum and was not
designed to ASME Code Case 2290 or ASME Code Case 2278, it may be rerated to the latest edition/addendum
of the ASME  Code  if permitted by Figure 8.1. Notice that for vessels built to a code earlier than 1968 the original
design allowable stress (based on design factor of 4.0 or 5.0) shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 Scope and Specific Exemptions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.1.1  This section sets forth the minimum alternative inspection rules for pressure vessels that are exempt from the
rules set forth in Section 6 except as referenced in 9.4 and 9.5. Owner/users may choose to use Section 6 instead of
this section for inspection of pressure vessels. Except for Section 6, all of the sections in this inspection code are
applicable to E&P pressure vessels. These rules are provided because of the vastly different characteristics and
needs of pressure vessels used for E&P service. Typical E&P services are vessels associated with drilling,
production, gathering, transportation, and treatment of liquid petroleum, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and
associated salt water (brine).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1.2  The following are specific exemptions.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Portable pressure vessels and portable compressed gas containers associated with construction machinery, pile
drivers, drilling rigs, well-servicing rigs and equipment, compressors, trucks, ships, boats, and barges shall be
treated, for inspection and recording purposes, as a part of that machinery and shall be subject to prevailing rules
and regulations applicable to that specific type of machine or container.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Pressure vessels referenced in Annex A are exempt from the specific requirements of this inspection code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.4 External Inspections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following apply to external inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The external visual inspection shall, at least, determine the condition of the shell, heads, nozzles, exterior
insulation, supports and structural parts, pressure-relieving devices, allowance for expansion, and general
alignment of the vessel on its supports. Any signs of leakage should be investigated so that the sources can be
established. It is not necessary to remove insulation if the entire vessel shell is maintained at a temperature
sufficiently low or sufficiently high to prevent the condensation of moisture. Refer to API 572 for guidelines on
external vessel inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Buried sections of vessels shall be monitored to determine their external environmental condition. This monitoring
shall be done at intervals that shall be established based on corrosion rate information obtained during
maintenance activity on adjacent connected piping of similar material, information from the interval examination of
similarly buried corrosion test coupons of similar material, information from representative portions of the actual
vessel, or information from a sample vessel in similar circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Vessels that are known to have a remaining life of over 10 years or that are protected against external corrosion—
for example,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) vessels insulated effectively to preclude the entrance of moisture;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) jacketed cryogenic vessels;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) vessels installed in a cold box in which the atmosphere is purged with an inert gas; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) vessels in which the temperature being maintained is sufficiently low or sufficiently high to preclude the
presence of water do not need to have insulation removed for the external inspection; however, the condition of
their insulating system or their outer jacketing, such as the cold box shell, shall be observed at least every five
years and repaired if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.5.3 Risk Classification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following apply to inspection intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Inspections shall be performed at intervals determined by the vessel’s risk classification. The inspection intervals
for the two main risk classifications (lower and higher) are defined below. When additional classes are established,
inspection and sampling intervals shall be set between the higher risk and lower risk classes as determined by the
owner or user. If the owner or user decides to not classify vessels into risk classes, the inspection requirements
and intervals of higher-risk vessels shall be followed. If the owner or user decides to use RBI, then the interval,
extent, and methods of inspection shall be determined by the RBI analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Lower-risk vessels shall be inspected as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Inspections on a representative sample of vessels in that class, or all vessels in that class, may be performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) External inspections shall be performed when an on-stream or internal inspection is performed or at shorter
intervals at the owner or user’s option.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) On-stream or internal inspections shall be performed at least every 15 years or three-fourths remaining
corrosion rate life, whichever is less.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) Any signs of leakage or deterioration detected in the interval between inspections shall require an on-stream or
internal inspection of that vessel and a reevaluation of the inspection interval for that vessel class.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Higher-risk vessels shall be inspected as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) External inspections shall be performed when an on-stream or internal inspection is performed or at shorter
intervals at the owner or user’s option.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) On-stream or internal inspections shall be performed at least every 10 years or one-half remaining corrosion
rate life, whichever is less.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) In cases where the remaining life is estimated to be less than four years, the inspection interval may be the full
remaining life up to a maximum of two years. Consideration should also be given to increasing the number of
vessels inspected within that class to improve the likelihood of detecting the worst-case corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4) Any signs of leakage or deterioration detected in the interval between inspections shall require an on-stream or
internal inspection of that vessel and a reevaluation of the inspection interval for that vessel class.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Pressure vessels (whether grouped into classes or not) shall be inspected at intervals sufficient to insure their
fitness for continued service. Operational conditions and vessel integrity may require inspections at shorter
intervals than the intervals stated above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) If service conditions change, the maximum operating temperature, pressure, and interval between inspections
shall be reevaluated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
For large vessels with two or more zones of differing corrosion rates, each zone may be treated independently
regarding the interval between inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.6 Additional Inspection Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Additional inspection requirements, regardless of vessel classification, exist for the following vessels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Vessels that have changed ownership and location shall have an on-stream or internal inspection performed to
establish the next inspection interval and to assure that the vessel is suitable for its intended service. Inspection of
new vessels is not required if a manufacturer’s data report is available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) If a vessel is transferred to a new location, and it has been more than five years since the vessel’s last inspection,
an on-stream or internal inspection is required. (Vessels in truck-mounted, skid-mounted, ship-mounted, or barge-
mounted equipment are not included.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Air receivers (other than portable equipment) shall be inspected at least every five years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Portable or temporary pressure vessels that are employed for the purpose of testing oil and gas wells during
completion or recompletion shall be inspected at least once during each three-year period of use. More frequent
inspections shall be conducted if vessels have been in severe corrosive environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4 Pressure Test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a pressure test is conducted, the test shall be in accordance with the procedures in 5.8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5 Safety Relief Devices<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety relief devices shall be inspected, tested, and repaired in accordance with 6.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6 Records<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following records requirements apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Pressure vessel owners and users shall maintain pressure vessel records. The preferred method of
recordkeeping is to maintain data by individual vessel. Where vessels are grouped into classes, data may be
maintained by vessel class. When inspections, repairs, or alterations are made on an individual vessel, specific
data shall be recorded for that vessel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Examples of information that may be maintained are vessel identification numbers; safety relief device
information; and the forms on which results of inspections, repairs, alterations, or reratings are to be recorded. Any
appropriate forms may be used to record these results. A sample pressure vessel inspection record is shown in
Annex C. A sample alteration or rerating of pressure vessel form is shown in Annex D. Information on
maintenance activities and events that affect vessel integrity should be included in the vessel records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Technical Inquiries<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API will consider written requests for interpretations of API 510. API staff will make such interpretations in writing after
consultation, if necessary, with the appropriate committee officers and the committee membership. The API
committee responsible for maintaining API 510 meets regularly to consider written requests for interpretations and
revisions and to develop new criteria as dictated by technological development. The committee’s activities in this
regard are limited strictly to interpretations of the standard or to the consideration of revisions to the present standard
on the basis of new data or technology. As a matter of policy, API does not approve, certify, rate, or endorse any item,
construction, proprietary device, or activity; thus, accordingly, inquiries requiring such consideration will be returned.
Moreover, API does not act as a consultant on specific engineering problems or on the general understanding or
application of the rules. If, based on the inquiry information submitted, it is the opinion of the committee that the
inquirer should seek assistance, the inquiry will be returned with the recommendation that such assistance be
obtained. All inquiries that cannot be understood because they lack information will be returned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2 Inquiry Format<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inquiries shall be limited strictly to requests for interpretation of the standard or to the consideration of revisions to the
standard on the basis of new data or technology. Inquiries shall be submitted in the following format.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Scope —The inquiry shall involve a single subject or closely related subjects. An inquiry letter concerning
unrelated subjects will be returned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Background —The inquiry letter shall state the purpose of the inquiry, which shall be either to obtain an
interpretation of the standard or to propose consideration of a revision to the standard. The letter shall provide
concisely the information needed for complete understanding of the inquiry (with sketches, as necessary). This
information shall include reference to the applicable edition, revision, paragraphs, figures, and tables.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  Inquiry —The inquiry shall be stated in a condensed and precise question format. Superfluous background
information shall be omitted from the inquiry, and where appropriate, the inquiry shall be composed so that “yes”
or “no” (perhaps with provisos) would be a suitable reply. This inquiry statement should be technically and
editorially correct. The inquirer shall state what he/she believes the standard requires. If in his/her opinion a
revision to the standard is needed, he/she shall provide recommended wording. The inquiry should be typed;
however, legible handwritten inquiries will be considered. The name and the mailing address of the inquirer must
be included with the proposal. The proposal shall be submitted to the following address: Director of the Standards
Department, American Petroleum Institute, 1220 L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005-4070, or via e-mail to
standards@api.org.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
