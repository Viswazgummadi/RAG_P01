<<HEADING level=3>>General
4.1.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping can be made from any material that can be rolled and welded, cast, or drawn through dies to form a
tubular section. The two most common carbon steel piping materials used in the petrochemical industry are
ASTM A53/A53M and ASTM A106. The industry uses both seamless and electric resistance welded (ERW)
piping for process services, depending upon current economics and the potential for accelerated corrosion of
the weld seam in the service. Piping of a nominal size larger than 16 in. (406 mm) is usually made by rolling<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_20>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
13<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>plates to size and welding the seams. Centrifugally cast piping can be cast then machined to any desired
thickness. Steel and alloy piping are manufactured to standard dimensions in nominal pipe sizes (NPSs) up to
48 in. (1219 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipe wall thicknesses are designated as pipe schedules in NPSs up to 36 in. (914 mm). The traditional
thickness designations—standard weight, extra strong, and double extra strong—differ from schedules and
are used for NPSs up to 48 in. (1219 mm). In all standard sizes, the outside diameter (OD) remains nearly
constant regardless of the thickness. The size refers to the approximate inside diameter (ID) of standard
weight pipe for NPSs equal to or less than 12 in. (305 mm). The size denotes the actual OD for NPSs equal to
or greater than 14 in. (356 mm). The pipe diameter is expressed as NPS, which is based on these size
practices. Table 1 and Table 2 list the dimensions of ferritic and stainless steel pipe from NPS  1 / 8  [DN
(nominal diameter) 6] up through NPS 24 (DN 600). See ASME B36.10M for the dimensions of welded and
seamless wrought steel piping and ASME B36.19M for the dimensions of stainless steel piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Allowable tolerances in pipe diameter differ from one piping material to another. Table 3 lists the acceptable
tolerances for diameter and thickness of most ASTM ferritic pipe standards. The actual thickness of seamless
piping can vary from its nominal thickness by a manufacturing tolerance of as much as 12.5 %. The under
tolerance for welded piping is 0.01 in. (0.25 mm). Cast piping has a thickness tolerance of + 1 / 16  in. (1.6 mm)
and –0 in. (0 mm), as specified in ASTM A53/A53M. Consult the ASTM or the equivalent ASME material
specification to determine what tolerances are permitted for a specific material. Piping that has ends that are
beveled or threaded with standard pipe threads can be obtained in various lengths. Piping can be obtained in
different strength levels depending on the grades of material, including alloying material and the heat
treatments specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cast iron piping is generally used for nonhazardous service, such as water; it is generally not recommended
for pressurized hydrocarbon service because of its brittle nature. The standards and sizes for cast iron piping
differ from those for welded and seamless piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>FRP Pipe
4.1.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nonmetallic materials also have some limited uses in piping systems in the hydrocarbon process industry.
They have significant advantages over more familiar metallic materials, but they also have unique
construction and deterioration mechanisms that can lead to premature failures if not addressed adequately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The term nonmetallic has a broad definition but in this section refers to the fiber reinforced plastic groups
encompassed by the generic acronym FRP and GRP (glass reinforced plastic). The extruded, generally
homogenous nonmetallics, such as high- and low-density polyethylene, are excluded from coverage in this
document but are also used in some utility and specialty services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical service applications of FRP piping include service water, process water, cooling medium, potable
water, sewage/gray water, nonhazardous waste, nonhazardous drains, nonhazardous vents, chemicals,
firewater ring mains, firewater deluge systems, and produced and ballast water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Design of these piping systems is largely dependent on the application. Many companies have developed
their own specifications that outline the materials, quality, fabrication requirements, and design factors. ASME
B31.3, Chapter VII covers design requirements for nonmetallic piping. American Water Works Association
(AWWA) is an organization that also provides guidance on FRP pipe design and testing. These codes and
standards, however, do not offer guidance as to the right choice of corrosion barriers, resins, fabricating
methods, and joint systems for a particular application. The user should consider other sources such as resin
and pipe manufacturers for guidance on their particular application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Historically, many of the failures in FRP piping are related to poor construction practice. Lack of familiarity with
the materials can lead to a failure to recognize the detail of care that must be applied in construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FRP materials require some understanding as to their manufacture. Each manufacturing technique will
generate a different set of physical properties. Each resin system has a temperature limitation, and each joint
system has its advantages and disadvantages. Qualification of bonders and jointers is as important for FRP
fabrication as qualification of welders is for metal fabrication. Due to limitations in NDE methods, the
emphasis must be placed on procedure and bonder qualifications and testing. Similarly, because the material
stiffness is much less than metal and because FRP has different types of shear, small-bore connections will
not withstand the same shear stress, weight loadings, or vibrations that are common with metallic piping;
supporting attachments such as valves, etc. on small-bore connections should be analyzed in detail.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FRP piping is manufactured in many ways. Every service application should be reviewed for proper resin,
catalyst, corrosion barrier (liner) composition, and structural integrity. Although FRP is considered to be
corrosion resistant, using the wrong resin or corrosion barrier can be a cause for premature failure. FRP pipe
can experience ultraviolet (UV) degradation over time if not adequately protected. Adding a UV inhibitor in the
resin will help prevent premature fiber blooming caused by UV. The user should consider this option for all
FRP piping applications and be aware that this would be a supplemental specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All FRP piping should be inspected by a person that is knowledgeable in the curing, fabrication, and quality of
FRP materials. The level of inspection should be determined by the user. ASME RTP-1, Table 6-1 can be
used as a guide to identify liner and structure imperfections that are common in FRP laminates. Standardized
FRP piping systems commonly called “commodity piping” are manufactured for a variety of services and are
sold as products with a predetermined design, resin, corrosion barrier, and structure. The piping
manufacturers typically have a quality control specification that identifies the level of quality and allowable
tolerance that is built into their product. Custom fabricated pipe is typically designed and manufactured for a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>SBP can be used as primary process piping or as nipples, secondary piping, and auxiliary piping. Nipples are
normally 6 in. (152 mm) or less in length and are most often used in vents at piping high points and drains at
piping low points and used to connect secondary/auxiliary piping. Secondary piping is normally isolated from
the main process lines by closed valves and can be used for such functions as sample taps. Auxiliary piping is
normally open to service but can be isolated from the primary process. Examples include flush lines,
instrument piping, analyzer piping, lubrication, and seal oil piping for rotating equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors and piping engineers should be aware of design, maintenance, and operating issues that cause
SBP failures and may require mitigation. Those issues include but are not limited to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— mismatched union connections from differing manufacturers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the potential for thermal growth or contraction that could cause SBP stresses that may lead to failure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— cyclic loading from thermal or mechanical loads that could cause fatigue cracking (e.g. overhung SBP<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>piping systems, potential for PRV chattering in certain relief scenarios, flow induced vibration,
vaporization, and cavitation);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— inadequate management of change (MOC) consideration that may cause unanticipated thermal,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>mechanical, or corrosive scenarios on SBP;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— inadequate design (e.g. support and pipe schedule) for the various unanticipated transient loads imposed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>on SBP;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— inadequate protection from external impacts (e.g. vehicular traffic and maintenance activities);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— inadequate protection or support for SBP that could be subject to being used as personnel or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>tool/equipment support (e.g. step, tie-off, hand rail, pulley, lever );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— improperly selected components for the class of service;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— inadequate consideration for the use of socket weld versus threaded fittings, both of which can lead to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>premature failure if not specified and/or installed properly;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— inadequate thickness for threaded SBP after accounting for the loss of thickness from thread cutting or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>lack of bottom gap when welding socket welded fittings,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— not including alloy SBP in positive material identification (PMI) procedures;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— not including SBP in piping damage mechanism reviews;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— replacement of SBP components with different alloys without adequate consideration for potential new<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>damage mechanisms (e.g. “upgrading” to stainless steel in a wet chloride environment).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Pipe Linings
4.1.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal linings can be incorporated into piping design to reduce corrosion, erosion, product contamination,
and pipe metal temperatures. The linings can generally be characterized as metallic and nonmetallic. Metallic
liners are installed in various ways, such as cladding, weld overlay, and strip lining. Clad pipe has a metallic
liner that is an integral part of the plate material rolled or explosion bonded before fabrication of the pipe. They
may instead be separate strips of metal fastened to the pipe by welding referred to strip lining.
Corrosion-resistant metal can also be applied to the pipe surfaces by various weld overlay processes. Metallic
liners can be made of any metal resistant to the corrosive or erosive environment, depending upon its purpose.
These include stainless steels, high alloys, cobalt-based alloys, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nonmetallic liners can be used to resist corrosion and erosion or to insulate and reduce the temperature on
the pipe wall. Some common nonmetallic lining materials for piping are concrete, castable refractory, plastic,
and thin-film coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2
Tubing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With the exception of heater, boiler, and exchanger tubes, tubing is similar to piping, but is manufactured in
many ODs and wall thicknesses. Tubing is generally seamless, but can be welded. Its stated size is the actual
OD rather than NPS. [ASTM B88 tubing, which is often used for steam tracing, is an exception in that its size
designation is  1 / 8  in. (3.2 mm) less than the actual OD.] Tubing is usually made in small diameters and is mainly
used for heat exchangers, instrument piping, lubricating oil services, steam tracing, and similar services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A commonly used tubing material is the 18Cr-8Ni family of stainless steels, such as Types 304 and 316.
However, it should be noted that even though these tubing materials may be resistant to many chemical fluids,
they are susceptible to pitting and chloride stress corrosion cracking (CSCC) if:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) there is a presence of chlorides that may come from insulation, PVC insulation cladding/jacketing, the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>atmosphere, rain (especially in marine environments), deluge water systems, washdown of surrounding
decks and roads, etc. Internally, chlorides can be common in many process streams and may, in fact, be
introduced by hydrotest water. Concentration mechanisms such as local evaporation of water can also
increase susceptibility to cracking;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) there is a presence of water. Sources are similar to chlorides above. Often the chlorides are dissolved in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>various water sources;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) exposed to a temperature above about 140 °F (60 °C);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE It should be noted that chloride pitting and CSCC can occur at temperatures below 140 °F in some instances,
such as low pH environments, or in components with high residual stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) there is tubing material stress, which is common from residual stresses imparted during tube manufacturing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>processes or during installation processes like tube bending and compression fitting makeup.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubing failures due to CSCC and/or pitting can be too unpredictable to manage through inspection efforts;
therefore, a materials or corrosion specialist/engineer should be consulted for alloy recommendations used in
aggressive environments. Consideration should be given to using materials like Incoloy 825 (for many
elevated temperature refining applications), Hastelloy C276 (for sour water or hot hydrofluoric acid [HF]
services where oxidizing species are present), and Alloy 20Cb3 (for sulfuric acid applications) or other
available high alloys because of their improved resistance to CSCC and/or pitting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3
Valves<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
4.3.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basic types of valves are gate, globe, plug, ball, diaphragm, butterfly, check, and slide valves. Valves are
made in standard pipe sizes, materials, body thickness, and pressure ratings that permit them to be used in
any pressure-temperature service in accordance with ASME B16.34 or API 599, API 600, API 602, API 603,
API 608, or API 609, as applicable. Valve bodies can be cast, forged, machined from bar stock, or fabricated<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_31>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>24
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>by welding a combination of two or more materials. The seating surfaces in the body can be integral with the
body, or they can be made as inserts. The insert material can be the same as or different from the body
material. When special nonmetallic material that could fail in a fire is used to prevent seat leakage,
metal-to-metal backup seating surfaces can be provided. Other parts of the valve trim can be made of any
suitable material and can be cast, formed, forged, or machined from commercial rolled shapes. Valve ends
can be flanged, threaded for threaded connections, recessed for socket welding, or beveled for butt-welding.
Although many valves are manually operated, they can be equipped with electric motors and gear operators
or other power operators to accommodate a large size or inaccessible location or to permit actuation by
instruments. Body thicknesses and other design data are given in API 594, API 599, API 600, API 602, API
603, API 608, API 609, and ASME B16.34.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Gate Valves
4.3.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A gate valve consists of a body that contains a gate that interrupts flow. This type of valve is normally used in
a fully open or fully closed position and as such is often called a “block valve,” since it is not generally
designed for regulating fluid flow. Gate valves larger than 2 in. (51 mm) usually have port openings that are
approximately the same size as the valve end openings—this type of valve is called a full-ported valve.
Figure 1 shows a cross section of a full-ported wedge gate valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reduced port gate valves are also very common and have port openings that are smaller than the end openings.
Reduced port valves should not be used as block valves associated with pressure-relief devices (PRDs) or in
erosive applications, such as slurries, or lines that are to be “pigged.”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Globe Valves
4.3.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A globe valve, which is commonly used to regulate fluid flow, consists of a valve body that contains a circular
disc that moves parallel to the disc axis and contacts the seat. The stream flows upward generally, except for
vacuum service or when required by system design (e.g. fail closed), through the seat area against the disc,
and then changes direction to flow through the body to the outlet disc. The seating surface can be flat or
tapered. For fine-throttling service, a very steep tapered seat can be used; this particular type of globe valve is
referred to as a needle valve. A globe valve is commonly constructed with its inlet and outlet in line and with its
port opening at right angles to the inlet and outlet. Figure 2 illustrates a cross section of a globe valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Plug Valves
4.3.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A plug valve consists of a tapered or cylindrical plug fitted snugly into a correspondingly shaped seat in the
valve body. Plug valves usually function as block valves to close off flow. When the valve is open, an opening
in the plug is in line with the flow openings in the valve body. The valve is closed by turning the plug
one-quarter turn so that its opening is at right angles to the openings in the valve body. Plug valves can be
operated by a gear-operated device or by turning a wrench on the stem. Plug valves are either lubricated or
nonlubricated; Figure 3 illustrates both types. Lubricated plug valves use a grease-like lubricant that is
pumped into the valve through grooves in the body and plug surfaces to provide sealing for the valve and
promote ease of operation. Nonlubricated plug valves on the other hand use as sealing elements metal seats
or nonmetallic sleeves, seats, or complete or partial linings or coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Ball Valves
4.3.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A ball valve is another one-quarter turn valve similar to a plug valve except that the plug in a ball valve is
spherical instead of tapered or cylindrical. Ball valves usually function as block valves to close off flow. They
are well suited for conditions that require quick on/off or bubble-tight service. A ball valve is typically equipped
with an elastomeric seating material that provides good shutoff characteristics; however, all-metal,
high-pressure ball valves are available. Figure 4 illustrates a ball valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Diaphragm Valves
4.3.6<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A diaphragm valve is a packless valve that contains a diaphragm made of a flexible material that functions as
both a closure and a seal. When the valve spindle is screwed down, it forces the flexible diaphragm against a
seat, or dam, in the valve body and blocks the flow of fluid. These valves are not used extensively in the
petrochemical industry, but they do have application in corrosive services below approximately 250 °F
(121 °C), where a leak tight valve is needed. Figure 5 illustrates a diaphragm valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Butterfly Valves
4.3.7<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A butterfly valve consists of a disc mounted on a stem in the flow path within the valve body. The body is usually
flanged and of the lug or wafer type. A one-quarter turn of the stem changes the valve from fully closed to
completely open. Butterfly valves are most often used in low-pressure service for coarse flow control. They are
available in a variety of seating materials and configurations for tight shutoff in low- and high-pressure services.
Large butterfly valves are generally mechanically operated. The mechanical feature is intended to prevent them
from slamming shut in service. Figure 6 illustrates the type of butterfly valve usually specified for water service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Slide Valves
4.3.9<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The slide valve is a specialized gate valve generally used in erosive or high-temperature service. It consists of
a flat plate that slides against a seat. The slide valve uses a fixed orifice and one or two solid slides that move
in guides, creating a variable orifice that make the valve suitable for throttling or blocking. Slide valves do not
make a gas tight shutoff. One popular application of this type of valve is controlling fluidized catalyst flow in
fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units. Internal surfaces of these valves that are exposed to high wear from the
catalyst are normally covered with erosion-resistant refractory. Figure 8 illustrates a slide valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4
Fittings<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Metallic Fittings
4.4.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fittings are used to connect pipe sections and change the direction of flow or allow the flow to be diverted or
added to. Fittings can be cast, forged, drawn from seamless or welded pipe, or formed and welded. Fittings
can be obtained with their ends flanged, recessed for socket welding, beveled for butt-welding, or threaded for
threaded connections. Fittings are made in many shapes, such as wyes, tees, elbows, crosses, laterals, and
reducers. Figure 9 illustrates types of flanged and butt-welded fittings. Figure 10 illustrates types of threaded
and socket-welded fittings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>FRP Fittings
4.4.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FRP fittings are manufactured by different processes. Injection molding, filament winding and contact molding
are the most common techniques. The same criteria used to accept the pipe should be applied to fittings. In
particular, contact molded fittings should be inspected to ensure that they are manufactured to the same
specification as the pipe. Contact molded fittings fabrication is critical because the layers of reinforcement
must be overlapped to make sure that the strength of the layers is not compromised. One-piece contact
molded fittings are the preferred method, but many items such as tees and branch connections are often
manufactured using two pieces of pipe. The inspector must check to make sure that the reinforcement on
those pieces and the gap between them is within the tolerance specified. The exposed cut edges must be
protected accordingly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Flanges<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Metallic Flanges
4.5.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME B16.5 covers flanges of various materials through a NPS of 24 in. (610 mm). ASME B16.47 covers
steel flanges that range from NPS 26 through NPS 60. The flanges of cast fittings or valves are usually
integral with the fitting or the valve body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>FRP Flanges
4.5.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>FRP flanges are manufactured using the same methods as the fittings. Contact molded flanges should be
inspected for dimensions, drawback, and face flatness. The layers of reinforcement should extend onto the
pipe in order to create the proper bond and hub reinforcement. More information on FRP flanges can be found
in MTI Project 160-04. FRP flanges should have the proper torques and gaskets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6
Expansion Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Expansion joints are devices used to absorb dimensional changes in piping systems, such as those caused
by thermal expansion, to prevent excessive stresses/strains being transmitted to other piping components,
and connections to pressure vessels and rotating equipment. While there are several designs, those
commonly found in a plant are metallic bellows and fabric joint designs. Metallic bellows can be single wall or
multilayered, containing convolutions to provide flexibility. Often, these joints will have other design features,
such as guides, to limit the motion of the joint or type of loading applied to the joint. Metallic bellows are often
found in high-temperature services and are designed for the pressure and temperature of the piping system.
Fabric joints are often used in flue gas services at low pressure and where temperatures do not exceed the
rating of the fabric material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7
Piping Supports<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
4.7.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are many different pipe support designs, types, and styles. They include hanger type, support shoes,
saddles, bearing surfaces (e.g. structural members, concrete plinth blocks, etc.), spring type, dummy legs
(trunnions), slide plates, sway braces/snubbers/struts, stands, sleeves, rollers, straps, clamps, and restrictive
guides or anchors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An understanding of the function and design of pipe supports is required to manage both their integrity and
the integrity of piping systems. Pipe supports can be subject to various damage mechanisms (see 7.4.17) as
well as significant stresses from static loading and thermal movements that can affect the pipe support itself,
as well the supported piping and piping components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Piping Support Design—General Considerations
4.7.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping supports usually are designed to carry the weight of piping including valves, insulation, and the weight
of the fluid contained in the pipe, including hydrostatic test conditions. Properly designed piping supports will
ensure that:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) pipes and piping components are not subjected to unacceptable stresses from sustained loads, external<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>loads, or vibration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the piping does not impose an unacceptable load on the connections to the equipment it services (e.g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pressure vessels, pumps, turbines, tanks);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) thermal movement is controlled within allowable displacements so as not to interfere with adjacent piping<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or equipment and be maintained within allowable stress levels;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the potential for corrosion, cracking, and other in-service damage is minimized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Piping Support Design—Specific Considerations
4.7.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipe support design considerations can differ depending on the support type or style. While some pipe
support manufacturers offer innovative and proprietary designs to eliminate or minimize some of the potential
damage mechanisms, the following is a list of some special piping support design parameters to take into
consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Pipe Shoes—It is important that the shoe is long enough and/or guides or stops are provided on the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>structural steel to prevent the shoe from coming off the support, which could cause tearing or other
damage to the pipe. Also, some pipe shoes may trap water between the pipe and shoe (e.g. clamp-on,
bolt-on, saddles that have been stich welded, etc.) and make inspection difficult to determine the condition
of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Pipe Sleeves—Pipe sleeves are often used where pipe passes through a wall, under a roadway, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>through an earthen berm. When used, design precautions should be taken to prevent corrosion on both the
pipe, as well as the pipe sleeve. Centering devices should also be considered to keep the inner pipe
centered and prevent coating damage and corrosion. Fully welded and/or sealed sleeves may be
considered if loss of containment detection and control are necessary. It should be noted that sleeves can
make future pipe inspections and examinations much more difficult.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Doubler Plates, Half Soles, and Wear Pads—Additional plates may be attached to a pipe system at points<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where the pipe rests on bearing surfaces. Plates should be fully welded to avoid crevice corrosion except
in hydrogen charging environments, where a weep hole should be included that will not lead to moisture
ingress. The use of adhesive bonded stainless steel or composite half soles may be considered, but it is
very important to make sure that the adhesive is fully bonded and maintained so as to effectively eliminate
water entrapment. Galvanic corrosion should also be considered when using dissimilar materials for this
purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Dummy Legs (Trunnions)—Historically, dummy leg (trunnion) supports were simple open-ended lengths<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of pipe welded to a piping system from which the piping system was supported. An open-ended design can
allow moisture and debris to become trapped inside the support and cause corrosion of the support itself
and of the pipe. Dummy leg design should include, as a minimum, drain holes no smaller than  1 / 4  in.
(6 mm) located at a low point, with the unattached end of the support being fitted with a fully welded cap or
end plate to prevent debris or animals from entering. Trunnion design can be improved by using solid
sections such as “C” channels or “І/H” beams, to reduce the risk of this problem. However, even solid
member sections can trap water and debris depending upon their design and orientation. Incorporating a
fully welded doubler pad to the pipe at the trunnion attachment location can provide additional corrosion
protection and may help to more evenly distribute loads. The end of a dummy leg support that is not
attached to the pipe may or may not be anchored or restrained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Supports on Insulated Lines—Special attention is necessary for the design of supports on insulated lines<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>so as to minimize the possibility of water ingress and wicking of water into the insulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Accessibility—The accessibility, and therefore inspectability/maintainability, of pipe supports should be
considered during design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Welding—Paths for water ingress into hollow supports can be minimized with the use of fully welded<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>seams. Avoid welding undercut or excessive penetration. Welding defect associated with supports can
contribute to loss of containment events and, in some cases, be of sufficiently small size so as to make leak
detection and source identification difficult. In hydrogen charging environments, a weep hole should be
provided to avoid buildup of pressure between the plate and pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Anchors and Restraints—Attachment of an anchor or restraint to a pipe should preferably encircle the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pipe in order to distribute the stresses evenly about the circumference of the piping component(s).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Flexible Hoses<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flexible hoses are often used to transfer hydrocarbons and other process fluids on a temporary basis to
facilitate turnaround activities (clearing equipment, de-inventorying, purging, etc.) and for transfer of process
fluids/products to rail cars and/or tanker trucks for shipment. Flexible hoses may also be installed within
process piping systems to mitigate the effects of thermal expansion, vibration, or movement during normal
operations. Some sites will maintain several flexible hoses to be used as needed in multiple services. Flexible
hoses come in a variety of different construction materials and designs. Owner/users should have appropriate
quality assurance systems in place to ensure that each different type of flexible hose is compatible with the
process service in which it is used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Pipe-joining Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The common joining methods used to assemble piping components are welding, threading, and flanging.
Piping should be fabricated in accordance with ASME B31.3. Additionally, cast iron piping and thin wall tubing
require special connections/joining methods due to inherent design characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2
Threaded Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Threaded joints are generally limited to auxiliary piping in noncritical service (minor consequence should a
leak occur) that has a nominal size of 2 in. (51 mm) or smaller. Threaded joints for NPSs of 24 in. (610 mm)
and smaller are standardized (see ASME B1.20.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lengths of pipe can be joined by any of several types of threaded fittings (see 4.4). Couplings, which are
sleeves tapped at both ends for receiving a pipe, are normally used to connect lengths of threaded pipe.
When it is necessary to remove or disconnect the piping, threaded unions or mating flanges are required (see
5.4). Threaded joints that are located adjacent to rotating equipment or other specific sources of high vibration
can be especially susceptible to failure due to fatigue. Special consideration should be given to these
situations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3
Welded Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
5.3.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welded joints have for the most part replaced threaded and flanged joints, except in SBP where some users
still rely on threaded joints and in cases where piping is connected to equipment that requires periodic
maintenance. Joints are either butt-welded (in various sizes of pipe) or socket-welded (typically NPS 2 and

<<HEADING level=3>>Butt-welded Joints
5.3.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Butt-welded connections are the most commonly found in the petrochemical industry. The ends of the pipe,
fitting, or valve are prepared (beveled) and aligned with adequate root opening in accordance with ASME
B16.25 or any other end preparation that meets the welding procedure specification (WPS), permitting the ends
to be joined by fusion welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Socket-welded Joints
5.3.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Socket-welded joints are made by inserting the end of the pipe into a recess in a fitting or valve and then fillet
welding the joint. A small space, per the construction code, should be provided between the end of the pipe
and the bottom of the socket to allow for pipe expansion and weld shrinkage. Two lengths of pipe or tubing
can be connected by this method using a socket-weld coupling. Figure 11 illustrates a cross section of a
socket-welded joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Welded Branch Connections
5.3.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A large number of piping failures occur at pipe-to-pipe welded branch connections. The reason for the failures
is that branch connections are often subject to higher-than-normal stresses caused by excessive structural
loadings from unsupported valves or piping, vibration, thermal expansion, or other configurations. The result
is concentrated tri-axial stresses (e.g. bending and torsional) that can cause fatigue cracking or other types of
failures. Where joints are susceptible to such failures, a forged piping tee typically offers better reliability
because it removes the weld from the point of highest stress concentration. Weld-o-lets also can offer better
reliability if they are properly welded to the main pipe using appropriate weld procedures and manufacturer’s
recommendations for full penetration welds<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4
Flanged Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flanged joints are made by bolting two flanges together with some form of gasket between the seating
surfaces. The gasket surfaces can be flat and range from serrated (concentric or spiral) to smooth (depending
on the type of gasket, gasket material, and service conditions), or grooves can be cut for seating metal-ring
gaskets. Flanged joints should be assembled by trained and qualified personnel (see Appendix A of ASME
PCC-1). Consideration should be given to establishing a finished joint examination process. See 6.2 on
flanged joint leakage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 12 illustrates common flange facings for various gaskets. The common types of flanges are welding
neck, slip-on welding, threaded, blind, lap joint, and socket welded. Each type is illustrated in Figure 13.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5
Cast Iron Pipe Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cast iron pipe joints can be of the flanged, packed, sleeve, hub-and-spigot-end or hub-and-plain-end, or
bell-and-spigot-end or bell-and-plain-end type. Push-on joints with rubber or synthetic ring gaskets are
available. Clamped joints are also used. The hub-and-plain-end joint is shown in Figure 14. Figure 15
illustrates cross sections of a bell-type mechanical joint, a sleeve connection, and a typical proprietary
connection (see 5.7). These types of joints are rarely used in process piping service because of their low
toughness and tendency toward brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6
Tubing Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubing can be joined by welding, soldering, or brazing or by using flared or compression fittings. Figure 16
illustrates flared and compression joints. Tubing joints should be assembled by trained and qualified
personnel. Consideration should be given to establishing a finished joint examination process in accordance
with tubing joint manufacturer’s recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7
Special Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Proprietary joints are available that incorporate unique gaskets, clamps, and bolting arrangements. These
designs offer some advantages in some services over conventional joints in certain services including:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) higher pressure and temperature ratings,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) smaller dimensions,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) easier installation—axial and angular alignment requirements are less stringent,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) greater force and moment toleration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Nonmetallic Piping Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
5.8.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are several methods of joining FRP pipe and fittings. Joints in nonmetallic piping are often of several
different designs depending upon the manufacturer of the pipe. Some common joint designs in FRP pipe
systems include a bell and spigot, butt and wrap, taper-taper, and flange-flange.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Bell and Spigot/Taper-taper
5.8.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bell-and-spigot and taper-taper joints are created by inserting the spigot end into the bell end. Proper surface
preparation, insertion, and adequate adhesive are the key to make these types of joints. These joints should
be inspected internally when possible for excess adhesive that can restrict the flow and specified gap. The
inspector should perform an external inspection to look for proper surface preparation, insertion, joint
assembly, and alignment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Butt and Wrap
5.8.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Butt-and-wrap joints involve butting plain end pipe together and applying layers of resin and fiber
reinforcement layers around the joint. These types of joints should be done by qualified secondary bonders.
The joints should be inspected internally for proper gap, cut edge protection and require paste to fill the gap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_45>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>38
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Externally, the joint should be checked for proper alignment, gap tolerance, thickness, width, laminate
sequence, and taper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Fitting thickness is often greater than the matching pipe thickness. Proper taper of the fitting thickness is required
in order to make the proper butt-and-wrap joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Flange-flange
5.8.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flange joints require proper gaskets and torques. A calibrated torque wrench should be used to ensure proper
torqueing and to avoid damage by overstressing the FRP flanges. Proper flange alignment (including flatness
and waviness according to the specification) is required in order to prevent damage at the specified torque
values. Full-face gaskets are required for bolting full-face flanges. Flanges bolted to raised-face connections
must be evaluated individually for required torque values and proper gasket requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6
Reasons for Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The primary purposes of inspection is to observe, report, and quantify damage (see API 571) and then to
specify needed repairs or replacement. Planning for inspection entails identifying potential damage
mechanisms for purposes of directing the inspection activity. The inspection activity requires obtaining
information about the physical condition of the piping, which will lead to determining the causes of any
deterioration and the rate of deterioration. By developing a database of inspection history, the user can predict
and recommend future repairs and replacements, act to prevent or retard further deterioration, and most
importantly, prevent loss of containment. These actions should result in increased operating safety, reduced
maintenance costs, and more reliable and efficient operations. API 570 provides the basic requirements for
such an inspection program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2
Process and Personnel Safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A leak or failure in a piping system can be a minor inconvenience for low-consequence fluids or it can become
a potential source of a process safety incident for higher consequence fluids depending on the temperature,
pressure, contents, and location of the piping. Piping in a petrochemical plant typically contains flammable
fluids, acids, alkalis, toxic fluids, and other harmful fluids that would make leaks potentially hazardous to
exposed personnel. Leaks in these kinds of piping systems can also have environmental consequences
associated with their failure. Adequate inspection is a prerequisite for maintaining this type of piping in a safe,
reliable condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leakage can occur at flanged joints in piping systems for a variety of reasons including corrosion, cracking,
bolt tightness issues, gasket issues, and thermal expansion issues, especially in high-temperature services,
during start-ups or shutdowns, and sometimes during normal operation. For these reasons, it is important that
process plant practices include quality assurance/control procedures to ensure that flanged joints are properly
assembled, inspected, and tested after maintenance activities where the joints have been disassembled and
that the proper gaskets have been selected and installed. ASME PCC-1 is a useful standard for flange joint
assembly practices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3
Reliable Operation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the need for inspection to provide for process and personnel safety, thorough inspection, data
analysis, and maintenance of detailed inspection/repair/replacement records of piping systems are essential
to the attainment of acceptable process reliability in order to meet the business plan. Piping maintenance and
replacement schedules are developed to coincide with scheduled maintenance turnarounds to avoid
unplanned outages and the consequences of lost production opportunities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

39<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4
Regulatory Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Regulatory requirements may cover those piping systems that could affect personnel or process safety and
environmental concerns. Process safety regulations such as OSHA 29  CFR  1910.119 in the United States
have mandated that equipment, including piping, that handles significant quantities of hazardous chemicals
be inspected according to accepted codes and standards, which includes API 570. Local and state
regulations may also cover process piping inspection and maintenance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7
Inspection Plans<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An inspection plan is often developed and implemented for piping systems within the scope API 570. Other
piping systems may also be included in the inspection program and accordingly have an inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An inspection plan should contain the inspection tasks, scope of inspection, and schedule required to monitor
identified damage mechanisms and ensure the mechanical integrity of the piping components in the system.
API 570 defines the minimum contents of an inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection plans for piping systems can be maintained in spreadsheets, hardcopy files, and proprietary
inspection software databases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2
Developing an Inspection Plan<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
7.2.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An inspection plan is often developed through the collaborative work of the inspector, piping engineer,
corrosion specialist, and operating personnel. The team should consider several pieces of information such
as operating temperature ranges, operating pressure ranges, process fluid corrosive contaminant levels,
piping
material
of
construction,
piping
system
configuration,
process
stream
mixing,
and
inspection/maintenance history. In addition, other information sources can be consulted, including API and
NACE publications, to obtain industry experience with similar systems. All of this information provides a basis
for defining the types of damage and locations for its occurrence. Knowledge of the capabilities and limitations
of NDE techniques allows the proper choice of examination technique(s) to identify particular damage
mechanism in specific locations. Ongoing communication with operating personnel when process changes
and/or upsets occur that could affect damage mechanisms and rates are critical to keeping an inspection plan
updated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For piping systems, inspection plans should address the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) condition monitoring locations (CMLs) for specific damage mechanisms;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) piping contact points at pipe support;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) pipe supports and support appurtenances;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>p) expansion joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection plans may be based upon various criteria but should include a risk assessment or fixed intervals as
defined in API 570.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) Plans
7.2.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection plans based upon an assessment of the likelihood of failure and the consequence of failure of a
piping system or circuit is RBI. RBI may be used to determine inspection intervals or due dates and the type
and extent of future inspection/examinations. API 580 details the systematic evaluation of both the likelihood
of failure and consequence of failure for establishing RBI plans. API 581 details an RBI methodology that has
all of the key elements defined in API 580.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Identifying and evaluating potential damage mechanisms, current piping condition, and the effectiveness of
the past inspections are important steps in assessing the likelihood of a piping failure. The likelihood
assessment should consider all forms of degradation that could reasonably be expected to affect piping
circuits in any particular service. Examples of those degradation mechanisms include internal or external
metal loss from an identified form of corrosion (localized or general), all forms of cracking, including
hydrogen-assisted and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) (from the inside or outside surfaces of piping), and
any other forms of metallurgical, corrosion, or mechanical degradation, such as fatigue, embrittlement, creep,
etc. See API 571 for details of common degradation mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Identifying and evaluating the process fluid(s), potential injuries, environmental damage, unit piping and
equipment damage, and unit loss of production are important aspects in assessing the consequences
associated with a failure of piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any RBI assessment should be thoroughly documented in accordance with API 580, defining all the factors
contributing to both the probability and consequence of a failure of the piping system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After an RBI assessment is conducted, the results may be used to establish the inspection plan and better
define the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the most appropriate inspection and NDE methods, tools, and techniques;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the extent of NDE (e.g. percentage of piping to examine);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the date for internal, external, and on-stream inspections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the need for pressure testing after damage has occurred or after repairs/alterations have been completed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) the prevention and mitigation steps to reduce the probability and consequence of a piping failure (e.g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>repairs, process changes, inhibitors, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

41<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Interval-based Inspection Plans
7.2.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection plans that are based upon the specific inspection intervals for the various types of piping inspection
and of specific types of damage are considered interval based. The types of inspection where maximum
intervals are defined in API 570 include external visual, CUI, thickness measurement, injection point, SAI,
SBP, auxiliary piping, and threaded connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The interval for inspections is based upon a number of factors, including the corrosion rate and remaining life
calculations, piping service classification, applicable jurisdictional requirements, and the judgment of the
inspector, the piping engineer, or a corrosion specialist. The governing factor in the inspection plan for many
piping circuits is the piping service classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Classifying Piping Service
7.2.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>According to API 570, Section 6.3.4, all process piping shall be classified according to consequence of failure,
except for piping that has been planned on the basis of RBI. Piping classes vary from Class 1—high
consequence to Class 3—low consequence. Additionally, there is a Class 4 for services that are essentially
nonflammable and nontoxic. Adding more CMLs in appropriate locations to higher consequence piping
subject to higher corrosion rates or localized corrosion and monitoring those CMLs more frequently may
reduce the likelihood of high-consequence events. This strategy gives more accurate prediction of retirement
dates and reduces inspection uncertainty in the piping where reliability is more important. Factors to consider
when classifying piping are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) toxicity,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) volatility,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) combustibility,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) location of the piping with respect to personnel and other equipment, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) experience and history.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3
Monitoring Process Piping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
7.3.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The single most frequent damage mechanism leading to pipe replacement is corrosion. For this reason, an
effective process piping inspection program should include monitoring piping thickness from which corrosion
rates, remaining life, next inspection dates, and projected piping retirement dates can be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A key to the effective monitoring of piping corrosion is identifying and establishing CMLs. CMLs are
designated areas in the piping system where measurements are periodically taken. UT thickness
measurements are obtained within examination points on the pipe. Thickness measurements may be
averaged within the examination point. By taking repeated measurements and recording data from the same
points over extended periods, damage rates can more accurately be calculated or assessed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some of the factors to consider when establishing the corrosion-monitoring plan for process piping are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) classifying the piping service in accordance with API 570 or risk ranking based on RBI analysis;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) categorizing the piping systems into piping circuits of similar corrosion behavior (e.g. localized, general,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>environmental cracking);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) identifying susceptible locations where accelerated damage is expected;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_49>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>42
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) accessibility of the CMLs for monitoring when localized corrosion is not predicted;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) RBI to identify high-risk piping circuits and/or specific piping locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Piping Systems
7.3.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Developing piping systems and circuits based on expected/identified damage mechanisms enables the
development of concise inspection plans and forms the basis for improved data analysis. Refer to API 570 for
the common characteristics of piping systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following are some examples of documenting piping systems. Piping systems can be documented on the
process flow diagrams (PFDs) as described below and contain the following information for each.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Systems can be highlighted by a unique color coding and name.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Piping system nomenclature may utilize conventions that are readily understood within the facility, ideally<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>providing a common language between operating and inspection personnel. Typically, the piping system
identifier is appended to a unit prefix, with piping system and individual piping circuits incrementing from
unit feed to product streams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Each piping system may have other characteristics associated with them documented, including the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>boundaries, general process concerns, integrity operating window parameters, general damage
mechanisms, and process corrosion control measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Piping Circuits
7.3.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Complex process units or piping systems are divided into piping circuits to manage the necessary inspections,
calculations, and recordkeeping. When establishing the boundary of a particular piping circuit, the inspector
may also size it to provide a practical package for recordkeeping and performing field inspection. By
identifying like environments and damage mechanisms as circuits, the spread of calculated corrosion rates of
the CMLs in each circuit is reduced. Proper selection of components in the piping circuit and the number of
CMLs are particularly important when using statistical methods to assess corrosion rates and remaining life.
Figure 17 is an example of one way to break piping up into circuits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping circuit layout and associated CMLs are often identified on inspection piping sketches to aid the
inspector in performing inspection tasks. See 13.2 for information on piping sketches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials of construction have specific potential for corrosion/erosion characteristics and may respond
differently when placed into like operating parameters. Material of construction is a key element in determining
the damage mechanisms and/or rate of damage based on operating environment. Circuit breaks should be
placed when there is a change in piping materials of construction, which can cause a change in
corrosive/erosive behavior. A metallurgist/corrosion engineer experienced in the process unit under review
should be consulted for assignment of damage mechanisms and/or rate of damage for differing materials of
construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A number of factors can affect the rate and nature of pipe wall corrosion. Individual circuits should be limited
to piping components within the system where the damage rate and type of damage (common damage
mechanisms) are consistent. Considerations for the limits of the piping circuit may include, but are not limited
to, the following items:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) piping metallurgy;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) process fluid and its phase (e.g. gas, liquid, two phase, solid);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) flow velocity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) temperature;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping circuits should be identified with common damage mechanisms to facilitate inspection planning and
data analysis and will generally have the following characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Common materials of construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Common design conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Common operating conditions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Common set (one or more) of damage mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Common expected corrosion rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Common expected damage locations/morphology.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) For risk-based programs, piping circuits may be further subdivided based on risk level. For example, a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>pump discharge or upstream of a control valve may have the same corrosion characteristics as pump
suction or downstream of the control valve, but the risk may be greater on the high-pressure segments due
to higher leak rate potential. In such cases, the higher pressure components may be assigned to a
separate circuit<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition, based on the nature of the corrosion, damage type/morphology, and piping metallurgy, circuits
may contain the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Multiple line numbers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Multiple line sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Both primary and secondary piping components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Short dead-legs (e.g. the greater of < 2 D  or 8 in. in length) (e.g. drains/vents and blinded/capped tee runs),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) contact support locations for inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) SAI locations,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>e) CUI/CUF locations for inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Statistical Analysis of Circuit CMLs
7.3.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are many statistical tools that can be employed once piping circuits have been properly established.
While such calculations offer a convenient means to numerically summarize circuit data, it is often the
combination of descriptive statistics plus data visualization through statistical plots that provide the most
useful results. The results of statistical analysis of the CML data using descriptive statistics and statistical
plots should be evaluated for validity and interpreted by a person who is deemed competent by the
owner/user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Probability plots are convenient tools for modeling circuit thickness or corrosion rate data. There are many
statistical programs that can be utilized to visualize large quantities of data and obtain the parameters of
interest. Generally, simple two-parameter distributions such as normal, log normal, and Weibull are good
candidates to describe thickness and corrosion rate trends. In many cases, the “goodness of fit” to a particular
distribution can be visually assessed from a probability plot, although many statistical packages also provide
goodness of fit statistics. Any significant deviation from the best fit line may be an indication of localized
corrosion and/or data anomalies to be investigated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Graphical visualization tools may be used in addition to descriptive statistics to demonstrate the validity of the
statistical modeling assumptions and goodness of fit of the data, especially in the range of highest interest
from an integrity point of view. Examples include the use of normal probability or extreme value distribution
plots to indicate goodness of fit for largest or smallest values in a data set of interest. Visualization of all data
on an appropriately selected scale may reveal lack of goodness of fit or correlations that are not readily
apparent from descriptive statistics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While the following discussion focuses on the use of probability plots, similar results may be obtained without
plotting software. Descriptive statistics may be generated in spreadsheets that estimate distribution
parameters, calculate projected values, and provide other useful circuit analysis information. If calculations<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

45<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>are performed without the aid of data visualization, some assessment as to the goodness of fit and presence
of outliers would provide additional data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical circuit analysis applications include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Creating separate plots for long-term and short-term corrosion rates, to determine if the rate<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>distributions are significantly different.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A shift in the distribution’s location parameter (e.g. the mean, for normal distribution) may indicate
higher or lower rates, while changes in the shape parameter (e.g. the standard deviation) suggest a
change in the degree of localized corrosion. This type of analysis can be useful for assessing
feedstock and other process changes that may have occurred over a period of time. Due to the
impact of thickness measurement accuracies and the physical nature of corrosion phenomena,
special care should be taken when comparing data sets over different time intervals. A direct
comparison of 1-year interval to 5-year interval data may be misleading for the following two reasons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— The time scale of corrosion physics dictates decreasing correlation between measurements as<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the time lag between successive measurements increases. Therefore, short-term and long-term
variability usually have different scatter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Measurement uncertainty tends to affect the results as well. If the measurements are significantly<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>impacted by measurement errors, the scatter would follow a square root relationship with time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Screening circuit corrosion rate and thickness data for uniform vs. localized trends<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When plotting thicknesses or corrosion rates, the best-fitting distribution type as well as trends in the
parameters can be used to screen for localized corrosion. Parameter trends may additionally reveal
important changes over time, relating to higher corrosion rates and/or localized corrosion tendencies.
For example, corrosion rate distributions for uniform services tend to follow a normal distribution.
Significantly nonuniform/localized services (such ammonium bisulfide or naphthenic acid corrosion)
will typically fit best to a log normal distribution with a wide shape parameter. On thickness plots,
reductions in the scale parameter are related to the corrosion rate, while wider shape parameters
suggest more localized behavior.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Estimating a representative corrosion rate for a piping circuit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once a corrosion rate plot has been prepared (considering both long-term and short-term rates), a
representative rate may be assigned for the entire piping circuit. The owner/user may establish
guidelines based (for example) on service class or risk, utilizing a specific occurrence level rate, in
remaining life calculations. For uniform services, a mean rate might be appropriate, while localized
corrosion services may require a much higher occurrence level (say 0.90 or 0.95). If an additional
factor of safety is needed, confidence intervals may be added to the plot and a specified occurrence
level at the upper confidence interval could be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) Evaluating the circuit design, to confirm the assumption of similar damage mechanisms and corrosion<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>rates within a circuit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If all corrosion rates in a circuit do not demonstrate a satisfactory fit as defined by owner/user,
consider grouping the data based on knowledge of the piping design, assigned damage mechanisms,
and pertinent process conditions. This type of grouping is generally required when subpopulations
may be present. For example, a plot of all circuit corrosion data may not exhibit a satisfactory
goodness of fit. It may be subsequently observed that higher rates tend to be associated with elbow
fittings (or even more specifically, the extrados). This would suggest that elbow (or extrados) readings
be plotted separately. If the resulting plots demonstrate a significantly improved goodness of fit, the
circuit design may be validated, but the assigned damage mechanisms may require review. This type
of feedback often provides considerable insight to the inspection program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_53>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>46
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A nongraphical method for identifying potential subpopulations is to calculate the covariance. For
example, a covariance exceeding 10 % could suggest the presence of subpopulations, requiring the
data to be grouped, as outlined above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5) Identifying data outliers and other anomalies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sometimes, the data that does not fit the model is of most interest. Elevated corrosion rates or low
thicknesses that appear as outliers (e.g. points lying outside the plot confidence intervals) should not
be discarded unless a specific cause can be assigned. Each such outlier should be carefully reviewed
to confidently rule out the possibility of localized corrosion. In some cases, this may require obtaining
confirmation readings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6) Estimating the thickness at a low occurrence level, or the probability of the minimum required<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>thickness for a particular size/component within a circuit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thickness probability plots may be used to estimate the minimum thickness at a selected low
occurrence level (say 0.001) for size/component combinations in a circuit. Alternatively, the
probability of reaching the minimum required thickness may be estimated, essentially yielding a
probability of retirement that may be used in risk-based programs. Suitable data validation to identify
replacement sections or potential schedule changes would typically accompany this type of analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of thickness measurement uncertainty, the scatter in the corrosion rate distribution can be
overestimated. Any thickness measurement uncertainty effects should be estimated, with adequate
corrections made, to minimize the impact on probability estimates, otherwise some overconservatism
may be expected in the results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7) Assessing the standard error of the data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is often useful to gain an understanding of how “good” a representative corrosion rate or minimum
thickness estimate may be. It may also be of interest to estimate how much data should be taken for
subsequent inspections. Such estimates can be made by exploring different confidence intervals on
the probability plot. Current and future inspections can be modeled to estimate the effects of
additional (or less) data. The owner/user may choose to adopt practices using variable confidence
intervals depending on service class or risk to estimate minimum data requirements. Such techniques
may also be used to quantify representative sampling requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Given the nature of piping thickness data and its many sources of error, all data used in any statistical
analysis should be carefully validated. The validation might include steps to identify, to the extent
possible, typical issues such as undocumented replacements, anomalous readings, calibration shifts,
or data entry errors. The error can and should be prevented with adequate QA/QC,
training/certification of personnel (data entry, undocumented replacements, use of improper tools,
probes or techniques), and periodic system calibrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are numerous related statistical techniques that may be employed in the analysis of circuit
thickness data. The owner/user may elect to use the methodologies outlined above or may utilize
more advanced statistical techniques (either corrosion rate or thickness based) as a means to
establish representative rates and estimate minimum remaining thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any statistical approach should be documented. Care should be taken to ensure that the statistical
treatment of data results reflects a reasonably conservative representation of the various pipe
components within the circuit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Identifying Locations Susceptible to Accelerated Corrosion
7.3.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the presence of certain corrodants, corrosion rates are normally increased at areas of increased velocity
and/or turbulence. Elbows, reducers, mixing points, control valves, and orifices are examples of piping<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_54>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
47<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>components where accelerated corrosion can occur because of increased velocity and/or turbulence. Such
components are normally areas where an inspector would locate additional CMLs in a piping circuit. However,
the inspector should also be aware that areas of no flow, such as dead-legs (see 7.4.4), can cause
accelerated corrosion and may need additional CMLs. In situations where cracking is anticipated, a CML may
be established temporarily to monitor the rate of cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Accessibility of CMLs
7.3.6<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When assigning CMLs, the inspector should consider accessibility for monitoring them. CMLs at grade level
normally provide the easiest accessibility. Other areas with good accessibility are equipment platforms and
ladders. In some piping systems, the nature of the active damage mechanisms will require monitoring at
locations with limited accessibility. In these cases, inspection planning should decide among scaffolding,
portable manlifts, or other methods to provide adequate access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4
Inspection for Specific Damage Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
7.4.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Oil refinery and chemical plant piping can be subject to internal and external damage mechanisms. This
piping carries a range of fluids that can be highly corrosive, erosive, and prone to SCC or subject to material
degradation in service. In addition, both aboveground and buried piping is subject to external corrosion. The
inspector should be familiar with the potential damage mechanisms for each piping system. API 571 has been
developed to give the inspector added insights on various causes of damage. Figure 18, Figure 19, Figure 20,
and Figure 21 illustrate several examples of corrosion and erosion of piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If an inspection of an area of piping indicates damage is occurring, the piping upstream and downstream of
this area, along with associated equipment, should also be inspected. Additionally, if deterioration is detected
in pressure equipment, associated piping should also be inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each owner/user should provide specific attention to the needs for inspection of piping systems that are
susceptible to the following specific types and areas of deterioration:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) injection points,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Injection Points
7.4.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 570 has identified injection points for additional monitoring and/or enhanced inspection during operation.
This was done in recognition of the fact that injections have caused significant equipment integrity problems,
and part of the reason was that their design and operation might have received insufficient scrutiny. Some
injection points have been installed without close attention simply because they were perceived as small
add-ons with little potential for causing a problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many different types of process additives are used to maintain reliability and optimal performance of plant
operations. Typically, additives are injected into piping systems through small branch connections either
directly or through a quill or spray nozzle. The locations at which these additives are introduced into process
streams are commonly referred to as injection points.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An additive may be one of the following types:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) a proprietary chemical such as a corrosion inhibitor, antifoulant, or oxygen scavenger;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) a water stream injected to dissolve salt deposits;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) dilute corrosive process components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some common injection systems found in refinery applications include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) ammonium polysulfide (APS) injection into sour gas streams (FCC, coker, sour water stripper);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) steam/condensate injection into flue gas and catalyst piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) washwater injection (continuous and intermittent) into hydroprocessing effluent to control corrosion, which<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>may be caused by NH 4 HS and NH 4 Cl salts. Refer to API 932-B, Section 6.8.1 and Table 2 for additional
details;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) crude desalter washwater;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) caustic injection into crude feed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
caustic injection into reformer regeneration section piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) chloride, e.g. PERC (perchlorethylene), injection into reformer reactor feed piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) methanol/condensate injection into reformer reactor system piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
ammonia or neutralizing amine injection into crude tower overhead systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
cold H 2  quench injection into hydroprocessing reactor system piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) Filming amine inhibitor injection into fractionation and gas plant overhead piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Several corrosion mechanisms associated with injection points have become apparent over the years. Many
of these problems have resulted in highly localized deterioration. Corrosion damage associated with injection
points may produce corrosion rates one order of magnitude higher than reported for the main process
streams, with localized losses being the most common form of problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion associated with injection points may be highly localized. Inspection practices geared to scanning
areas of the piping are necessary to be able to detect the localized corrosion. Problems with injection points
have generally been avoided when specification, design, training, operation, and condition monitoring were
adequately carried out. After installation of injection systems the following should be reviewed:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) injection system has been documented and installed hardware has been checked,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) procedures and measurements in place to verify injection system performance,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) inspection plan in place to check for equipment degradation related to the injection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the design and period audit of the injection systems, the following would typically be considered:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the injection was designed to achieve its process objectives;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the range of desired injection rates and the range of process conditions expected in the receiving stream<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>were considered;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the ultimate destination of the injectant and its components were considered;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) design of the injection as a system, including the injection point, supply system, instrumentation, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>control was considered;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) the system was designed to achieve the desired process reliability;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
potential materials degradation problems were anticipated, and designs and materials of construction to
achieve the desired pressure equipment reliability were chosen;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) an approved MOC process was used in implementing or modifying the injection, as a way to ensure that<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>changes were adequately thought out;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) operating and maintenance personnel were trained on the proper operation and servicing of the injection<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
performance of the injection was verified and monitored to see that it was accomplishing its objective and
not causing unanticipated process problems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
the integrity of the injection point and related equipment was monitored;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) minimum inspection requirements for injection points in accordance with API 570 were implemented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Potential problem process mixing points were identified and similarly inspected;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
the injection system, including the process operating window, anticipated conditions, equipment design,
materials of construction, anticipated chemical and physical interactions, and monitoring/inspection
requirements were documented;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>p) antiblowout features of retractable injection hardware were inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Process Mixing Points
7.4.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
7.4.3.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Process mixing points occur where pipe components combine two process streams of differing composition,
temperature, or other parameter that could cause damage. Mixing points can be subject to accelerated
damage either from corrosion or mechanical mechanisms (e.g. thermal fatigue). Problems with mixing points<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>

53<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>have generally been avoided when specification, design, training, operation, and condition monitoring were
adequately carried out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some examples of process mixing points include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) mixing of a chloride-containing stream from a catalytic reformer (e.g. naphtha) with a wet hydrocarbon<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>stream from elsewhere;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) mixing a low-temperature, high-sulfur-containing hydrocarbon stream with a high-temperature stream is an<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>issue when bulk fluid temperature is increased where high-temperature sulfidation becomes active;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) mixing hydrogen into a hydrocarbon stream where the stream temperatures are significantly different;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) mixing of streams from hydroprocessing hot and cold separators;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) mixing where high-temperature sulfidation can become an issue if the overall fluid temperature is<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>increased.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector, unit process engineer, and corrosion engineer will typically review PFDs to identify susceptible
process mixing points and define the extent of the mix point circuit. More intensive inspection chosen for the
damage mechanism is usually required at specific mixing points. This could include close grid thickness
surveys, UT scanning techniques, and profile radiographic examination (RT)   for corrosion. Other NDE
techniques (e.g. angle beam UT, PT, etc.) may be appropriate when inspecting for thermal fatigue cracking.
Under some conditions, users may apply injection point inspection requirements to susceptible process
mixing points.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some mixing points may incorporate proven technology resulting in complete mixing of each stream. These
mixing points may not fall within the intended scope/definition of corrosive mixing points and, therefore, may
not require any special emphasis inspections<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Mixing Point Design Considerations
7.4.3.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important to identify mixing points in the design phase of the piping system’s life cycle. Proper design of
mixing points should incorporate a number of considerations, like mixing effectiveness, flow regime, materials
of construction, stream composition and stream volume, and normal operating conditions, as well as
abnormal operating conditions along with the likelihood/frequency of those abnormal/excursive conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 4 is an example that may be used for screening the material, fluid types and temperature difference
between the two streams at a mixing point to determine whether thermal fatigue may be a concern. If the
temperature difference between two process streams exceeds the number below, a thermal sleeve may be
needed in order to prevent thermal fatigue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Caution—This table is for the potential for thermal cracking at mix points. Corrosion at mix points can
be created at much lower temperature differentials.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Effectiveness of Mixing and Flow Regime
7.4.3.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When two streams are combined, turbulence starts the mixing process, and the effectiveness will depend on
the degree of penetration by the mixing stream and whether the two streams are miscible or immiscible. If the
streams are miscible, then a single phase will be formed, but dispersion and dissolution are time dependent.
Complete mixing may not develop until 100 pipe diameters or more downstream; inspection plans should
consider the area where incomplete mixing is predicted. If the streams are immiscible, two phases may
remain in the mixed stream or a third phase may form downstream of the mixing point (e.g. amine salt
deposition).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The flow regime that develops depends on:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) stream velocity,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) relative amounts/densities of the phases,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) size and orientation of both lines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flow regimes are different in horizontal and vertical lines because of gravity. Fully developed flow may not
occur until many pipe diameters downstream.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Mixing, Contacting, or Wetting
7.4.3.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Injection and mixing points involve mixing, contacting, or wetting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Mixing—The rate of mixing is improved by an increase in velocity of the injected stream, which can be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>accomplished by injecting through a quill or spray nozzle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Contacting—Contacting or intimate mixing of the separate phases is improved by maximizing the area<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>between the phases (e.g. by a spray nozzle).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Wetting—In single-phase streams, wetting of walls by injected fluid is readily achieved. In two-phase<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>streams, wetting is dependent on the flow regime with annular, bubble, and froth flow enhancing wetting of
the walls, while stratified and wavy flow will impede wall wetting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Quantity of Injected/Mixed Water
7.4.3.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some situations, the quantity of water needs to be calculated carefully to ensure sufficient un-vaporized
water remains to fulfill the function and not exacerbate corrosion. Process engineers should check this
periodically. Water quality can also affect corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See NACE SP0114 for additional information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Dead-legs
7.4.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The corrosion rate in dead-legs can vary significantly from adjacent active piping. The inspector should
monitor wall thickness on selected dead-legs, including both the stagnant end and at the connection to an
active line. In systems such as tower overhead systems and hydrotreater units where ammonium salts are
present, the corrosion can occur in the area of the dead-leg where the metal is at the salting or dew-point
temperature. In hot piping systems, the high-point area can corrode due to convective currents set up in the
dead-leg. For these reasons, consideration should be given to removing dead-legs that serve no further
process purpose. For such systems, extensive inspection coverage using such techniques as UT scanning
and profile RT may be necessary in order to locate the area where dew-point or ammonium-salt corrosion is
occurring. Additionally, water can collect in dead-legs, which can freeze in colder environments, resulting in
pipe rupture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>CUI
7.4.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
7.4.5.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External inspection of insulated piping systems should include a review of the insulation system integrity for
conditions that could lead to CUI and signs of ongoing CUI. API 570 documents the requirements of a CUI
inspection program. Sources of moisture can include rain, water leaks, condensation, deluge systems, and
cooling towers. The two forms of CUI are localized corrosion of carbon steel and CSCC of austenitic stainless
steels. See API 571 and API 583 for additional details on CUI mechanisms and inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section provides guidelines for identifying potential CUI areas for inspection. The extent of a CUI
inspection program may vary depending on the local climate. Marine locations in warmer areas may require a
very active program, whereas cooler, drier, mid-continent locations may not need as extensive a program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Insulated Piping Systems Susceptible to CUI
7.4.5.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain areas of piping systems are potentially more susceptible to CUI, including:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) those exposed to mist over-spray from cooling water towers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) those exposed to steam vents;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) those exposed to deluge systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) those subject to process spills or ingress of moisture or acid vapors;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) carbon steel and low-alloy piping systems, including ones insulated for personnel protection, operating<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>between 10 °F (–12 °C) and 350 °F (175 °C); CUI is particularly aggressive where operating temperatures
cause frequent or continuous condensation and reevaporation of atmospheric moisture;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
carbon steel and low-alloy piping systems that normally operate in service above 350 °F (175 °C), but are
in intermittent service,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) areas where temperature regimes are moving into and out of the CUI temperature range (this applies to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>both carbon steel and stainless steel susceptibility ranges);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) dead-legs and attachments that protrude from insulated piping and operate at a different temperature than<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

vibrating piping systems that have a tendency to inflict damage to insulation jacketing providing a path for
water ingress;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) steam traced piping systems that can experience tracing leaks, especially at tubing fittings beneath the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>insulation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
piping systems with deteriorated insulation, coatings, and/or wrappings; bulges or staining of the insulation

<<HEADING level=3>>Typical Locations on Piping Circuits Susceptible to CUI
7.4.5.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The above noted areas of piping systems can have specific locations within them that are more susceptible to
CUI. These areas include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) All penetrations or breaches in the insulation jacketing systems, such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) dead-legs (vents, drains, etc.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4) bolt-on pipe shoes; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5) steam and electric tracer tubing penetrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Termination of insulation at flanges and other piping components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Damaged or missing insulation jacketing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Insulation jacketing seams located on the top of horizontal piping or improperly lapped or sealed insulation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>jacketing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Termination of insulation in a vertical pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Caulking that has hardened, separated, or is missing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Low points in piping systems, particularly ones that have a known breach in the insulation system,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>including low points in long unsupported piping runs and vertical to horizontal transitions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Carbon or low-alloy steel flanges, bolting, and other components under insulation in high-alloy piping<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Particular attention should be given to locations where insulation plugs have been removed to permit piping
thickness measurements on insulated piping. These plugs should be promptly replaced and sealed. Several
types of removable plugs are commercially available that permit inspection and identification of inspection
points for future reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>SAI
7.4.6<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection at grade should include checking for coating damage, bare pipe, and pit depth measurements. If
significant corrosion is noted, thickness measurements and excavation may be required to assess whether
the corrosion is localized to the SAI or can be more pervasive to the buried system. Thickness readings at
SAIs can expose the metal and accelerate corrosion if coatings and wrappings are not properly restored.
Figure 22 is an example of corrosion at a SAI although it had been wrapped with tape. If the buried piping has
satisfactory cathodic protection as determined by monitoring in accordance with API 570, excavation is
required only if there is evidence of coating or wrapping damage. Experience has shown that corrosion could
occur under the tape even though it appears to be intact. Consideration should be given to excavate down
12 in. (300 mm) deep and remove the tape for inspection, or using appropriate NDE in lieu of the excavation
and tape removal, to inspect for possible corrosion underneath the tape. If the buried piping is uncoated at
grade, consideration should be given to excavating 6 in. (150 mm) to 12 in. (300 mm) deep to assess the
potential for hidden damage. Alternately, specialized UT techniques such as guided wave can be used to
screen areas for more detailed evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At concrete-to-air and asphalt-to-air interfaces for buried piping without cathodic protection, the inspector
should look for evidence that the caulking or seal at the interface has deteriorated and allowed moisture
ingress. If such a condition exists on piping systems over 10 years old, it may be necessary to inspect for
corrosion beneath the surface before resealing the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Service-specific and Localized Corrosion
7.4.7<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An effective inspection program includes the following four elements that help identify the potential for
service-specific and localized corrosion and select appropriate CMLs:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) an inspector with knowledge of the service and where corrosion is likely to occur,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) extensive use of NDE,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) communication from operating personnel when process upsets occur that can affect corrosion rates,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) identification of piping that may be overlooked from the routine piping circuit inspection programs that pose<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a degradation concern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples include instrument bridles for equipment connecting to piping circuits, temporary piping used during
maintenance outages, and swing-out spools.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are many types of internal corrosion possible from the process service. These types of corrosion are
usually localized and are specific to the service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of where this type of corrosion might be expected include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) downstream of injection and mixing points and upstream of product separators (e.g. hydroprocessor<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>reactor effluent lines);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) dew-point corrosion in condensing streams (e.g. overhead fractionation);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_65>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>58
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) unanticipated acid or caustic carryover from processes into nonalloyed piping systems, or in the case of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>caustic, into non-postweld-heat-treated steel piping systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) where condensation or boiling of acids (organic and inorganic) or water is likely to occur;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) where naphthenic or other organic acids can be present in the process stream;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
where high-temperature hydrogen attack can occur (see API 941);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) ammonium salt condensation locations in hydroprocessing streams (see API 932-B);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) mixed-phase flow and turbulent areas in acidic systems, also hydrogen grooving areas;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
where high-sulfur streams at moderate-to-high temperatures exist;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
mixed grades of carbon steel piping in hot corrosive oil service [500 °F (260 °C)] or higher temperature and
sulfur content in the oil greater than 0.5 % by weight;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Nonsilicon-killed steel pipe (e.g. ASTM A53/A53M and API 5L) can corrode at higher rates than silicon-killed
steel pipe (e.g. ASTM A106) in high-temperature sulfidation environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) under-deposit corrosion in slurries, crystallizing solutions, or coke-producing fluids;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
chloride carryover in catalytic reformer units, particularly where it mixes with other wet streams;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>m) welded areas subject to preferential attack;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n) “hot spot” corrosion on piping with external heat tracing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
In services that become much more corrosive to the piping with increased temperature (e.g. sour water,
caustic in carbon steel), corrosion or SCC can develop at hot spots that develop under low flow conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>o) steam systems subject to “wire cutting,” graphitization, or where condensation occurs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>p) Locations subject to high-temperature sulfidation corrosion where residence times resulting from low flow<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>conditions may result in increased corrosion. Susceptible locations include elbows, along the top of
horizontal sections of line, and areas where localized heating may occur, i.e. double or triple heat trace
areas and in stagnant and low flow piping systems with thermally induced currents (thermosiphon).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where a temporary (or swing-out) piping spool has not been removed prior to process operation start-up, it
should be verified that the temporary piping is either effectively isolated from the process (such as
double-block valve or isolation blind) or that the temporary piping is of adequate material and mechanical
design for the continued process operation, including potential no flow conditions. One particular concern is
raised for temporary piping of inadequate material that may be subject to high-temperature sulfidation or other
damage mechanisms if left exposed to the process. If the temporary piping is isolated and left for a significant
period of time, lock-out/tag-out can be a means to prevent inappropriate and inadvertent service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Erosion and Erosion-corrosion
7.4.8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Erosion can be defined as the removal of surface material by the action of numerous individual impacts of
solid or liquid particles or cavitation. It can be characterized by grooves, rounded holes, waves, and valleys in
a directional pattern. Erosion is usually in areas of turbulent flow such as at changes of direction in a piping
system or downstream of control valves where vaporization can take place. Erosion damage is usually
increased in streams with large quantities of solid or liquid particles and high velocities. A combination of
corrosion and erosion (erosion-corrosion) results in significantly greater metal loss than can be expected from
corrosion or erosion alone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_66>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
59<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This type of corrosion occurs at high-velocity and high-turbulence areas. Examples of places to inspect
include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) downstream of control valves, especially where flashing or cavitation is occurring;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) downstream of orifices;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) downstream of pump discharges;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) at any point of flow direction change, such as the outside radii of elbows;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) downstream of piping configurations (welds, thermowells, flanges, etc.) that produce turbulence,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>particularly in velocity sensitive systems, such as ammonium hydrosulfide and sulfuric acid systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Areas suspected to have localized erosion-corrosion should be inspected using appropriate NDE methods
that will yield thickness data over a wide area, such as UT scanning and profile RT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See API 571 for additional information on erosion and erosion-corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Environmental Cracking
7.4.9<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping system materials of construction are normally selected to resist the various forms of SCC. Some piping
systems can be susceptible to environmental cracking due to upset process conditions, CUI, unanticipated
condensation, or exposure to wet hydrogen sulfide or carbonates. Examples of this include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) CSCC of austenitic stainless steels resulting from moisture and chlorides under insulation, under deposits,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>under gaskets, or in crevices (see API 583). This is an especially aggressive form of cracking if
environmental conditions cause drying and wetting (chlorides concentrate). SCC of austenitic stainless
steels can also occur internally where chlorides are present with water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Polythionic acid SCC of sensitized austenitic alloy steels resulting from exposure to sulfide/moisture<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>condensation/oxygen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Caustic SCC (sometimes known as caustic embrittlement).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Amine SCC in non-stress-relieved piping systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Carbonate SCC in alkaline systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Wet hydrogen sulfide stress cracking and hydrogen blistering in systems containing sour water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Hydrogen blistering and hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC) damage. This has not been as serious of a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>problem for piping as it has been for pressure vessels. It is listed here because it is considered to be
environmental cracking and can occur in piping although it has not been extensive. One exception where
this type of damage has been a problem is longitudinally welded pipe fabricated from plate materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See API 571 for additional details on environmental cracking mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the inspector suspects or is advised that specific circuits may be susceptible to environmental cracking,
he/she should schedule supplemental inspections. Such inspections can take the form of surface NDE [PT or
wet fluorescent magnetic particle examination technique (WFMT)], UT, or eddy current (ET). Where available,
suspect spools may be removed from the piping system and split open for internal surface examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If environmental cracking is detected during internal inspection of pressure vessels and the piping is considered
equally susceptible, the inspector should designate appropriate piping spools upstream and downstream of the
pressure vessel, for environmental cracking inspection. When the potential for environmental cracking is
suspected in piping circuits, inspection of selected spools should be scheduled before an upcoming turnaround.
Such inspection should provide information useful in forecasting turnaround maintenance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Corrosion Beneath Linings and Deposits
7.4.10<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If external or internal coatings, refractory linings, and corrosion-resistant linings are in good condition and
there is no reason to suspect a deteriorated condition behind them, it is usually not necessary to remove them
for inspection of the piping system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effectiveness of corrosion-resistant linings is greatly reduced due to breaks or holes in the lining. The
linings should be visually inspected for separation, breaks, holes, and blisters. If any of these conditions are
noted, it may be necessary to remove portions of the internal lining to investigate the effectiveness of the
lining and the condition of the metal piping beneath the lining. Alternatively, UT from the external surface can
be used to measure the base metal thickness. When the lining is metallic and is designed to be fully bonded,
external UT can also be used to detect separation, holes, and blisters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Refractory linings used to insulate the pipe wall can spall or crack in service, causing hot spots that expose
the metal to oxidation and creep cracking. Periodic temperature monitoring via visual, infrared, temperature
indicating paints should be undertaken on these types of lines to confirm the integrity of the lining. Corrosion
beneath refractory linings can result in separation and bulging of the refractory. Microwave examination
technique (MW) can examine the refractory for volumetric flaws and for separation from the shell surface. If
bulging or separation of the refractory lining is detected, portions of the refractory may be removed to permit
inspection of the piping beneath the refractory. Otherwise, thickness measurements utilizing UT or profile RT
may be obtained from the external metal surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where operating deposits such as coke are present on the internal pipe surface, NDE techniques employed
from the outside of the pipe such as profile RT, UT, and/or ET should be used to determine whether such
deposits have active corrosion beneath them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Fatigue Cracking
7.4.11<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fatigue cracking of piping systems can result from excessive cyclic stresses that are often well below the
static yield strength of the material. The cyclic stresses can be imposed by pressure, mechanical, or thermal
means and can result in low-cycle or high-cycle fatigue. The onset of low-cycle fatigue cracking is often
directly related to the number of heat-up/cooldown cycles experienced. For example, trunnions or other
attachments that extend beyond the pipe insulation can act as a cooling fin that sets up a situation favorable
to thermal fatigue cracking on the hot pipe. Thermal fatigue can also occur at mix points when process
streams at different operating temperatures combine. Excessive piping system vibration (e.g. machine or flow
induced) can also cause high-cycle fatigue damage. See API 570, Section 5.5.5 for vibrating piping
surveillance requirements and API 570, Section 7.8 for design requirements associated with vibrating piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fatigue cracking can typically be first detected at points of high stress intensification such as branch
connections. Locations where metals having different coefficients of thermal expansion are joined by welding
can be susceptible to thermal fatigue. Preferred NDE methods of detecting fatigue cracking include PT, MT,
and angle beam UT when inspecting from the OD for ID cracking. Suggested locations for UT on elbows
would include the 3 and 9 o’clock positions. Acoustic emission examination technique (AE) also may be used
to detect the presence of cracks that are activated by test pressures or stresses generated during the test.
See API 570, Section 6.6.4 for fatigue considerations relative to threaded connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important for the owner/user and the inspector to understand that fatigue cracking is likely to cause piping
failure before detection with any NDE methods. Of the fatigue cycles required to produce failure, the vast
majority are required to initiate cracking and relatively few cycles are required to propagate the crack to failure.
As such, proper design and installation to prevent fatigue cracking are important.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See API 571 for additional information on thermal fatigue, mechanical fatigue, and vibration-induced fatigue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Creep Cracking
7.4.12<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Creep is dependent on time, temperature, and stress. Creep cracking can eventually occur at design
conditions since some piping code allowable stresses are in the creep range. Cracking is accelerated by<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_68>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
61<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>creep/fatigue interaction when operating conditions in the creep range are cyclic. Particular attention should
be given to areas of high stress concentration. If excessive temperatures are encountered, mechanical
property and microstructural changes in metals can also take place, which can permanently weaken
equipment. An example of where creep cracking has been experienced in the industry is in 1 1 / 4  Cr steels
above 900 °F (482 °C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NDE methods of detecting creep cracking include PT, MT, UT, RT, and ET, and alternating current field
measurement (ACFM), in-situ metallography, and dimensional verification (i.e. strapping pipe diameter) are
other common practices for detection. NDE volumetric examination methods, including profile RT and UT, can
be used for detection of creep cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>AE can be utilized to identify active creep cracking. The examination can be conducted while piping is in or out
of operation. When the examination is conducted, the probability of detecting creep cracks can be a function
of crack orientation. Any piping examined out of operation requires a pressure stimulus to activate any
damage present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See API 571 for additional information on creep and stress rupture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Brittle Fracture
7.4.13<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon, low-alloy, and other ferritic steels can be susceptible to brittle failure at or below ambient
temperatures. In some cases, the refrigerating effect of vaporizing liquids such as ammonia or C 2  or C 3
hydrocarbons can chill the piping and promote brittle fracture in material that may not otherwise fail. Brittle
fracture usually is not a concern with relatively thin wall piping. Most brittle fractures have occurred on the first
application of a particular stress level (i.e. the first hydrotest or overload) unless critical defects are introduced
in service. The potential for a brittle failure should be considered when pressure testing or more carefully
evaluated when pressure testing equipment pneumatically or when adding any other additional loads. Special
attention should be given to low-alloy steels (especially 2 1 / 4  Cr-1 Mo material), because they can be prone to
temper embrittlement, and to ferritic stainless steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A through-wall crack resulting from brittle fracture and causing a leak can be detected with helium leak
detection. Alternatively, active cracking in embrittled material can be detected and possibly located with AE.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See API 571 for additional information on brittle fracture. API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Section 3 provides
procedures for the assessment of equipment for resistance to brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Freeze Damage
7.4.14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At subfreezing temperatures, water and aqueous solutions handled in piping systems can freeze and cause
failure because of the expansion of these materials. After unexpectedly severe freezing weather, it is
important to visually check for freeze damage to exposed piping components before the system thaws. If
rupture has occurred, leakage can be temporarily prevented by the frozen fluid. Low points, drip-legs, and
dead-legs of piping systems containing water should be carefully examined for damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To prevent freeze damage, precautions need to be taken to drain, purge, or heat trace systems where
moisture could collect and unexpectedly freeze during severe or sudden subfreezing temperature excursions.
One of the most critical locations for these precautions is the top of the seat of relief valves and pilot-operated
relief valves, when moisture could be present. Tail pipes on relief valves that discharge to the atmosphere
should always have adequate drainage or heat tracing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Contact Point Corrosion
7.4.15<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Localized corrosion at pipe support contact points is the result of crevice corrosion due to deposits that contain
corrosive species, water, and oxygen typical of an externally corrosive environment. More corrosion can be
expected in moist climates, marine climates, and where contact between pipe and its supports is less of a “point”
and more of an “area.” If undetected and/or not mitigated, contact point corrosion can lead to leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Nonmetallic Damage Mechanisms
7.4.16<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In many circumstances, the choice of FRP is based on its inherent resistance to degradation mechanisms
such as corrosion. However, no material is totally resistant and so there is a potential for in-service
degradation. OLF 055 has compiled an extensive review of the topic and produced a framework that may be
used in risk assessments and in evaluating damage mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical in-service damage mechanisms found in FRP nonmetallic piping systems are shown in Table 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>External Corrosion at Supports
7.4.17.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion of supports, and their associated pipe work, may occur in areas of protective coating breakdown
where water and airborne debris become trapped (often referred to as “touch point corrosion”). Support
design (i.e. support beams) can significantly contribute to this issue. Corrosion rates can be increased by local
factors. Elevated temperatures from hot piping (e.g. steam piping) can increase corrosion, including
fireproofed supports. Other factors such as heat tracing or steam trap drain outlets, or where moisture is
increased such as from proximity to cooling towers, and vegetation (creating a wet environment on the
underside of the pipe and on any supports in the proximity) all can contribute to locally high corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Dummy leg supports may trap water and airborne debris, leading to corrosion of both the support and the pipe.
When constructed using pipe, consideration should be given to capping all open-ended supports with fully
welded caps or plates and providing a drain hole no smaller than  1 / 4  in. (6 mm) at the lowest position. For
horizontal dummy legs, drain holes should be provided at both ends and the dummy leg should slope slightly

parameters for integrity operating windows containing upper and lower limits can be established, as needed,
and deviations outside these limits brought to the attention of inspection/engineering personnel. Particular
attention to monitoring integrity operating windows should also be provided during start-ups, shutdowns, and
significant process upsets. Refer to API 584 for more information on integrity operating windows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8
Frequency and Extent of Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency and extent of piping inspections will range from often and extensive in piping classes where
deterioration is extreme or high consequence to seldom and cursory in piping classes in noncorrosive or
low-consequence services. The frequency of piping inspections should be determined by the following
conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) consequence of a failure (piping classification),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) degree of risk (likelihood and consequence of a failure),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) amount of corrosion allowance remaining,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) available historical data,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) regulatory requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 570 requires classifying piping systems according to the consequences of failure, unless RBI is used to
determine piping inspection plans. Each refinery or process plant should review their own piping systems and
develop either a classification system using the information provided in API 570 or an RBI analysis in
accordance with API 580. Either system helps to establish minimum inspection frequencies for each piping
classification or inspection due dates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some inspections can and should be made while the piping is operating. Inspections that cannot be made
during operation should be made while the piping is not in service. Elevated operating temperature can limit
the inspections techniques that can be effectively used during operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2
On-stream Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Technical Reasons for Inspecting On-stream
8.2.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain kinds of external inspections should be done while piping is operating. Vibration and swaying is
evident with process flow through the pipe. Proper position and function of supports, hangers, and anchors is
most apparent while piping is in operation at temperature. The inspector should look for distortion, settlement,
or foundation movement, which could indicate improper design or fabrication. Pipe rollers and slide plates
should be checked to ensure that they operate freely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leakage is often more obvious during operation. Inspectors should look for signs of leakage both coming from
each pipe and onto each pipe. The leakage from a pipe can indicate a hole in the pipe, and leakage onto a
pipe can indicate a leak from an unobserved source (e.g. beneath insulation).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermal imaging inspections may be performed for various reasons and should be done under operating
conditions. Thermal images can show pluggage and/or maldistribution of flow that can affect corrosion
mechanisms. Thermal imaging can also show wet insulation that can lead to CUI. Thermal imaging can show
breakdown of internal insulating refractory, which can lead to high-temperature corrosion of the pipe wall.
Thermal imaging may show malfunctions of heat tracing, which could allow unexpected damage mechanisms<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_72>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
65<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to operate. For instance, tracing that is too hot may cause caustic SCC of carbon steel carrying caustic
solutions, and tracing that is too cold may allow dew-point corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiography can be as effective during operation as when the piping is offline. On-stream radiography could
detect fouling that might be washed out of piping during unit entry preparation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Practical Reasons for Inspecting On-stream
8.2.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On-stream inspection can increase unit run lengths by giving assurance that piping is fit for continued service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When piping must be replaced, on-stream inspection allows an inspector to define the extent of replacement
necessary and have replacement piping fabricated before the shutdown.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Units are often crowded during a shutdown, and on-stream piping inspection can increase the safety and
efficiency of shutdown operations by reducing the number of people who need to be in the unit during that time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On-stream inspection can reduce surges in work load and thus stabilize personnel requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3
Offline Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A common limitation to on-stream inspection is temperature. The equipment used in some kinds of techniques
cannot operate at temperatures much above ambient. In addition, the radiant heat from some piping can be
too great for technicians to make measurements safely. In both of these instances, piping inspection may
need to be done when the piping is not in operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Signs of wet insulation should be noted when piping is offline. Water dripping onto insulation may not show
dampness during operation because heat from the pipe causes surface water to evaporate, but water deeper
in the insulation can still cause CUI. If dampness is noted during a shutdown, the damp piping should be
considered for CUI inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When piping is opened for any reason, it should be inspected internally as far as accessibility permits. Some
piping is large enough for internal inspection, which can only occur while the piping is offline.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adequate follow-up inspections should be conducted to determine the causes of defects, such as leaks,
misalignment, vibration, and swaying, that were detected while the unit was operating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4
Inspection Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping inspection should be frequent enough to ensure that all piping has sufficient thickness to provide both
pressure containment and mechanical support. For pipes undergoing uniform corrosion, calculating the
corrosion rate and remaining life at each CML and setting the inspection interval at the half-life had
traditionally given that assurance. The inspector, often in consultation with corrosion specialists and piping
engineers, has decided the number and locations of CMLs (see API 570). RBI may be used to determine
interval or due date and extent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For degradation mechanisms other than uniform corrosion, the inspector should determine the type of
inspection, the frequency, the extent, and the locations of CMLs. Corrosion and pressure equipment
engineers have typically helped in this process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9
Safety Precautions and Preparatory Work<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1
Safety Precautions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety precautions should be taken before external inspections are performed and especially before any piping
is opened for inspection. The appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) should be utilized for each
inspection. Procedures for the separation of piping, installation of blinds, and leak testing should be an integral<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_73>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>66
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>part of safety practices. In general, the section of piping to be opened should be isolated from all sources of
harmful liquids, gases, or vapors and purged to remove all oil and toxic or flammable gases and vapors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hammer testing of pressured piping might cause failure and allow the contents of the piping to be released.
Precautions should be taken before any hammer testing of in-service piping (see API 2217A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiography must be performed in accordance with the applicable requirements of the site and jurisdiction
due to potential radiation exposure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Caution should be taken when attempting to remove scale and deposits from the external surfaces of
in-service piping, especially when operating at high pressure or temperature with hazardous/flammable
process fluids. Loss of containment incidents have occurred when deposits were removed while inspecting for
CUI, support point corrosion, cooling water drift corrosion, etc. that were covering through-wall corrosion
damage. The owner/user may consider the following to mitigate the risk of a through-wall event.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Use of profile RT or UT NDE to inspect under deposits and determine the amount of corrosion damage,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>before disturbing the deposits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Develop an emergency response plan in the event that a through-wall leak develops. This plan should<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>include provisions to isolate the affected area, temporary repair provisions, and any additional PPE
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2
Communication<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before starting any piping system inspection and/or maintenance activities (NDE, pressure testing, repair, or
alteration), personnel should obtain permission from operating personnel responsible for the piping to work in
the vicinity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When individuals are inside large piping systems, all persons working around the equipment should be
informed that people are working inside the piping. Individuals working inside the piping should be informed
when any work is going to be done on the exterior of the piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3
Preparatory Work<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All possible preparatory work should be done before the scheduled start of inspection. Scaffolds should be
erected, insulation removed, and surface preparation completed where required. Buried piping should be
excavated at the points to be inspected. Equipment required for personal safety should be checked to
determine its availability and condition. Any necessary warning signs should be obtained in advance, and
barricades should be erected around all excavations. The appropriate signs and barricades as required by the
site and jurisdiction should be in place before radiography is performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All tools, equipment, and PPE used during piping work (i.e. inspection, NDE, pressure testing, repairs, and
alterations) should be checked for damage and/or operability prior to use. NDE equipment and the repair
organization’s equipment are subject to the owner/user’s safety requirements for electrical equipment. Other
equipment that might be needed for the piping system access, such as planking, scaffolding, and portable
ladders, should be checked for adequacy and safety before being used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During preparation of piping systems for inspection, PPE should be worn when required either by regulations,
the owner/user, or the repair organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tools needed for inspection should be checked for availability, proper working condition, calibration, and
accuracy. The following tools and instruments are often used in inspection of piping:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

protective coatings, dirt, or corrosion products so that the surface is properly prepared for the inspection
technique (e.g. inspection for cracks with MT).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4
Investigation of Leaks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On-stream piping leaks in process units can occur for various reasons. Those who investigate the leak may
be particularly at risk to the consequence associated with release of the process fluid. A site may want to
create a general safety procedure to be followed during a piping leak investigation. A further precaution is to
hold a safety review before any leak investigation. The review would consider the state of a piping system in
terms of pressure, temperature, remaining inventory of process fluids, potential damage mechanisms, and
similar factors. Where piping may be significantly thinned rather than contain isolated defects, potential pipe
rupture is more likely and should be taken into consideration when investigating leaks or during firefighting
efforts. Reference API 2001 for more information on leak response protocol.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The safety review team should define:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) a “hot zone” around the leak site and establish PPE and additional firefighting equipment requirements to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>perform work inside this zone;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) decontamination requirements upon exit from the hot zone and other requirements necessary to protect<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>personnel and the environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The safety review team must be careful making assumptions about the leak’s cause. Incidents have occurred
where investigative personnel assumed they knew the cause of a small leak on an operating line and were
caught unprepared when the leak suddenly became quite large.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10 Inspection Procedures and Practices<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1 External Visual Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
10.1.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External visual inspections are performed to determine the external condition of piping, insulation system,
painting/coating systems, and associated hardware and to check for signs of misalignment, vibration, and
leakage. Annex A contains a sample checklist.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Leaks
10.1.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leaks can be safety or fire hazards. They can cause premature shutdown of equipment and often result in
economic loss. Leaks in utility piping are seldom hazardous or cause shutdowns, but they do result in loss.
Leaks in hot or volatile oil, gas, and chemical piping can result in a fire, an explosion, contamination of the
surrounding atmosphere, a serious environmental problem, or a premature shutdown. Frequent visual
surveillance should be made for leaks. Particular attention should be given to flanged joints, packing glands,
bonnets of valves, and expansion joints on piping that carries flammable, toxic, corrosive, or other harmful
materials. Many leaks can be stopped or minimized by tightening packing glands.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tightening flange bolts in a pressurized line is only recommended when special steps are taken to avoid three
potential problems:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) bolt interactions—when a bolt is tightened the adjacent bolts are loosened,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) a bolt can yield or fail due to overloading,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) tightening one side of a flange can cause deflections in the areas opposite and adjacent to it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_76>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
69<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leaks of certain fluids can result in the cracking and/or corrosion of flange bolts; in such services, the bolts
should be replaced. The prompt repair of leaks will often prevent serious corrosion or erosion of gasket
surfaces or packing glands. Temporary or permanent repairs can possibly be made while lines are in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wet hydrogen sulfide stress cracking and hydrogen blistering in systems in sour (H 2 S laden) service may
occur externally if trapped due a leak that is clamped.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Misalignment
10.1.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping should be inspected for misalignment, which can be indicated by the following conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) piping dislodged from one or more supports so that its weight is not being properly distributed on the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>remaining hangers or saddles;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the deformation of a vessel or tank wall in the vicinity of a piping attachment, which may also be the result<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of thermal expansion in the piping system or major piping misalignment or inadequate piping support;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) piping supports forced out of plumb by expansion or contraction of the piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) excessive replacement or repair of bearings, impellers, and turbine wheels of centrifugal pumps,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>compressors, and turbine seals to which piping is connected;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) the shifting of a base plate, breaking of a foundation, or shearing of foundation bolts of mechanical<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>equipment to which piping is attached;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
cracks in connecting flanges or the cases of pumps or turbines to which piping is attached;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) expansion joints that are excessively deformed or not performing properly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If significant piping misalignment is discovered, it should be promptly corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Supports
10.1.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General Pipe Support Inspection
10.1.4.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Support locations should be identified in appropriate record systems and inspected to verify that the supports
are functioning properly and are not causing damage to the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The prioritization of support inspections may be made on the basis of likelihood of damage or may be made
on the basis of a risk assessment that also considers the consequence of a failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Statistical techniques may be used to determine the required inspection sample size to ensure the necessary
degree of confidence. Site-specific data related to historical piping support problems should be referenced to
better understand the vulnerability of particular support design, location, or application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Statistical analysis may be used to evaluate the inspection data collected during sampling inspections and
determine if additional inspection, up to and including 100 % inspection of particular piping supports and/or
designs is warranted. Close visual inspection of piping supports or touch point locations may provide
additional data to help determine where more detailed, quantitative techniques are required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External inspection of supports should include the following examinations where applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Visual examination for general physical damage, distortion, and deterioration of protective coatings or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>fireproofing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Visual examination for evidence of corrosion, especially at or near touch points, the foundation<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>attachments, and near dummy legs (trunnions).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Close visual examination of the touch point area between the piping and support can identify corrosion
damage by the presence of rust buildup and/or paint blistering and discoloring. However, the severity of
corrosion cannot always be assessed without further examinations. Further, highly localized corrosion
may be missed as the visual appearance may not be significant. Mirrors can be used with great
advantage when inspecting support locations with limited access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dummy leg drain holes should be examined to ensure they are open and unobstructed. Water should
never be allowed to accumulate within a piping support trunnion. The dummy leg drain holes should not
be sitting on any structural supports, which may allow water to wick into any horizontal closed dummy leg.
Vertical dummy legs should have a drain hole at the bottom. Water should never be allowed to
accumulate within a piping support trunnion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lifting pipe from supports or touch points using a crane or other lifting equipment can allow for a more
accurate determination of condition and extent of damage. Lifting a pipe, which may already have
suffered corrosion, can be hazardous and should be carried out with extreme caution. Safety precautions
for lifting the pipe will vary depending on the fluid contained, line pressure, anticipated pipe condition, and
location on site/off site. This should involve a job safety analysis prior to performing the task. In some
instances, the pipe lifting may be considered too hazardous for particular fluids (e.g. propane), or for
particular services if the line cannot be depressurized. If external corrosion is evident, any external
cleaning using mechanical means, abrasive blasting, or high-pressure water blasting should be done with
extreme caution so as to minimize the chance of prematurely causing a loss of containment event.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Support removal and temporary support placement, when possible, can also be an effective method to
gain access and allow for a more thorough examination. When removing support, or using temporary
support, the same precautions apply as for lifting pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Visual examination for signs of movement, restricted operation of pipe rollers, slide plates, pulleys, or pivot<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>points in counterbalanced support systems. Inspection should also include a search for small branch
connections that are against pipe supports that might be constraining thermal movement of the larger line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Visual examination for deterioration of concrete footings, foundations, or plinth blocks. If deterioration of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>concrete footings is found, the cause should be determined and corrective action should be taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Visual examination for failed fireproofing at support locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Visual examination for failed or loosening of foundation anchor bolts. Loose foundation bolts can be found
by lightly rapping the bolt sideways with a hammer while holding a finger against the opposite side in
contact with the bearing plate. Movement of the bolt will be easily detected. Trying the bolts by tightening
the nuts with a wrench may also indicate loosening. Broken bolts can be detected using the same methods
used to find loose bolts. Shifting of the bearing plate on its foundation can indicate that the foundation bolts
are sheared.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Visual examination for insecure attachment of brackets and beams to the support, or insecure attachment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or improper adjustment of pipe hangers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Visual examination of spring can integrity and proper operation. For spring supports, the following items<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>need to be inspected for any evidence of corrosion or mechanical overload:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) spring can,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) spring,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Spring hanger loads should be checked under both cold and hot conditions, and the readings obtained
should be checked against the original cold and hot readings. Improper spring support settings can cause
excessive pipe loads on rotating equipment that can result in misalignment. Other factors such as
differential settlement and creep can make alternate settings necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Ultrasonic thickness measurements or profile radiography used to determine corrosion damage should
include the center of dummy leg (trunnion) support attachments, unless drain holes are present and
historical inspection have determined that no pipe external corrosion exists within the dummy leg. A
measurement of pipe thickness should include the center of the dummy leg attachment and be taken as
near as possible to the edge where water may sit in the dummy leg.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Special Emphasis Support Inspection
10.1.4.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are several types of specialized NDE techniques that may allow inspection of touch points without lifting
of the pipe or removal of the support. Some of these techniques may also be suitable for inspection of piping
at dummy leg (trunnion) attachments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Long-range Ultrasonic Technique: Ultrasonic Guided Wave Inspection—Low-frequency ultrasonic guided<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>waves can be used for detection of internal and external corrosion from a single point of access on the pipe to
a distance of about 30 m (98 ft) in both directions. The distance and effectiveness may be reduced by factors
such as fittings, flanges, heavy external coatings and concrete, and heavy products inside the pipe. This
technology cannot differentiate between internal and external corrosion or may not locate the most severe
localized corrosion; however, it can be used as a screening tool. When supports are welded to the pipe,
detection of defects is not effective. Highly localized corrosion is not reliably detected with long-range UT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) Ultrasound—The EMAT system can be used to inspect pipe<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>support locations on live, on-stream process piping. This monitors ultrasonic Lamb wave mode and
velocity changes and enables defects at support locations to be detected and sized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The EMAT system does not require contact or a couplant, and the ultrasonic transducers use magnetic
waves and high-current tone bursts to generate Lamb waves. These waves propagate circumferentially
around the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Transducers housed in a scanner that moves along the pipe measure the mode and velocity changes of
the Lamb waves and convert the output into readings of wall thickness. The accuracy can vary depending
on the defect characteristic and material thickness. The owner/user should consider validating the
performance accuracy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EMAT can (at the time of document release) be used to survey pipe diameters 100 mm to 600 mm NPS
(4 in. to 24 in. NPS)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Creeping Head Wave Method—The Creeping Head Wave Method is able to detect corrosion of a pipe at a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>distance from the point of access. It requires contact with the pipe in two locations, one at either side of the
pipe support (maximum effective span between transducer heads is 1 m).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic compression waves are launched along the surface of the pipe and result in the production of
shear waves in the body of the material. When the shear waves reach the opposite side of the pipe wall,
they convert back to compression surface-skimming waves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion and other flaws result in a scattering of surface-skimming waves, and they can therefore be
located and sized based on an analysis of the waves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The presence of too much debris can prevent the technique from being effective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_79>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>72
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Creeping Head Wave Method results are usually reported by estimating the defect severity into three
ranges that include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Defect of less than 10 % through-wall thickness loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Defect of between 10 % and 40 % through-wall thickness loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Defect of greater than 40 % through-wall thickness loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Creeping Head Wave Method can also be utilized to survey for corrosion between pipe and saddle
supports.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
When choosing a special emphasis inspection technique for supports, some techniques such as Ultrasonic
Guided Wave and Creeping Head Wave Method may not be effective at detecting localized corrosion areas with near
through-wall depths and should not be relied upon to find this type of defect. Other inspection and sampling techniques
should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Pipe Support Risk Ranking
10.1.4.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk assessment may be considered to identify vulnerable pipe supports and in deciding where sample
inspection may and may not be used. Determination of the most vulnerable areas should consider the
following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Factors affecting likelihood of damage include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Is the support of a type that has a history of giving problems (e.g. open dummy legs, beam supports,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and saddle clamps)? Supports with a flat surface, such as H beams and those listed above, provide a
crevice for retention of water, which can promote corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Does the support design promote continuous moist conditions (e.g. contact with insulation)?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Is there an effective coating on the pipe in the area of the support?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) Is the support in an area of the plant that is particularly wet (e.g. near cooling towers)?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5) Is the temperature in the area of contact such that corrosion could be accelerated?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6) Could pipe movement result in distortion or high local stresses on the pipe in the area of the support?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7) Age.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Factors affecting consequence of failure like the health and safety hazards to personnel if leaks occur, the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>impact on the environment, the unavailability of equipment, and any resultant financial impact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) On-site and Off-site Areas—There is usually no distinction between on-site and off-site areas in terms of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>corrosion vulnerability. However, the location can have corrosion contributing factors like flooding or lack of
drainage, weeds, mud, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Vibration
10.1.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If vibration or swaying is observed, welds should be inspected for cracks, particularly at points of restraint,
such as areas where piping is attached to equipment and near anchors. Problems frequently occur at small
welded and screwed connections that have a heavy valve that accentuates vibration and at small lines that
are tied down to a larger line and forced to move with it. Additional support should be considered for poorly
braced small-sized piping and valves and for the main vibrating line to which they are attached. In cases of
severe vibration, it may be advisable to have a competent consultant recommend a remedy, particularly if
specialized equipment, such as a pulsation bottle or sway stabilizers, may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>External Corrosion
10.1.6<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Defects in protective coatings and the waterproof coating of insulation will permit moisture to come into
contact with the piping. When defects are found in the waterproof coating of insulation, either enough
insulation should be removed or the affected area should be radiographed to determine the extent and
severity of the corrosion. Sections of insulation may be removed from small connections, such as bleed lines
and gauge connections, since difficulty in obtaining a good seal in the insulation makes these locations
particularly vulnerable to external corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lines that sweat are susceptible to deterioration at areas of support. Corrosion can be found under clamps on
suspended lines. Piping mounted on rollers or welded support shoes is subject to moisture accumulation with
resultant corrosion. Liquid spilled on piping, the impingement of a jet of steam, and water dripping on a line
can cause deterioration. Loss of vapor-sealing mastic from the insulation of piping in cold service can result in
local corrosion. Pipe walls inside open-ended trunion supports are subject to corrosion. All of these points
should be investigated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A loss in thickness can be determined by comparing the pipe diameter at the corroded area with the original
pipe diameter. The depth of pits can be determined with a pit-depth gauge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bolting should also be checked, especially in marine environments and other corrosive environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Accumulations of Corrosive Liquids
10.1.7<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spilled liquid that has seeped into the ground can usually be located by looking for discoloration of the earth.
The spill should be investigated to determine whether the liquid is corrosive to steel. This may involve a
chemical analysis of soil samples or of the liquid, unless the source of the spill is known.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Hot Spots
10.1.8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping operating at temperatures higher than the design limit or in the creep range, even without higher
pressure, can experience bulging. In piping that is protected from excessive temperatures by internal
insulating refractory, failure of the insulation will result in overheating of the metal wall, causing a hot spot. The
excessive temperature greatly reduces the strength of the metal and can cause bulging, scaling, localized
buckling, metal deterioration, or complete failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Frequent inspection should be performed to detect hot spots on internally insulated piping. Any bulging or
scaling should be noted for further investigation when the equipment is shut down. Some hot spots can be
detected by a red glow, particularly if the inspection is made in the dark. The skin temperature of indicated
hot spots should be measured using a portable thermocouple, temperature-indicating crayons,
temperature-indicating paints, thermography, or a pyrometer. To ensure that an in-service rupture does not
occur, the amount of bulging should not exceed the amount of creep permitted for the material. As an
interim measure, cooling severe hot spots with steam, water, or air may be desirable or necessary until the
system can be removed from service (this situation should be reviewed by a piping engineer). The condition
of both the pipe metal and the internal insulation near hot spots should be investigated during the next
shutdown period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the time available,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the accuracy desired,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>UT instruments are now the primary means of obtaining thickness measurements on equipment. Radiography
and real-time radiography may also be used in a limited way to determine thickness of piping components.
Methods such as depth drilling (i.e. sentinel or tell-tale holes), the use of corrosion buttons, and the use of test
holes may be applied at some special locations. However, these methods have generally been replaced by
NDE methods of thickness gauging, such as ultrasonic thickness measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic instruments are widely used for thickness measurements and have become standard equipment in
most petrochemical inspection organizations. The major advantages to utilizing digital thickness instruments
are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) most instruments weigh no more than several pounds and are small enough that they are not<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>cumbersome,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) digital meters are economical to purchase and maintain compared to many other instruments,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) training and experience requirements are less than would be required for flaw detection and weld quality<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, the degree of training and experience required in order to ensure true and accurate measurements
are obtained can be considerable and should not be underestimated. Owner/users should ensure that
adequate training, examination, and certification of personnel takes place such as outlined in
ASNT SNT-TC-1A or equivalent international standards. Personnel using these devices should have training
on the proper use of this equipment, including ultrasonic theory, high-temperature thickness measurements,
corrosion evaluation, midwall anomalies, potential for “doubling,” and equipment operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Thickness Instruments
10.2.1.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.1.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are three types of digital ultrasonic thickness instruments: numeric thickness readout, A-scan with
numeric thickness readout, and flaw detectors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.1.2.2 Numeric Thickness Readout<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thickness readout instruments are small handheld pulse-echo thickness gauges with only a numeric readout.
These instruments typically are equipped with dual-element pitch-catch transducers. The instruments have a
probe zero and a velocity setting for calibration on various materials. The range on for these instruments
usually ranges from 0.040 in. to 20.000 in., depending on the configuration. The instruments operate by
measuring the time between the initial pulse (IP) and the first echo.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of numeric thickness readout only instruments should be carefully considered as they have been
misused and misapplied within the industry and can lead to erroneous and inaccurate results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.1.2.3 A-scan with Numeric Thickness Readout<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-scan with thickness readout instruments are divided into two groups, thickness measurement and flaw
detectors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A-scan thickness measurement instruments incorporate a numeric display and an electronic display for
viewing an A-scan presentation. The displays are usually liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or light-emitting
diodes (LEDs). Some of these instruments have the ability to display both A- and B-scans.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The advantage to an A-scan display over a numeric display is that it allows the examiner to view the ultrasonic
waveform to verify the proper signal is being measured by the instrument. This is extremely important in the
case of doubling and for evaluating a laminar indication vs. corrosion damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Doubling occurs when measuring wall thickness below the instrument/transducers ability to separate the
signals adequately for proper measurement gate function. This problem can occur on thin wall below
approximately <0.1 in. thickness and for evaluating a laminar indication vs. corrosion damage. It is equally
important when using echo-to-echo mode due to mode converted shear wave echoes occurring between the
backwall echoes. The measuring gate can lock on the signal mode converted shear wave echo, causing
incorrect wall thickness measurement, as shown in Figure 23.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Occurring Between the Backwall Echoes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The A-scan display aids the examiner in distinguishing between a corroded surface and a midwall anomaly
(e.g. laminar inclusion). The reflected signal from a laminar inclusion will come straight up from the baseline at
a point prior to the reflected backwall signal indicating the depth. Often, while scanning a corroded area, the
signal from corrosion will break the baseline at the backwall signal and the corrosion signal will move toward
the IP signal until the minimum thickness is reached. This movement is due to the sound reflecting from the
edges of the corrosion until the thinnest area is being reflected. This movement of the corroded signal is often
referred to as “walking the signal.”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A-scan instruments typically have the ability to operate in either of two timing modes, the IP timing mode or
the multiple echo modes. The IP timing mode measures the transit time from the IP to the first echo. The
multiple echo mode allows the examiner to set the instrument to measure between a set of multiple
successive echoes instead of the IP to first in order to establish the thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The multiple echo mode is used for measuring the remaining thickness on specimens with coated surfaces
without including the coating thickness. This is accomplished by measuring the travel time between two
successive backwall signals to obtain the thickness of the material and not including the travel time due to the
thickness of the coating. When using this mode, the examiner should pay careful attention to the A-scan
display to ensure that the proper signals are being measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion evaluation should be conducted using the IP timing mode. The reflected energy on rough and
corroded or pitted surfaces is often times only strong enough to produce a single signal, and the instrument
will indicate “0.000” when in the multiple echo mode because it requires two echoes to measure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where a component is painted at the measurement location and is corroded on the reflection side
(which can cause lack of sufficient echo-to-echo signal and therefore measurement error), the paint should be
removed for accurate thickness measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>UT thickness gauges and certain transducers can measure the thickness of paint and wall thickness
simultaneously.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These instruments primarily use a 0.250-in. to 0.500-in. diameter, 2.0 MHz to 5.0 MHz, dual-element
pitch-catch search unit, but some instruments have options to use single-element delay or even EMATs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.1.2.4 Ultrasonic Flaw Detectors with a Numeric Display<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic flaw detectors with a numeric display are similar to the A-scan thickness gauges in that they have
both an A-scan and a numeric display and can be used with single- or dual-element transducers. These
instruments are more advanced than the others and typically have a lot more options and features, including
the capability for angle beam examinations. However, modern UT thickness gauges utilize features that
enhance the accuracy of thickness measurement, typically resulting in improved accuracy of measurement
over flaw detectors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flaw detectors with numeric displays can be operated in either the IP or multiple echo timing modes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other applications requiring the use of ultrasonic flaw detectors are weld quality examinations, advanced flaw
sizing, and high-temperature hydrogen attack detection. Weld quality examinations (angle beam) use
specially designed transducer wedges to generate shear waves at 45°, 60°, or 70° for detecting, evaluating,
and sizing of flaws. Flaws that can be detected are cracks, slag, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, and
porosity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Advanced crack-sizing techniques for measuring the through-wall extent of the cracks include the use of tip
diffraction, high-angled L-waves, 30-70-70 search units, and bimodal search units. All of the advanced
techniques require additional hours of classroom and field experience and the examiner pass a
performance-based demonstration examination. Other advanced ultrasonic testing technologies available for
detecting and evaluating and sizing flaws include time-of-flight diffraction (TOFD) and phased arrays.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>High-temperature hydrogen attack can be detected and evaluated utilizing other highly specialized ultrasonic
techniques, including ultrasonic backscatter and velocity ratio techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2.1.2.5 Some Factors Affecting Measurement Accuracy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic velocities are different in different materials. It is very important to use the proper velocity to obtain
accurate thickness measurements. The ultrasonic instrument determines the thickness by measuring the
roundtrip sound travel multiplied by the velocity and divided by two. The roundtrip sound travel is measured
from the pulse generation to the time the sound waves from the backwall or another reflector is received. The
wrong velocity can either increase or decrease the as-measured ultrasonic thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Laminar inclusions can cause erroneous readings. Because laminar inclusions create a planar interface
perpendicular to the direction of wave travel, they can reflect the sound back to the transducer. This reflected
signal can be misinterpreted as being the backwall signal and will be calculated as a thinner reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the ID surface is extremely rough or an irregular-shaped pit is encountered, often the only indication the
examiner may encounter is a lower amplitude backwall signal or a complete loss of the backwall signal. This
reduction or loss is due to the dispersion of the sound in the material and in turn there is not enough ultrasonic
energy received by the instrument that will produce a signal above the noise level. In cases as these, the
examiner should increase the gain setting on the instrument until the area where the diminished signal or loss
of signal occurred can be fully evaluated to the extent the examiner can determine a minimum thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

77<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Doubling occurs when measuring thin materials usually less than 0.100 in. (2.5 mm) and results in a reading
much thicker than the actual wall thickness. The reflected backwall signal is masked by the noise from the IP,
and the instrument reads the second or third reflection. Another occurrence of doubling can be caused in
extremely thin materials by the sound reflecting in the material producing an extra skip distance before it is
received, thereby doubling the travel time or sound distance and in turn doubling the measured thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each search unit should be tested to determine the minimum measurable thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sample steps are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) measure the thickness of a set of feeler gauges beginning at 0.100 in. (2.5 mm);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) measure the 0.090 in. (2.3 mm), 0.080 in. (2.0 mm), and so on, subtracting 0.010 in. (0.25 mm) every<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>reading until the as-measured thickness is two times or more than the actual thickness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) take the thickness where the doubling occurred and multiply by 1.5 times and this should be the minimum<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>measurable thickness for that search unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Corrosion Evaluations
10.2.1.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The best search units for conducting corrosion evaluation are dual-element transducers. The piezoelectric
elements in these search units are placed on slight angles for direct reflection of the transmitted sound toward
the receiving transducer. This tilting of the transducers also provides some pseudo focusing of the sound
beam. The dual-element search units provide better near-surface detection than conventional single-element
search units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency for the majority of search units ranges from 2 MHz to 5 MHz and the diameter from 0.25 in. to
0.500 in. (6.3 mm to 12.7 mm). Special applications such as thick [>6.00 in. (152 mm)] materials, product
forms such as castings, or coarse grain materials such as high-alloy or high-nickel steels can require lower
frequencies (1 MHz) and/or larger diameter search units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Search units used for corrosion detection or evaluation should have a good wear surface on the face of the
search unit to allow the examiner to scan corroded areas for the minimum reading and minimize the wear on
the search unit. When conducting corrosion detection or evaluation, the examiner should scan the area of
interest with the search unit in lieu of conducting individual point measurements. Scanning provides a greater
chance of detecting small diameter (less than one-half of the search unit diameter) indications than taking
point measurements. The examiner should not scan faster than the A-scan displays refresh rate to avoid
missing a small indication. This is typically 6 in./s (152 mm/s) or less. Additionally, the examiner should
overlap each scan path by a minimum of 10 % of the transducer diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>High-temperature Thickness Measurements
10.2.1.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The search unit is the most important component of the thickness testing equipment for high-temperature
measurements. Some high-temperature search units are designed to withstand temperatures up to 1000 °F
(538 °C) for very brief durations of time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Special delay-line materials and water-cooled transducers are available that permit the use of pulse-echo
instruments at temperatures up to 1100 °F (593 °C).The majority of high-temperature dual-element search
units are manufactured with the delay material built into the case, while most single-element search units
come with replaceable delays.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The duty cycle is another critical factor for the high-temperature search units. The search unit should be
allowed to cool down between thickness measurements. This is especially critical in the case of the
dual-element search units. Even though these search units are manufactured to withstand the high
temperatures, continued use at elevated temperatures will cause these units to begin to breakdown. As a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_85>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>78
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>general rule of thumb, the search unit should be allowed to cool down between thickness measurements
where the examiner can comfortably hold it in their bare hand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The second most critical element for performing high-temperature thickness measurements is the ultrasonic
couplant. There are several high-temperature couplants commercially available. The desirable characteristics
of a couplant should be one with good acoustic properties, good chemical stability at elevated temperatures,
the ability to withstand decomposition, the ability to remain on vertical surfaces for 10 seconds or longer, high
boiling temperature, nonflammable, and nontoxic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test specimen temperature affects the UT thickness measurement. As the test specimen temperature
increases above ambient temperature, the velocity of the material decreases, thereby increasing the as-
measured ultrasonic thickness by a factor of 1 %/100 °F (1 %/55 °C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some modern UT thickness gauges have a feature that provides automatic temperature compensation. The
surface temperature to be examined is measured with a pyrometer. The operator keys in the temperature of
the surface being examined. The UT thickness gauge automatically compensates for the change in velocity
due to elevated temperature (see Figure 24 for an example). The inspector should be cautioned when using
such gauges. The UT thickness procedures should clearly describe how thickness data is collected when the
metal temperature is greater than a defined temperature. The inspector should understand if and when the
Inspection Data Management System (IDMS) that will be storing and analyzing the thickness data may also
be used to compensate for temperature differences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Gamma-radiographic techniques provide accurate pipe wall measurements and permit inspection of the
internals of some equipment. The primary functions of this method are to detect metal loss and check weld
quality. Radiography has the following advantages:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) pipe insulation can remain intact;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the metal temperature of the line has little bearing on the quality of the radiograph, provided the film<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) radiographs of small pipe connections, such as nipples and couplings, can be examined for thread contact,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>corrosion, and weld quality;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) film provides a permanent visual record of the condition of the piping at the time of the radiograph;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
provides a view of a large area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gamma rays traveling through the pipe wall between the outside and inside radii of the pipe must penetrate
metal that is approximately four times the wall thickness of the pipe. Most of the rays are absorbed by the
metal, leaving an unexposed area on the film. This area that is lighter on the darkened film represents a
slightly enlarged projected image of the pipe wall. The image can be measured, and a correcting calculation
can establish the thickness of the pipe wall. Any deposits or scale inside the pipe usually appear on the
developed film as distinctly separate from the pipe wall. Pitting can also be visible on the film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Computed radiography (CR) can be utilized in place of film radiography, reducing exposure times and
producing a digital image this is easily archived and electronically transmitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because isotope radiography gives the inspector an “internal look” in the pipe, the somewhat higher cost of
this inspection can be more than offset by the data obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ionizing radiation is the base principle in industrial radiography, and the most common radiation sources are
iridium and cobalt. There are significant safety issues surrounding the use of ionizing radiation such that
personnel performing RT are required to be trained and certified as identified in API 570 and ASME  BPVC
Section V, plus any jurisdictional requirements. Correct procedures must be established and implemented to
ensure the safety of examiners and all other plant personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RT thickness measurement accuracy relies somewhat on the abilities of the radiographic technician exposing
the films and the person reviewing them. When using RT for this purpose, it is advisable to develop a written
practice defining the method(s) of film placement, exposure, and reading or interpreting them. Radiographic
test shots should be taken of piping, which can be examined with UT thickness measurements to determine
the limits of accuracy of the RT once it has been developed. In addition, a test piece of known thickness can
be placed on the same plane as the radiograph, which will help define radiographic magnification factors.
Multiple caliper thickness readings of the shot will improve the precision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When radiographic inspection is being performed, process-unit control systems, which use isotopes in
liquid-level indicators and controls, occasionally give erroneous indications on control panels. Flame detectors
used to indicate a furnace or boiler fire can also be affected. Unit operators must be warned of this possibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Profile RT is particularly useful for identifying internal and external corrosion of small connections, such as
bleed lines and gauge connections, which are especially susceptible to external corrosion from CUI since it is
difficult to obtain a good seal in the insulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiographs of piping are shown in Figure 25, Figure 26, and Figure 27.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Caliper Thickness Measurements
10.2.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When piping is opened, the thickness of the pipe and fittings can be measured behind the flange using
transfer or indicating calipers. The thickness of inaccessible piping that cannot be measured by radiographic
or ultrasonic instruments during operation can be measured with these instruments during shutdown. If need
be, the thickness of valve bodies and bonnets and pipe fittings can be measured using transfer or indicating
calipers that have special legs designed to reach inaccessible areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Corrosion, Erosion, and Fouling
10.3.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping can be opened at various places by removing a valve or fitting or by springing the pipe apart at flanges
to permit visual inspection. The internal surfaces of the piping should be inspected visually over the greatest
possible area. A flashlight or extension light is usually sufficient for this task, but a probe such as a borescope
or a mirror and light will permit a more detailed view. Other inspection methods include optical/laser and
mechanical calipers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_88>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
81<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where nonuniform corrosion or erosion conditions are noted in areas that are accessible for visual
examination, it may be advisable to perform an RT or to measure thicknesses with ultrasonic instruments to
extend coverage to parts of the piping that are inaccessible for visual examination. This applies particularly to
piping that could not be or was not inspected during operation. Nonuniform corrosion or erosion can also be
pinpointed for closer examination by directing sunlight along the surface of the piping with a mirror or by
shining a light parallel to the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The amount of fouling should be noted to determine whether cleaning is necessary. Fouling should be
investigated to determine whether it consists of deposits from the product stream or is a buildup of corrosion
products. Taking samples for chemical analysis may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Cracks
10.3.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The locations most susceptible to cracking are welds and the heat-affected zones including fillet welds at
other than pressure welds, heat-affected areas adjoining welds, and points of restraint or excessive strain.
Other areas prone to cracking are locations that contain crevices, such as socket-welded piping, flange
surfaces, or threaded joints. Locations that are subject to SCC, hydrogen attack, and caustic or amine
embrittlement also require attention, as do exposed threads of threaded joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspected surface should be clean if cracks are to be detected. Cleaning can be accomplished by wire
brushing, sandblasting, or chemically removing coatings, deposits, and corrosion products. After thorough
cleaning, the area should be visually inspected for any indications of cracks. (Spot checking by MT, PT, or UT
should be considered even if visual inspection revealed no cracks.) Adequate lighting and a good magnifying
glass will assist in locating such indications. Visual inspection may not differentiate between a surface scratch
and a crack. Any apparent scratch should be further investigated by other methods. MT can be used on
magnetic materials. PT and UT can be used on both nonmagnetic and magnetic materials. Only liquid
penetrants with low or no chlorides should be used for austenitic materials. Other methods such as shear- or
surface-wave UT, ET, ACFM, or sample removal for microscopic inspection may be used. The depth of a
crack may be determined by NDE or by chipping or grinding until sound metal is reached. The inspector
should determine if the area can be repaired properly before commencing to grind, however.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Gasket Faces of Flanges
10.3.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gasket seating faces of flanged joints that have been opened should be visually inspected for corrosion
and defects such as scratches, cuts, and gouges that might cause leakage. The gasket faces should be
checked for warping by placing a straight edge across the diameter of the face of the flange and rotating it
around an axis through the flange centerline. Grooves and rings of ring joints should be checked for defects,
including cracks at the bottom of the grooves or on the sealing surfaces. For HF alkylation services, see
specific recommendations in API 751 on inspection for flange face corrosion. Phased array ultrasonic testing
(PAUT) is a potential method for inspecting for flange face corrosion without having to disassemble flanges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Valves
10.3.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally, valves used in process piping systems have body thicknesses somewhat heavier than adjoining
piping. For this reason, an adequate piping corrosion-monitoring program need not routinely include
monitoring of valve body thicknesses. However, in piping circuits where corrosion rate monitoring of piping
indicates severe corrosion or erosion, consideration should be given to routinely measuring thicknesses of
selected valve bodies in the circuit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In severe services, such as HF, slurry, and fluidized catalyst services, valves may need to be dismantled and
inspected at specified intervals to ensure that internal parts are of sufficient integrity to provide reliable and
safe operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Whenever valves are removed from service for overhaul or refurbished for reuse, they should be inspected
and tested to the requirements of API 598. When a valve is disassembled for inspection, the bonnet gasket
should be replaced. Any valve parts that do not meet the minimum requirements of the applicable valve<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_89>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>82
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>standard should be either repaired or replaced. The used valves should then be restored for continued safe
operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When body thicknesses are measured, the measurements should include locations that were inaccessible
before dismantling, particularly at areas that show evidence of corrosion or erosion. Bodies of valves that
operate in severe cyclic temperature service should be checked internally for cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gate valves should be measured for thickness between the seats, since turbulence can cause serious
deterioration. This is a particularly weak location because of the wedging action of the disc, or wedge, when
the valve is closed. The seating surfaces should be visually inspected for defects that might cause leakage.
The wedge guides should be inspected for corrosion and erosion, both on the wedge and in the body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The stem and the threads on the stem and in the bonnet should be examined for corrosion. The connection
between the stem and the wedge should be inspected to ensure that the wedge will not detach from the stem
during operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Swing-check valves can be inspected by removing the cover or cap. Check valves often flutter, making the
shaft and hinges the principal points of deterioration. The disc should be checked for free rotation, and the nut
holding either to the arm should be checked for security and the presence of a locking pin, lock washer, or
tack weld. The arm should be free to swing, and the anchor pin or shaft should be inspected for wear. The
seating surfaces on both the disc and the valve body can be checked for deterioration by feeling them with the
fingers. It is extremely important that the cover is installed in the proper orientation for the wedge to operate
properly. Refer to API 570 for requirements for inspection of critical check valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quarter-turn valves can be inspected for ease of operation and the ability to open and close completely by
operators. When they are serviced, all seating surfaces should also be examined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When valves are reported by operators to have “operability” problems like leaking through the gate when fully
closed, a review of the potential for that leakage to cause or accelerate deterioration downstream of the valve
should be conducted to help establish the priority for valve replacement and the need of increased inspection
of downstream piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Joints
10.3.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
10.3.5.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods of inspection for specific types of joints are discussed in 10.3.5.2 through 10.3.5.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Flanged and Bolted Joints
10.3.5.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sites should have a program to ensure that flanges are made up properly. Proper makeup of every flange in a
piping system is important for reliability. Proper makeup includes the use of the proper gasket and fastener
material, type, and size, proper positioning of the gasket, and proper torqueing of the fasteners. The
assurance program should include procedures for gasket and fastener selection and for fastener torqueing.
ASME PCC-1 offers good guidance on proper makeup of bolted flange joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The program can incorporate varying degrees of sampling, visual inspection, field testing, and destructive
testing of components. Gasket selection can usually be confirmed by visual examination of the gasket’s color
and markings on the OD surface. Spiral-wound gaskets should be marked and color coded in accordance
with ASME B16.20. Fasteners can be visually examined for proper stampings or markings and PMI tested in
accordance with API 578. Proper gasket positioning and torqueing depends on the training and craftsmanship
of the pipefitters making up the flanges. Gasket positioning can be checked visually. Proper torqueing is
difficult to check, but flange deformation can be a sign of improperly torqued fasteners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flanged joints should be visually inspected for cracks and metal loss caused by corrosion and erosion when
they are opened. See 10.3.3 for methods of inspection for cracks. Inspection of gasket faces is covered in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
83<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10.3.4. Flange joints can be inspected while in service by applying single-element or phased array UTs to the
external surfaces to measure flange face corrosion and to detect ring groove cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flange bolts should be inspected for stretching and corrosion. Where excessive bolt loading is indicated or
where flanges are deformed, a nut can be rotated along the entire length of the stud. If the stud is stretched,
the thread pitch will be changed and the nut will not turn freely. Inspection involves checking to determine
whether bolts of the proper specification have been used, and it may involve chemical analysis or physical
tests to determine the yield point and the ultimate strength of the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If flanges are bolted too tightly, they can bend until the outer edges of the flanges are in contact. When this
occurs, the pressure on the gasket can be insufficient to ensure a tight joint. Visual inspection of the gasket
will reveal this condition. Permanently deformed flanges should be replaced or refaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Welded Joints
10.3.5.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some services, welds can preferentially corrode. The inspection program should look at a sampling of
welds if corrosion at welds is suspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welded joints may be subject to leaks caused either by cracks or by corrosion or erosion. Cracks in alloy-steel
welds are often associated with excessive hardness resulting from improper control of preheat or PWHT. The
hardness of air-hardenable alloy-steel welds should therefore be checked after heat treatment. Carbon steel
welds in environmental cracking service should be checked for hardness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion can occur in the form of pitting that has penetrated the weld or the adjacent heat-affected metal.
Both pitting and welding defects can be detected by radiography. If severe defects are suspected and
radiography is not feasible, the affected area can be chipped or gouged out until sound metal is reached, and
the groove can be rewelded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welded joints in carbon steel and carbon-molybdenum steel exposed to elevated temperatures of 800 °F
(426 °C) or greater can be subject to graphitization. When graphitization is suspected, a sample should be
taken from a welded joint and examined metallurgically for evidence of excessive graphitization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Threaded Joints
10.3.5.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Threaded joints can leak because of improper assembly, loose threads, corrosion, poor fabrication, cross
threading, through crack in the root of a thread, or threads that are dirty at the time of assembly. Lack of
thread lubricant or the use of the wrong lubricant can also cause leaks. If the leak cannot be stopped by
tightening the joint, the joint should be unscrewed and visually examined to determine the cause of the leak.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Caution—A leaking threaded joint should not be tightened while the system is in service under
pressure unless there is reasonable certainty that the leak is not caused by a crack in the threads. An
undetected crack in a thread root could open up significantly and cause a release of product with
serious consequences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Clamped Joints
10.3.5.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A clamped joint that depends on machined surfaces for tightness can leak because of dirt, corrosion of the
mating faces, mechanical damage, or failure of the clamp to provide sufficient force on the mating faces for
proper contact. A clamped joint that depends on a gasket for tightness can leak because of damaged or dirty
gasket seating surfaces or failure of the clamp to provide sufficient pressure on the gasket. If tightening the
clamp does not stop the leak, the joint should be dismantled and visually inspected to determine the cause of
the leak. ASME PCC-2, Article 3.6 provides useful guidance on the design, limitations, fabrication, installation,
inspection, and testing of mechanical clamps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_91>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>84
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Caution—Certain kinds of clamped joints should not be used without adequate axial restraint on the
piping and sufficient pipe wall thickness at the ends of the clamp to resist collapsing by the clamping
forces. Other types of clamps are designed to provide adequate strength to the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Misalignment
10.3.6<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Often, misalignment is not apparent until the piping has cooled and has moved to its cold position. The
inspector should note, as in 10.1.3, indications of misalignment while the piping is cold. Note especially the
hot and cold position of spring hangers to determine if the hangers are adjusting properly to the changes in
piping positions from hot to cold. This is especially critical for large-diameter lines such as catalyst transfer
lines in FCC units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If misalignment of piping was noted during operation, the cause should be determined and corrected.
Misalignment is usually caused by the following conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) inadequate provision for expansion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) broken or defective anchors or guides;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) excessive friction on sliding saddles, indicating a lack of lubrication or a need for rollers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) broken rollers or rollers that cannot turn because of corrosion or lack of lubrication;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) broken or improperly adjusted hangers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
hangers that are too short and thus limit movement or cause lifting of the piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) excessive operating temperature;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) failure to remove the spring blocks after system construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Vibration
10.3.7<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where excessive vibration or swaying was noted during operation, an inspection should be made for points of
abrasion and external wear and for cracks in welds at locations that could not be inspected during operation.
The visual inspection methods described in 10.1.5 should be followed. This inspection should be
supplemented by surface NDE methods as applicable. The conditions causing excessive vibration or swaying
should be corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Hot Spots
10.3.8<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The internal insulation of piping should be visually inspected for bypassing or complete failure in locations of
hot spots on internally insulated piping noted during operation (see 10.1.8). The cause of the hot spot should
be corrected. The pipe wall near the hot spot should be visually inspected for oxidation and resultant scaling.
All the scale should be removed, and the remaining sound metal should be examined for incipient cracks. The
sound metal should be measured to ensure that sufficient thickness remains for the service. The OD of piping
in high-temperature service—metal temperatures of about 800 °F (427 °C) and above—should be measured
to check for creep or deformation with time under stress. To ensure that an in-service fracture will not occur,
the amount of creep permitted should be based on established data for the contemplated service life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Expansion Joints
10.3.9<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of expansion joints involves examinations both at maintenance outages and during operation prior
to shutdown and shortly after start-up. While in operation, the “hot” settings and position of connected pipe
supports/guides and the expansion joint should be recorded. Comparing measurements obtained prior to unit
shutdown and after start-up allows for changes to be identified and subsequently studied. In addition, the joint
and attached piping should be visually examined for alignment, distortion, cracks, and leaks. A check should
be made prior to start-up to make sure all stops and other restricting devices are removed and all components
are positioned in the cold setting. Temporary supports may be left in place as long as they will not interfere
with the piping expansion in the hot setting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

85<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Infrared thermography examination of the joint in high-temperature services can identify hot spots and bulk
temperature to determine both the joint is operating within its design temperature and any internal fiber
blanket and liner associated with the joint is functioning as designed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During maintenance outages, additional inspection activities may be performed. The “cold” position and
settings should be recorded and compared to previous “cold” and “hot” measurements. Changes should be
reviewed against design. The expansion joint should be visually examined externally and, if possible, internally.
Any external coverings should be removed to facilitate the inspection. The fabric in fabric joints should be
examined for rips, holes, and flexibility. Metal attachment rings and bolting should be examined for distortion
and corrosion. Metallic bellows may be examined with dye penetrant examination, ET, and UT for cracking.
Cracks can occur in convolutions, at piping attachment fillet welds, and on any internal liner attachment welds.
Thinning and pitting can occur in some services and should be examined during internal inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4 Nonmetallic Piping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
10.4.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nonmetallic piping systems are often used for fluids that are nontoxic, nonflammable, and environmentally
benign. However, in some circumstances, even these piping systems are critical considering economic or
operational consequences. Inspection intervals are probably best assessed using a risk-based approach.
Factors that influence the initial inspection date are the amount and quality of the supervision and inspection
performed during construction. The inspector should have adequate knowledge of FRP materials, resins,
reinforcements, laminate imperfections, and manufacturing techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, experience shows an initial inspection within the first 2 years of operation and subsequent intervals
being extended or reduced based on initial findings. A site experiencing a significant number of failures in the
early years of operation may need to increase inspection activities and shorten intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Initial Construction
10.4.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Visual examination and pressure testing are the primary inspection and testing methods used during original
construction. ASTM D2563 provides guidance for the visual examination of FRP components but is focused
on manufacturing and assembly. Some of the more stringent specifications require RT and/or bond inspection
tools of bonded nonmetallic joints. These are more advanced examinations to supplant the “coin tapping”
method for locating delaminated or disbonded areas close to the surface of nonmetallic piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure testing at up to 1.5 times design pressure will reveal leaks from major flaws such as severe impact
damage. Pressure tests, however, are not a guarantee of structural integrity. Joints with up to 85 % disbond
have reportedly passed pressure tests. The use of acoustic emission monitoring during pressure testing can
identify material failure occurring prior to leakage, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the pressure test. This
can be used real time to prevent the pressure test from causing irreversible damage to the pipe that might
otherwise occur without monitoring and lead to future in-service failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>On-stream Examination and Testing Techniques
10.4.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many traditional NDE techniques and testing are used to assess nonmetallic piping. These techniques include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.5 Flexible Hoses<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flexible hoses utilized in hydrocarbon or other hazardous service should be individually identified and include
appropriate service (chemical) limitations and acceptable operating conditions. Generally, there are two
purposes for flexible hoses: one being installed in lieu of hard piping and the other being used for short-term
purposes. The purpose of the flexible hose should be taken into consideration when determining if the flexible
hose should be inspected and how it should be inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flexible hoses used in permanent installations should be periodically inspected with the hard piping it is
attached to or more frequently if determined necessary by the owner/user. Flexible hoses used in temporary
applications should be cleaned and stored appropriately (per manufacturer’s instructions where available)
when not in use to minimize both mechanical damage and exposure to environmental conditions and
chemicals that could compromise one or more components of the hose assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each flexible hose (new and used) should be inspected prior to being placed in service. This inspection
should include a verification of its intended service (process chemicals and temperature/pressure rating),
overall condition (looking for mechanical damage to connections, fittings, flanges, etc.), and that the periodic
inspection has been performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A complete inspection of the hose should be performed periodically. This inspection should include the
following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Ensure the hose has been individually identified (ID tag) and that the records contain appropriate design<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>conditions and service limitations or compatibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Verify diameter, length, and end fittings for individual assemblies and compare with existing ID tags and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>documentation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Verify the hose and fitting pressure ratings are within the design parameters for hydrostatic proof pressure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>test (generally 1.5 times MAWP), and check the condition of the fittings (thread condition and gasket or
sealing surface condition to provide a proper seal). Fittings should also be examined for mechanical
damage from overtightening of the threads or overtorquing of bolted assembly, causing flange face
rotation. The hose to fitting attachment point should also be inspected for loose or damaged clamps or
compression fittings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Perform visual inspection of the hose cover for any cuts, gouges, breach, fraying, or other defects where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>reinforcement is exposed. The hose assembly should also be inspected for excessive abrasion damage to
the outer covering/jacket and for damage from heat (brittleness and/or cracking).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Inspect for damage from excessive bending (kinking), which may produce partial crushing/flattening of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>hose, crimping, or excessive strain at end connections. Check minimum installed bend radiuses to the
manufacturer recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
To the extent possible, examine the internal condition of the hose, looking for signs of erosion, cracking, or
chemical attack/degradation of a nonmetallic liner (swelling, tears, abrasion/roughness, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Additional inspections may include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Visual inspection of the hose tube with boroscope or videoprobe for a general condition on the interior<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>liner (looking for blisters, cracks, or other defects).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Perform test to ensure electrical continuity between end fittings and perform electrical conductivity test<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>on fluoropolymer and thermoplastic tube hose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) If the transfer fluid inside the hose is nonconductive, then perform electrical conductivity test to ensure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>grounding/bonding of hose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4) Check for appropriate alloy composition (PMI) per manufacturers and equipment records. Note that<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>this may only be an initial inspection unless hose fittings or other components may be changed or
modified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5) On-stream inspection using infrared thermography examination may help to identify damage to one or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>more of the hose components/layers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6) Fittings may be examined with dye penetrant, ET, and/or UT methods to identify cracking or other<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7) Perform hydrostatic pressure test in accordance with manufacturers’ recommended design<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>specifications (limited by the lowest pressure rating of included component).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8) Original equipment manufacturers recommended inspection and testing activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As effective inspections of process hoses are difficult, some owner/users stamp and track process hoses,
periodically pressure test them, and require replacement after a set amount of service time based on risk and
type of hose. Additionally visual inspection checklists are in use for issues that should be periodically checked
to verify the integrity of the hose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11 Pressure Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1  Purpose of Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A pressure test conducted on in-service piping may function as a leak test, or if the pressure is high enough, it
can reveal gross errors in design or fabrication. Pressure tests of existing piping should be performed in
accordance with the requirements of API 570. Piping systems that may be subjected to pressure testing
include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) underground lines and other inaccessible piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) water and other nonhazardous utility lines;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) long oil-transfer lines in areas where a leak or spill would not be hazardous to personnel or harmful to the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>environment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) complicated manifold systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) small piping and tubing systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
all systems, after a chemical cleaning operation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) when required by the jurisdiction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reasons and procedures for pressure-testing piping are generally the same as those for equipment.
When vessels of process units are pressure tested, the main lines connected to the vessels are often tested
at the same time. Service testing of Category D piping systems is limited to the 150 psi (1034.2 kPa) design
gauge pressure upper limit defined for Category D fluid service in ASME B31.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2  Performing Pressure Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 570, Section 5.7 provides guidelines for preparing piping for pressure testing, and ASME PCC-2, Article
5.1 offers useful guidance on performing pressure and tightness testing of piping systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During liquid pressure testing, all air should be expelled from the piping through vents provided at all high
points. If the system is not full of liquid, the trapped air will compress. With large quantities of a compressible<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_96>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
89<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>medium in the system, a failure will be more violent than in a liquid-full system because of expansion of the
compressible medium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care should be taken to ensure the test does not overpressure the system, including components (e.g.
expansion joints) that may have a lower design pressure than the remainder of the piping system. Calibrated
pressure gauges properly located and of the proper range should be used and carefully watched during
pressuring. When all air is expelled from the system, the pressure will rise rapidly. A sudden rise in pressure
can cause shock, resulting in failure of the tested equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pressure for a liquid pressure test is usually supplied by an available pump. If a pump of sufficient head is
not available, the necessary test pressure can be supplied by bottled inert gas, such as nitrogen, bled in at the
top of the system after the system is filled with the test liquid. This method has the disadvantage of introducing
a compressible medium into the system, but the quantity can be kept small. In either case, if overpressuring
can occur, a relief device should be installed to protect the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various fluids can be used for pressure testing. The following are the most commonly used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) water with or without an inhibitor, freezing-point depressant, or wetting agent;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) liquid products normally carried in the system, if they are not toxic or likely to cause a fire in case of a leak<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or failure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) steam;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, or another inert gas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
ASME B31.3 has restrictions on the use of the test mediums listed in Item c) and Item d).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a leak or failure occurs, fluid may be released in the area of the piping being tested. For this reason, the fluid
should not be harmful to adjoining equipment or to the plant sewer system, and appropriate safety
precautions are taken to avoid personnel exposure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water may not be suitable as a test fluid in some piping systems, such as acid lines, cryogenic systems, and
air-drier systems. Uninhibited salt water can cause corrosion of some nonferrous alloys and SCC of austenitic
stainless steels. Salt water can also cause corrosion of ferritic steels and severe pitting of austenitic steels,
such as valve trim or plating. Most natural waters contain bacteria that can lead to microbiologically induced
corrosion if the water is left in the piping for too long after a pressure test. Austenitic stainless steels have
failed after 2 to 5 weeks of this kind of exposure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water can freeze in cold weather unless a freezing-point depressant is used. The depressant should not be
harmful to the sewer system or other place of disposal. Steam is sometimes used to warm the water and
prevent freezing. The transition temperature of the steel should be considered to prevent brittle failure when
the testing is during cold weather or with cold fluids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A steam test may be advantageous where steam is used for heating or purging equipment before operation.
The steam pressure should not exceed the operating pressure. An advantage of steam is that it heats the
piping, thereby popping flux from welds in piping that could have passed a water test; however, steam testing
does have several disadvantages. Condensation occurs, and the draining of condensate may be necessary
before operations are started. When high-pressure steam is used, leaks are difficult to detect and can burn
personnel who are in the area of the equipment. Steam also has the previously mentioned disadvantage of
compressible media. ASME B31.3 allows for a leakage test with the flowing medium at operating conditions
for Category D fluid services, i.e. the fluid should be nonflammable, nontoxic, and 366 °F (186 °C) or lower.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
If steam is used as the test medium for piping other than Category D piping, the rules for pneumatic testing stated
in ASME B31.3 should be followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_97>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>90
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pneumatic tests in conjunction with a soap solution, foaming agent, or sonic leak detector are sometimes
permissible for small lines and systems. The preferred medium for pneumatic testing is an inert gas.
Compressed air should not be used where flammable fluids can be present. Leaks that would not be detected
during a liquid pressure test can often be detected by a pneumatic test. Because nitrogen and helium are
more penetrating than air, they are used when service conditions are particularly critical. Filling any piping
system with an inert gas creates an asphyxiation hazard at every stage in the process. Precautions must be
taken to ensure that no personnel are inadvertently exposed to a low-oxygen atmosphere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pneumatic testing should be conducted strictly in accordance with ASME B31.3. All the precautions specified
in ASME B31.3 should be strictly observed, including the elimination of conditions under which brittle fracture
might occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3 Hammer Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hammer testing of piping, valves, and fittings for thickness is a largely outdated test method in which the
component is struck with a hammer in order to listen to the sound or attenuation. The type of sound can be
used by an experienced inspector in hammer testing to differentiate thin metal from thicker metal. While some
experienced inspectors may gain some knowledge about a pipe’s thinness using this technique, the
difficulties of calibrating and standardizing a hammer test put this technique outside the scope of modern
recommended practices. Individual sites may choose to allow hammer testing of certain lines but should do so
only after evaluating the hazards involved and assessing whether the hammer strikes will damage the piping
or cause a leak.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hammer testing is still considered a valid test for:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) support anchor or flange bolt tightness by tapping on the nut and monitoring for movement;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) identifying other loose or broken parts;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) checking the piping to ensure that it has drained properly of liquid or if it contains excess process or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>corrosion scale. Tapping the pipe and hearing a dull thud rather than a ring (attenuation) is an indication of
a problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.4 Tell-tale Hole Drilling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tell-tale drilling (also referred to as sentinel holes or delforez holes) is the application of small pilot holes [e.g.
1 / 8 -in. (3.2-mm) diameter] drilled into the pipe component wall using specified and controlled patterns and
depths. The purpose of the tell-tale holes is to prevent major incidents associated with undetected thinning
damage due to internal corrosion, erosion, and erosion-corrosion, by alerting unit personnel with a leak
through the tell-tale hole. Tell-tale holes are less effective where isolated pitting is occurring. Tell-tale holes
are used in conjunction with typical detailed piping inspection programs although they may provide an added
measure of protection against major ruptures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Until the general acceptance of UT wall thickness measurements, the use of tell-tale holes was a more
common practice to determine when some amount of pipe wall loss had occurred. This practice has been
abandoned by most users in favor of UT thickness examinations. However, some locations continue the use
of tell-tale holes to minimize risk in addition to employing recognized and generally accepted piping inspection
practices (e.g. digital UT, profile RT, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pilot holes are drilled from the OD to the outermost part of the corrosion allowance periphery such that
when the internal corrosion allowance is consumed a small leak occurs at the tell-tale hole. Special drill
assemblies and depth gauges are used to ensure that the hole is drilled to the proper depth. The hole pattern
and density can vary depending upon the type of service, likelihood of failure, and consequence of failure.
They are most commonly installed during pipe fabrication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
91<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Older facilities may have piping installed with tell-tale holes. It is suggested to document those piping systems
containing tell-tale holes as their presence should be known by operators and can alter the inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.5 Inspection of Piping Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 570 provides a detailed discussion of inspection of in-service piping welds. In addition, API 577 provides
details on inspection of pipe welding. The inspector should be familiar with the material contained in these
documents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.6 Other Inspection Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Qualitative NDE methods have been developed to assist the inspector in identifying areas of piping that are
experiencing deterioration. Additionally, new methods are in the process of development. Halogen leak
detectors are available to detect leaks in special application piping such as vacuum systems. Several
methods of detecting thinning piping, CUI, and other types of deterioration are available utilizing UT, magnetic
flux leakage (MFL), real-time RT, neutron radiography, neutron backscatter, thermography, pulsed eddy
current (PEC), ACFM, MW, CR, etc. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages for each application.
The inspector should be aware of these methods and their applicability to particular inspection needs. Visual
inspection at CMLs will typically not provide a representative evaluation of CUI conditions at other locations
along the pipe. A detailed discussion of the various NDE methods for detecting CUI is contained in API 583.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.7 Inspection of Underground Piping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
11.7.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of buried process piping (not regulated by the Department of Transportation) is different from other
process piping inspection because significant external deterioration can be caused by corrosive soil
conditions. Figure 28 illustrates external corrosion occurring to underground piping despite the use of tape
wrap. Important references for underground piping inspection include NACE SP0169 and NACE SP0274, and
API 570, Section 9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Types and Methods of Inspection and Testing
11.7.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Above-grade Visual Surveillance
11.7.2.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indications of leaks in buried piping can include moist ground or actual seepage of product carried in the
underground piping, a change in the surface contour of the ground, discoloration of the soil, softening of
paving asphalt, pool formation, bubbling water puddles, or noticeable odor. Surveying the route of buried
piping is one method to identify problem areas. All lines should be inspected at and just below the point where
they enter earth, asphalt, or concrete, since serious corrosion frequently occurs at such locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Close-interval Potential Survey
11.7.2.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Close-interval potential surveys are used to locate corrosion cells, galvanic anodes, stray currents, coating
problems, underground contacts, areas of low pipe-to-soil potentials, and other problems relating to cathodic
protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A close-interval pipe-to-soil potential survey measures the potential of the pipe to the soil directly over the pipe,
at predetermined intervals between measurements, usually at 2.5 ft, 5 ft, 10 ft, or 20 ft (0.8 m, 1.5 m, 3 m, or
6 m). The pipe contact can be made at an aboveground pipe attachment. An example of a standard type
pipe-to-soil potential survey on a bare line is shown in Figure 29 and Figure 30.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion cells can form on both bare pipe and coated pipe with holidays where the bare steel contacts the
soil. Since the potential at the area of corrosion will be measurably different from an adjacent area on the pipe,
the location of the corrosion activity can be determined by this survey technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Holiday Pipe Coating Survey
11.7.2.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The holiday pipe coating survey can be used to locate external coating defects on buried coated pipes. It
should be used on newly constructed pipe systems to ensure that the coating is intact and holiday free. More
often it is used to evaluate coating serviceability for buried piping that has been in service for an extended
period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>From survey data, the coating effectiveness and rate of coating deterioration can be determined. This
information is used for both predicting corrosion activity in a specific area and forecasting replacement of the
coating for corrosion control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency of pipe coating holiday surveys is usually based on indications that other forms of corrosion
control are ineffective. For example, on a coated pipe where there is gradual loss of cathodic protection
potentials, or when an external corrosion leak occurs at a coating defect, a pipe coating holiday survey may
be used to evaluate the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Soil Resistivity Testing
11.7.2.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Soil resistivity measurements can be used for relative classification of the soil corrosivity. Corrosion of bare or
poorly coated piping is often caused by a mixture of different soils in contact with the pipe surface. The
corrosiveness of the soils can be determined by a measurement of the soil resistivity. Lower levels of
resistivity are relatively more corrosive than higher levels, especially in areas where the pipe is exposed to
significant changes in soil resistivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are three well-known methods of determining resistivity. These are the Wenner Four-pin Method, the
soil bar (AC bridge), and the soil box. The procedures for the use of each of these three methods are simple in
concept. Each one measures a voltage drop, caused by a known current flow, across a measured volume of
soil. This “resistance” factor is used in a formula to determine the resistivity of the soil. Both the soil bar and
the soil box use a multiplication factor to determine the soil resistivity. This factor should be imprinted on the
bar or box.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements of soil resistivity using the Wenner Four-pin Method should be in accordance with ASTM G57.
The Four-pin Method uses the formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>resistivity (ohm-cm) = 191.5    d      R<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The number “191.5” is a constant that takes into account the mathematical equation for the mass of the soil,
and a conversion factor to convert feet to centimeters. “ d ” is the distance in feet between any of the equally
spaced pins (with all of the pins in a straight line). “ R ” is a resistance factor of the voltage drop across the two
inner pins, divided by the induced current flow in the earth between the two outer pins. The depth that the pins
are inserted into the earth should be small compared to the pin spacing (see Figure 31). The following
conditions should be considered in four-pin soil resistivity measurements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) all underground structures should be excluded from the measurement,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) all of the pins should be in a straight line and equally spaced,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the depth of the pins inserted into the ground should be less than 4 % of the spacing,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the soil resistivity meter should be designed to exclude any effect of extraneous AC or DC currents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases of parallel pipes or in areas of intersecting pipelines, the Four-pin Method may not be applicable.
Other methods include using a soil bar or a soil box.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A schematic illustrating use of a soil bar is shown in Figure 32. The soil bar is typically inserted to the depth in
the soil where the resistivity is to be taken. An AC bridge-type meter is used to balance and read the indicated
resistivity. Suggestions for use of the soil bar include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) use of a standard prod bar to provide the initial hole;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) avoiding addition of water during, or after opening the hole;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) applying pressure on the soil bar after insertion into the open hole.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 32—Soil Bar Used for Soil Resistivity Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For measuring resistivity of soil samples from auger holes or excavations, a soil box serves as a convenient
means for obtaining accurate results. The soil box is used to determine the resistivity of soil from a certain
location by removing the soil from its location and placing it into a soil box. If the resistivity of the soil sample is
not going to be measured immediately after its removal, the soil should be stored in a container that can
preserve its moisture and prevent it from contamination. Figure 33 depicts two types of soil boxes used for
resistivity measurement. Important points for consideration when using a soil box include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) avoiding contamination during soil sample removal, handling, and storing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) avoiding adding or subtracting water;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) having to compact the soil sample to the same density in the soil box as it was prior to removal from the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ground.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For soil resistivity testing, the depth of piping should be considered in selecting the method to be used and the
location of samples. The testing and evaluation of results should be performed by personnel trained and
experienced in soil resistivity testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Cathodic Protection Monitoring
11.7.2.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cathodically protected buried piping should be monitored regularly to ensure adequate levels of protection.
Monitoring should include periodic measurement and analysis of pipe-to-soil potentials by personnel trained
and experienced in cathodic protection system operation. More frequent monitoring of critical cathodic
protection components, such as impressed current rectifiers, is required to ensure reliable system operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See NACE SP0169 and API 651, Section 11 for guidance on inspecting and maintaining cathodic protection
systems for buried piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Inspection Methods
11.7.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
11.7.3.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Several inspection methods are available. Some methods can indicate the external or wall condition of the
piping, whereas other methods indicate only the internal condition. Examples are as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Intelligent Pigging
11.7.3.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In-line inspection (ILI) tools are commonly referred to as “smart” or “intelligent pigging.” This method involves
the movement of a device (pig) through the piping either while it is in service or after it has been removed from
service. Many devices are available employing different methods of inspection utilizing MFL, UT, optical, laser,
ET, and other electromagnetic techniques. There are self-propelled ILI or free swimming tools now available
that only require one point of access and can perform the wall loss examinations with or without product/fluid
in the line. These tools use either ultrasonic or electromagnetic inspection methods to detect and size both ID
and OD defects. These tools do not require typical launching and receiving line modifications; however, the
use of an umbilical often restricts their inspection range. Beware of potential limitations of ILI on
small-diameter piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Video Cameras
11.7.3.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Television cameras are available that can be inserted into the piping. These cameras can provide visual
inspection information on the internal condition of the line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Guided Wave Inspection
11.7.3.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guided wave ultrasonic techniques can be used to inspect underground piping for internal and external
corrosion. Guided waves are sent axially along the piping under examination. Localized wall loss due to
corrosion may be located by analyzing signals of the reflected waves. The techniques require some access to
the outside surface for mounting the guided wave transducers. The distance that the waves can travel and
provide echoes of sufficient amplitude for analysis depends on many factors, including, for example, type and
condition of coating on pipe surface, surface roughness due to internal and/or external corrosion, bonding
between pipe and concrete at air-to-concrete interface, condition of soil in tight contact with the piping, and
fittings on the piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Excavation
11.7.3.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In many cases, the only available inspection method that can be performed is unearthing the piping in order to
visually inspect the external condition of the piping and to evaluate its thickness and internal condition using
the methods discussed in 10.2. Care should be exercised in removing soil from above and around the piping
to prevent damaging the line or line coating, especially if the piping is in service. The last few inches of soil
should be removed manually to avoid this possibility. If the excavation is sufficiently deep, the sides of the
trench should be properly shored to prevent their collapse, in accordance with OSHA regulations, where
applicable. If the coating or wrapping is deteriorated or damaged, it should be removed in that area to inspect
the condition of the underlying metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See 7.4.6 for inspection of the SAI of buried piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Leak Testing
11.7.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Underground lines that cannot be visually inspected should be periodically tested for leaks. Several methods
are available to achieve this objective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Pressure decay methods involve pressurizing the line to a desired amount, blocking it in, and then<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>removing the source of pressure. Monitoring the line pressure over a period of time will provide an
indication of system tightness. Tests may be conducted at a single pressure or multiple pressures. Testing
at multiple pressures provides a means of compensating for temperature variations and may enable
shorter test times compared to a single pressure test. For pressure decay methods, temperature variation
and line pack (e.g. air pockets in a liquid-filled line) can affect the interpretation of results. If desired, the
performance of pressure decay methods can be confirmed by leak simulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Volume in/volume out methods make use of volumetric measuring meters at each end of the line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typically, these devices are permanently installed in situations requiring custody transfer and/or
on-demand leak detection. A standard system would not be able to detect a leak under static (no flow)
conditions. If desired, the performance of volume in/volume out methods can be determined by a leak
simulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Single point volumetric methods are similar to pressure decay measurements requiring the line to be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>blocked in for a static test. A graduated cylinder is attached to the line to measure volume changes over
time. Air pockets in a liquid-filled line and temperature variation can affect the results. Again, the
performance of single point volumetric methods can be determined by a leak simulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Marker chemical (tracer) can be added to the line as a leak detection method. Soil gas samples near the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>line are collected and tested for the presence of the marker chemical. The absence of any marker chemical
in the soil gas samples indicates the line is not leaking. Supplementary tests are usually required to
determine the speed of sample probes in the soil and the speed at which the marker chemical travels
through the backfill. Chemical tracers may be added to a liquid- or gas-filled line. This technology has the
capability to both detect and locate leaks. The supplementary tests are equivalent to confirming technology
performance with leak simulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Acoustic emission technology detects and locates leaks by the sound created by the leak. Sensors should<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>be spaced to allow the sound generated by a leak to be detected at the sensor locations. Sensors are
attached directly to the pipe so it may require the removal of any protective coating. It should be confirmed
that the probable leak conditions will generate sufficient sound to be detected by the sensors. Since
geometry and backfill will affect the noise generation, generalized leak simulations may not confirm
technology performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

should be based on service conditions and experience with piping in the same or similar service. The risk
associated with substitution of wrong materials should determine the extent of PMI of new fabrication, repairs, or
alterations. Existing connecting systems may require checks to determine whether rerating is necessary to meet
the specified conditions. The extent of inspection during fabrication and installation depends largely on the
severity of the service and the quality of the workmanship, and it should be part of the design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Material Verification
11.8.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Both materials and fabrication should be checked for conformance with the codes and specifications that are
appropriate for the plant. Some piping items, such as those used in steam generation, can be subject to
additional regulatory requirements. Although the piping, valves, and fittings should be specified in detail when
orders are placed for new construction, there should be a positive means of identifying the materials installed
in the intended piping systems, including weld filler metals. Checks should be made using material test kits or
other positive identification means, such as portable X-ray fluorescence or portable optical emission
spectrometry analyzers. In addition, manufacturers’ material and test data can be obtained for review,
particularly when special quality requirements are specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examination of welds by RT or other special techniques is important in new construction. A representative
number of welds can be checked for quality or the hardness of the weld and heat-affected zone. PT or MT can
reveal cracks and surface defects. Similar techniques can be used to check for defects in castings and in
machined surfaces such as gasket facings. Surface inspections often provide clues to whether destructive
test methods should be used. See API 578 for additional guidance on material verification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Deviations
11.8.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Exceptions to specifications or standards for materials, tolerances, or workmanship are usually evaluated
based on their effects on such factors as safety, strength, corrosion resistance, and serviceability. Special
reviews may be required to determine whether piping items deviate to an extent that necessitates rejection
and/or repairs. Risk analysis may be useful in these reviews. Any exceptions that have been accepted should
be properly recorded and identified for future reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Repairs and Alterations
11.8.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of repairs and alterations to piping systems may involve several steps in the performance of the
work to ensure that it complies with the applicable sections of API 570. The inspector should be involved in
planning, execution, and documentation of repairs and alterations. The inspector may need to consult with a
piping engineer and corrosion specialist to properly plan and execute the piping work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some typical inspection activities involved with planning repairs and alterations include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Providing necessary field data such as piping diameter, measured wall thickness, and material of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>construction. The required data can vary depending upon the work to be performed whether it is a
temporary repair, a permanent repair, or alteration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Developing and/or reviewing the scope of work. Supporting engineering design calculations should be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>available for review and assurance that they are applicable to the piping system and work being
performed. If any restorative changes result in a change of design temperature or pressure, the
requirements for rerating also should be satisfied. Any welding, cutting, or grinding operation on a
pressure-containing piping component not specifically considered an alteration is considered a repair.
Additional requirements such as PWHT are defined for the work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Developing an inspection plan for the work. The inspector should establish appropriate NDE hold points<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>during the execution of the work and any testing requirements upon completion of the work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Reviewing and accepting any weld procedures to be used for the work. API 577 should be reviewed for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>details on weld techniques and weld procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Reviewing welder qualifications to verify that they are qualified for the welding procedures to be used for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the work. API 577 should be reviewed for details on welder performance qualifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Reviewing material test reports, as required, to ensure that all materials of construction are per the piping
specification and/or scope of work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>procedures are appropriate for the work to be performed and examiners are qualified/certified to perform
the examination technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the execution of repairs, the inspector should ensure that the work is executed per the scope and meets
code requirements. Typical inspector activities include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) ensuring NDE is performed at the hold points as stated in the inspection plan;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) reviewing examination results to ensure that they meet code and specification requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) ensuring any heat treatment is performed per the work scope;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) ensuring testing requirements, such as hardness and pressure testing, are performed and acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Documentation of repairs and alterations can include the written scope of work, supporting engineering
design calculations, NDE and test results, heat-treatment charts, material test reports, WPSs, and welding
performance qualification records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12 Determination of Minimum Required Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.1 Piping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
12.1.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME B31.3 contains formulas and data for determining the minimum required wall thickness for new
uncorroded piping. The specification relates thickness, diameter, joint efficiency, and allowable stress to
maximum safe working pressure. In specifying piping for original installation, ASME B31.3 requires that the
following be taken into account when pipe thickness is determined:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) corrosion allowance;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) threads and other mechanical allowances (consideration should be given to crevice corrosion and loss of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>thickness due to cutting the threads);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) stresses caused by mechanical loading, hydraulic surge pressure, thermal expansion, and other<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) reinforcement of openings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) other allowances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Additional thickness is nearly always required when Item a) through Item e) are considered. Normally, the
engineer will select the pipe schedule that accommodates the required thickness plus the manufacturing
tolerance permitted by the pipe material specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Additional thickness is often needed near branch connections. This additional thickness is usually provided by
one of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) a welding tee,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) a saddle,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) an integrally reinforced branch outlet (e.g. a weldolet), or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the header and/or run pipe thickness is greater than required by design conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Caution should be exercised in calculating the retirement thickness for piping with branch
connections reinforced per Item d). These calculations should be performed by a piping engineer.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION  P RACTICES FOR  P IPING  S Y S TE M  C OMP ON E N TS
103<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-service piping subject to localized damage (e.g. pitting, cracking, blistering, gouging), as well as weld
misalignment and distortion, the inspector may choose to evaluate the piping strength and suitability for
continued service utilizing the approach discussed in API 579-1/ASME FFS-1. Such an analysis should be
performed by, or under the direction of, a piping engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Pressure Design Thickness
12.1.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME B31.3 contains a formula for determining the required thickness of new, uncorroded, straight pipe
subject to internal pressure. API 570 permits the use of the simple Barlow formula to determine the required
wall thickness for in-service piping. ASME B31.3 provides the guidance of when other equations are
applicable. The Barlow formula is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SE
PD
t
2
<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t
is the pressure design thickness for internal pressure, in inches (millimeters);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P
is the internal design gauge pressure of the pipe, in pounds per square inch (kilopascals);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>D
is the OD of the pipe, in inches (millimeters);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S
is the allowable unit stress at the design temperature, in pounds per square inch (kilopascals);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>E
is the longitudinal quality factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Barlow formula gives results that are practically equivalent to those obtained by the more elaborate
ASME B31.3 formula except in cases involving high pressures where thick-walled tubing is required. Metallic
pipe for which  t  ≥  D / 6 or   P / SE  > 0.385   requires special consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME B31.3 also contains the allowable unit stresses to be used in the formulas contained in that publication.
These allowable stresses include a factor of safety and are functions of the pipe material and the temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Structural Minimum Thickness
12.1.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In low-pressure and low-temperature applications, the required pipe thicknesses determined by the Barlow
formula can be so small that the pipe would have insufficient structural strength. For this reason, an absolute
minimum thickness to prevent sag, buckling, and collapse at supports should be determined by the user for
each size of pipe. The pipe wall should not be permitted to deteriorate below this minimum thickness
regardless of the results obtained by the ASME B31.3 or Barlow formulas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The owner/user should specify how structural minimum thicknesses are determined. An example table of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>calculated structural minimum thickness for straight spans of carbon steel pipe is provided in Table 7.
Additional consideration and allowances may be required for the following conditions: screwed piping and
fittings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Piping diameters greater than 24 in. (610 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Temperatures exceeding 400 °F (205 °C) for carbon and low-alloy steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Higher alloys (other than carbon steel and Cr-Mo).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Spans in excess of 20 ft (6 m).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
High external loads (e.g. refractory lined, pipe that is also used to support other pipe, rigging loads, and
personnel support loading).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Excessive vibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_111>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>104
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  574<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Engineering calculations, typically using a computerized piping stress analysis program, may be required in
these instances to determine structural minimum thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Austenitic stainless steel piping often have lower minimum structural thickness requirements based upon their
typically higher strength, higher toughness and thinner initial thicknesses of piping components. Separate
tables are often created for stainless steel piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Minimum Required Thickness
12.1.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, piping is replaced and/or repaired when it reaches the minimum required thickness unless a
Fitness-For-Service analysis has been performed which defined additional remaining life. The minimum
required thickness is the greater value of the pressure design thickness or the structural minimum thickness.
The following steps should be followed when determining the minimum required thickness at a CML.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 1: Calculate pressure design thickness per rating code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 2: Determine structural minimum thickness per owner/user table or engineering calculations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 3: Select minimum required thickness. This is the larger of the pressure design thickness or structural
minimum thickness determined in Step 1 and Step 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For services with high potential consequences if a failure were to occur, the piping engineer should consider
increasing the minimum allowed thickness above the one determined above in Step 3. This would provide extra
thickness for unanticipated or unknown loadings, undiscovered metal loss, or resistance to normal abuse.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Example 1: Determine the minimum required thickness for a NPS 2, ASTM A106, Grade B pipe designed for 100 psig
@ 100 °F.  P  = 100 psig,  D  = 2.375 in.,  S  = 20,000 psi,  E  = 1.0 (since seamless),  Y  = 0.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 1: Calculate pressure design thickness per rating code. (In this example, the ASME B31.3 design formula was used.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If this NPS 2 pipe was 100 % supported (e.g. laying on flat ground), then 0.006 in. would hold the 100 psig of pressure.
This thickness includes a 3-to-1 safety factor; however, it would not hold up in the pipe rack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 2: Determine structural minimum thickness per owner/user table or engineering calculations. From Table 6, the
default structural minimum thickness is 0.070 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 3: Select minimum required thickness. This is the larger of the pressure design thickness or structural minimum
thickness determined in Step 1 and Step 2. Larger value of 0.006 in. and 0.070 in. is 0.070 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Example 2: Determine the minimum required thickness for a 14 NPS, ASTM A106, Grade B pipe designed for 600 psig

<<HEADING level=3>>Minimum Alert Thickness
12.1.5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Users may establish a minimum alert thickness with values greater than either the minimum structural
thickness or the pressure design thickness whichever governs the minimum required thickness. Alert
thicknesses are often inputted into the facility’s inspection data management program. The alert thickness
signals the inspector that it is timely for a remaining life assessment. This could include a detailed engineering
evaluation of the structural minimum thickness, Fitness-For-Service assessment, or developing future repair
plans. In addition, when a CML reaches the alert thickness, it raises a flag to consider the extent and severity
at other possible locations for the corrosion mechanism. Alert minimum thicknesses are usually not intended
to mean that pipe components must be retired when one CML reaches the default limit. Table 7 shows an
example of alert thicknesses for carbon and low-alloy steel pipe that could be used in conjunction with the
default minimum structural thicknesses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>12.2 Valves and Flanged Fittings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Valves and flanged fittings are subject to stress both from internal pressure and from mechanical loadings and
temperature changes. Valves are also subject to closing stresses and stress concentrations because of their
shape. These stresses are difficult to calculate with certainty. For this reason, the thickness of valves and
flanged fittings is substantially greater than that of a simple cylinder. ASME B16.34 establishes the minimum
valve wall thickness at 1.5 times (1.35 times for Class 4500) the thickness of a simple cylinder designed for a
stress of 7000 psi (48.26 MPa) and subjected to an internal pressure equal to the pressure rating class for
valve Classes 150 to 2500. The actual valve wall thickness requirements given in Table 3 of ASME B16.34
are approximately 0.1 in. (2.54 mm) thicker than the calculated values. Valves furnished in accordance with
API 600 have thickness requirements for corrosion and erosion in addition to those given in ASME B16.34.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The formula for calculating the minimum required thickness of pipe can be adapted for valves and flanged
fittings by using the factor of 1.5 and the allowable stress for the material specified in ASME B31.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The necessity of keeping complete records in a detailed and orderly manner is an important responsibility of
the inspector as well as a requirement of many regulations (e.g. OSHA 29  CFR  1910.119). Accurate records
allow an evaluation of service life on any piping, valve, or fitting. From such records, a comprehensive picture
of the general condition of any piping system can be determined. When properly organized, such records form
a permanent record from which corrosion rates and probable replacement or repair intervals can be
determined. A computer program can be used to assist in a more complete evaluation of recorded information
and to determine the next inspection date.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection records should contain:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

reviewed soon after the inspections are conducted to schedule the next inspection date. This review should
provide lists of areas that are approaching retirement thickness, areas that have previously shown high
corrosion rates, and areas in which current inspection has indicated a need for further investigation. From
these lists, a work schedule should be prepared for additional on-stream inspection, if possible, and for
inspections to be conducted during the next shutdown period. Such a schedule will assist in determining the
number of inspectors to be assigned to the work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition, from the review of the records of previous inspections, a list should be made of all expected
repairs and replacements. This list should be submitted to the maintenance department far enough in
advance of the shutdown to permit any required material to be obtained or, if necessary, fabricated. This list
will also assist the maintenance personnel in determining the number of personnel required during the
shutdown period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6 Record Updates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Records should be updated following inspection activities within a reasonable amount of time affording the
inspector enough time to properly gather, analyze, and record data. Many sites have internal requirements
indicating a maximum duration between obtaining data and updating records. These requirements generally
allow records be updated within a few weeks of completing the inspection activities. Establishing a time frame
for record updates helps ensure that data and information are accurately recorded and do not become lost
and details forgotten.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.7 Audit of Records<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection records should be regularly audited against code requirements, site’s quality assurance inspection
manual, and site procedures. The audit should assess whether the records meet requirements and whether
the records are of appropriate quality/accuracy. Regular audits provide a means to identify gaps and
deficiencies in existing inspection programs and define corrective actions, such as focused training.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
