<<HEADING level=2>>Piping Inspection Code: In-service Inspection, Rating, Repair,
and Alteration of Piping Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 General Application<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1.1 Coverage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 570 covers inspection, rating, repair, and alteration procedures for metallic and fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP)
piping systems and their associated pressure relieving devices that have been placed in service.This inspection Code
applies to all hydrocarbon and chemical process piping covered in 1.2.1 that have been placed in service unless
specifically designated as optional per 1.2.2. This publication does not cover inspection of specialty equipment
including instrumentation, exchanger tubes and control valves. However, this piping Code could be used by owner/
users in other industries and other services at their discretion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Process piping systems that have been retired from service and abandoned in place are no longer covered by this “in
service inspection” Code. However abandoned in place piping may still need some amount of inspection and/or risk
mitigation to assure that it does not become a process safety hazard because of continuing deterioration. Process
piping systems that are temporarily out of service but have been mothballed (preserved for potential future use) are
still covered by this Code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1.2 Intent<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The intent of this Code is to specify the in-service inspection and condition-monitoring program as well as repair
guidance that is needed to determine and maintain the on-going integrity of piping systems. That program should
provide reasonably accurate and timely assessments to determine if any changes in the condition of piping could
possibly compromise continued safe operation. It is also the intent of this Code that owner/users shall respond to any
inspection results that require corrective actions to assure the continued integrity of piping consistent with appropriate
risk analysis. API 570 is intended for use by organizations that maintain or have access to an authorized inspection
agency, a repair organization, and technically qualified piping engineers, inspectors, and examiners, all as defined in
Section 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1.3 Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 570 shall not be used as a substitute for the original construction requirements governing a piping system before
it is placed in-service; nor shall it be used in conflict with any prevailing regulatory requirements. If the requirements of
this Code are more stringent than the regulatory requirements, then the requirements of this Code shall govern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2 Specific Applications<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The term non-metallics has a broad definition but in this Code refers to the fiber reinforced plastic groups
encompassed by the generic acronyms FRP (fiberglass-reinforced plastic) and GRP (glass-reinforced plastic). The
extruded, generally homogenous non-metallics, such as high and low-density polyethylene are not specifically
covered by this Code. Refer to API 574 and MTI 129 for guidance on degradation and inspection issues associated
with FRP piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.2 Inspection Organization Audits<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each owner/user organization should be audited periodically to determine if they are meeting the requirements of an
authorized inspection agency as defined in this inspection Code. The audit team should consist of people
experienced and competent in the application of this Code. The audit team should typically be from another owner/
user plant site, company central office or from a third party organization experienced and competent in refining and/or
petrochemical process plant inspection programs or a combination of third party and other owner/user sites.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following key elements of an inspection program should be assessed by the audit team:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the requirements and principles of this inspection Code are being met;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) owner/user responsibilities are being properly discharged;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) documented inspection plans are in place for covered piping systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) intervals and extent of inspections are adequate for covered piping systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) general types of inspections and surveillance are being adequately applied;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
inspection data analysis, evaluation, and recording are adequate;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) repairs, reratings and alterations comply with this Code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user should receive a report of the audit team's scope and findings. After review of the report, non-
conformances should be prioritized and corrective actions implemented. Each organization should establish a system
for tracking and completion of audit findings. This information should also be reviewed during subsequent audits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.3 MOC<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user is also responsible for implementing an effective MOC process that will review and control changes
to the process and to the hardware. An effective MOC process is vital to the success of any piping integrity
management program in order that the inspection group is able to: 1) address issues concerning the adequacy of the
pressure piping design and current condition for the proposed changes, 2) anticipate changes in corrosion or other
types of damage and their effects on the adequacy on the pressure piping, and 3) update the inspection plan and
records to account for those changes. The MOC process shall include the appropriate materials/corrosion experience
and expertise in order to effectively forecast what changes might affect piping integrity. The inspection group shall be
involved in the approval process for changes that may affect piping integrity. Changes to the hardware and the
process shall be included in the MOC process to ensure its effectiveness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.4 Integrity Operating Windows (IOWs)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user should implement and maintain an effective program for creating, establishing and monitoring
integrity operating windows. IOWs are implemented to avoid process parameter exceedances that may have an
unanticipated impact on pressure equipment integrity. Future inspection plans and intervals have historically been
based on prior measured corrosion rates resulting from past operating conditions. Without an effective IOW and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_26>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>20
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>process control program, there often is no warning of changing operating conditions that could affect the damage
mechanisms and rates and subsequently impact the integrity of equipment, or validation of the current inspection
plan. Deviations from and changes of trends within established IOW limits should be brought to the attention of
inspection/engineering personnel so they may modify or create new inspection plans depending upon the
seriousness of the exceedance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Integrity operating windows should be established for process parameters (both physical and chemical) that could
impact equipment integrity if not properly controlled. Examples of the process parameters include temperatures,
pressures, fluid velocities, pH, flow rates, chemical or water injection rates, levels of corrosive/erosive constituents,
chemical composition, etc. IOWs for key process parameters may have both upper and lower limits established, as
needed. Particular attention to monitoring integrity operating windows should also be provided during start-ups,
shutdowns and significant process upsets. See API 584 for more information on issues that may assist in the
development of an IOW program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2 Piping Engineer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The piping engineer is responsible to the owner/user for activities involving design, engineering review, rating,
analysis, or evaluation of piping systems and PRDs covered by API 570 as specified in this Code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3 Repair Organization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All repairs and alterations shall be performed by a repair organization as defined in Section 3. The repair organization
shall be responsible to the owner/user and shall provide the materials, equipment, quality control, and workmanship
necessary to maintain and repair the piping systems in accordance with the requirements of API 570.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4 Authorized Piping Inspector<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When inspections, repairs, or alterations are being conducted on piping systems, the designated authorized piping
inspector shall be responsible to the owner/user for determining that the requirements of API 570 on inspection,
examination, quality assurance and testing are met. The inspector shall be directly involved in the inspection activities
which in most cases will require field activities to ensure that procedures are followed. The inspector is also
responsible for extending the scope of the inspection (with appropriate consultation with engineers/specialists), where
justified depending upon the findings of the inspection. Where non-conformances are discovered, the designated
inspector is responsible for notifying the owner/user in a timely manner and making appropriate repair or other
mitigative recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector shall be knowledgeable with piping system damage types listed in API 571 and the content of API 574,
API 576, API 577, API 578, API 583, API 584, and also knowledgeable in RP 580 where RBI is in use. The inspector
shall be able to use the guidance contained in these RPs in order to meet the requirements and/or expectations in this
Code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Inspection Plans<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1 Piping Systemization and Circuitization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to develop inspection plans (including scope, frequency, techniques and location), facility piping should be
broken down into piping systems and circuits. Piping systems can be defined at a PFD (process flow diagram) level
however piping circuits are often defined at the P&ID (process and instrumentation diagram) level. Potential damage
mechanisms are primarily a function of the process/operating conditions, the material of construction and mechanical
design. Defining systems and circuits based upon potential damage mechanisms can yield an inspection plan with a
high probability of detecting damage. The Piping systemization is the first cut for defining the potential corrosion
issues and is a convenient reference to the general location of damage mechanisms within the process unit. Piping
systems generally have common characteristics such as one or more of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) process intent (e.g. overhead reflux system),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) process control scheme (e.g. temperature/end point),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) process stream composition,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_28>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>22
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) design operating conditions,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) similar or related set of IOWs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping systems may contain (or pass through) one or more equipment items (e.g. exchangers, pumps) and will
typically contain one or multiple piping circuits. Piping systems and circuits developed from expected/identified
damage mechanisms enables the development of concise inspection plans and forms the basis for improved data
analysis. Piping circuitization is a further breakdown of piping systems into sections of piping and/or individual pipe
components which have common damage mechanisms, same material of construction and have similar damage
rates and modes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Refer to API 574 for more information on development of piping systems and circuits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2 Development of an Inspection Plan<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An inspection plan shall be established for all piping systems and/or circuits and associated pressure relieving
devices within the scope of this Code. The inspection plan shall be developed by the inspector and/or engineer. A
corrosion specialist shall be consulted to identify/clarify potential damage mechanisms and specific locations where
degradation may occur, especially where localized corrosion or cracking mechanisms may be involved. A corrosion
specialist shall be consulted when developing the inspection plans for piping systems that operate at elevated
temperatures [above 750 °F (400 °C)] and piping systems that operate below the ductile-to-brittle transition
temperature. Special attention in the inspection plan should be given to any types of deterioration or issues listed in
5.5.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection plan is developed from the analysis of several sources of data including the piping inspection records.
Piping systems shall be evaluated based on present or possible types of damage mechanisms. The methods and the
extent of NDE shall be evaluated to assure that they can adequately identify the damage mechanism and the severity
of damage. Subdividing piping systems into circuits subject to common damage mechanisms facilitates selecting the
inspection techniques best suited to find the damage that's most likely to occur in the piping circuit. Examinations
shall be scheduled at intervals that consider the:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) type of damage (see API 571),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) rate of damage progression,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) tolerance of the equipment to the type of damage,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) capability of the NDE method to identify the damage,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) maximum intervals as defined in codes and standards,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
extent of examination,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Recent operating history, including IOW exceedances;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) MOC records that may impact inspection plans;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
RBI assessments or piping classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection plan should be developed using the most appropriate sources of information including those
references listed in Section 2. Inspection plans shall be reviewed and amended as needed when variables that may
impact damage mechanisms and/or deterioration rates are identified such as those contained in inspection reports or
management of change documents. See API 574 for more information on the development of inspection plans.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3 Minimum Contents of an Inspection Plan<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection plan shall contain the inspection tasks and schedule required to monitor identified damage
mechanisms and assure the pressure integrity of the piping systems. The plan should:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) define the type(s) of inspection needed, (e.g. internal, external, on-stream ,nonintrusive);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) identify the next inspection date for each inspection type;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) describe the inspection methods and NDE techniques;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) describe the extent and locations of inspection and NDE at CMLs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) describe the surface cleaning requirements needed for inspection and examinations for each type of inspection;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
describe the requirements of any needed pressure test (e.g. type of test, test pressure, test temperature, and
duration);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) describe any required repairs if known or previously planned before the upcoming inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) describe the types of damage anticipated or experienced in the piping systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
define the location of the expected damage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
define any special access and preparation needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generic inspection plans based on industry standards and practices may be used as a starting point in developing
specific inspection plans. The inspection plan may or may not exist in a single document, however the contents of the
plan should be readily accessible from inspection data systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI analysis may be used to determine inspection intervals or due dates and the type and extent of future
inspection/examinations. The RBI analysis, when conducted in accordance with API 580, shall include all of the
inspection planning elements noted in API 580, Section 5.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the owner/user chooses to conduct an RBI assessment it shall include a systematic evaluation of both the
probability and the associated consequence of failure, in accordance with the requirements in API 580. API 581
provides a set of methodologies for assessing risk (both POF and COF) and for developing inspection plans that are
consistent with key elements defined in API 580.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Identifying and evaluating potential damage mechanisms, current equipment condition and the effectiveness of the
past inspections are important steps in assessing the probability of piping failure. Identifying and evaluating the
process fluid(s), potential injuries, environmental damage, equipment damage and equipment downtime are
important steps in assessing the consequence of piping failure. Identifying integrity operating windows for key
process variables is an important adjunct to RBI (see 4.3.1.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2 Probability Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The probability assessment shall be in accordance with the requirements in API 580 and shall be based on all forms
of damage that could reasonably be expected to affect equipment in any particular service. Additionally, the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_30>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>24
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>effectiveness of the inspection practices, tools, and techniques used for finding the potential damage mechanisms
shall be evaluated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other factors that should be considered in a probability assessment include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) appropriateness of the materials of construction for the damage mechanisms;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) equipment design conditions, relative to operating conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) appropriateness of the design codes and standards utilized;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) effectiveness of corrosion monitoring programs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) the quality of maintenance and inspection quality assurance/quality control programs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
both the pressure retaining and structural requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) operating conditions both past and projected and review of potential fouling as it impacts damage mechanisms;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) prior mechanical / corrosion or failure history of the piping system/circuit;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
review of inspection history.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3 Consequence Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The consequence of a release is dependent on type and amount of process fluid contained in the equipment. The
consequence assessment shall be in accordance with the requirements in API 580 and shall consider the potential
incidents that may occur as a result of fluid release, the size of a potential release, and the type of a potential release
(includes explosion, fire, or toxic exposure.) The assessment should also determine the potential outcomes that may
occur as a result of fluid release or equipment damage, which may include: health effects, environmental impact,
additional equipment damage, and process downtime or slowdown.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4 Documentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is essential that all RBI assessments be thoroughly documented in accordance with the requirements in API 580
clearly defining all the factors contributing to both the probability and consequence of a failure of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After an RBI assessment is conducted, the results can be used to establish the equipment inspection plan and better
define the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the most appropriate inspection and NDE methods, tools, and techniques;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the extent of NDE (e.g. percentage of equipment to examine);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the interval or due date for internal (where applicable), external, and on-stream inspections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the need for pressure testing after damage has occurred or after repairs/alterations have been completed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) the prevention and mitigation steps to reduce the probability and consequence of equipment failure. (e.g. repairs,
process changes, inhibitors, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.5 Frequency of RBI Assessments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When RBI assessments are used to set equipment inspection intervals or due dates, the assessment shall be
updated after each equipment inspection as defined in API 580 Section 15. The RBI assessment shall be updated at
least every 10 years or more often if process or hardware changes are made, or after any event occurs that could
significantly affect damage rates or damage mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The RBI assessment shall be reviewed and approved by the appropriate qualified personnel per API 580 and
inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Preparation for Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety precautions shall be included when preparing piping systems for inspection and maintenance activities to
eliminate exposure to hazardous fluids, energy sources, and physical hazards. Regulations [e.g. those administered
by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)] govern many aspects of piping systems
inspection and shall be followed where applicable. In addition, the owner/user's safety procedures shall be reviewed
and followed. See API 574 for more information on the safety aspects of piping inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Procedures for segregating piping systems, installing blinds (blanks), and testing tightness should be an integral part
of safety practices for flanged connections. Appropriate safety precautions shall be taken before any piping system is
opened. In general, the section of piping to be opened should be isolated from all sources of harmful liquids, gases, or
vapors and purged to remove all oil and toxic or flammable gases and vapors. See API 574 for more information on
the equipment preparation and entry aspects of piping inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2 Records Review<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before performing any of the required inspections, inspectors shall familiarize themselves with prior history of the
piping system for which they are responsible. In particular, they should review the piping system's prior inspection
results, prior repairs, current inspection plan, and/or other similar service inspections. Additionally it is advisable to
ascertain recent operating history that may affect the inspection plan. The types of damage and failure modes
experienced by piping systems are provided in API 571 and API 579-1/ASME FFS-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and characteristics of potential defects and damage mechanisms associated with the equipment being inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Detailed information concerning common damage mechanisms (critical factors, appearance, and typical inspection
and monitoring techniques) is found in API 571 and other sources of information on damage mechanisms included in
the bibliography. Additional recommended inspection practices for specific types of damage mechanisms are
described in API 574.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2 Areas of Deterioration for Piping Systems<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 General Types of Inspection and Surveillance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Different types of inspection and surveillance are appropriate depending on the circumstances and the piping system.
These include the following types of inspections and inspection focus areas:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) internal visual inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) on-stream inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) thickness measurement inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) various NDE examinations,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) external visual inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
vibrating piping inspection,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) supplemental inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with the inspection plan for each piping circuit or system. Refer to
Section 6 for the interval/frequency and extent of inspection. Corrosion and other damage identified during
inspections and examinations shall be characterized, sized, and evaluated per Section 7. Revisions to the inspection
plan shall be approved by the inspector and/or piping engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.2 Internal Visual Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal visual inspections are not normally performed on piping. When practical, internal visual inspections may be
scheduled for systems such as large-diameter transfer lines, ducts, catalyst lines, or other large-diameter piping
systems. Such inspections are similar in nature to pressure vessel inspections and should be conducted with
methods and procedures similar to those outlined in API 510 and API 572. Remote visual inspection techniques can
be helpful when inspecting piping which is too small to enter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An additional opportunity for internal inspection is provided when piping flanges are disconnected, allowing visual
inspection of internal surfaces with or without the use of NDE. When piping flanges are disconnected, the gasket
surface, studs and nuts should be examined for any signs of deterioration. Removing a section of piping and splitting
it along its centerline also permits access to internal surfaces where there is need for such inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.3 On-stream Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The on-stream inspection may be required by the inspection plan. All on-stream inspections should be conducted by
either an inspector or examiner. All on-stream inspection work performed by an examiner shall be authorized and
approved by the inspector. When on-stream inspections of the pressure boundary are specified, they shall be
designed to detect the damage mechanisms identified in the inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection may include several NDE techniques to check for various types of damage that pertain to the circuit as
identified during inspection planning. Techniques used in on-stream inspections are chosen for their ability to identify
particular damage mechanisms from the exterior and their capabilities to perform at the on-stream conditions of the
piping system (e.g. metal temperatures). The external thickness measurement inspection described in 5.6.2 may be a
part of an on-stream inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

29<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are inherent limitations when applying external NDE techniques trying to locate damage on the inside of piping
components. Issues that can affect those limitations include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) type of material of construction (alloy);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) weldments;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) pipe junctions, nozzles, support saddles, reinforcing plates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) internal lining or cladding;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) physical access and equipment temperature;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
limitations inherent to the selected NDE technique to detect the damage mechanism;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) type of damage mechanism (e.g. pitting versus general wall thinning).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API 574 provides more information on piping system inspection and should be applied when performing on-stream
piping inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.4 Thickness Measurement Inspection and Various NDE Examinations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thickness measurements are obtained to verify the thickness of piping components. This data is used to calculate the
corrosion rates and remaining life of the piping system. Thickness measurements shall be obtained by the inspector
or the examiner at the direction of the inspector. The owner/user shall ensure that all individuals conducting thickness
measurements are trained and qualified in accordance with the applicable procedure used during the examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally thickness measurements are taken while the piping is on-stream. On-stream thickness monitoring is a good
tool for monitoring corrosion and assessing potential damage due to process or operational changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector should consult with a corrosion specialist when the short-term corrosion rate changes significantly from
the previous identified rate to determine the cause. Appropriate responses to accelerated corrosion rates may
include, obtaining additional UT thickness readings, using profile RT in lieu of, or to supplement UT readings,
performing UT scans in suspect areas, performing other corrosion/process monitoring, reviewing changes in
operations/process, making revisions to the piping inspection plan and addressing non-conformances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Screening examination techniques (e.g. guided wave examination, EMAT, Lamb wave) are typically limited to the
qualitative data results (i.e. volumetric percentage of wall loss, versus actual discrete thickness values). If used,
screening examination techniques are considered to fulfill the requirements for thickness measurement inspection
provided they are used complimentary to an inspection plan that also includes periodic quantitative examination
techniques to establish actual baseline thickness data, or to prove up screening technique examination results
conducted at appropriate intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See API 574, Third Edition, Section 10.2,  Thickness Measurement,  for additional guidance in conducting ultrasonic
thickness measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.5 External Visual Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An external visual inspection is performed to determine the condition of the outside of the piping, insulation system,
painting, and coating systems, and associated hardware; and to check for signs of misalignment, vibration, and
leakage. When corrosion product buildup or other debris is noted at pipe support contact areas, it may be necessary
to lift the pipe off such supports for thorough inspection. When lifting piping that is in operation, extra care should be
exercised and consultation with an engineer may be necessary. Based on the support type/configuration, screening
techniques such as guided wave testing/EMAT or Lamb-wave inspections can be used to locate areas of interest for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>follow-up inspection using more quantitative NDE techniques. Users of screening techniques should be aware of the
possibility that some of those techniques may miss significant localized corrosion. External piping inspections may be
made when the piping system is on-stream. Refer to API 574 for information concerning conducting external
inspections. External piping inspections may include CUI inspections per 5.6.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External inspections shall include surveys for the condition of piping hangers and supports. Instances of cracked or
broken hangers, “bottoming out” of spring supports, support shoes displaced from support members, or other
improper restraint conditions shall be reported and corrected. Vertical support dummy legs also shall be checked to
confirm that they have not filled with water that is causing external corrosion of the pressure piping or internal
corrosion of the support leg. Horizontal support dummy legs also shall be checked to determine that slight
displacements from horizontal are not causing moisture traps against the external surface of active piping
components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bellows expansion joints should be inspected visually for unusual deformations, misalignment, excessive angular
rotation and displacements that may exceed design. In some cases where two ply bellows have been utilized, the
annular space between the inner and outer bellow should be pressure tested and/or monitored for leakage. Other
nonstandard piping components (e.g flex hoses) may have different degradation mechanisms (see API 574).
Specialist engineers or manufacturer data sources may need to be consulted in developing valid inspection plans for
these components. The inspector should examine the piping system for the presence of any field modifications or
temporary repairs not previously recorded on the piping drawings and/or records. The inspector also should be alert
to the presence of any components that may be unsuitable for long-term operation, such as improper flanges,
temporary repairs (clamps), modifications (flexible hoses), or valves of improper specification. Threaded components
and other flanged spool pieces that may be easily removed and reinstalled deserve particular attention because of
their higher potential for installation of incorrect materials of construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The periodic external inspection called for in 6.4 should normally be conducted by the inspector, who also shall be
responsible for record keeping and repair inspection. Qualified examiners, operating or maintenance personnel may
also conduct external inspections, when acceptable to the inspector. In such cases, the persons conducting external
piping inspections in accordance with API 570 shall be qualified through an appropriate amount of training.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to these scheduled external inspections that are documented in inspection records, it is beneficial for
personnel who frequent the area to report deterioration or changes to the inspector (see API 574 for examples of
such deterioration).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the external inspection, particular attention should be given to weldments of attachments (e.g. reinforcement
plates and clips) looking for cracking, corrosion or other defects. Any signs of leakage should be investigated so that
the sources can be established. Normally, weep holes in reinforcing plates (re-pads) should remain open to provide
visual evidence of leakage. If weep holes are plugged to exclude moisture they shall not be plugged with material
capable of sustaining pressure behind the reinforcing plate unless fitness for service assessments and an approved
MOC have demonstrated that the reinforcement plate is capable of withstanding the design pressure of the piping
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.6 Vibrating Piping and Line Movement Surveillance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Operating personnel should report vibrating or swaying piping to engineering or inspection personnel for assessment.
Evidence of significant line movement that could have resulted from liquid hammer (e.g. piping shifted off of pipe
support’s normal/designed location), liquid slugging in vapor lines, abnormal thermal expansion or from other sources
such as large reciprocating compressors, should be reported. At locations where vibrating piping systems are
restrained to resist dynamic pipe stresses (such as at shoes, anchors, guides, struts, dampeners, hangers), periodic
MT or PT should be considered to check for the onset of fatigue cracking. Branch connections should receive special
attention particularly unbraced small bore piping connected to vibrating pipe. However, fatigue is generally considered
to be a design related mechanism. Once a crack has initiated, it can grow at unknown rates and inspection alone
cannot be used to manage the risk of failure. Typically at the point a fatigue crack is detectible, approximately 80 % of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

engineering assessment/analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.7 Supplemental Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other inspections may be scheduled as appropriate or necessary. Examples of such inspections include periodic use
of radiography and/or thermography to check for fouling or internal plugging, thermography to check for hot spots in
refractory lined systems, additional inspections after reported process unit upsets, verifying previously measured data
for accuracy, inspection for environmental cracking, and any other piping specific damage mechanism. Acoustic
emission, acoustic leak detection, and thermography can be used for remote leak detection and surveillance. Areas
susceptible to localized erosion or erosion-corrosion should be inspected using visual inspection internally if possible
or by using radiography. Scanning of the areas with UT is also a good technique and should be used if the line is
larger than NPS 12.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 CMLs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CMLs are specific areas along the piping circuit where inspections are conducted. The nature of the CML varies
according to its location in the piping system. The allocation of CMLs shall consider the potential for service-specific
damage mechanisms, e.g localized corrosion, as described in API 574 and API 571. Examples of different conditions
to be monitored at CMLs include wall thickness, stress cracking, CUI and high temperature hydrogen attack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2 CML Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each piping system shall be monitored at appropriately placed CMLs. Piping circuits subject to higher corrosion rates
or localized corrosion will normally have more CMLs and be monitored more frequently. The minimum measured
thickness at a CML can be located by ultrasonic scanning or profile radiography. Electromagnetic techniques also can
be used to identify thin areas that may then be measured by UT or radiography. When accomplished with UT,
scanning consists of taking several thickness measurements at the CML searching for localized thinning. The thinnest
reading or an average of several measurement readings taken within the area of a examination point shall be
recorded and used to calculate corrosion rates, remaining life, and the next inspection date in accordance with
Section 7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where appropriate, thickness measurements should include measurements at each of the four quadrants on pipe
and fittings, with special attention to the inside and outside radius of elbows and tees where corrosion/erosion could
increase corrosion rates. As a minimum, the thinnest reading or an average of several measurements at each
recording point at a CML shall be recorded. The rate of corrosion/damage shall be determined from successive
measurements and the next inspection interval appropriately established. Corrosion rates, the remaining life and next
inspection intervals should be calculated to determine the limiting component of each piping circuit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CMLs should be established for areas with continuing CUI, corrosion at SAI interfaces, immediately upstream and
downstream of piping material changes (e.g. spec breaks) or other locations of potential localized corrosion as well as
for general, uniform corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CMLs should be marked on inspection drawings. The piping system may also be marked to allow repetitive
measurements at the same locations. This recording procedure provides data for more accurate corrosion rate
determination. The rate of corrosion/damage shall be determined from successive measurements and the next
inspection interval appropriately established based on the remaining life or RBI analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.3 CML Allocation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CMLs should be distributed appropriately throughout each piping circuit. CMLs may be eliminated or the number
reduced under certain circumstances when the expected damage mechanism will not result in a wall loss or other<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_38>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>32
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>forms of deterioration, such as olefin plant cold side piping, anhydrous ammonia piping, clean noncorrosive
hydrocarbon product, or high-alloy piping for product purity. In circumstances where CMLs will be substantially
reduced or eliminated, a corrosion specialist should be consulted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In selecting or adjusting the number and locations of CMLs, the inspector should take into account the patterns of
corrosion that would be expected and have been experienced in the process unit. A decision on the type, number and
location of the CMLs should consider results from previous inspections, the patterns of corrosion and damage that are
expected and the potential consequence of loss of containment. CMLs should be distributed appropriately over the
piping system to provide adequate monitoring coverage of major components and nozzles. Thickness measurements
at CMLs are intended to establish general and localized corrosion rates in different sections of the piping circuits. A
minimal number of CMLs are acceptable when the established corrosion rate is low and the corrosion is not localized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A number of corrosive processes common to refining and petrochemical units are relatively uniform in nature,
resulting in a fairly constant rate of pipe wall reduction independent of location within the piping circuit, either axially or
circumferentially. Examples of such corrosion phenomena include sulfidation corrosion (provided that it is a uniform
liquid phase with no naphthenic acid and the piping circuit does not contain low silicon CS, see 5.12 and API 939-C)
and sour water corrosion (provided velocities are not so high as to cause local corrosion/erosion of elbows, tees, and
other similar items). In these situations, the number of CMLs required to monitor a circuit will be fewer than those
required to monitor circuits subject to more localized metal loss. In theory, a circuit subject to perfectly uniform
corrosion could be adequately monitored with a single CML. In reality, corrosion is seldom truly uniform and in fact
may be quite localized, so additional CMLs may be required. Inspectors must use their knowledge (and that of others)
of the process unit to optimize the CML allocation for each circuit, balancing the effort of collecting the data with the
benefits provided by the data. Where there is adequate historical thickness data for a circuit and data has been
validated to ensure it is representative for the expected corrosion environment, a statistical analysis may be useful to
help determine the number of inspection points needed to establish the desired confidence in the calculated circuit
average rate, limiting thickness and/or remaining life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>More CMLs should be selected for corrosive piping systems with any of the following characteristics:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) higher potential for creating a safety or environmental emergency in the event of a leak;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) higher expected or experienced corrosion rates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) higher potential for localized corrosion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) more complexity in terms of fittings, branches, deadlegs, injection points, and other similar items;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) higher potential for CUI;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
higher corrosion rate (or thickness) variability;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) higher short/long rate (or maximum / average) ratios;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
circuits with corrosion environments which have experienced unexpected failures in the facility or elsewhere in the
industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fewer CMLs can be selected for piping systems with any of the following three characteristics:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) low potential for creating a safety or environmental emergency in the event of a leak;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) relatively noncorrosive piping systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) long, straight-run piping systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CMLs can be eliminated for piping systems with any of the following characteristics:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) extremely low potential for creating a safety or environmental emergency in the event of a leak;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) noncorrosive systems, as demonstrated by history or similar service; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) systems not subject to changes that could cause corrosion as demonstrated by history and/or periodic reviews.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Every CML should have at least one or more examination points identified. Examples include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) locations marked on un-insulated pipe using paint stencils, metal stencils, or stickers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) holes cut in the insulation and plugged with covers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) temporary insulation covers for fittings nozzles, etc.;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>e) radio frequency identification devices (RFID);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
computerized monitoring buttons (CMB).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Careful identification of CMLs and examination points are necessary to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of the
data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion specialists should be consulted about the appropriate placement and number of CMLs for piping systems
susceptible to localized corrosion or cracking, or in circumstances where CMLs will be substantially reduced or
eliminated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7 Condition Monitoring Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.1 UT and RT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME  BPVC  Section V, Article 23, and Section SE-797 provide guidance for performing ultrasonic thickness
measurements. Radiographic profile techniques are preferred for pipe diameters of NPS 1 and smaller. PRT is
preferred for SBP where digital ultrasonic thickness gauging (DUT) are not very reliable.PRT is very often the
technique of choice on NPS 8 and under when localized corrosion is suspected. Ultrasonic thickness measurements
taken on small bore pipe (NPS 2 and below) may require specialized equipment (e.g. miniature transducers and/or
curved shoes as well as diameter specific calibration blocks). Radiographic profile techniques may be used for
measuring thicknesses, particularly in insulated systems or where nonuniform or localized corrosion is suspected.
Where practical, UT can then be used to obtain the actual thickness of the areas to be recorded. Following ultrasonic
readings at CMLs, proper repair of insulation and insulation weather coating is recommended to reduce the potential
for CUI. Radiographic profile techniques, which do not require removing insulation, may be considered as an
alternative. See API 574 for additional information on thickness monitoring methods for piping. When corrosion in a
piping system is nonuniform or the remaining thickness is approaching the minimum required thickness, additional
thickness measuring may be required. Radiography and ultrasonic scanning are the preferred methods in such
cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When ultrasonic measurements are taken above 150 °F (65 °C), instruments, couplants, and procedures should be
used that will result in accurate measurements at the higher temperatures. If the procedure does not compensate for
higher temperatures, measurements should be adjusted by the appropriate temperature correction factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_40>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>34
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should be aware of possible sources of measurement inaccuracies and make every effort to eliminate their
occurrence. As a general rule, each of the NDE techniques will have practical limits with respect to accuracy. Factors
that can contribute to reduced accuracy of ultrasonic measurements include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) improper instrument calibration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) external coatings or scale;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) significant surface roughness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) transducer placement and orientation (e.g., curved surface placement, pitch/catch probe orientation);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) subsurface material flaws, such as laminations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
temperature effects [at temperatures above 150 °F (65 °C)];<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) improper resolution on the detector screens;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) thicknesses of less than  1 / 8  in. (3.2 mm) for typical digital thickness gauges;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
improper coupling of probe to the surface (too much or too little couplant).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition, it must be kept in mind that the pattern of corrosion can be nonuniform. For corrosion rate determinations
to be valid, it is important that measurements on the thinnest point be repeated as closely as possible to the same
location. Alternatively, the minimum reading or an average of several readings at a examination point may be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When piping systems are out of service, thickness measurements may be taken through openings using calipers.
Calipers are useful in determining approximate thicknesses of castings, forgings, and valve bodies, as well as pit
depth approximations from CUI on pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pit depth measuring devices also may be used to determine the depth of localized metal loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.2 Other NDE Techniques for Piping Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to thickness monitoring, other examination techniques may be appropriate to identify or monitor for other
specific types of damage mechanisms. In selecting the technique(s) to use during piping inspection, the possible
types of damage for each piping circuit should be taken into consideration. The inspector should consult with a
corrosion specialist or an engineer to help define the type of damage, the NDE technique and extent of examination.
API 571 and API 577 also contains some general guidance on inspection techniques that are appropriate for different
damage mechanisms. Examples of NDE techniques that may be of use include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Magnetic particle examination for cracks and other linear discontinuities that extend to the surface of the material
in ferromagnetic materials. ASME  BPVC , Section V, Article 7, provides guidance on performing MT examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Liquid penetrant examination for disclosing cracks, porosity, or pin holes that extend to the surface of the material
and for outlining other surface imperfections, especially in nonmagnetic materials. ASME  BPVC , Section V,
Article 6, provides guidance on performing PT examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) RT for detecting internal imperfections such as porosity, weld slag inclusions, cracks, and thickness of
components. ASME  BPVC , Section V, Article 2, provides guidance on performing RT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Ultrasonic flaw detection for detecting internal and surface breaking cracks and other elongated discontinuities.
ASME  BPVC , Section V, Article 4, Article 5, and Article 23, provide guidance on performing UT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.3 Surface Preparation for NDE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adequate surface preparation is important for proper visual examination and for the satisfactory application of most
examination methods, such as those mentioned above. The type of surface preparation required depends on the
individual circumstances and NDE technique, but surface preparations such as wire brushing, blasting, chipping,
grinding, or a combination of these preparations may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Advice from NDE specialists may be needed in order to select and apply the proper surface preparation for each
individual NDE technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7.4 UT Angle Beam Examiners<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user shall specify industry-qualified UT angle beam examiners when the owner/user requires the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) detection of interior surface (ID) breaking flaws when inspecting from the external surface (OD); or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) detection, characterization, and/or through-wall sizing of defects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Application examples for the use of industry-qualified UT angle beam examiners include detecting and sizing planer
flaws from the external surface and collecting data for Fitness-For-Service evaluations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8 Corrosion Under Insulation Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection for CUI shall be considered for externally-insulated carbon and low alloy piping operating between 10 °F
(–12 °C) and 350 °F (175 °C). CUI inspections may be conducted as part of the external inspection. If CUI damage
is found during spot checks, the inspector should inspect other susceptible areas on the piping. API 583 on CUI
has much more detailed information on CUI and should be used in conjunction with piping CUI inspection
programs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although external insulation may appear to be in good condition, CUI damage may still be occurring. Non-intrusive
techniques such as real time radiography can help to determine if any scale is present behind the insulation without
removal. Other techniques such as profile radiography, Pulsed Eddy Current and Guided Wave Examination can help
to locate damage. Removal of scale on live equipment and removal of insulation where leaks are suspected can pose
a significant safety risk. CUI damage is often quite insidious in that it can occur in areas where it seems unlikely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>36
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerations for insulation removal include but are not limited to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) history of CUI for the specific piping system or comparable piping systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) visual condition of the external covering and insulation; rust stains, biological growth and bulged weather

<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
bottom of vertical pipe;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
proximity to equipment that could increase the local humidity, (e.g. cooling towers);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) areas where temperature regimes are moving into and out of the CUI temperature range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9 Mixing Point Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mixing points are locations in piping systems where two or more different streams meet. The difference in streams
may be composition, temperature or any other parameter that may contribute to deterioration, accelerated or
localized corrosion, and/or thermal fatigue during normal or abnormal operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All potentially problematic (subject to corrosion or cracking) mixing points should be identified and reviewed to
determine if these areas have an increased susceptibility, or rate of degradation from specific damage mechanisms
as compared to the parent/contributing piping streams. Mixing points identified as such, may be treated as separate
inspection circuits, and these areas may need to be inspected differently, using special techniques, different scope,
and at more frequent intervals when compared to the inspection plan for the parent/contributing piping stream(s). It
should be recognized that after review, some mixing points may not require any special emphasis inspection
techniques or intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Given the wide variation of mixing point designs and operation parameters, it is beyond the scope of this Code to
provide specific inspection recommendations for mixing point circuits. It is anticipated that defining those inspection
recommendations will require careful review in consideration of mix point design (configuration and metallurgy),
stream flow regime, composition and temperature differences, along with expected damage mechanism
susceptibilities, and rates of degradation. Refer to API 574 for additional information on process mixing points.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar to injection point circuits, the preferred methods of inspecting mixing points include; radiography and
ultrasonics (straight beam and/or angle beam) to determine the minimum measured thickness and/or the presence of
other susceptible damage mechanisms (e.g. thermal fatigue cracking and pitting) at each CML.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Changes to mixing points, including but not limited to changes in: flow regime, stream composition or characteristics,
or components of construction and their orientation, should be identified and reviewed to determine what, if any
changes to the inspection plan may be required as a result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.10 Injection Point Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Injection points are sometimes subject to accelerated or localized corrosion from normal or abnormal operating
conditions. Those that are susceptible should be treated as separate inspection circuits, and these areas need to be
inspected thoroughly on a regular schedule.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When designating an injection point circuit for the purposes of inspection, the recommended upstream limit of the
injection point circuit is a minimum of 12 in. (300 mm) or three pipe diameters upstream of the injection point,
whichever is greater. The recommended downstream limit of the injection point circuit is the second change in flow
direction past the injection point, or 25 ft (7.6 m) beyond the first change in flow direction, whichever is less. In some
cases, it may be more appropriate to extend this circuit to the next piece of pressure equipment, as shown in Figure 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The selection of condition monitoring locations (CMLs) within injection point circuits subject to localized corrosion
should be in accordance with the following guidelines:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) establish CMLs on appropriate fittings within the injection point circuit,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) establish CMLs on the pipe wall at the location of expected pipe wall impingement of injected fluid,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) establish CMLs at intermediate locations along the longer straight piping within the injection point circuit may be
required,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_44>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>38
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) establish CMLs at both the upstream and downstream limits of the injection point circuit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preferred methods of inspecting injection points are radiography and/or UT scanning or closely spaced UT grid
inspection, as appropriate, to establish the minimum measured thickness at each CML. Close grid ultrasonic
measurements or scanning may be used, as long as temperatures are appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For some applications, it is beneficial to remove piping spools to facilitate a visual inspection of the inside surface.
However, thickness measurements will still be required to determine the remaining thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During periodic scheduled inspections, more extensive inspection should be applied to an area beginning 12 in.
(300 mm) upstream of the injection nozzle and continuing for at least ten pipe diameters downstream of the injection
point. Additionally, measure and record the thickness at all CMLs within the injection point circuit. The potential for
localized corrosion can occur at the junction where the injection point enters into the primary pipe. The use of profile
radiography at the junction and UT manual scanning of the primary pipe (surrounding and downstream of the
junction) is recommended<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hardware used to inject the fluid into the process stream is important for proper mixing of the streams. Most
configurations use either an injection nozzle or quill that project into the process stream. These injection nozzles (or
quills) should be periodically inspected to assure they are still intact, and are in the correct orientation (i.e. nozzle
pointed upstream if that is the intended design). Use of radiography for periodic inspections of the injection nozzle or
quill is recommended for this purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

for repairs, alterations, and re-rating). Exceptions to this include requirements of the Coast Guard for over water
piping and requirements of local jurisdictions, after welded alterations, buried piping or when specified by the
inspector or piping engineer. When they are conducted, pressure tests shall be performed in accordance with the
requirements of ASME B31.3. Additional considerations for pressure testing are provided in API 574, API 579-1/
ASME FFS-1, and ASME PCC-2 Article 5.1. Service tests and/or lower pressure tests, which are used only for
tightness of piping systems, may be conducted at pressures designated by the owner/user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure tests are typically performed on an entire piping circuit. However, where practical, pressure tests of
individual components/sections can be performed in lieu of entire circuit (e.g. a replacement section of piping). An
engineer should be consulted when a pressure test of piping components/sections is to be performed (including use
of isolation devices) to ensure it is suitable for the intended purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a pressure test is required, it shall be conducted after any heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before applying a hydrostatic test, the supporting structures and foundation design should be reviewed by an
engineer to ensure that they are suitable for the hydrostatic load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The owner/user is cautioned to avoid exceeding 90 % of the specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) for the material at
test temperature and especially for equipment used in elevated temperature service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11.2 Test Fluid<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test fluid should be water unless there is the possibility of damage due to freezing or other adverse effects of
water on the piping system or the process (e.g. process incompatibility with water) or unless the test water will
become contaminated and its disposal will present environmental problems. In either case, another suitable nontoxic
liquid may be used. If the liquid is flammable, its flash point shall be at least 120 °F (49 °C) or greater, and
consideration shall be given to the effect of the test environment on the test fluid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

39<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping fabricated of or having components of austenitic stainless steel should be hydrotested with a solution made up
of potable water (see note), de-ionized/de-mineralized water or steam condensate having a total chloride
concentration (not free chlorine concentration) of less than 50 ppm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Potable water in this context follows U.S. practice, with 250 parts per million maximum chloride, sanitized with chlorine or
ozone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For sensitized austenitic stainless steel piping subject to polythionic stress corrosion cracking, consideration should
be given to using an alkaline-water solution for pressure testing where accelerated corrosion of the sensitized region
may be an issue (see NACE RP 0170).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a pressure test is to be maintained for a period of time and the test fluid in the system is subject to thermal
expansion, precautions shall be taken to avoid pressure build up beyond that specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After testing is completed, the piping should be thoroughly drained (all high-point vents should be open during
draining), air blown, or otherwise dried. If potable water is not available or if immediate draining and drying is not
possible, water having a very low chloride level, higher pH (>10), and inhibitor addition may be considered to reduce
the risk of pitting and microbiologically induced corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11.3 Pneumatic Pressure Tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A pneumatic (or hydro pneumatic) pressure test may be used when it is impracticable to hydrostatically test due to
temperature, structural, or process limitations. However, the potential risks to personnel and property of pneumatic
testing shall be considered when carrying out such a test. As a minimum, the inspection precautions contained in
ASME B31.3 shall be applied in any pneumatic testing. See ASME PCC-2 for precautions on pneumatic pressure
testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11.4 Test Temperature and Brittle Fracture Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At ambient temperatures, carbon, low-alloy, and other steels, including high alloy steels embrittled by service
exposure, may be susceptible to brittle failure. A number of failures have been attributed to brittle fracture of steels
that were exposed to temperatures below their transition temperature and to pressures greater than 25 % of the
required hydrostatic test pressure or 8 ksi of stress, whichever is less. Most brittle fractures, however, have occurred
on the first application of a high stress level (the first hydro test or overload). The potential for a brittle failure shall be
evaluated by an engineer prior to hydrostatic testing or especially prior to pneumatic testing because of the higher
potential energy involved. Special attention should be given when testing low-alloy steels, especially 2 1 / 4 Cr-1Mo,
because they may be prone to temper embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To minimize the risk of brittle fracture during a pressure test, the metal temperature should be maintained at least 3 °F
(17 °C) above the MDMT for piping that is more than 2 in. (5 cm) thick, and 10 °F (6 °C) above the MDMT for piping
that have a thickness of 2 in. (5 cm) or less. The test temperature need not exceed 120 °F (50 °C) unless there is
information on the brittle characteristics of the piping construction material indicating a higher test temperature is
needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11.5 Precautions and Procedures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During a pressure test, where the test pressure will exceed the set pressure of the pressure relieving device on a
piping system, the pressure relieving device(s) should be removed or blanked for the duration of the test. As an
alternative, each valve disk shall be held down by a suitably designed test clamp. The application of an additional load
to the valve spring by turning the adjusting screw is prohibited. Other appurtenances that are incapable of
withstanding the test pressure, such as gage glasses, pressure gages, expansion joints, and rupture disks, should be
removed or blanked. Lines containing expansion joints that cannot be removed or isolated may be tested at a
reduced pressure in accordance with the principles of ASME B31.3. If block valves are used to isolate a piping<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_46>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>40
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>system for a pressure test, caution should be used to not exceed the permissible seat pressure as described in ASME
B16.34 or applicable valve manufacturer data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Upon completion of the pressure test, pressure relieving devices of the proper settings and other appurtenances
removed or made inoperable during the pressure test shall be reinstalled or reactivated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before applying a pressure test, appropriate precautions and procedures should be taken into account to assure the
safety of personnel involved with the pressure test. A close visual inspection of piping components should not be
performed until the equipment pressure is at or below the MAWP. This review is especially important for in-service
piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11.6 Pressure Testing Alternatives<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Appropriate NDE shall be specified and conducted when a pressure test is not performed after a major repair or
alteration. Substituting NDE procedures for a pressure test after an alteration is allowed only after the engineer and
inspector have approved the substitution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For cases where UT is used in lieu of a pressure test, the owner/user shall specify industry-qualified UT angle beam
examiners. ASME B31 Code Case 179 may be used in lieu of RT for B31.1 piping welds, and alternative UT
acceptance criteria provided in B31 Code Case 181 may be used in lieu of those described in para. 344.6.2 of ASME
B31.3, as applicable, for closure welds that have not been pressure tested and for welding repairs identified by the
engineer or inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.12 Material Verification and Traceability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user shall assess the need for and extent of application of a material verification program consistent with
API 578 addressing inadvertent material substitution in existing alloy piping systems. A material verification program
consistent with API 578 may include procedures for prioritization and risk ranking of piping circuits. That assessment
may lead to retroactive PMI examination, as described in API 578, to confirm that the installed materials are
consistent with the intended service. Components identified during this verification that do not meet acceptance
criteria of the PMI examination program (such as in API 578) would be targeted for replacement. The owner/user and
authorized piping inspector, in consultation with a corrosion specialist, shall establish a schedule for replacement of
those components. The authorized inspector shall use periodic NDE, as necessary, on the identified components until
the replacement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In lines in older process units operating above 500 °F (260 °C) and subject to sulfidation corrosion, carbon steel
piping containing less than 0.1 wt % silicon can corrode at significantly higher rates than higher silicon carbon steels
(modern “silicon-killed” process). For piping systems / circuits that have been identified in sulfidation corrosion service
that may contain older low silicon carbon steels, consideration should be given to conducting inspection of each
piping segment in order to identify the worst case corrosion rate / limiting component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After about 1985 to 1990, most purchased pipe became double stamped, and hence the low-silicon issue diminished
for piping purchased and installed after that time frame. Inspection techniques that can be useful for finding
susceptible components under insulation include real time radiography, GWT, and PEC. Inspection plans for
sulfidation corrosion should be in accordance with API 939-C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During repairs or alterations to alloy material piping systems, where the alloy material is required to maintain pressure
containment, the inspector shall verify that the installation of new materials is consistent with the selected or specified
construction materials. This material verification program should be consistent with API 578. Using risk assessment
procedures, the owner/user can make this assessment by 100 % verification, PMI examination in certain critical
situations, or by sampling a percentage of the materials. PMI examination can be accomplished by the inspector or
the examiner with the use of suitable methods as described in API 578.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

41<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a piping system component should fail because an incorrect material was inadvertently substituted for the proper
piping material, the inspector shall consider the need for further verification of existing piping materials. The extent of
further verification will depend upon circumstances such as the consequences of failure and the probability of further
material errors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.13 Inspection of Valves<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally, thickness measurements are not routinely taken on valves in piping circuits. The body of a valve is normally
thicker than other piping components for design reasons. However, when valves are dismantled for servicing and
repair, the shop personnel should visually examine the valve components for any unusual corrosion patterns or
thinning and, when noted, report that information to the inspector. Bodies of valves that are exposed to significant
temperature cycling (for example, catalytic reforming unit regeneration and steam cleaning) should be examined
periodically for thermal fatigue cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If gate valves are known to be or are suspected of being exposed to severe or unusual corrosion-erosion, thickness
readings should be conducted on the body between the seats, since this is an area of high turbulence and high
stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Control valves or other throttling valves, particularly in high-pressure drop and slurry services, can be susceptible to
localized corrosion/erosion of the body downstream of the orifice. If such metal loss is suspected, the valve should be
removed from the line for internal inspection. The inside of the downstream mating flange and piping also should be
inspected for local metal loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When valve body and/or closure pressure tests are performed after servicing, they should be conducted in
accordance with API 598.Critical check valves should be adequately inspected or tested to provide greater assurance
that they will prevent flow reversals. An example of a critical check valve may be the check valve located on the outlet
of a multistage, high head hydro processing charge pump. Failure of such a check valve to operate correctly could
result in over pressuring the piping during a flow reversal. The normal visual inspection method should include the
following items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Checking to insure that the flapper is free to move, as required, without looseness beyond tolerance due to wear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The flapper stop should not have wear beyond tolerance. This will minimize the likelihood that the flapper will
move past the top dead central position and remain in an open position when the check valve is mounted in a
vertical position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The flapper nut should be secured to the flapper bolt to avoid backing off in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leak checks of critical check valves are normally not required, but may be considered for special circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.14 In-service Inspection of Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection for piping weld quality is normally accomplished as a part of the requirements for new construction, repairs,
or alterations. However, welds are often inspected for corrosion as part of a radiographic profile inspection or as part
of internal inspection. When preferential weld corrosion is noted, additional welds in the same circuit or system should
be examined for corrosion. API 577 provides additional guidance on weld inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Due to the different capabilities and characteristics of various NDE methods to find flaws, using an NDE method that
is different from the one employed during original fabrication may reveal pre-existing flaws that were not caused by in-
service exposure (e.g., applying UT and MT for in-service inspection when only RT was applied during fabrication).
For this reason, it is often a good practice to specify the types of NDE during original fabrication that the owner/user
plans to apply during in-service inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_48>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>42
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On occasion, radiographic profile examinations of welds that have been in-service may reveal a flaw in the weld. If
crack-like imperfections are detected while the piping system is in operation, further inspection with weld quality
radiography and/or UT should be used to assess the magnitude of the imperfection. Additionally, the inspector should
make an effort to determine whether the crack-like imperfections are from original weld fabrication or may be from an
environmental cracking mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Crack-like flaws and environmental cracking shall be assessed by an engineer in accordance with API 579-1/ASME
FFS-1 and/or corrosion specialist. Preferential weld corrosion shall be assessed by the inspector. Issues to consider
when assessing the quality of existing welds include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) original fabrication inspection method and acceptance criteria;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) extent, magnitude, and orientation of imperfections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) length of time in service;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) operating versus design conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) presence of secondary piping stresses (residual and thermal);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
potential for fatigue loads (mechanical and thermal);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) primary or secondary piping system;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) potential for impact or transient loads;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
potential for environmental cracking;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
repair and heat treatment history;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) dissimilar metal welds such as ferritic-to-austenitic and alloy 400 to carbon steel welds;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
weld hardness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For in-service piping weldments, it may not be appropriate to use the original construction code radiography
acceptance criteria for weld quality in ASME B31.3. The B31.3 acceptance criteria are intended to apply to new
construction on a sampling of welds, not just the welds examined, in order to assess the probable quality of all welds
(or welders) in the system. Some welds may exist that will not meet these criteria but will still perform satisfactorily in-
service after being hydrostatically tested. This is especially true on small branch connections that are normally not
examined during new construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user shall specify industry-qualified UT angle beam examiners when the owner/user requires either of the
following items.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Detection of interior surface (ID) breaking planar flaws when inspecting from the external surface (OD).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Where detection, characterization, and/or through-wall sizing is required of planar defects. Application examples
for the use of such industry-qualified UT angle beam examiners include obtaining flaw dimensions for Fitness-For-
Service assessment and monitoring of known flaws.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.15 Inspection of Flanged Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flanged joints should be examined for evidence of leakage, such as stains, deposits, or drips. Process leaks onto
flange fasteners and valve bonnet fasteners may result in corrosion or environmental cracking. This examination<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_49>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P IPING  I NSPECTION  C ODE : I N - SERVICE  I NSPECTION , R ATING , R EPAIR ,  AND  A LTERATION   OF  P IPING  S YSTEMS
43<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>should include those flanges enclosed with flange or splash-and-spray guards. Flanged joints that have been
clamped and pumped with sealant should be checked for leakage at the bolts. Fasteners subjected to such leakage
may corrode or crack (e.g. caustic cracking). If repumping is contemplated, affected fasteners should be renewed
first.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Accessible flange faces should be examined for distortion and to determine the condition of gasket-seating surfaces.
If flanges are significantly bent or distorted, their markings and thicknesses should be checked against engineering
requirements before taking corrective action.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flange fasteners should be examined visually for corrosion and thread engagement. Fasteners should be fully
engaged. Any fastener failing to do so is considered acceptably engaged if the lack of complete engagement is not
more than one thread (moved to 574). The markings on a representative sample of newly installed fasteners and
gaskets should be examined to determine whether they meet the material specification. The markings are identified in
the applicable ASME and ASTM standards. Questionable fasteners should be verified or renewed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Additional guidance on the inspection of flanged joints can be found in ASME PCC-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 Interval/Frequency and Extent of Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To ensure equipment integrity, all piping systems and pressure-relieving devices shall be inspected at the intervals/
frequencies provided in this section. Scheduled inspections shall be conducted on or before their due date or be
considered overdue for inspection. Alternatively, an inspection due date may be determined through a risk
assessment in accordance with API 580. This due date may exceed the typical half-life interval used in a more
conventional analysis. Note not all RBI analysis produce an inspection interval, some generate an inspection due
date based on acceptable risk criteria. See 7.13 for more information and requirements on overdue inspections,
inspection deferrals, and inspection interval revisions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The appropriate inspection shall provide the information necessary to determine that all of the essential sections or
components of the equipment are safe to operate until the next scheduled inspection. The risks associated with
operational shutdown and start-up and the possibility of increased corrosion due to exposure of equipment surfaces
to air and moisture during shutdown should be evaluated when an internal inspection is being planned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Code is based upon monitoring a representative sampling of inspection locations on selected piping with specific
intent to reveal a reasonably accurate assessment of the condition of the piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Inspection During Installation and Service Changes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1 Piping Installation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping shall be inspected in accordance with code of construction requirements at the time of installation. The
purpose of installation inspection is to verify that the piping is clean and safe for operation, and to initiate plant
inspection records for the piping systems. The minimum installation inspection should include the following items:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) verifying that piping is installed correctly, the correct metallurgy is installed, supports are adequate and secured,
exterior attachments such as supports, shoes, hangers are secured, insulation is properly installed, flanged and
other mechanical connections are properly assembled and the piping is clean and dry;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) verifying the pressure-relieving devices satisfy design requirements (correct device and correct set pressure) and
are properly installed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This installation inspection should document base-line thickness measurements to be used as initial thickness
readings for corrosion rate calculations in lieu of nominal and minimum design thickness data in specifications, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>design datasheets/drawings. This will also facilitate the creation of an accurate corrosion rate calculation after the first
in-service thickness measurements are recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2 Piping Service Change<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the service conditions of the piping system are changed, i.e. will exceed the current operating envelope (e.g.,
process contents, maximum operating pressure, and the maximum and minimum operating temperature), inspection
intervals shall be established for the new service conditions, including the review of applicable pressure relieving
device settings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If both the ownership and the location of the piping are changed, the piping shall be inspected before it is reused.
Also, the allowable service conditions and the inspection interval shall be established for the new service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Piping Inspection Planning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency and extent of inspection on piping circuits whether above or below ground depend on the forms of
degradation that can affect the piping and consequence of a piping failure. The various forms of degradation that can
affect process piping circuits are described in API 571 in more detail. A simplified classification of piping based on the
consequence of failure is defined in 6.3.4. As described in 5.3, inspection strategy based on probability and
consequence of failure is referred to as RBI.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The simplified piping classification scheme in 6.3.4 is based on the consequence of a failure. The classification is
used to establish frequency and extent of inspection. The owner/user may devise a more extensive classification
scheme that more accurately assesses consequence for certain piping circuits. The consequence assessment would
consider the potential for explosion, fire, toxicity, environmental impact, and other potential effects associated with a
failure. Reference API 580 Assessing Consequence of Failure guidelines and requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After an effective assessment is conducted, the results can be used to establish a piping circuit inspection strategy
and define the appropriate inspection plan per 5.2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2 Setting Inspection Intervals with RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RBI assessment conducted in accordance with API 580 may be used to determine the inspection intervals or next
inspection due date and extent of inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.3 Setting Inspection Intervals Without the Use of RBI<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If RBI is not being used, the interval between piping inspections shall be established and maintained by using the
following criteria:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the corrosion rate and remaining life calculations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the piping service classification (see 6.3.4);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the applicable jurisdictional requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) and the judgment of the inspector, the piping engineer, the piping engineer supervisor, or a materials specialist,
based on operating conditions, previous inspection history, current inspection results, and conditions that may
warrant supplemental inspections covered in 5.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user or the inspector shall establish inspection intervals for thickness measurements and external visual
inspections and, where applicable, for internal and supplemental inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For Class 1, 2, and 3 piping, the period between thickness measurements for CMLs or circuits should not exceed
one-half the remaining life or the maximum intervals recommended in Table 1, whichever is less. Whenever the
remaining life is less than four years, the inspection interval may be the full remaining life up to a maximum of two
years. The interval is established by the inspector or piping engineer in accordance with the owner/user's QA system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Maximum intervals for Class 4 piping are left to the determination of the owner/user depending upon reliability and
business needs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For piping that is in non-continuous service, the interval between thickness measurements may be based on the
number of years of actual service (piping in operation) instead of calendar years, provided that when idled, the piping
is:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) isolated from the process fluids, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) not exposed to corrosive internal environments (e.g. inert gas purged or filled with noncorrosive hydrocarbons).
Piping that is in non-continuous service and not adequately protected from corrosive environments may
experience increased internal corrosion while idle. The corrosion rates should be carefully reviewed before setting
the intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection interval shall be reviewed and adjusted as necessary after each inspection or significant change in
operating conditions and/or inspection results. General corrosion, localized corrosion, pitting, environmental cracking,
and other applicable forms of deterioration mentioned in 5.5 and API 571 shall be considered when establishing the
various inspection intervals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4 Piping Service Classes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All process piping systems shall be categorized into different piping classes except for piping that has been planned
on the basis of RBI. Such a classification system allows extra inspection efforts to be focused on piping systems that
may have the highest potential consequences if failure or loss of containment should occur. In general, the higher
classified systems require more extensive inspection at shorter intervals in order to affirm their integrity for continued
safe operation. Classifications should be based on potential safety and environmental effects should a leak occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Owner/users shall maintain a record of process piping fluids handled, including their classifications. NFPA 704
provides information that may be helpful in classifying piping systems according to the potential hazards of the
process fluids they contain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   The operating temperature of a hydrocarbon stream relative to its flash point, boiling point and auto-ignition temperature
is a significant factor in defining potential consequence of a release. Operating temperature of hydrocarbon piping systems should
be considered when assigning piping service class. For example, on-site ambient temperature gasoline is Class 2 since it is below
the boiling point but above the flash point of gasoline. However, on-site gasoline at 550 °F should be Class 1 since auto-ignition
can occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The four classes listed below in 6.3.4.2 through 6.3.4.5 are recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4.2 Class 1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Services with the highest potential of resulting in an immediate emergency if a leak were to occur are in Class 1. Such
an emergency may be safety or environmental in nature. Examples of Class 1 piping include, but are not necessarily
limited to, those containing the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Flammable services that can auto-refrigerate and lead to brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Pressurized services that can rapidly vaporize during release, creating vapors that can collect and form an
explosive mixture, such as C2, C3, and C4 streams. Fluids that can rapidly vaporize are those with atmospheric
boiling temperatures below 50 °F (10 °C) or where the atmospheric boiling point is below the operating
temperature (typically a concern with high-temperature services).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Hydrogen sulfide (greater than 3 % weight) in a gaseous stream.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>g) Flammable services operating above their auto-ignition temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4.3 Class 2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Services not included in other classes are in Class 2. This classification includes the majority of unit process piping
and selected off-site piping. Typical examples of these services include but are not necessarily limited to those
containing the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) on-site hydrocarbons that will slowly vaporize during release such as those operating below the boiling point but
above the flash point,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) on-site hydrogen, fuel gas, and natural gas,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) on-site strong acids and caustics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4.4 Class 3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Services that are either flammable but do not significantly vaporize when they leak, i.e. below the flash point, or
flammable but are located in remote areas and operate below the boiling point are in Class 3. Services that are
potentially harmful to human tissue but are located in remote areas may be included in this class. Examples of Class
3 service include, but are not necessarily limited to, those containing the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Extent of Visual External and CUI Inspections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External visual inspections, including inspections for CUI, should be conducted at intervals no greater than those
listed in Table 1. Alternatively, external visual inspection intervals or due dates can be established by using a valid RBI
assessment conducted in accordance with API 580. This external visual inspection for potential CUI is also to assess
insulation condition and shall be conducted on all piping systems susceptible to CUI. The results of the visual
inspection should be documented to facilitate follow-up inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Following the external visual inspection of susceptible systems, additional examination is required for the inspection
of CUI. The extent and type of the additional CUI inspection are listed in Table 2. Damaged insulation at higher
elevations may result in CUI in lower areas remote from the damage. NDE inspection for CUI should also be
conducted as listed in Table 2 at suspect locations operating between 10 °F (–12 °C) and 350 °F (175 °C) for carbon
steel and low alloy steel piping. RT or insulation removal and visual inspection is normally required for this inspection
at damaged or suspect locations. Other NDE assessment methods may be used where applicable. If the inspection
of the damaged or suspect areas has located significant CUI, additional areas should be inspected and, where
warranted, up to 100 % of the circuit should be inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The extent of the CUI program described in Table 2 should be considered as target levels for piping systems and
locations with no CUI inspection experience. It is recognized that several factors may affect the likelihood of CUI to
include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping systems that are known to have a remaining life of over 10 years or that are adequately protected against
external corrosion need not be included for the NDE inspection recommended in Table 2. However, the condition of
the insulating system or the outer jacketing, such as a cold-box shell, should be observed periodically by operating or
other personnel. If deterioration is noted, it should be reported to the inspector. The following are examples of these
systems:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) piping systems insulated effectively to preclude the entrance of moisture,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) jacketed cryogenic piping systems,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) piping systems installed in a cold box in which the atmosphere is purged with an inert gas,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) piping systems in which the temperature being maintained is sufficiently low or sufficiently high to preclude the
presence of water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The external visual inspection on bare piping is to assess the condition of paint and coating systems, to check for
external corrosion, and to check for other forms of deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.1 CML Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To satisfy inspection interval requirements, each thickness measurement inspection should obtain thickness readings
on a representative sampling of the total number of CMLs on each circuit (see 5.6). It is not the intent of this Code that
every established CML needs to be measured each time. A statistical sampling of active CMLs may be monitored. In
addition some CMLs may be documented as inactive and therefore do not need to be measured and would not be
considered overdue. This representative sampling should include data for all the various types of components and
orientations (horizontal and vertical) found in each circuit. This sampling also shall include CMLs with the earliest<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>renewal date as of the previous inspection. Where general thinning is predicted, this sampling should include all the
various types of components within the circuit. Where localized damage mechanisms are identified, sampling should
also include the location and orientation (top/bottom, inside/outside radius, etc.) where the damage is most likely to
occur.  The number and specific CMLs to be monitored at each inspection shall be determined by the inspector in
consultation with a piping engineer and/or corrosion specialist where non-uniform corrosion or other damage
mechanisms are expected. Therefore, scheduled inspection of circuits should obtain as many measurements as
necessary to satisfactorily monitor the type and extent of damage anticipated in each piping system. If RBI is used to
set the inspection interval or due date, CMLs not required for inspection per the RBI assessment do not need to be
inspected in accordance with the recommended maximum inspection intervals in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To determine the extent of thickness measurements necessary in order to develop a corrosion rate and remaining life,
two basic approaches are acceptable as discussed below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.2 Point-to-Point Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An analysis method, whereby the corrosion rate, remaining life and re-inspection interval is determined for each
individual CML. Future inspections are managed based on the worst case  1 / 2  life established at each CML location.
During a re-inspection of a piping system, all of the CMLs may be re-inspected or only those that are coming due.
This method can lead to frequent inspections of the same piping system if not carefully managed. It is generally not
possible to apply a statistical analysis with the point-to-point method since 1) a relationship of one CML to another has
not been established, making it difficult to compare corrosion rates in the circuit or between CMLs, and 2) the
individual CML rates may be generated over significantly different time periods, when operating conditions may have
changed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.3 Circuit Analysis Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where piping has been properly circuitized into common corrosion mechanisms and expected rates, a statistical
analysis may be used to determine a representative circuit corrosion rate and inspection interval. There are a number
of considerations for using a statistical analysis approach that are necessary to remain appropriately conservative,
some of which include the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Approach is generally applicable to damage mechanisms that produce uniform and some mildly localized
corrosion environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Locations that exhibit significantly different corrosion rates and locations with shorter remaining life may need to
be analyzed separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) A sampling statistic should be considered to check the statistical confidence factor given the variability of the data
set (within a circuit).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The number of data points (CMLs) may need to be adjusted to achieve the desired statistical confidence before
employing a statistical methodology.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) A safety factor or confidence interval, which may be dependent on the expected damage mechanisms and may
additionally account for circuit complexity, should be considered to account for uncertainties such as
measurement error and overall failure risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
CML re-inspection shall not be extended beyond the date projected to reach the established minimum required
thickness. Absolute limits should be considered for re-inspection of CMLs based on the likelihood of failure (e.g.,
time or thickness limit).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a minimum, the worst-case CMLs within the circuit shall be inspected at the next established inspection interval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_56>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>50
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.4 Data Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some level of data analysis is recommended under both approaches. Since the calculated corrosion rate used to
predict the future remaining life was a product of the prior operating history, it is important to check for any
acceleration of the corrosion rate over time and to be aware of planned operational changes. Good quality MOC and
IOW programs are necessary where critical process variables that may affect corrosion/damage rate or susceptibility
are tracked. Additional data analysis should consider the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Is the measured rate within the expected / predicted range?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Is the short rate significantly different from the long rate?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Has the variability (or standard deviation) within the circuit data increased significantly over time?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Do particular components, orientations, sections within the circuit or other identifiable features of the circuit exhibit
significantly different rates?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Have data anomalies been resolved, either through a review process or verification readings, prior to data
analysis?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general both approaches should be developed considering the potential active damage mechanisms within the
piping system. Representative CMLs should be primarily based on the locations where the damage mechanisms are
likely to be most active but should also include a sampling of all sizes, orientations, component types and design
features (e.g. control valve stations, equipment inlets/outlets, alternate flow piping, etc) within the line or circuit. This
sampling also shall include CMLs with the earliest renewal date as of the previous inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For general corrosion, it may not be necessary to identify the specific orientation of the sample point. Where localized
damage mechanisms are expected, sampling should include the orientation (top/bottom, inside/outside radius, etc.)
to help identify the specific active mechanism and provide data for future adjustments to CML locations. The number
and specific CMLs to be monitored at each inspection shall be determined by the inspector in consultation with a
piping engineer and/or corrosion specialist where non-uniform corrosion or other damage mechanisms are expected.
Statistical tools may be used to determine or adjust the CML quantities when prior data are available. For new circuits
or those with a change in service, data from a similar service may be applied to estimate CML quantities and/or
locations. Circuit inspections should include as many measurements as necessary to satisfactorily monitor the type
and extent of damage anticipated in each piping system. CMLs that are not driving the next inspection interval do not
necessarily need to be inspected in accordance with the recommended maximum inspection intervals in Table 1. If a
circuit statistical analysis method is to be performed, a representative sampling of all CMLs should be taken, to avoid
skewing the data. Representative sampling is not an important consideration using the point to point method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition, some CMLs may be documented as “inactive” or “archived”. These are CML points that have essentially
been eliminated from the active registry but are being maintained for historical record purposes. There are several
reasons to consider inactivating or archiving CMLs, including; inappropriate placement of CML, sufficient coverage by
other CMLs, lack of historical corrosion activity, inaccessible during operation (e.g. furnace tubes), considered as
“downtime/turnaround” only CMLs, etc. Although these CMLs may be maintained within the system (or electronic
IDMS), they do not need to be measured on calculated intervals and would not be considered as overdue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Specific attention should be paid to damage that may have been inflicted by mechanical overloading on SBP since
the strength and support systems for SBP are sometimes not adequate to avoid overload (e.g. vents, drains, bridles,
etc).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where RBI is not in use, SBP that is secondary process piping has different minimum requirements depending upon
service classification. Class 1 and 2 secondary SBP shall be inspected to the same requirements as primary process
piping. Inspection of Class 3 and Class 4 secondary SBP is optional at the owner-users discretion depending upon
reliability and risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Insulated SBP should receive the same inspection practices for CUI as the primary piping or vessels to which it is

<<HEADING level=3>>6.6.2 Deadleg Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deadlegs, including both large bore and small bore piping (e.g. level bridles), can be areas of increased corrosion
requiring special attention if they are deemed potentially corrosive by a corrosion specialist because of: the
accumulation of contaminated water, solid materials, different temperatures from the main line or the accumulation or
concentration of corrosive species (e.g. ammonium salts, organic acids, hydrogen sulfide and acidic deposits). Risk
assessment can be useful in determining which piping system deadlegs may be a higher threat to accelerated
corrosion than active piping circuits. Deadlegs that are part of primary piping systems should be considered at greater
risk because of the inability to valve them off in the event of a leak and the higher potential consequence of a large
leak.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consideration should be given to removing potentially corrosive deadlegs that are non-essential. Corrosion
specialists should be consulted for placement of CMLs on deadlegs because of their potential for localized corrosion,
especially with regard to accelerated corrosion above and below liquid interfaces. Infrared thermography may be
useful for locating liquid interfaces in deadlegs. Inspections of horizontal deadlegs that may not be liquid full should
have examination points in all four quadrants of any CMLs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Potentially corrosive deadlegs with CMLs should be tracked in a separate piping circuit from the mainline piping.
These deadlegs or low points are typically identified and documented in the inspection records and on inspection
ISO's. Deadlegs may be combined into one circuit if their anticipated damage mechanisms and corrosion rates are
similar. Inspections should include profile radiography on small diameter deadlegs, such as vents and drains, and
scanning UT or RT on larger diameter deadlegs. Other examination techniques for deadlegs include EMAT and PEC.
Profile RT should be employed for deadlegs that may be susceptible to fouling deposits that could cause
underdeposit corrosion or other integrity problems (e.g. fouling in relief lines).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deadlegs that may collect water and be susceptible to freezing from external ambient conditions should be
adequately insulated and heat traced for such cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6.3 Auxiliary Piping Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of auxiliary SBP associated with instruments and machinery is optional and the need for which would
typically be determined by risk assessment. Criteria to consider in determining whether auxiliary SBP will need some
form of inspection include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) piping classification;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) potential for environmental or fatigue cracking, particularly on non-braced SBP (e.g. reciprocating and centrifugal
compressors, flow induced vibration);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) potential for corrosion based on experience with adjacent primary systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) potential for CUI;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) potential for fatigue, erosion and/or corrosion on thermowells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6.4 Threaded-connection Inspection and Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of threaded connections should be according to the requirements listed above for small-bore and auxiliary
piping. When selecting CMLs on threaded connections, include those threaded connections that can be radiographed
during scheduled inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When seal-welding threaded connections to reduce likelihood of threaded connection failure scenarios, pay close
attention to weld prep cleanliness to avoid welding defects and cover all threads completely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SBP connections associated with rotating equipment, especially threaded connections are often subject to fatigue
damage. As such, they should be periodically assessed and considered for possible renewal with a thicker wall or
upgrading joint design. The need for such renewal will depend on several issues, including the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) classification of piping,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) magnitude and frequency of vibration,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) amount of unsupported weight,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) current piping wall thickness,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) whether or not the system can be maintained on-stream,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
corrosion rate,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) intermittent service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.7.3 PRD Testing and Inspection Intervals<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure-relieving devices shall be tested and inspected at intervals that are frequent enough to verify that the valves
perform reliably in the particular service conditions. Other pressure-relieving devices (e.g. rupture disks and vacuum-
breaker valves) shall be inspected at intervals based on service conditions. The inspection interval for all pressure-
relieving devices is determined by the inspector, engineer, or other qualified individual per the owner/user's quality
assurance system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7.3.2 PRD Testing and Inspection Intervals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless documented experience and/or an RBI assessment indicates that a longer interval is acceptable, test and
inspection intervals for pressure-relieving devices in typical process services should not exceed:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) 5 years for typical process services, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) 10 years for clean (non-fouling) and noncorrosive services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a pressure-relieving device is found to be heavily fouled or stuck, or when a PRD fails an as received pop test,
the inspection and testing interval shall be reduced unless a review shows that the device will perform reliably at the
current interval. The owner user should define the criteria which constitute an “As received” pop test failure. The
owner user may define criteria for failure based on “As received” pop test pressure as a percentage of set pressure.
As a default criteria for a valve being stuck shut, use a max 150 % of set pressure beyond which the valve is classified
as stuck shut if it does not pop, and the test is discontinued. The review should determine the cause of the failure or
the reasons for the pressure-relieving device not operating properly. When PRDs are removed for inspection and
testing, inlet and outlet lines should be visually inspected for fouling and plugging.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7 Inspection Data Evaluation, Analysis, and Recording<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Corrosion Rate Determination<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user may use either the Point-to-Point analysis method or a statistical analysis method, or a combination
of both, to determine the long term or short time corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.2 Point-to-Point Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Long Term (LT) corrosion rate of an individual CML shall be calculated from the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion rate LT

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<PARAGRAPH>>(1)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Short Term (ST) corrosion rate of an individual CML shall be calculated from the following formula:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion rate ST
t initial
t actual
–
time years
)   between   t previous   and  t actual
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t initial
is the thickness, in inches (millimeters), at the same location as tactual measured at initial installation
or at the commencement of a new corrosion rate environment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t previous
is the thickness, in inches (millimeters), at the same location as tactual measured during one or more
previous inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>LT and ST corrosion rates should be compared to see which results in the shortest remaining life as part of the data
assessment. The authorized inspector, in consultation with a corrosion specialist, shall select the corrosion rate that
best reflects the current process (see 6.3.3 for inspection interval determination).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1.3 Statistical Analysis Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Owner–User may elect to use a statistical analysis method (e.g. probability plots or related tools) to establish a
representative corrosion, remaining life estimate and/or re-inspection date. Any statistical approach shall be
documented. Care shall be taken to ensure that the statistical treatment of data results reflects a reasonably
conservative representation of the various pipe components within the circuit. Statistical analysis employing point
measurements is not applicable to piping circuits with significant localized unpredictable corrosion mechanisms (See
additional notes and statistical analysis in 6.5). There are many statistical tools that can be employed once Piping
Circuits have been properly established. While such calculations offer a convenient means to numerically summarize
Circuit data, it is often the combination of descriptive statistics plus data visualization through statistical plots that
provide the most useful results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See API 574 for additional discussion on statistical analysis methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Remaining Life Calculations<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t actual
is the actual thickness, in inches (millimeters), measured at the time of inspection for a given location
or component as specified in 5.7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t required
is the required thickness, in inches (millimeters), at the same location or component as the actual
measurement computed by the design formulas (e.g. pressure and structural) before corrosion
allowance and manufacturer's tolerance are added.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Newly Installed Piping Systems or Changes in Service<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For new piping systems and piping systems for which service conditions are being changed, one of the following
methods shall be employed to determine the probable rate of corrosion from which the remaining wall thickness at the
time of the next inspection can be estimated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) A corrosion rate for a piping circuit may be calculated from data collected by the owner/user on piping systems of
similar material in comparable service and comparable operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) If data for the same or similar service are not available, a corrosion rate for a piping circuit may be estimated from
the owner/user's experience or from published data on piping systems in comparable service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) If the probable corrosion rate cannot be determined by either method listed in 7.3a) or 7.3b), the initial thickness
measurement determinations shall be made after no more than three months of service by using nondestructive
thickness measurements of the piping system. Corrosion monitoring devices, such as corrosion coupons or
corrosion probes, may be useful in establishing the timing of these thickness measurements. Subsequent
measurements shall be made after appropriate intervals until the corrosion rate is established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Existing and Replacement Piping<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion rates shall be calculated on one of the methods identified in 7.1. For repaired or in-kind replacement piping,
the corrosion rate shall be established based on the previous worse case measured rate at the replacement location
or the circuit average rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If calculations indicate that an inaccurate rate of corrosion has been assumed, the rate to be used for the next period
shall be adjusted to agree with the actual rate found.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 MAWP Determination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The MAWP for the continued use of piping systems shall be established using the applicable code. Computations
may be made for known materials if all the following essential details are known to comply with the principles of the
applicable code:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) upper and/or lower temperature limits for specific materials,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) quality of materials and workmanship,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) inspection requirements,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) reinforcement of openings,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) any cyclical service requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_62>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>56
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For unknown materials, computations may be made assuming the lowest grade material and joint efficiency in the
applicable code. When the MAWP is recalculated, the wall thickness used in these computations shall be the actual
thickness as determined by inspection minus twice the estimated corrosion loss before the date of the next inspection
(see 6.3.3). Allowance shall be made for the other loadings in accordance with the applicable code. The applicable
code allowances for pressure and temperature variations from the MAWP are permitted provided all of the associated
code criteria are satisfied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex D contains two examples of calculations of MAWP illustrating the use of the corrosion half-life concept.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Required Thickness Determination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The required thickness of a pipe shall be the greater of the pressure design thickness or the structural minimum
thickness. For services with high risk, the piping engineer should consider increasing the required thickness to
provide for unanticipated or unknown loadings, or undiscovered metal loss. See API 574, Second Edition, Section 11
for information on the determination of pressure design thicknesses, structural minimum thicknesses, minimum
required thicknesses, and minimum alert thicknesses. Table 7 in Section 12 of API 574 provides examples of
minimum alert thicknesses and default minimum structural thicknesses for carbon and low alloy steel piping operating
below 400 °F (205 °C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7 Assessment of Inspection Findings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure containing components found to have degradation that could affect their load carrying capability [pressure
loads and other applicable loads (e.g. weight, wind, etc., per API 579-1/ASME FFS-1)] shall be evaluated for
continued service or removed from service until corrective actions/repairs are performed. Fitness-for-Service
techniques, such as those documented in API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, latest edition, may be used for this evaluation.
The Fitness-for-Service techniques used shall be applicable to the specific degradation observed. The following
techniques may be used as applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) To evaluate metal loss in excess of the corrosion allowance, a Fitness-For-Service assessment may be performed
in accordance with one of the following parts of API 579-1/ASME FFS-1. This assessment requires the use of a
future corrosion allowance, which shall be established, based on 7.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Assessment of General Metal Loss—API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Assessment of Local Metal Loss—API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Assessment of Pitting Corrosion—API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) To evaluate blisters and laminations, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed in accordance with
API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 7. In some cases, this evaluation will require the use of a future corrosion
allowance, which shall be established, based on 7.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
To evaluate weld misalignment and piping distortions, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed in
accordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) To evaluate crack-like flaws, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed in accordance with API 579-1/
ASME FFS-1, Part 9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) To evaluate the effects of fire damage, a Fitness-for-Service assessment should be performed in accordance with
API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, Part 11.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.8 Piping Stress Analysis<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping shall be supported and guided so that:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) its weight is carried safely,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) it has sufficient flexibility for thermal expansion or contraction, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) it does not vibrate excessively, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) accounts for other loads (e.g. those included in the original code of construction).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping flexibility is of increasing concern the larger the diameter of the piping and the greater the difference between
ambient and operating temperature conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping stress analysis to assess system flexibility and support adequacy is not normally performed as part of a piping
inspection. However, many existing piping systems were analyzed as part of their original design or as part of a re-
rating or modification, and the results of these analyses can be useful in developing inspection plans. When
unexpected movement of a piping system is observed, such as during an external visual inspection (see 5.5.5), the
inspector should discuss these observations with the piping engineer and evaluate the need for conducting a piping
stress analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See API 574 for more information on pressure design, minimum required and structural minimum thicknesses,
including formulas, example problems and default tables of suggested minimums.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping stress analysis can identify the most highly stressed components in a piping system and predict the thermal
movement of the system when it is placed in operation. This information can be used to concentrate inspection efforts
at the locations most prone to fatigue damage from thermal expansion (heat up and cool down) cycles and/or creep
damage in high-temperature piping. Comparing predicted thermal movements with observed movement can help
identify the occurrence of unexpected operating conditions and deterioration of guides and supports. Consultation
with the piping engineer may be necessary to explain observed deviations from the analysis predictions, particularly
for complicated systems involving multiple supports and guides between end points.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping stress analysis also can be employed to help solve observed piping vibration problems. The natural
frequencies in which a piping system will vibrate can be predicted by analysis. The effects of additional guiding can be
evaluated to assess its ability to control vibration by increasing the system's natural frequencies beyond the frequency
of exciting forces, such as machine rotational speed. It is important to determine that guides added to control vibration
do not adversely restrict thermal expansion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9 Reporting and Records for Piping System Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.1 Permanent and Progressive Records<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping system owner/users shall maintain permanent and progressive records of their piping systems and pressure-
relieving devices. Permanent records will be maintained throughout the service life of each piping system. As a part of
these records, progressive inspection and maintenance records will be regularly updated to include new information
pertinent to the operation, inspection, and maintenance history of the piping system. See also API 574 for more
information of piping system records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

initials) of the person who performed the inspection and/or examination, the serial number or other identifier of the
equipment inspected, a description of the inspection and/or examination performed, and the results of the
inspection and/or examination. Piping RBI records should be in accordance with API 580.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

mechanical integrity, changes in service, mechanical damage from maintenance should also be available to the
inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.4 Computer Records<<HEADING_END>>

useful for the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) storing and analyzing the actual thickness readings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) calculating short and long-term corrosion rates, retirement dates, MAWP, and re-inspection intervals;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.6 Inspection Isometric Drawings (ISOs)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The primary purpose of inspection ISOs is to identify the location of CMLs and to identify the location of any
recommended maintenance. Inspection ISOs are recommended and should contain the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection ISOs are recommended for all unit piping and all Class 1 (or high consequence RBI) pipe rack piping on
which CMLs have been identified for thickness measurement. Alternate methods for pipe rack piping which
adequately describes the system without ISOs may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection ISOs are recommended for Class 2 (or appropriate RBI consequence) rack piping with CMLs, except that
grid type drawings may be used if all other details are shown. The use of local details or local isometrics is acceptable
to show the location of CMLs on grid drawings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.11 Inspection Records for External Inspections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Results of external piping system inspections shall be documented. A combination of checklist and narrative record
keeping is recommended when documenting inspection results. Checklists should serve the purpose of reminding
record keepers of all the issues important to be included in piping inspection records; but narratives serve the purpose
better than checklists for thoroughly documenting inspections results. The location of CUI inspections, either by
insulation removal or NDE, should be identified. The location may be identified by establishing a CML on the
appropriate inspection ISO or with marked-up construction ISOs and narrative reports.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.12 Piping Failure and Leak Reports<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leaks and failures in piping that occur as a result of corrosion, cracking or mechanical damage shall be recorded and
reported to the owner/user. As with other piping failures, leaks and failures in piping systems shall be investigated to
identify and correct the cause of failure. See API 585 for more information on how to investigate piping failures.
Temporary repairs to piping systems shall be documented in the inspection records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.13 Inspection Deferral or Interval Revision<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection tasks for piping circuits and pressure relieving devices that cannot be performed by their due date can be
risk assessed and deferred for a specific period of time, where appropriate. A deferral procedure shall be in place that
defines a risk-based deferral process, including a corrective action plan and deferral date, plus necessary approvals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For equipment with RBI intervals/due dates, the existing risk assessment should be updated to determine if the
change in risk is acceptable by not doing the originally planned inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If inspection of a piping circuit is to be deferred beyond the established interval. that procedure should include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) concurrence with the appropriate piping personnel including the inspector and appropriate owner/user
management representative;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) any required operating controls needed to make the extended run;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) need for appropriate nonintrusive inspection with NDE, if any, as needed to justify the temporary extension; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) proper documentation of the deferral in the piping or PRD records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Notwithstanding the above, an inspection or pressure relieving device servicing interval may be deferred by the
inspector, without other approvals, based on a satisfactory review of the equipment history and appropriate risk
analysis, when the period of time for which the item is to be deferred does not exceed 10 % of the inspection/servicing
interval or six months, whichever is less.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Deferrals need to be completed and documented before the equipment is operated past the scheduled inspection
due date and owner/user management apprised of the increased risk (if any) of temporarily operating past the
scheduled inspection due date. Piping operated beyond the inspection due date without a documented and approved
deferral is not permitted by this Code. The deferral of scheduled inspections should be the occasional exception not a
frequent occurrence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   If there are potentially any unusual types of degradation involved in the inspection of the piping systems, the inspector is
advised to seek the guidance of the piping engineer or corrosion specialist before interval changes are approved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 Repairs, Alterations, and Rerating of Piping Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Repairs and Alterations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The principles of ASME B31.3 or the code to which the piping system was built shall be followed to the extent
practical for in-service repairs. ASME B31.3 is written for design and construction of piping systems. However, most
of the technical requirements on design, welding, examination, and materials also can be applied in the inspection, re-
rating, repair, and alteration of operating piping systems. When ASME B31.3 cannot be followed because of its new
construction coverage (such as revised or new material specifications, inspection requirements, certain heat
treatments, and pressure tests), the piping engineer or inspector shall be guided by API 570 in lieu of strict conformity
to ASME B31.3. As an example of intent, the phrase “principles of ASME B31.3” has been employed in API 570,
rather than “in accordance with ASME B31.3.”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The principles and practices of API 577 shall also be followed for all welded repairs and modifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.2 Authorization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All repair and alteration work shall be done by a repair organization as defined in Section 3 and shall be authorized by
the inspector prior to its commencement. Authorization for alteration work to a piping system may not be given without
prior consultation with, and approval by, the piping engineer. The inspector will designate any inspection hold points
required during the repair or alteration sequence. The inspector may give prior general authorization for limited or
routine repairs and procedures, provided the inspector is satisfied with the competency of the repair organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.3 Approval<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All proposed methods of design, execution, materials, welding procedures, examination, and testing shall be
approved by the inspector or by the piping engineer, as appropriate. Owner/user approval of on-stream welding is
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding repairs of cracks that occurred in-service should not be attempted without prior consultation with the piping
engineer in order to identify and correct the cause of the cracking. Examples are cracks suspected of being caused
by vibration, thermal cycling, thermal expansion problems, and environmental cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspector shall approve all repair and alteration work at designated hold points and after the repairs and
alterations have been satisfactorily completed in accordance with the requirements of API 570.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.4 Welding Repairs (Including On-stream)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.4.1 Temporary Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For temporary repairs, including on-stream, a full encirclement welded split sleeve or box-type enclosure designed by
the piping engineer may be applied over the damaged or corroded area. See various articles in ASME PCC-2 for
more information on repairs to piping systems. Longitudinal cracks shall not be repaired in this manner unless the
piping engineer has determined that cracks would not be expected to propagate from under the sleeve. In some
cases, the piping engineer will need to consult with a fracture analyst. The design of temporary enclosures and
repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the repair area is localized (for example, pitting or pinholes) and the SMYS of the pipe is not more than 40,000 psi
(275,800 kPa), and a Fitness-for-Service analysis shows it is acceptable, a temporary repair may be made by fillet
welding a properly designed split coupling or plate patch over the pitted or locally thinned area (see 8.1.4 for design
considerations and Annex C for an example). The material for the repair shall match the base metal unless approved
by the piping engineer. A fillet-welded patch shall not be installed on top of an existing fillet-welded patch. When
installing a fillet-welded patch adjacent to an existing fillet-welded patch, the minimum distance between the toe of the
fillet weld shall not be less than:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(3)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d
4  Rt
=<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d
is the minimum distance between the toes of fillet welds of adjacent fillet weld attachments, in inches
(millimeters);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>R
is the inside radius in inches (millimeters);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t
is the minimum required thickness of the fillet-welded patch in inches (millimeters).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For minor leaks and thinning below  T min , properly designed enclosures may be welded over the leak or thin piping
while the piping system is in-service, provided the inspector is satisfied that adequate thickness remains in the actual
location of the proposed weld and HAZ, and the piping component can withstand welding without the likelihood of
further material damage, such as from caustic service. Any leak in a Class 1 service or where a risk ranking is
determined to be high, shall be first reviewed by a piping engineer to determine if the work can be safely performed
while the system remains on stream.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temporary repairs should be removed and replaced with a suitable permanent repair at the next available
maintenance opportunity. Temporary repairs may remain in place for a longer period of time only if approved and
documented by the piping engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

63<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.4.2 Permanent Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repairs to defects found in piping components may be made by preparing a welding groove that completely removes
the defect and then filling the groove with weld metal deposited in accordance with 8.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corroded areas may be restored with weld metal deposited in accordance with 8.2. Surface irregularities and
contamination shall be removed before welding. Appropriate NDE methods shall be applied after completion of the
weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If it is feasible to take the piping system out of service, the defective area may be removed by cutting out a cylindrical
section and replacing it with a piping component that meets the applicable code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Insert patches (flush patches) may be used to repair damaged or corroded areas if the following requirements are
met:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) full-penetration groove welds are provided;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) for Class 1 and Class 2 piping systems, the welds shall be 100 % radiographed or ultrasonically tested using NDE
procedures that are approved by the inspector;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) patches may be any shape but shall have rounded corners [1 in. (25 mm) minimum radius].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>See ASME PCC-2 Part 2 for more information on various welded repairs to piping systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.5 Nonwelding Repairs (On-stream)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temporary repairs of locally thinned sections or circumferential linear defects may be made on-stream by installing a
properly designed and applied enclosure (e.g. bolted clamp, nonmetallic composite wrap, metallic and epoxy wraps,
or other non-welded applied temporary repair). The design shall include control of axial thrust loads if the piping
component being enclosed is (or may become) insufficient to control pressure thrust. The effect of enclosing
(crushing) forces on the component also shall be considered. See ASME PCC-2 Part 4 for more information on
nonmetallic composite wrap repair methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During turnarounds or other appropriate opportunities, temporary leak sealing and leak dissipating devices, (e.g., wire
wrapping, mechanical clamps, etc) including temporary repairs on valves, shall be removed and appropriate actions
taken to restore the original integrity of the piping system. The inspector and/or piping engineer shall be involved in
determining repair methods and procedures. Temporary leak sealing and leak dissipating devices may remain in
place for a longer period of time only if approved and documented by the piping engineer. From a mechanical integrity
perspective, injection fittings on valves to seal fugitive (LDAR) emissions from valve stem seal are not considered to
be temporary repairs. Their removal or valve replacement is at the discretion of the owner operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Procedures that include leak sealing fluids (“pumping”) for process piping should be reviewed for acceptance by the
inspector or piping engineer. The review should take into consideration the compatibility of the sealant with the
leaking material; the pumping pressure on the clamp (especially when re-pumping) and any resulting crushing forces;
and; the risk of sealant affecting downstream flow meters, pressure relieving devices, or machinery; the risk of
subsequent leakage at bolt threads causing corrosion or stress corrosion cracking of bolts; and the number of times
the seal area is repumped.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.3.2 Preheating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Preheat temperatures used in making welding repairs shall be in accordance with the applicable code and qualified
welding procedure. Exceptions for temporary repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Preheating alone may not be considered as an alternative to environmental cracking prevention.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping systems constructed of steels initially requiring PWHT normally are postweld heat treated if alterations or
repairs involving pressure retaining welding are performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.3.3 PWHT<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>PWHT of piping system repairs or alterations should be made using the applicable requirements of ASME B31.3 or
the code to which the piping was built. See 8.2.4 for an alternative preheat procedure for some PWHT requirements.
Exceptions for temporary repairs shall be approved by the piping engineer and be in accordance with ASME PCC-2,
Article 2.9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Local PWHT may be substituted for 360° banding on local repairs on all materials, provided the following precautions
and requirements are applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The application is reviewed, and a procedure is developed by the piping engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) In evaluating the suitability of a procedure, consideration shall be given to applicable factors, such as base metal
thickness, thermal gradients, material properties, changes resulting from PWHT, the need for full-penetration
welds, and surface and volumetric examinations after PWHT. Additionally, the overall and local strains and
distortions resulting from the heating of a local restrained area of the piping wall shall be considered in developing
and evaluating PWHT procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) A preheat of 300 °F (150 °C), or higher as specified by specific welding procedures, is maintained while welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The required PWHT temperature shall be maintained for a distance of not less than two times the base metal
thickness measured from the weld. The PWHT temperature shall be monitored by a suitable number of
thermocouples (a minimum of two) based on the size and shape of the area being heat treated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Controlled heat also shall be applied to any branch connection or other attachment within the PWHT area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The PWHT is performed for code compliance and not for environmental cracking resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.4 Preheat or Controlled Deposition Welding Methods as Alternatives to Postweld Heat Treatment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some instances, full PWHT may have potential adverse effects on equipment and piping. Nevertheless, the piping
may have been originally PWHT’d or may require PWHT according to the original construction code. In these cases,
preheat and controlled deposition welding may be used in lieu of PWHT, as described in 8.2.4.2 and 8.2.4.3.
However, prior to using alternative methods, a piping engineer shall assure the alternative is suitable based on a
metallurgical review. The review shall consider factors such as the reason for the original PWHT, susceptibility to
stress corrosion cracking, stresses in the location of the weld, susceptibility to high temperature hydrogen attack,
susceptibility to creep, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The welding method shall be selected based on the rules according to the applicable code/standard. As well, the
adequacy of the as-welded joint at operating and pressure test conditions should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When reference is made in this section to materials by the ASME designations, P-Numbers and Group Numbers, the
requirements of this section apply to the applicable materials of the original code of construction, either ASME or
other, which conform by chemical composition and mechanical properties to the ASME P-number and group number
designations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pressure boundary process piping alterations or repair welds that initially required PWHT shall be postweld heat
treated, with the exceptions listed in 8.2.4.2 and 8.2.4.3. If valid for the current rated design, the original joint efficiency
factor may be used when alternative post weld heat treatments are practiced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.4.2 Preheating Method (Notch Toughness Testing Not Required)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preheating method, when performed in lieu of PWHT, is limited to the following materials and weld processes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The materials shall be limited to P-No. 1, Group 1, 2, and 3, and to P-No. 3, Group 1 and 2 (excluding Mn-Mo
steels in Group 2)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The welding shall be limited to the shielded-metal-arc welding (SMAW), gas-metal-arc welding (GMAW), gas-
tungsten-arc (GTAW), and flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The welders and welding procedures shall be qualified in accordance with the applicable rules of the original code of
construction, except that the PWHT of the test coupon used to qualify the procedure shall be omitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The weld area shall be preheated and maintained at a minimum temperature of 300°F (150°C) during welding. The
300 °F (150 °C) temperature should be checked to assure that 4 in. (100 mm) of the material or four times the
material thickness (whichever is greater) on each side of the groove is maintained at the minimum temperature during
welding. The maximum interpass temperature shall not exceed 600 °F (315 °C). When the weld does not penetrate
through the full thickness of the material, the minimum preheat and maximum interpass temperatures need only be
maintained at a distance of 4 in. (100 mm) or four times the depth of the repair weld, whichever is greater on each
side of the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_72>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>66
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of the preheat alternative requires consultation with the piping engineer who should consider the potential for
environmental cracking and whether the welding procedure will provide adequate toughness. Examples of situations
where this alternative could be considered include seal welds, weld metal buildup of thin areas, and welding support
clips.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Notch toughness testing is not required when using this preheat method in lieu of PWHT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.4.3 Controlled-deposition Welding Method (Notch Toughness Testing Required)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The controlled-deposition welding method may be used in lieu of PWHT in accordance with the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Notch toughness testing, such as that established by ASME B31.1, Chapter III Section 323, is necessary when
impact tests are required by the original code of construction or the construction code applicable to the work
planned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The materials shall be limited to P-No. 1, P-No. 3, and P-No. 4 steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The welding shall be limited to the shielded-metal-arc welding (SMAW), gas-metal-arc welding (GMAW), flux-
cored arc welding (FCAW), and gas–tungsten arc welding (GTAW) processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) A weld procedure specification shall be developed and qualified for each application. The welding procedure shall
define the preheat temperature and interpass temperature and include the post-heating temperature requirement
in f(8). The qualification thickness for the test plates and repair grooves shall be in accordance with Table 3.The
test material for the welding procedure qualification shall be of the same material specification (including
specification type, grade, class and condition of heat treatment) as the original material specification for the repair.
If the original material specification is obsolete, the test material used should conform as much as possible to the
material used for construction, but in no case shall the material be lower in strength or have a carbon content of
more than 0.35 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) When impact tests are required by the construction code applicable to the work planned, the PQR shall include
sufficient tests to determine if the toughness of the weld metal and the heat-affected zone of the base metal in the
as-welded condition is adequate at the minimum design metal temperature (such as the criteria used in ASME
B31.3). If special hardness limits are necessary (for example, as set forth in NACE RP 0472 and MR 0103) for
corrosion resistance, the PQR shall include hardness tests as well.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
The WPS shall include the following additional requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) The supplementary essential variables of ASME Code, Section IX, Paragraph QW-250, shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) The maximum weld heat input for each layer shall not exceed that used in the procedure qualification test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) The minimum preheat temperature for welding shall not be less than that used in the procedure qualification
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) The maximum interpass temperature for welding shall not be greater than that used in the procedure
qualification test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5) The preheat temperature shall be checked to assure that 4 in. (100 mm) of the material or four times the
material thickness (whichever is greater) on each side of the weld joint will be maintained at the minimum
temperature during welding. When the weld does not penetrate through the full thickness of the material, the
minimum preheat temperature need only be maintained at a distance of 4 in. (100 mm) or four times the depth
of the repair weld, whichever is greater on each side of the joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6) For the allowed welding processes in Item c, use only electrodes and filler metals that are classified by the filler
metal specification with an optional supplemental diffusible-hydrogen designator of H8 or lower. When shielding
gases are used with a process, the gas shall exhibit a dew point that is not higher than –60 °F (–50 °C).
Surfaces on which welding will be done shall be maintained in a dry condition during welding and free of rust,
mill scale and hydrogen producing contaminants such as oil, grease and other organic materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7) The welding technique shall be a controlled-deposition, temper-bead or half-bead technique. The specific
technique shall be used in the procedure qualification test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8) For welds made by SMAW, once filling is completed do not allow the weldment to cool below the minimum
preheat temperature. As well, raise the weldment temperature to 500 °F ± 50 °F (260 °C ± 30 °C) for a minimum
period of two hours. This assists out-gassing diffusion of any weld metal hydrogen picked up during welding.
This hydrogen bake-out may be omitted when H4 filler metal (such as E7018-H4) is specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9) After the finished repair weld has cooled to ambient temperature, the final temper bead reinforcement layer
shall be removed substantially flush with the surface of the base material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

design temperature, consideration shall be given to process fluid temperatures, ambient temperatures, heating and
cooling media temperatures, and insulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.6 Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The materials used in making repairs or alterations shall be of known weldable quality, shall conform to the applicable
code, and shall be compatible with the original material. For material verification requirements, see 5.12.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.7 NDE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acceptance of a welded repair or alteration shall include NDE in accordance with the applicable code and the owner/
user's specification, unless otherwise specified in API 570. The principles and practices of API 577 shall also be
followed. When surface and volumetric examinations are required, they shall be in accordance with ASME  BPVC
Section V (or equivalent).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.8 Pressure Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After welding is completed, a pressure test in accordance with 5.8 shall be performed if practical and deemed
necessary by the inspector. Pressure tests are normally required after alterations and major repairs. See ASME
PCC-2, Article 5.1 for more information on conducting pressure tests. When a pressure test is not necessary or
practical, NDE shall be utilized in lieu of a pressure test. Substituting appropriate NDE procedures for a pressure test
after an alteration, re-rating, or repair may be done only after consultation with the inspector and the piping engineer.
For existing insulated lines that are being pressure tested after repairs, re-rating, or alterations, it is not necessary to
strip insulation on all existing welds. Pressure tests with longer hold times and observations of pressure gauges can
be substituted for insulation stripping when the risks associated with leak under the insulation are acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When it is not practical to perform a pressure test of a final closure weld that joins a new or replacement section of
piping to an existing system, all of the following requirements shall be satisfied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The new or replacement piping section is pressure tested and examined in accordance with the applicable code
governing the design of the piping system, or if not practical, welds are examined with appropriate NDE, as
specified by the authorized piping inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The closure weld is a weld between any pipe or standard piping component of equal diameter and thickness,
axially aligned (not miter cut), and of equivalent materials. Where slip-on flanges or socket weld fittings are
permitted by the specification for the piping system, they may be used within the limitations of that specification.
Acceptable alternatives are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) slip-on flanges for design cases up to Class 150 and 500 °F (260 °C); and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) socket-welded fittings for sizes NPS 2 or less and design cases up to 500 °F (260 °C). A spacer designed for
socket welding or some other means shall be used to establish a minimum  1 / 16  in. (1.6 mm) gap. Socket welds
shall be per ASME B31.3 and shall be a minimum of two passes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Any final closure butt weld shall be of 100 % RT; or angle beam ultrasonic flaw detection may be used, provided
the appropriate acceptance criteria have been established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Re-rating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Re-rating piping systems by changing the temperature rating or the MAWP may be done only after all of the following
requirements have been met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Calculations are performed by the piping engineer or the inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) All re-ratings shall be established in accordance with the requirements of the code to which the piping system was
built or by computation using the appropriate methods in the latest edition of the applicable code or other industry
standards approved by a SDO (e.g. API 579-1/ASME FFS-1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Current inspection records verify that the piping system is satisfactory for the proposed service conditions and that
the appropriate corrosion allowance is provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Re-rated piping systems shall be leak tested in accordance with the code to which the piping system was built or
the latest edition of the applicable code for the new service conditions, unless one of the following is true.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Documented records indicate a previous leak test was performed at greater than or equal to the test pressure
for the new condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) The re-rate is an increase in the rating temperature that does not affect allowable tensile stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) The piping integrity is confirmed by appropriate nondestructive inspection techniques in lieu of testing after
consultation with the inspector and piping engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) The piping system is checked to affirm that the required pressure relieving devices are present, are set at the
appropriate pressure, and have the appropriate capacity at set pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9 Inspection of Buried Piping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of buried process piping (not regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation) is different from other
process piping inspection because significant external deterioration can be caused by corrosive soil conditions and
the inspection can be hindered by the inaccessibility of the affected areas of the piping. Important, non-mandatory
references for underground piping inspection are API 574 and the following NACE documents: SP0102, SP0169,
SP0274, and RP0502; and API 651.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_76>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>70
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Buried piping shall be inspected to determine its external surface condition. The inspection plans shall be based on
an assessment of the effectiveness of the CP system (if any exists), whether the pipe was coated and on inspection
information obtained from one or more of the following methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) during maintenance activity on connecting piping of similar material;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) from representative portions of the actual piping;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) from buried piping in similar circumstances;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) from permanently installed thickness monitoring devices;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) from inspections conducted with remote visual equipment, if possible; or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
from the results of cathodic protection surveys, or from guided wave examination used to locate areas of interest
for follow-up inspection using more quantitative thickness measurement techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2 Above-grade Visual Surveillance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indications of leaks in buried piping may include a change in the surface contour of the ground, discoloration of the
soil, softening of paving asphalt, pool formation, bubbling water puddles, or noticeable odor. Surveying the route of
buried piping is one method of identifying problem areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3 Close-interval Potential Survey<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The close-interval potential survey performed at ground level over the buried pipe can be used to locate areas where
the cathodic protection systems may not be effective and active corrosion on the pipe's surface is present or may
occur. However, it may not be a reliable method for corrosion wall loss inspection, since it can only infer wall loss from
CP potential but not directly detect presence of wall loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion cells can form on both bare and coated pipe where the bare steel contacts the soil. Since the potential at
the area of corrosion will be measurably different from an adjacent area on the pipe, the location of possible corrosion
activity can be determined by this survey technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4 Pipe Coating Holiday Survey<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The pipe coating holiday survey [e.g. direct current voltage gradient (DCVG)] can be used to locate coating defects on
buried coated pipes, and it can be used on newly constructed pipe systems to ensure that the coating is intact and
holiday-free. More often it is used to evaluate coating serviceability for buried piping that has been in-service for an
extended period of time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>From survey data, the coating effectiveness and rate of coating deterioration can be determined. This information is
used both for predicting corrosion activity in a specific area and for forecasting replacement of the coating for
corrosion control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5 Soil Resistivity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion of bare or poorly coated piping is often caused by a mixture of different soils in contact with the pipe
surface. The corrosiveness of the soils can be determined by a measurement of the soil resistivity. Lower levels of
resistivity are relatively more corrosive than higher levels, especially in areas where the pipe is exposed to significant
changes in soil resistivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_77>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P IPING  I NSPECTION  C ODE : I N - SERVICE  I NSPECTION , R ATING , R EPAIR ,  AND  A LTERATION   OF  P IPING  S YSTEMS
71<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements of soil resistivity should be performed using the Wenner Four-Pin Method in accordance with ASTM
G57. In cases of parallel pipes or in areas of intersecting pipelines, it may be necessary to use the Single-Pin Method
to accurately measure the soil resistivity. For measuring resistivity of soil samples from auger holes or excavations, a
soil box serves as a convenient means for obtaining accurate results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The depth of the piping shall be considered in selecting the method to be used and the location of samples. The
testing and evaluation of results should be performed by personnel trained and experienced in soil resistivity testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6 Cathodic Protection Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cathodically protected buried process piping shall be monitored regularly to assure adequate levels of protection.
Monitoring shall include periodic measurement and analysis of pipe-to-soil potentials by personnel trained and
experienced in cathodic protection system operation. More frequent monitoring of critical cathodic protection
components, such as impressed current rectifiers, may be needed to ensure reliable system operation. Owner/users
should keep appropriate records of CP monitoring and maintenance performed as a result of CP system monitoring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Refer to NACE SP0169 and Section 11 of API 651 for guidance applicable to inspecting and maintaining cathodic
protection systems for buried piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7 Inspection Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A number of direct examination techniques methods are available that may be applied to buried piping and a more
extensive guide to these can be found in API RP 574. Some methods can indicate the external or wall condition of the
piping, whereas other methods indicate only the internal condition. Additionally some methods are able to
simultaneously detect and quantify both wall loss and deformation damage such as denting, ovality, bulging, swelling,
etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An array of technologies are now available that can be externally applied to buried piping at a location and screen
select areas from that position. These techniques may require some excavation but considerable less than a full
access described earlier. An example of these techniques is guided wave examination, previously known as long
range ultrasonics (LRUT) or guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT). These technologies may allow 15 ft or longer
distances to be screened from one installation and provide a screening assessment of the pipe. Distance travelled
and the degree of detection/accuracy is a function of the applied technology and pipe conditions including degree of
corrosions, external and internal coatings and soil conditions, transported product and type and number of
accessories in the path of the signal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other technologies employing ultrasound may be used to screen several feet from one location and are useful for
assessing damage in locations such as soil-to-air interfaces. Reference API 574 for examples of other technologies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8 Frequency and Extent of Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.1 Above-grade Visual Surveillance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user should, at approximately six month intervals survey the surface conditions on and adjacent to each
buried piping path (see 9.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.2 Pipe-to-soil Potential Survey<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A close-interval potential survey on a cathodically protected line may be used to verify that the buried piping has a
protective potential throughout its length. For poorly coated pipes where cathodic protection potentials are
inconsistent, the survey may be conducted at three- to five-year intervals for verification of continuous corrosion
control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_78>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>72
API 570<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For piping with no cathodic protection or in areas where leaks have occurred due to external corrosion, a pipe-to-soil
potential survey may be conducted along the pipe route. The pipe should be excavated for inspection or inspected
with appropriate NDE at sites where possibilities of active corrosion cells have been located to determine the extent of
corrosion damage. A continuous potential profile or a close-interval survey may be required to better locate active
corrosion cells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.3 Pipe Coating Holiday Survey<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency of pipe coating holiday surveys is usually based on indications that other forms of corrosion control are
ineffective. For example, on a coated pipe where there is gradual loss of cathodic protection potentials or an external
corrosion leak occurs at a coating defect, a pipe coating holiday survey may be used to evaluate the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.4 Soil Corrosivity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For piping buried in lengths greater than 100 ft (30 m) and not cathodically protected, evaluations of soil corrosivity
should be performed at appropriate intervals based on likelihood of change. Soil resistivity measurements may be
used for relative classification of the soil corrosivity (see 9.5). Additional factors that may warrant consideration are
changes in soil chemistry and analyses of the polarization resistance of the soil and piping interface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.5 External and Internal Inspection Intervals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If internal corrosion of buried piping is expected as a result of inspection on the above-grade portion of the line,
inspection intervals and methods for the buried portion should be adjusted accordingly. The inspector should be
aware of and consider the possibility of accelerated internal corrosion in deadlegs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The external condition of buried piping that is not cathodically protected should be determined by either pigging,
which can measure wall thickness, or by excavating according to the frequency given in Table 4. Significant external
corrosion detected by pigging or by other means may require excavation and evaluation even if the piping is
cathodically protected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Piping inspected periodically by excavation shall be inspected in lengths of 6 ft to 8 ft (2.0 m to 2.5 m) at one or more
locations judged to be most susceptible to corrosion. Excavated piping should be inspected full circumference for the
type and extent of corrosion (pitting or general) and the condition of the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If inspection reveals damaged coating or corroded piping, additional piping shall be excavated until the extent of the
condition is identified. If the average wall thickness is at or below the minimum required thickness, it shall be repaired
or replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the piping is contained inside a casing pipe, the condition of the casing should be inspected to determine if water
and/or soil has entered the casing. The inspector should verify the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) both ends of the casing extend beyond the soil surface,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the ends of the casing are sealed if the casing is not self-draining,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the pressure-carrying pipe is properly coated and wrapped, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) there is no metallic or electrolytic contact between the casing and the pressure carrying pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.6 Leak Testing Intervals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An alternative or supplement to inspection is leak testing with liquid at a pressure at least 10 % greater than maximum
operating pressure at intervals one-half the length of those shown in Table 4 for piping not cathodically protected and
at the same intervals as shown in Table 4 for cathodically protected piping. The leak test should be maintained for a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

73<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>period of eight (8) hours. Four hours after the initial pressurization of the piping system, the pressure should be noted
and, if necessary, the line repressurized to original test pressure and isolated from the pressure source. If, during the
remainder of the test period, the pressure decreases more than 5 %, the piping should be visually inspected
externally and/or inspected internally to find the leak and assess the extent of corrosion. Sonic measurements may be
helpful in locating leaks during leak testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Buried piping also may be surveyed for integrity by using temperature-corrected volumetric or pressure test methods.
Other alternative leak test methods involve acoustic emission examination and the addition of a tracer fluid to the
pressurized line (such as helium or sulfur hexafloride). If the tracer is added to the service fluid, the owner/user shall
confirm suitability for process and product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.1 Repairs to Coatings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any coating removed for inspection shall be renewed and inspected appropriately. For coating repairs, the inspector
should be assured that the coating meets the following criteria:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) it has sufficient adhesion to the pipe to prevent under-film migration of moisture,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) it is sufficiently ductile to resist cracking,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) it is free of voids and gaps in the coating (holidays),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) it has sufficient strength to resist damage due to handling and soil stress,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) it can support any supplemental cathodic protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition, coating repairs may be tested using a high voltage holiday detector. The detector voltage shall be
adjusted to the appropriate value for the coating material and thickness. Any holidays found shall be repaired and
retested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.2 Clamp Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, bolted clamps should be avoided for temporary repairs to all buried piping. If piping leaks are clamped and
reburied, the location of the clamp shall be logged in the inspection record and may be surface marked. Both the
marker and the record shall note the date of installation and the location of the clamp. All clamps shall be considered
temporary. Temporary repairs on buried piping should be permanently repaired at the next maintenance opportunity
unless approved for extension by a piping engineer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Requests for Interpretations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API will consider written requests for interpretations of API 570. API staff will make such interpretations in writing after
consultation, if necessary, with the appropriate committee officers and the committee membership. The API
committee responsible for maintaining API 570 meets regularly to consider written requests for interpretations and
revisions, and to develop new criteria as dictated by technological development. The committee's activities in this
regard are limited strictly to interpretations of the latest edition of API 570 or to the consideration of revisions to
API 570 based on the new data or technology.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a matter of policy, API does not approve, certify, rate, or endorse any item, construction, proprietary device, or
activity; and accordingly, inquiries requiring such consideration will be returned. Moreover, API does not act as a
consultant on specific engineering problems or on the general understanding or application of the rules. If, based on
the inquiry information submitted, it is the opinion of the committee that the inquirer should seek engineering or
technical assistance, the inquiry will be returned with the recommendation that such assistance be obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>ASME PCC-2, Repair of Pressure Equipment and Piping provides guidance on various types of repairs, such as: butt
welded insert plates, external weld overlay to repair internal thinning, Full Encirclement Steel Reinforcing Sleeves for
Piping, Weld Buildup, Weld Overlay, and Clad Restoration or Fillet Welded Patches<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Manual welding utilizing the gas metal-arc or shielded metal-arc processes may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the temperature is below 50 °F (10 °C), low-hydrogen electrodes, AWS E-XX16 or E-XX18, shall be used when
welding materials conforming to ASTM A-53, Grades A and B; A-106, Grades A and B; A-333; A-334; API 5L; and
other similar material. These electrodes should also be used on lower grades of material when the temperature of the
material is below 32 °F (0 °C). The piping engineer should be consulted for cases involving different materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When AWS E-XX16 or E-XX18 electrodes are used on weld numbers 2 and 3 (see Figure C.1 below), the beads shall
be deposited by starting at the bottom of the assembly and welding upward. The diameter of these electrodes should
not exceed  5 / 32  in. (4.0 mm). Electrodes larger that  5 / 32  in. (4.0 mm) may be used on weld number 1 (see Figure C.1),
but the diameter should not exceed  3 / 16  in. (4.8 mm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The longitudinal welds (number 1, Figure C.1) on the reinforcing sleeve shall be fitted with a suitable tape or mild steel
backing strip (see note) to avoid fusing the weld to the side wall of the pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   If the original pipe along weld number 1 has been checked thoroughly by ultrasonic methods and it is of sufficient
thickness for welding, a backing strip is not necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All repair and welding procedures for on-stream lines shall conform to API 2201.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The diameter of electrodes should not exceed  5 / 32  in. (4.0 mm). When the temperature of the base material is below
32 °F (0 °C), low-hydrogen electrodes shall be used. Weaving of weld beads deposited with low-hydrogen electrodes
should be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All repair and welding procedures for on-stream lines shall conform to API 2201.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of small repair patches are shown below in Figure C.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Size of the patch should not exceed  / 2  the pipe diameter.
A full encirclement sleeve should be used if the corroded
area exceeds the    / 2  diameter.
