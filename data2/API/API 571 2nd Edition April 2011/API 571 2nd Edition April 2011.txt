<<PARAGRAPH>>Damage Mechanisms Affecting Fixed Equipment in the Refining Industry

_____________________________________________________________________________________________<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1
Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ASME and API design codes and standards for pressurized equipment provide rules for the design,
fabrication, inspection, and testing of new pressure vessels, piping systems, and storage tanks.  These
codes do not address equipment deterioration while in service and that deficiencies due to degradation or
from original fabrication may be found during subsequent inspections.  Fitness-For-Service (FFS)
assessments are quantitative engineering evaluations that are performed to demonstrate the structural
integrity of an in-service component containing a flaw or damage.  The first step in a fitness-for-service
assessment performed in accordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1 is to identify the flaw type and the
cause of damage.  Proper identification of damage mechanisms for components containing flaws or other
forms of deterioration is also the first step in performing a Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) in accordance with
API RP 580.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When conducting an FFS assessment or RBI study, it is important to determine the cause(s) of the
damage or deterioration observed, or anticipated, and the likelihood and degree of further damage that
might occur in the future.  Flaws and damage that are discovered during an in-service inspection can be
the result of a pre-existing condition before the component entered service and/or could be service-
induced.  The root causes of deterioration could be due to inadequate design considerations including
materials selection and design details, or the interaction with aggressive environments/conditions that the
equipment is subjected to during normal service or during transient periods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One factor that complicates an FFS assessment or RBI study for refining and petrochemical equipment is
that material/environmental condition interactions are extremely varied. Refineries and chemical plants
contain many different processing units, each having its own combination of aggressive process streams
and temperature/pressure conditions.  In general, the following types of damage are encountered in
petrochemical equipment:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Each of these general types of damage may be caused by a single or multiple damage mechanisms.  In
addition, each of the damage mechanisms occurs under very specific combinations of materials, process
environments, and operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This recommended practice provides general guidance as to the most likely damage mechanisms
affecting common alloys used in the refining and petrochemical industry and is intended to introduce the
concepts of service-induced deterioration and failure modes.  These guidelines provide information that
can be utilized by plant inspection personnel to assist in identifying likely causes of damage; to assist with
the development of inspection strategies; to help identify monitoring programs to ensure equipment
integrity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The summary provided for each damage mechanism provides the fundamental information required for
an FFS assessment performed in accordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1 or an RBI study performed in
accordance with API RP 580.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The damage mechanisms in this recommended practice cover situations encountered in the refining and
petrochemical industry in pressure vessels, piping, and tankage.  The damage mechanism descriptions
are not intended to provide a definitive guideline for every possible situation that may be encountered,
and the reader may need to consult with an engineer familiar with applicable degradation modes and
failure mechanisms, particularly those that apply in special cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Carbon steel  –  steels that do not have alloying elements intentionally added.  However, there
may be small amounts of elements permitted by specifications such as SA516 and SA106, for example
that can affect corrosion resistance, hardness after welding, and toughness.  Elements which may be
found in small quantities include Cr, Ni, Mo, Cu, S, Si, P, Al, V and B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.4
Diethanolamine (DEA)  – used in amine treating to remove H2S and CO2 from hydrocarbon
streams.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.5
Duplex stainless steel  –  a family of stainless steels that contain a mixed austenitic-ferritic
structure including Alloy 2205, 2304, and 2507.  The welds of 300 series stainless steels may also exhibit
a duplex structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.6
Ferritic  –  a term that refers to a type of metallurgical structure (ferrite) normally found in carbon
and low alloy steels and many 400 series stainless steels.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.7
Ferritic stainless steels  –  include Types 405, 409, 430, 442, and 446.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.8
Heat Affected Zone (HAZ)  –  the portion of the base metal adjacent to a weld which has not
been melted, but the metallurgical microstructure and mechanical properties have been changed by the
heat of welding, sometimes with undesirable effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.9
High Strenth low Alloy Steels (HSLA)  - A family of low-carbon steels in which the strength
levels are achieved by the addition of moderate amounts of alloying elements such as titanium, vanadium
or niobium in amounts of less than 0.1 per cent.  They can be are more sensitive to cracking during
fabrication from hydrogen embrittlement (delayed cracking) or underbead cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.10 Hydrogen Induced Cracking (HIC)  –  describes stepwise internal cracks that connect adjacent
hydrogen blisters on different planes in the metal, or to the metal surface. No externally applied stress is
needed for the formation of HIC. The development of internal cracks (sometimes referred to as blister
cracks) tends to link with other cracks by a transgranular plastic shear mechanism because of internal
pressure resulting from the accumulation of hydrogen. The link-up of these cracks on different planes in
steels has been referred to as stepwise cracking to characterize the nature of the crack appearance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.11 Low alloy steel  –  a family of steels containing up to 9% chromium and other alloying additions
for high temperature strength and creep resistance.  The materials include C-0.5Mo, Mn-0.5Mo, 1Cr-
0.5Mo, 1.25 Cr-0.5Mo, 2.25Cr-1.0Mo, 5Cr-0.5Mo, and 9Cr-1Mo.  These are considered ferritic steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.12 Martensitic  –  a term that refers to a type of metallurgical structure (martensite) normally found in
some 400 series stainless steel.  Heat treatment and or welding followed by rapid cooling can produce
this structure in carbon and low alloy steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1.13 Martensitic stainless steel  –  include Types 410, 410S, 416, 420, 440A, 440B, and 440C.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.17 Stress oriented hydrogen induced cracking (SOHIC)  –  describes an array of cracks, aligned
nearly perpendicular to the stress, that are formed by the link-up of small HIC cracks in steel.  Tensile
strength (residual or applied) is required to produce SOHIC.  SOHIC is commonly observed in the base
metal adjacent to the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) of a weld, oriented in the through-thickness direction.
SOHIC may also be produced in susceptible steels at other high stress points, such as from the tip of the
mechanical cracks and defects, or from the interaction among HIC on different planes in the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1.18 Stainless steel  –  there are four categories of stainless steels that are characterized by their
metallurgical structure at room temperature:  austenitic, ferritic, martensitic and duplex.  These alloys
have varying amounts of chromium and other alloying elements that give them resistance to oxidation,
sulfidation and other forms of corrosion depending on the alloy content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

_____________________________________________________________________________________________<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Damage mechanisms that are common to a variety of industries including refining and petrochemical,
pulp and paper, and fossil utility are covered in this Section. The mechanisms are divided into the
following sections:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Mechanical and Metallurgical Failure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Uniform or Localized Loss of Thickness<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2
Mechanical and Metallurgical Failure Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1
Graphitization<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Graphitization is a change in the microstructure of certain carbon steels and 0.5Mo steels after long-
term operation in the 800°F to 1100°F (427°C to 593°C) range that may cause a loss in strength,
ductility, and/or creep resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
At elevated temperatures, the carbide phases in these steels are unstable and may decompose into
graphite nodules. This decomposition is known as graphitization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some grades of carbon steel and 0.5Mo steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The most important factors that affect graphitization are the chemistry, stress, temperature, and time
of exposure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In general, graphitization is not commonly observed.  Some steels are much more susceptible to
graphitization than others, but exactly what causes some steels to graphitize while others are
resistant is not well understood.  It was originally thought that silicon and aluminum content played a
major role but it has been shown that they have negligible influence on graphitization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Graphitization has been found in low alloy C-Mo steels with up to 1% Mo.  The addition of about
0.7% chromium has been found to eliminate graphitization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Temperature has an important effect on the rate of graphitization. Below 800°F (427°C), the rate is
extremely slow. The rate increases with increasing temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
There are two general types of graphitization.  First is random graphitization in which the graphite
nodules are distributed randomly throughout the steel. While this type of graphitization may lower the

<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
The second and more damaging type of graphitization results in chains or local planes of
concentrated graphite nodules.  This form of graphitization can result in a significant reduction in load
bearing capability while increasing the potential for brittle fracture along this plane.  The two forms of
this type of graphitization are weld heat-affected zone graphitization and non-weld graphitization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Weld heat-affected zone graphitization is most frequently found in the heat-affected zone
adjacent to welds in a narrow band, corresponding to the low temperature edge of the heat-
affected zone.  In multipass welded butt joints, these zones overlap each other, covering the
entire cross-section. Graphite nodules can form at the low temperature edge of these heat-
affected zones, resulting in a band of weak graphite extending across the section.  Because of
its appearance, this graphite formation within heat-affected zones is called eyebrow
graphitization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Non-weld graphitization is a form of localized graphitization that sometimes occurs along planes
of localized yielding in steel.  It also occurs in a chain-like manner in regions that have
experienced significant plastic deformation as a result of cold working operations or bending.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
The extent and degree of graphitization is usually reported in a qualitative fashion (none, slight,
moderate, severe).  Although it is difficult to predict the rate at which it forms, severe heat-affected
zone graphitization can develop in as little as five years at service temperatures above 1000°F
(538°C).  Very slight graphitization would be expected to be found after 30 to 40 years at 850°F
(454°C).  Time-Temperature-Transformation curves for heat-affected zone graphitization can be
found in Reference 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Primarily hot-wall piping and equipment in the FCC, catalytic reforming and coker units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Bainitic grades are less susceptible than coarse pearlitic grades.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Few failures directly attributable to graphitization have been reported in the refining industry.
However, graphitization has been found where failure resulted primarily from other causes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Several serious cases of graphitization have occurred in the reactors and piping of fluid catalytic
cracking units, as well as with carbon steel furnace tubes in a thermal cracking unit and the failure of
seal welds at the bottom tube sheet of a vertical waste heat boiler in a fluid catalytic cracker.  A
graphitization failure was reported in the long seam weld of a C-0.5Mo catalytic reformer
reactor/interheater line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Where concentrated eyebrow graphitization occurs along heat-affected zones, the creep rupture
strength may be drastically lowered.  Slight to moderate amounts of graphite along the heat-affected
zones do not appear to significantly lower room or high-temperature properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Graphitization seldom occurs on boiling surface tubing but did occur in low alloy C-0.5Mo tubes and
headers during the 1940’s.  Economizer tubing, steam piping and other equipment that operates in
the range of temperatures of 850°F to 1025°F (441°C to 552°C) is more likely to suffer graphitization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Damage due to graphitization is not visible or readily apparent and can only be observed by
metallographic examination ( Figure 4-1  and  Figure 4-2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Advanced stages of damage related to loss in creep strength may include microfissuring/microvoid
formation, subsurface cracking or surface connected cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Graphitization can be prevented by using chromium containing low alloy steels for long-term operation
above 800°F (427°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Softening (Spheroidization)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spheroidization is a change in the microstructure of steels after exposure in the 850°F to 1400°F (440°C
to 760°C) range, where the carbide phases in carbon steels are unstable and may agglomerate from their
normal plate-like form to a spheroidal form, or from small, finely dispersed carbides in low alloy steels like
1Cr-0.5Mo to large agglomerated carbides. Spheroidization may cause a loss in strength and/or creep
resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All commonly used grades of carbon steel and low alloy steels including C-0.5Mo, 1Cr-0.5Mo,1.25Cr-
0.5Mo, 2.25Cr-1Mo, 3Cr-1Mo, 5Cr-0.5Mo, and 9Cr-1Mo steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Metal chemistry, microstructure, exposure time, and temperature are critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The rate of spheroidization depends on the temperature and initial microstructure. Spheroidization
can occur in a few hours at 1300°F (552°C), but may take several years at 850°F (454°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Annealed steels are more resistant to spheroidization than normalized steels.  Coarse-grained steels
are more resistant than fine-grained. Fine grained silicon-killed steels are more resistant than
aluminum-killed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Spheroidization can occur in piping and equipment after exposure to temperatures above 850°F
(454°C).  The loss in strength may be as high as about 30% but failure is not likely to occur except
under very high applied stresses, in areas of stress concentration, or in combination with other
damage mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The loss in strength is usually accompanied by an increase in ductility which allows for deformation
at stress concentrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Spheroidization affects hot wall piping and equipment in the FCC, catalytic reforming and coker
units.  Fired heater tubes in boilers or process units may be affected by a loss in creep strength, but
equipment, in general, is seldom renewed or repaired because of spheroidization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Spheroidization is not visible or readily apparent and can only be observed through metallography.
The pearlitic phase undergoes a time dependant transformation from partial to complete
spheroidization ( Figure 4–3  and  Figure 4–4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In the case of the 5% to 9% CrMo alloys, spheroidization is the process of transforming the carbides
from their original finely dispersed morphology to large agglomerated carbides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spheroidization is difficult to prevent except by minimizing long-term exposure to elevated temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spheroidization can only be found through field metallography or removal of samples for metallographic
observation.  A reduction in tensile strength and/or hardness may indicate a spheroidized microstructure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Temper Embrittlement<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temper embrittlement is the reduction in toughness due to a metallurgical change that can occur in some
low alloy steels as a result of long term exposure in the temperature range of about 650°F to 1070°F
(343°C to 577°C).  This change causes an upward shift in the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature as
measured by Charpy impact testing.  Although the loss of toughness is not evident at operating
temperature, equipment that is temper embrittled may be susceptible to brittle fracture during start-up and
shutdown.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Primarily 2.25Cr-1Mo low alloy steel, 3Cr-1Mo (to a lesser extent), and the high-strength low alloy
Cr-Mo-V rotor steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Older generation 2.25Cr-1Mo materials manufactured prior to 1972 may be particularly susceptible.
Some high strength low alloy steels are also susceptible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The C-0.5Mo, 1Cr-0.5Mo and 1.25Cr-0.5Mo alloy steels are not significantly affected by temper
embrittlement.  However, other high temperature damage mechanisms promote metallurgical
changes that can alter the toughness or high temperature ductility of these materials.  Refer to API
934-C and API 934-D for additional information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Weld materials are generally more affected than today’s low-impurity base materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Alloy steel composition, thermal history, metal temperature and exposure time are critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Susceptibility to temper embrittlement is largely determined by the presence of the alloying elements
manganese and silicon, and the tramp elements phosphorus, tin, antimony, and arsenic. The
strength level and heat treatment/fabrication history should also be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Temper embrittlement of 2.25Cr-1Mo steels develops more quickly at 900°F (482°C) than in the
800°F to 850°F (427°C to 440°C) range, but the damage is more severe after long-term exposure at
850°F (440°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Some embrittlement can occur during fabrication heat treatments, but most of the damage occurs
over many years of service in the embrittling temperature range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
This form of damage will significantly reduce the structural integrity of a component containing a
crack-like flaw.  An evaluation of the materials toughness may be required depending on the flaw
type, the severity of the environment, and the operating conditions, particularly in hydrogen service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Temper embrittlement occurs in a variety of process units after long term exposure to temperatures
above 650°F (343°C).  It should be noted that there have been very few industry failures related
directly to temper embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Equipment susceptible to temper embrittlement is most often found in hydroprocessing units,
particularly reactors, hot feed/effluent exchanger components, and hot HP separators.  Other units
with the potential for temper embrittlement include catalytic reforming units (reactors and
exchangers), FCC reactors, coker and visbreaking units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Welds in these alloys are often more susceptible than the base metal and should be evaluated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Temper embrittlement is a metallurgical change that is not readily apparent and can be confirmed
through impact testing.   Damage due to temper embrittlement may result in catastrophic brittle
fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Temper embrittlement can be identified by an upward shift in the ductile-to-brittle transition
temperature measured in a Charpy V-notch impact test, as compared to the non-embrittled or de-
embrittled material ( Figure 4-5 ).  Another important characteristic of temper embrittlement is that
there is no effect on the upper shelf energy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
SEM fractographs of severely temper embrittled material show primarily intergranular cracking due to
impurity segregation at grain boundaries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Existing Materials<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Temper embrittlement cannot be prevented if the material contains critical levels of the
embrittling impurity elements and is exposed in the embrittling temperature range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
To minimize the possibility of brittle fracture during startup and shutdown, many refiners use a
pressurization sequence to limit system pressure to about 25 percent of the maximum design
pressure for temperatures below a Minimum Pressurization Temperature (MPT). Note that MPT
is not a single point but rather a pressure-temperature envelope which defines safe operating
conditions to minimize the likelihood of brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
MPT’s generally range from 350 o F (171 o C) for the earliest, most highly temper embrittled steels,
down to 125 o F (52 o C) or lower for newer, temper embrittlement resistant steels (as required to
also minimize effects of hydrogen embrittlement).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
If weld repairs are required, the effects of temper embrittlement can be temporarily reversed
(de-embrittled) by heating at 1150°F (620°C) for two hours per inch of thickness, and rapidly
cooling to room temperature.  It is important to note that re-embrittlement will occur over time if
the material is re-exposed to the embrittling temperature range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
New Materials<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
The best way to minimize the likelihood and extent of temper embrittlement is to limit the
acceptance levels of manganese, silicon, phosphorus, tin, antimony, and arsenic in the base
metal and welding consumables.  In addition, strength levels and PWHT procedures should be
specified and carefully controlled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
A common way to minimize temper embrittlement is to limit the "J*" Factor for base metal and
the "X" Factor for weld metal, based on material composition as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>J* = (Si + Mn) x (P + Sn) x 10 4         {elements in wt%}<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X = (10P + 5Sb + 4Sn + As)/100   {elements in ppm}<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Typical J* and X factors used for 2.25 Cr steel are a maximum of 100 and 15, respectively.
Studies have also shown that limiting the (P + Sn) to less than 0.01% is sufficient to minimize
temper embrittlement because (Si + Mn) control the rate of embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
A newer and less widely used factor called the Equivalent Phosphorus content has been
developed for base metal and weld metal and is defined as follows is given by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>P = C + Mn + (Mo Cr) /3 + Si / 4 + 3.5 x [(10 x  P + (5 x Sb) + (4 x Sn) + As)     {elements in wt%}<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
A common method of monitoring is to install blocks of original heats of the alloy steel material inside
the reactor.  Samples are periodically removed from these blocks for impact testing to
monitor/establish the ductile-brittle transition temperature.  The test blocks should be strategically
located near the top and bottom of the reactor to make sure that the test material is exposed to both
inlet and outlet conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Strain Aging<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Strain aging is a form of damage found mostly in older vintage carbon steels and C-0.5 Mo low alloy
steels under the combined effects of deformation and aging at an intermediate temperature. This results
in an increase in hardness and strength with a reduction in ductility and toughness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mostly older (pre-1980’s) carbon steels with a large grain size and C-0.5 Mo low alloy steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Steel composition and manufacturing process determine steel susceptibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Steels manufactured by the Bessemer or open hearth process contain higher levels of critical
impurity elements than newer steels manufactured by the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In general, steels made by BOF and fully killed with aluminum will not be susceptible.  The effect is
found in rimmed and capped steels with higher levels of nitrogen and carbon, but not in the modern
fully killed carbon steels manufactured to a fine grain practice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Strain aging effects are observed in materials that have been cold worked and placed into service at
intermediate temperatures without stress relieving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Strain aging is a major concern for equipment that contains cracks.  If susceptible materials are
plastically deformed and exposed to intermediate temperatures, the zone of deformed material may
become hardened and less ductile.  This phenomenon has been associated with several vessels that
have failed by brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
The pressurization sequence versus temperature is a critical issue to prevent brittle fracture of
susceptible materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Strain aging can also occur when welding in the vicinity of cracks and notches in a susceptible
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Strain aging is most likely to occur in thick wall vessels manufactured from susceptible materials that have
not been stress relieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Strain aging can result in the formation of brittle cracks that are revealed through detailed metallurgical
analyses, but damage most likely will not be identified as strain aging until fracture has already occurred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Strain aging is not an issue for newer steels that contain low levels of interstitial impurity elements
and sufficient aluminum (>0.015 wt%) to fully deoxidize the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
For older equipment, extra care should be taken to avoid the potentially damaging effects of strain
aging by avoiding stressing or pressurizing equipment until the metal temperature reaches an
acceptable level where the risk of brittle fracture is low.  Refer to curve “A” in UCS 66 of the ASME
Code Section VIII, Division I for pressurization temperatures of vessels susceptible to strain aging
effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Applying PWHT to weld repairs of susceptible materials will eliminate the effects of strain aging.
Where PWHT is not possible, buttering should be considered to minimize welding on old material
under restraint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

885°F (475 o C) Embrittlement<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.5.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>885°F (475°C) embrittlement is a loss in toughness due to a metallurgical change that can occur in alloys
containing a ferrite phase, as a result of exposure in the temperature range 600°F to1000°F (316°C to
540°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.5.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
400 Series SS (e.g., 405, 409, 410, 410S, 430 and 446).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Duplex stainless steels such as Alloys 2205, 2304 and 2507.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.5.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The alloy composition, particularly chromium content, amount of ferrite phase, and operating
temperature are critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Increasing amounts of ferrite phase increase susceptibility to damage when operating in the high
temperature range of concern.  A dramatic increase in the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature will
occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
A primary consideration is operating time at temperature within the critical temperature range.
Damage is cumulative and results from the precipitation of an embrittling intermetallic phase that
occurs most readily at approximately 885°F (475°C).  Additional time is required to reach maximum
embrittlement at temperatures above or below 885°F (475°C).  For example, many thousands of
hours may be required to cause embrittlement at 600°F (316°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Since 885 o F embrittlement can occur in a relatively short period of time, it is often assumed that
susceptible materials that have been exposed to temperatures in the 700°F to 1000°F (371°C to
538°C) range are affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The effect on toughness is not pronounced at the operating temperature, but is significant at lower
temperatures experienced during plant shutdowns, startups or upsets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Embrittlement can result from tempering at higher temperatures or by holding within or cooling
through the transformation range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.5.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
885 o F embrittlement can be found in any unit where susceptible alloys are exposed to the embrittling
temperature range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Most refining companies limit the use of ferritic stainless steels to non-pressure boundary
applications because of this damage mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Common examples include fractionator trays and internals in high temperature vessels used in FCC,
crude, vacuum and coker units.  Typical failures include cracking when attempting to weld or to
straighten bent, upset tower trays of Type 409 and 410 material (occurs often with vacuum tower
trays of this material).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Other examples include duplex stainless steel heat exchanger tubes and other components exposed
to temperatures above 600°F (316°C) for extended time periods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
885°F embrittlement is a metallurgical change that is not readily apparent with metallography but can
be confirmed through bend or impact testing ( Figure 4-6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The existence of 885°F embrittlement can be identified by an increase in hardness in affected areas.
Failure during bend testing or impact testing of samples removed from service is the most positive
indicator of 885°F embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.5.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The best way to prevent 885°F embrittlement is to use low ferrite or non-ferritic alloys, or to avoid
exposing the susceptible material to the embrittling range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
It is possible to minimize the effects of embrittlement through modifications in the chemical
composition of the alloy, however, resistant material may not always be readily available in most
commercial forms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
885°F embrittlement is reversible by heat treatment to dissolve precipitates, followed by rapid
cooling. The de-embrittling heat treatment temperature is typically 1100°F (593°C) or higher and may
not be practical for many equipment items. If the de-embrittled component is exposed to the same
service conditions it will re-embrittle faster than it did initially.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.5.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Impact or bend testing of samples removed from service is the most positive indicator of a problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Most cases of embrittlement are found in the form of cracking during turnarounds, or during startup
or shutdown when the material is below about 200°F (93°C) and the effects of embrittlement are
most detrimental.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
An increase in hardness is another method of evaluating 885°F embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Sigma Phase Embrittlement<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.6.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Formation of a metallurgical phase known as sigma phase can result in a loss of fracture toughness in
some stainless steels as a result of high temperature exposure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.6.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
300 Series SS wrought metals, weld metal, and castings.  Cast 300 Series SS including the HK and
HP alloys are especially susceptible to sigma formation because of their high (10% to 40%) ferrite
content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The 400 Series SS and other ferritic and martensitic SS with 17% Cr or more are also susceptible
(e.g., Types 430 and 440).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Duplex stainless steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.6.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Alloy composition, time and temperature are the critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In susceptible alloys, the primary factor that affects sigma phase formation is the time of exposure at
elevated temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Sigma phase occurs in ferritic (Fe-Cr), martensitic (Fe-Cr), austenitic (Fe-Cr-Ni) and duplex stainless
steels when exposed to temperatures in the range of 1000°F to 1700°F (538°C to 927°C).
Embrittlement can result by holding within or cooling through the transformation range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Sigma forms most rapidly from the ferrite phase that exists in 300 Series SS and duplex SS weld
deposits.  It can also form in the 300 Series SS base metal (austenite phase) but usually more
slowly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The 300 Series SS can exhibit about 10% to 15% sigma phase. Cast austenitic stainless steels can
develop considerably more sigma.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Formation of sigma phase in austenitic stainless steels can also occur in a few hours, as evidenced
by the known tendency for sigma to form if an austenitic stainless steel is subjected to a post weld
heat treatment at 1275°F (690°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The tensile and yield strength of sigmatized stainless steels increases slightly compared with
solution annealed material. This increase in strength is accompanied by a reduction in ductility
(measured by percent elongation and reduction in area) and a slight increase in hardness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Stainless steels with sigma can normally withstand normal operating stresses, but upon cooling to
temperatures below about 500°F (260°C) may show a complete lack of fracture toughness as
measured in a Charpy impact test.  Laboratory tests of embrittled weld metal have shown a complete
lack of fracture toughness below 1000°F (538°C)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
The metallurgical change is actually the precipitation of a hard, brittle intermetallic compound that
can also render the material more susceptible to intergranular corrosion. The precipitation rate
increases with increasing chromium and molybdenum content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

FCC Regenerator service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
300 Series SS weld overlays and tube-to-tubesheet attachment welds can be embrittled during
PWHT treatment of the underlying CrMo base metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.6.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Sigma phase embrittlement is a metallurgical change that is not readily apparent, and can only be
confirmed through metallographic examination and impact testing. ( Tables 4-1  and  4-2 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Damage due to sigma phase embrittlement appears in the form of cracking, particularly at welds or
in areas of high restraint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Tests performed on sigmatized 300 Series SS (304H) samples from FCC regenerator internals have
shown that even with 10% sigma formation, the Charpy impact toughness was 39 ft-lbs (53 J) at
1200°F (649°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
For the 10% sigmatized specimen, the values ranged from 0% ductility at room temperature to 100%
at 1200°F (649°C). Thus, although the impact toughness is reduced at high temperature, the
specimens broke in a 100% ductile fashion, indicating that the wrought material is still suitable at
operating temperatures.  See  Figures 4-7  to  4-11 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Cast austenitic stainless steels typically have high ferrite/sigma content (up to 40%) and may have
very poor high temperature ductility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.6.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The best way to prevent sigma phase embrittlement is to use alloys that are resistant to sigma
formation or to avoid exposing the material to the embrittling range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The lack of fracture ductility at room temperature indicates that care should be taken to avoid
application of high stresses to sigmatized materials during shutdown, as a brittle fracture could
result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The 300 Series SS can be de-sigmatized by solution annealing at 1950°F (1066°C) for four hours
followed by a water quench.  However, this is not practical for most equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Sigma phase in welds can be minimized by controlling ferrite in the range of 5% to 9% for Type 347
and somewhat less ferrite for Type 304.  The weld metal ferrite content should be limited to the
stated maximum to minimize sigma formation during service or fabrication, and must meet the stated
minimum in order to minimize hot short cracking during welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
For stainless steel weld overlay clad Cr-Mo components, the exposure time to PWHT temperatures
should be limited wherever possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.6.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Physical testing of samples removed from service is the most positive indicator of a problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Most cases of embrittlement are found in the form of cracking in both wrought and cast (welded)
metals during turnarounds, or during startup or shutdown when the material is below about 500°F
(260°C) and the effects of embrittlement are most pronounced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7
Brittle Fracture<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Brittle fracture is the sudden rapid fracture under stress (residual or applied) where the material exhibits
little or no evidence of ductility or plastic deformation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steels and low alloy steels are of prime concern, particularly older steels.  400 Series SS are also
susceptible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For a material containing a flaw, brittle fracture can occur.  Following are three important factors:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
The Material fracture  toughness (resistance to crack like flaws) as measured in a Charpy
impact test;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
The size, shape and stress concentration effect of a flaw;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
The amount of residual and applied stresses on the flaw.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Susceptibility to brittle fracture may be increased by the presence of embrittling phases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Steel cleanliness and grain size have a significant influence on toughness and resistance to brittle
fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Thicker material sections also have a lower resistance to brittle fracture due to higher constraint
which increases triaxial stresses at the crack tip.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
In most cases, brittle fracture occurs only at temperatures below the Charpy impact transition
temperature (or ductile-to-brittle transition temperature), the point at which the toughness of the
material drops off sharply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Equipment manufactured to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Division 1,
prior to the December 1987 Addenda, were made with limited restrictions on notch toughness for
vessels operating at cold temperatures.  However, this does not mean that all vessels fabricated
prior to this date will be subject to brittle fracture.  Many designers specified supplemental impact
tests on equipment that was intended to be in cold service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Equipment made to the same code after this date were subject to the requirements of UCS 66
(impact exemption curves).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Most processes run at elevated temperature so the main concern is for brittle fracture during startup,
shutdown, or hydrotest/tightness testing.  Thick wall equipment on any unit should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Brittle fracture can also occur during an autorefrigeration event in units processing light
hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane/ethylene, propane/propylene, or butane.  This includes
alkylation units, olefin units and polymer plants (polyethylene and polypropylene).  Storage
bullets/spheres for light hydrocarbons may also be susceptible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Brittle fracture can occur during ambient temperature hydrotesting due to high stresses and low
toughness at the testing temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cracks will typically be straight, non-branching, and largely devoid of any associated plastic
deformation (although fine shear lips may be found along the free edge of the fracture, or localized
necking around the crack ( Figure 4-12  to  Figure 4-16 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Microscopically, the fracture surface will be composed largely of cleavage, with limited intergranular
cracking and very little microvoid coalescence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For new equipment, brittle fracture is best prevented by using materials specifically designed for low
temperature operation including upset and autorefrigeration events.  Materials with controlled
chemical composition, special heat treatment and impact test verification may be required.  Refer to
UCS 66 in Section VIII of the ASME BPV Code.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Brittle fracture is an “event” driven damage mechanism.  For existing materials, where the right
combination of stress, material toughness and flaw size govern the probability of the event, an
engineering study can be performed in accordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-1 , Section 3, Level 1
or 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Preventative measures to minimize the potential for brittle fracture in existing equipment are limited
to controlling the operating conditions (pressure, temperature), minimizing pressure at ambient
temperatures during startup and shutdown, and periodic inspection at high stress locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Some reduction in the likelihood of a brittle fracture may be achieved by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Performing a post weld heat treatment (PWHT) on the vessel if it was not originally done during
manufacturing; or if the vessel has been weld repaired/modified while in service without the
subsequent PWHT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Perform a “warm” pre-stress hydrotest followed by a lower temperature hydrotest to extend the
Minimum Safe Operating Temperature (MSOT) envelope.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Inspection is not normally used to mitigate brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Susceptible vessels should be inspected for pre-existing flaws/defects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8
Creep and Stress Rupture<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
At high temperatures, metal components can slowly and continuously deform under load below the
yield stress. This time dependent deformation of stressed components is known as creep.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Deformation leads to damage that may eventually lead to a rupture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>All metals and alloys.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The rate of creep deformation is a function of the material, load, and temperature.  The rate of
damage (strain rate) is sensitive to both load and temperature.  Generally, an increase of about 25°F
(12°C) or an increase of 15% on stress can cut the remaining life in half or more, depending on the
alloy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Table 4-3  lists threshold temperatures above which creep damage is a concern.  If the metal
temperature exceeds these values, then creep damage and creep cracking can occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The level of creep damage is a function of the material and the coincident temperature/stress level at
which the creep deformation occurs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The life of metal components becomes nearly infinite at temperatures below the threshold limit
( Table 4-3 ) even at the high stresses near a crack tip.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The appearance of creep damage with little or no apparent deformation is often mistakenly referred
to as creep embrittlement, but usually indicates that the material has low creep ductility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Low creep ductility is:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
More severe for higher tensile strength materials and welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
More prevalent at the lower temperatures in the creep range, or low stresses in the upper creep
range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
More likely in a coarse-grained material than a fine-grained material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Not evidenced by a deterioration of ambient temperature properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Promoted by certain carbide types in some CrMo steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Increased stress due to loss in thickness from corrosion will reduce time to failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Creep damage is found in high temperature equipment operating above the creep range.  Heater
tubes in fired heaters are especially susceptible as well as tube supports, hangers and other furnace
internals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Piping and equipment, such as hot-wall catalytic reforming reactors and furnace tubes, hydrogen
reforming furnace tubes, hot wall FCC reactors, FCC main fractionator and regenerator internals all
operate in or near the creep range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Low creep ductility failures have occurred in weld heat-affected zones (HAZ) at nozzles and other
high stress areas on catalytic reformer reactors. Cracking has also been found at long seam welds in
some high temperature piping and in reactors on catalytic reformers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Welds joining dissimilar materials (ferritic to austenitic welds) may suffer creep related damage at
high temperatures due to differential thermal expansion stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

_____________________________________________________________________________________________<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The initial stages of creep damage can only be identified by scanning electron microscope
metallography.  Creep voids typically show up at the grain boundaries and in later stages form
fissures and then cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
At temperatures well above the threshold limits, noticeable deformation may be observed.  For
example, heater tubes may suffer long term creep damage and exhibit significant bulging before final
fracture occurs. The amount of deformation is highly dependent on the material, and the combination
of temperature and stress level ( Figure 4-17  to  4-19 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In vessels and piping, creep cracking can occur where high metal temperatures and stress
concentrations occur together, such as near major structural discontinuities including pipe tee joints,
nozzles, or welds at flaws.  Creep cracking, once initiated, can progress rapidly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
There is little that inspectors or operators can do to prevent this damage once a susceptible material
has been placed into creep service, other than to minimize the metal temperature, particularly with
fired heater tubes.  Avoiding stress concentrators is important during design and fabrication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Low creep ductility can be minimized by the careful selection of chemistry for low alloy materials.
Higher post weld heat treatment temperatures may help minimize creep cracking of materials with
low creep ductility such as 1.25Cr-0.5Mo.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Creep damage is not reversible.  Once damage or cracking is detected much of the life of the
component has been used up and typically the options are to repair or replace the damaged
component.  Higher PWHT in some cases can produce a more creep ductile material with longer life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Equipment – Repair of creep damaged catalytic reformer reactor nozzles has been successfully
accomplished by grinding out the affected area (making sure all the damaged metal is
removed), re-welding and careful blend grinding to help minimize stress concentration.  PWHT
temperatures must be carefully selected and may require a higher PWHT than originally
specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Fired Heater Tubes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Alloys with improved creep resistance may be required for longer life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Heaters should be designed and operated to minimize hot spots and localized overheating
( Figure 4-19 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Visual inspection followed by thickness measurements and or strap readings may be
required to assess remaining life of heater tubes in accordance with API 579-1/ASME FFS-
1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Minimizing process side fouling/deposits and fire side deposits/scaling can maximize tube
life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Creep damage with the associated microvoid formation, fissuring and dimensional changes is not
effectively found by any one inspection technique.  A combination of techniques (UT, RT, EC,
dimensional measurements and replication) should be employed.  Destructive sampling and
metallographic examination are used to confirm damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
For pressure vessels, inspection should focus on welds of CrMo alloys operating in the creep range.
The 1 Cr-0.5Mo and 1.25Cr-0.5Mo materials are particularly prone to low creep ductility.  Most
inspections are performed visually and followed by PT or WFMT on several-year intervals.  Angle
beam (shear wave) UT can also be employed, although the early stages of creep damage are very
difficult to detect.  Initial fabrication flaws should be mapped and documented for future reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Fired heater tubes should be inspected for evidence of overheating, corrosion, and erosion as
follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Tubes should be VT examined for bulging, blistering, cracking, sagging and bowing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Wall thickness measurements of selected heater tubes should be made where wall losses are
most likely to occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Tubes should be examined for evidence of diametric growth (creep) with a strap or go/no go
gauge, and in limited cases by metallography on in place replicas or tube samples.  However,
metallography on the OD of a component may not provide a clear indication of subsurface
damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Retirement criteria based on diametric growth and loss of wall thickness is highly dependent on
the tube material and the specific operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9
Thermal Fatigue<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermal fatigue is the result of cyclic stresses caused by variations in temperature.  Damage is in the
form of cracking that may occur anywhere in a metallic component where relative movement or
differential expansion is constrained, particularly under repeated thermal cycling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All materials of construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Key factors affecting thermal fatigue are the magnitude of the temperature swing and the frequency
(number of cycles).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Time to failure is a function of the magnitude of the stress and the number of cycles and decreases
with increasing stress and increasing cycles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Startup and shutdown of equipment increase the susceptibility to thermal fatigue.  There is no set
limit on temperature swings; however, as a practical rule, cracking may be suspected if the
temperature swings exceeds about 200°F (93°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Damage is also promoted by rapid changes in surface temperature that result in a thermal gradient
through the thickness or along the length of a component. For example: cold water on a hot tube
(thermal shock); rigid attachments and a smaller temperature differential; inflexibility to
accommodate differential expansion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Notches (such as the toe of a weld) and sharp corners (such as the intersection of a nozzle with a
vessel shell) and other stress concentrations may serve as initiation sites.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Examples include the mix points of hot and cold streams such as hydrogen mix points in
hydroprocessing units, and locations where condensate comes in contact with steam systems, such
as de-superheating or attemporating equipment ( Figures 4-20  and  4-23 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Thermal fatigue cracking has been a major problem in coke drum shells.  Thermal fatigue can also
occur on coke drum skirts where stresses are promoted by a variation in temperature between the
drum and skirt ( Figure 4–21  and  Figure 4–22 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In steam generating equipment, the most common locations are at rigid attachments between
neighboring tubes in the superheater and reheater.  Slip spacers designed to accommodate relative
movement may become frozen and act as a rigid attachment when plugged with fly ash.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Tubes in the high temperature superheater or reheater that penetrate through the cooler waterwall
tubes may crack at the header connection if the tube is not sufficiently flexible.  These cracks are
most common at the end where the expansion of the header relative to the waterwall will be greatest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Steam actuated soot blowers may cause thermal fatigue damage if the first steam exiting the soot
blower nozzle contains condensate.  Rapid cooling of the tube by the liquid water will promote this
form of damage.  Similarly, water lancing or water cannon use on waterwall tubes may have the
same effect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Thermal fatigue cracks usually initiate on the surface of the component. They are generally wide and
often filled with oxides due to elevated temperature exposure.  Cracks may occur as single or
multiple cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Thermal fatigue cracks propagate transverse to the stress and they are usually dagger-shaped,
transgranular, and oxide filled ( Figure 4-24  and  4-25 ).  However, cracking may be axial or
circumferential, or both, at the same location.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In steam generating equipment, cracks usually follow the toe of the fillet weld, as the change in
section thickness creates a stress raiser. Cracks often start at the end of an attachment lug and if
there is a bending moment as a result of the constraint, they will develop into circumferential cracks
into the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d )
Water in soot blowers may lead to a crazing pattern. The predominant cracks will be circumferential
and the minor cracks will be axial.  ( Figure 4-26  to  4-27 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Thermal fatigue is best prevented through design and operation to minimize thermal stresses and
thermal cycling.  Several methods of prevention apply depending on the application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Designs that incorporate reduction of stress concentrators, blend grinding of weld profiles, and
smooth transitions should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Controlled rates of heating and cooling during startup and shutdown of equipment can lower
stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Differential thermal expansion between adjoining components of dissimilar materials should be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Designs should incorporate sufficient flexibility to accommodate differential expansion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
In steam generating equipment, slip spacers should slip and rigid attachments should be
avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Drain lines should be provided on soot-blowers to prevent condensate in the first portion of the
soot blowing cycle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In some cases, a liner or sleeve may be installed to prevent a colder liquid from contacting the hotter
pressure boundary wall<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.9.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Since cracking is usually surface connected, visual examination, MT and PT are effective methods of
inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
External SWUT inspection can be used for non-intrusive inspection for internal cracking and where
reinforcing pads prevent nozzle examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Heavy wall reactor internal attachment welds can be inspected using specialized ultrasonic
techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11 Steam Blanketing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The operation of steam generating equipment is a balance between the heat flow from the combustion of
the fuel and the generation of steam within the waterwall or generating tube. The flow of heat energy
through the wall of the tube results in the formation of discrete steam bubbles (nucleate boiling) on the ID
surface. The moving fluid sweeps the bubbles away.  When the heat flow balance is disturbed, individual
bubbles join to form a steam blanket, a condition known as Departure From Nucleate Boiling (DNB).
Once a steam blanket forms, tube rupture can occur rapidly, as a result of short term overheating, usually
within a few minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel and low alloy steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Heat flux and fluid flow are critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Flame impingement from misdirected or damaged burners can provide a heat flux greater than the
steam generating tube can accommodate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
On the water side, anything that restricts fluid flow (for example, pinhole leaks lower in the steam
circuit or dented tubes from slag falls) will reduce fluid flow and can lead to DNB conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Failure occurs as a result of the hoop stress in the tube from the internal steam pressure at the
elevated temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All steam-generating units including fired boilers, waste heat exchangers in sulfur plants, hydrogen
reformers and FCC units.  Failures can occur in superheaters and reheaters during start-up when
condensate blocks steam flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
These short-term, high-temperature failures always show an open burst with the fracture edges
drawn to a near knife-edge ( Figure 4-32 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The microstructure will always show severe elongation of the grain structure due to the plastic
deformation that occurs at the time of failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
When a DNB condition has developed, tube rupture will quickly follow.  Proper burner management
should be practiced to minimize flame impingement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Proper BFW treatment can help prevent some conditions that can lead to restricted fluid flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Tubes should be visually inspected for bulging.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Burners  should be properly maintained to prevent flame impingement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.11.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Steam blanketing can cause caustic corrosion (caustic gouging) as outlined in  4.3.10 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Very similar characteristics are observed in short term overheating (see  4.2.10 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.12 Dissimilar Metal Weld (DMW) Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.12.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cracking of dissimilar metal welds occurs in the ferritic (carbon steel or low alloy steel) side of a weld
between an austenitic (300 Series SS or Nickel base alloy) and a ferritic material operating at high
temperature ( Figure 4-33  and  4-44 ).  Cracking can result from creep damage, from fatigue cracking, from
sulfide stress cracking or hydrogen disbonding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.12.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most common are ferritic materials such as carbon steel and low alloy steels that are welded to the
austenitic stainless steels as well as any material combinations that have widely differing thermal
expansion coefficients.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.12.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Important factors include the type of filler metal used to join the materials, heating and cooling rate,
metal temperature, time at temperature, weld geometry and thermal cycling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracking can occur because of the different coefficients of thermal expansion between ferritic and
austenitic (e.g. 300 Series stainless steel or nickel-base alloys) which differ by about 25 to 30% or
more. At high operating temperatures, the differences in thermal expansion leads to high stress at
the heat-affected zone on the ferritic side ( Table 4-4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
As the operating temperature increases, differential thermal expansion between the metals results in
increasing stress at the weldment, particularly if a 300 Series SS weld metal is used.
Ferritic/austenitic joints can generate significant thermal expansion/thermal fatigue stresses at
temperatures greater than 510°F (260°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Thermal cycling aggravates the problem. Stresses during start up and shut down can be significant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Stresses acting on the weldment are significantly higher when an austenitic stainless steel filler metal
is used.  A nickel base filler metal has a coefficient of thermal expansion that is closer to carbon
steel, resulting in significantly lower stress at elevated temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
For dissimilar welds that operate at elevated temperatures, the problem is aggravated by the
diffusion of carbon out of the heat-affected zone of the ferritic material and into the weld metal.  The
loss of carbon reduces the creep strength of the ferritic material heat-affected zone, thereby
increasing the cracking probability ( Figure 4-35 ). The temperature at which carbon diffusion
becomes a concern is above 800°F to 950°F (427°C to 510°C) for carbon steels and low alloy steels,
respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Dissimilar metal welds on a ferritic steel that are made with a 300 Series SS weld metal or a nickel-
based filler metal result in a narrow region (mixed zone) of high hardness at the toe of the weld, near
the fusion line on the ferritic steel side.  These high hardness zones render the material susceptible
to various forms of environmental cracking such as sulfide stress cracking or hydrogen stress
cracking ( Figures 4-36  and  4-37 ).  PWHT of the weldment will not prevent environmental cracking if
the weld is exposed to wet H 2 S conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
DMW’s for high temperature service in hydrogen environments must be carefully designed and
inspected to prevent hydrogen disbonding ( Figures 4-38  to  4-41 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
In environments that promote liquid ash corrosion, weld cracking problems may be accelerated by
stress-assisted corrosion. The ferritic heat-affected zone will preferentially corrode due to the large
thermal strain.  The results are long, narrow, oxide wedges that parallel the fusion line of the weld
( Figure 4-42 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
Poor geometry of the weld, excessive undercut, and other stress intensification factors will promote
crack formation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Dissimilar metal welds are utilized in special applications in refineries and other process plants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Examples of DMW’s include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Welds used to join clad pipe in locations such as transitions in hydroprocessing reactor
outlet piping from overlaid low alloy CrMo nozzles or piping to solid 300 Series stainless
steel pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Hydroprocessing exchanger inlet and outlet piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Alloy transitions inside fired heaters (e.g. 9Cr to 317L in a crude furnace)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Hydrogen reformer  furnace 1.25 Cr inlet pigtails to Alloy 800 sockolets or weldolets on
Hydrogen reformer tubes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Hydrogen reformer furnace Alloy 800 outlet cones to CS or 1.25 Cr refractory lined transfer
lines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Alloy transitions inside fired heaters (e.g. 9Cr to 317L in a crude or vacuum furnace)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Welds joining clad pipe sections to themselves or to unclad carbon or low alloy steel pipe
(e.g. Alloy C276 clad CS piping in crude unit overhead system)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Nickel base alloy welds joining socket weld valves in 5 and 9 Cr piping systems<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
300 series SS weld overlay in numerous refinery reactors and pressure vessels<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Similar DMWs have been used in FCCU reactors and regenerator vessels and in Coker
Units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
All superheaters and reheaters that have welds between ferritic materials (1.25Cr-0.5Mo and 2.25Cr-
1Mo) and the austenitic materials (300 Series SS, 304H, 321H and 347H).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.12.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
In most cases, the cracks form at the toe of the weld in the heat-affected zone of the ferritic material
( Figure 4-36  to  Figure 4-42 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Welds joining tubes are the most common problem area, but support lugs or attachments of cast or
wrought 300 Series SS to 400 Series SS are also affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.12.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For high temperature applications, nickel base filler metals which have a coefficient of thermal
expansion closer to carbon steel and low alloy steels may dramatically increase the life of the joint,
because of the significant reduction in thermal stress acting on the steel (ferritic) side of the joint.
Refer to API 577 and API 582 for additional information on filler metal selection, welding procedures
and weld inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
If 300 Series SS welding electrodes are used, the dissimilar metal weld should be located in a low
temperature region.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Consider buttering the ferritic side of the joint with the SS or nickel base filler metal and perform
PWHT prior to completing the DMW to minimize the hardness of the mixed weld zone in order to
minimize susceptibility to environmental cracking. See  Figure 4-34  and  4-35 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
On buttered joints, the thickness of the weld metal should be a minimum of 0.25 inch (6.35 mm)
after the bevel is machined.   Figure 4-35 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
In steam generating equipment, the weld at the high temperature end should be made in the
penthouse or header enclosure, out of the heat transfer zone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.13.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A form of thermal fatigue cracking – thermal shock – can occur when high and non-uniform thermal
stresses develop over a relatively short time in a piece of equipment due to differential expansion or
contraction.  If the thermal expansion/contraction is restrained, stresses above the yield strength of the
material can result.  Thermal shock usually occurs when a colder liquid contacts a warmer metal surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.14 Erosion/Erosion – Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.14.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Erosion is the accelerated mechanical removal of surface material as a result of relative movement
between, or impact from solids, liquids, vapor or any combination thereof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Erosion-corrosion is a description for the damage that occurs when corrosion contributes to erosion
by removing protective films or scales, or by exposing the metal surface to further corrosion under
the combined action of erosion and corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.14.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All metals, alloys and refractories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.14.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
In most cases, corrosion plays some role so that pure erosion (sometimes referred to as abrasive
wear) is rare.  It is critical to consider the role that corrosion contributes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Metal loss rates depend on the velocity and concentration of impacting medium (i.e., particles,
liquids, droplets, slurries, two-phase flow), the size and hardness of impacting particles, the hardness
and corrosion resistance of material subject to erosion, and the angle of impact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Softer alloys such as copper and aluminum alloys that are easily worn from mechanical damage may
be subject to severe metal loss under high velocity conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Although increasing hardness of the metal substrate is a common approach to minimize damage, it
is not always a good indicator of improved resistance to erosion, particularly where corrosion plays a
significant role.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
For each environment-material combination, there is often a threshold velocity above which
impacting objects may produce metal loss.  Increasing velocities above this threshold result in an
increase in metal loss rates as shown in  Table 4-5 .  This table illustrates the relative susceptibility of
a variety of metals and alloys to erosion/corrosion by seawater at different velocities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
The size, shape, density and hardness of the impacting medium affect the metal loss rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Increasing the corrosivity of the environment may reduce the stability of protective surface films and
increase the susceptibility to metal loss. Metal may be removed from the surface as dissolved ions,
or as solid corrosion products which are mechanically swept from the metal surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Factors which contribute to an increase in corrosivity of the environment, such as temperature, pH,
etc., can increase susceptibility to metal loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.14.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All types of equipment exposed to moving fluids and/or catalyst are subject to erosion and erosion-
corrosion. This includes piping systems, particularly the bends, elbows, tees and reducers; piping
systems downstream of letdown valves and block valves; pumps; blowers; propellers; impellers;
agitators; agitated vessels; heat exchanger tubing; measuring device orifices; turbine blades;
nozzles; ducts and vapor lines; scrapers; cutters; and wear plates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Erosion can be caused by gas borne catalyst particles or by particles carried by a liquid such as a
slurry.  In refineries, this form of damage occurs as a result of catalyst movement in FCC
reactor/regenerator systems in catalyst handling equipment (valves, cyclones, piping, reactors) and
slurry piping ( Figure 4-43 ); coke handling equipment in both delayed and fluidized bed cokers
( Figure 4-44 ); and as wear on pumps ( Figure 4-45 ), compressors and other rotating equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Hydroprocessing reactor effluent piping may be subject to erosion-corrosion by ammonium bisulfide.
The metal loss is dependent on several factors including the ammonium bisulfide concentration,
velocity and alloy corrosion resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Crude and vacuum unit piping and vessels exposed to naphthenic acids in some crude oils may
suffer severe erosion-corrosion metal loss depending on the temperature, velocity, sulfur content and
TAN level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.14.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Erosion and erosion-corrosion are characterized by a localized loss in thickness in the form of pits,
grooves, gullies, waves, rounded holes and valleys. These losses often exhibit a directional pattern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Failures can occur in a relatively short time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.14.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Improvements in design involve changes in shape, geometry and materials selection. Some
examples are: increasing the pipe diameter to decrease velocity; streamlining bends to reduce
impingement; increasing the wall thickness; and using replaceable impingement baffles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Improved resistance to erosion is usually achieved through increasing substrate hardness using
harder alloys, hardfacing or surface-hardening treatments.  Erosion resistant refractories in cyclones
and slide valves have been very successful.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Erosion-corrosion is best mitigated by using more corrosion-resistant alloys and/or altering the
process environment to reduce corrosivity, for example, deaeration, condensate injection or the
addition of inhibitors.  Resistance is generally not improved through increasing substrate hardness
alone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Heat exchangers utilize impingement plates and occasionally tube ferrules to minimize erosion
problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Higher molybdenum containing alloys are used for improved resistance to naphthenic acid corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.14.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Visual examination of suspected or troublesome areas, as well as UT checks or RT can be used to
detect the extent of metal loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Specialized corrosion coupons and on-line corrosion monitoring electrical resistance probes have
been used in some applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
IR scans are used to detect refractory loss on stream.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.14.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specialized terminology has been developed for various forms of erosion and erosion-corrosion in
specific environments and/or services. This terminology includes cavitation, liquid impingement erosion,
fretting and other similar terms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.15 Cavitation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.15.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cavitation is a form of erosion caused by the formation and instantaneous collapse of innumerable
tiny vapor bubbles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The collapsing bubbles exert severe localized impact forces that can result in metal loss referred to
as cavitation damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The bubbles may contain the vapor phase of the liquid, air or other gas entrained in the liquid
medium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.15.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Most common materials of construction including copper and brass, cast iron, carbon steel, low alloy
steels, 300 Series SS, 400 Series SS and nickel base alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.15.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
In a pump, the difference between the actual pressure or head of the liquid available (measured on
the suction side) and the vapor pressure of that liquid is called the Net Positive Suction Head
(NPSH) available.  The minimum head required to prevent cavitation with a given liquid at a given
flow rate is called the net positive suction head required.  Inadequate NPSH can result in cavitation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Temperatures approaching the boiling point of the liquid are more likely to result in bubble formation
than lower temperature operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The presence of solid or abrasive particles is not required for cavitation damage but will accelerate
the damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.15.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cavitation is most often observed in pump casings, pump impellers (low pressure side) and in piping
downstream of orifices or control valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Damage can also be found in restricted-flow passages or other areas where turbulent flow is
subjected to rapid pressure changes within a localized region.  Examples of affected equipment
include heat exchanger tubes, venturis, seals and impellers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.15.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cavitation damage generally looks like sharp-edged pitting but may also have a gouged appearance in
rotational components.  However, damage occurs only in localized low-pressure zones (see  Figure 4-46 ,
Figure 4-47  to  Figure 4-49 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.15.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Resistance to cavitation damage in a specific environment may not be significantly improved by a
material change. A mechanical modification, design or operating change is usually required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cavitation is best prevented by avoiding conditions that allow the absolute pressure to fall below the
vapor pressure of the liquid or by changing the material properties.  Examples include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Streamline the flow path to reduce turbulence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Decrease fluid velocities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Remove entrained air.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Increase the suction pressure of pumps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Alter the fluid properties, perhaps by adding additives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6)
Use hard surfacing or hardfacing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7)
Use of harder and/or more corrosion resistant alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Attack is accelerated by the mechanical disruption of protective films at the liquid-solid interface
(such as a protective corrosion scale or passive films).  Therefore, changing to a more corrosion
resistant and/or higher hardness material may not improve cavitation resistance.  Excessively hard
materials may not be suitable if they lack the toughness required to withstand the high local
pressures and impact (shear loads) of the collapsing bubbles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.15.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cavitating pumps may sound like pebbles are being thrashed around inside.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Techniques include limited monitoring of fluid properties as well as acoustic monitoring of turbulent
areas to detect characteristic sound frequencies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Visual examination of suspected areas, as well as external UT and RT can be used to monitor for
loss in thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.16 Mechanical Fatigue<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.16.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Fatigue cracking is a mechanical form of degradation that occurs when a component is exposed to
cyclical stresses for an extended period, often resulting in sudden, unexpected failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
These stresses can arise from either mechanical loading or thermal cycling and are typically well
below the yield strength of the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.16.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All engineering alloys are subject to fatigue cracking although the stress levels and number of cycles
n ecessary to cause failure vary by material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.16.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Geometry, stress level, number of cycles, and material properties (strength, hardness, microstructure) are
the predominant factors in determining the fatigue resistance of a component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Design: Fatigue cracks usually initiate on the surface at notches or stress raisers under cyclic
loading. For this reason, design of a component is the most important factor in determining a
component’s resistance to fatigue cracking. Several common surface features can lead to the
initiation of fatigue cracks as they can act as stress concentrations. Some of these common features
are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Mechanical notches (sharp corners or groves);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Key holes on drive shafts of rotating equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Weld joint, flaws and/or mismatches;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Quench nozzle areas;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Tool markings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6)
Grinding marks;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7)
Lips on drilled holes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8)
Thread root notches;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9)
Corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Metallurgical Issues and Microstructure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
For some materials such as titanium, carbon steel and low alloy steel, the number of cycles to
fatigue fracture decreases with stress amplitude until an endurance limit reached.  Below this
stress endurance limit, fatigue cracking will not occur, regardless of the number of cycles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
For alloys with endurance limits, there is a correlation between Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)
and the minimum stress amplitude necessary to initiate fatigue cracking. The ratio of endurance
limit over UTS is typically between 0.4 and 0.5. Materials like austenitic stainless steels and
aluminum that do not have an endurance limit will have a fatigue limit defined by the number of
cycles at a given stress amplitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Inclusions found in metal can have an accelerating effect on fatigue cracking. This is of
importance when dealing with older, “dirty” steels or weldments, as these often have inclusions
and discontinuities that can degrade fatigue resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Heat treatment can have a significant effect on the toughness and hence fatigue resistance of a
metal.  In general, finer grained microstructures tend to perform better than coarse grained.
Heat treatments such as quenching and tempering, can improve fatigue resistance of carbon
and low alloy steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Carbon Steel and Titanium:  These materials exhibit an endurance limit below which fatigue cracking
will not occur, regardless of the number of cycles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
300 Series SS, 400 Series SS, aluminum and most other non-ferrous alloys:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
These alloys have a fatigue characteristic that does not exhibit an endurance limit. This means
that fatigue fracture can be achieved under cyclical loading eventually, regardless of stress
amplitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Maximum cyclical stress amplitude is determined by relating the stress necessary to cause
fracture to the desired number of cycles necessary in a component’s lifetime. This is typically
106 to 107 cycles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.16.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Thermal Cycling<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Equipment that cycles daily in operation such as coke drums.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Equipment that may be auxiliary or on continuous standby but sees intermittent service such as
auxiliary boiler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Quench nozzle connections that see significant temperature deltas during operations such as
water washing systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Mechanical Loading<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Pressure Swing Absorbers on hydrogen purification units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Rotating shafts on centrifugal pumps and compressors that have stress concentrations due to
changes in radii and key ways.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Components such as small diameter piping that may see vibration from adjacent equipment
and/or wind. For small components, resonance can also produce a cyclical load and should be
taken into consideration during design and reviewed for potential problems after installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
High pressure drop control valves or steam reducing stations can cause serious vibration
problems in connected piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.16.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The signature mark of a fatigue failure is a “clam shell” type fingerprint that has concentric rings
called “beach marks” emanating from the crack initiation site ( Figure 4-50  and  Figure 4-51 ).  This
signature pattern results from the “waves” of crack propagation that occur during cycles above the
threshold loading. These concentric cracks continue to propagate until the cross-sectional area is
reduced to the point where failure due to overload occurs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracks nucleating from a surface stress concentration or defect will typically result in a single “clam
shell” fingerprint ( Figure 4-52  to  Figure 4-56 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Cracks resulting from cyclical overstress of a component without significant stress concentration will
typically result in a fatigue failure with multiple points of nucleation and hence multiple “clam shell”
fingerprints. These multiple nucleation sites are the result of microscopic yielding that occurs when
the component is momentarily cycled above its yield strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The best defense against fatigue cracking is good design that helps minimize stress concentration of
components that are in cyclic service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Select a metal with a design fatigue life sufficient for its intended cyclic service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Allow for a generous radius along edges and corners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Minimize grinding marks, nicks and gouges on the surface of components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Insure good fit up and smooth transitions for welds. Minimize weld defects as these can accelerate
fatigue cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Remove any burrs or lips caused by machining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Use low stress stamps and marking tools.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.16.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
NDE techniques such as PT, MT and SWUT can be used to detect fatigue cracks at known areas of
stress concentration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
VT of small diameter piping to detect oscillation or other cyclical movement that could lead to
cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Vibration monitoring of rotating equipment to help detect shafts that may be out of balance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.17 Vibration-Induced Fatigue<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.17.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A form of mechanical fatigue in which cracks are produced as the result of dynamic loading due to
vibration, water hammer, or unstable fluid flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.17.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All engineering materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.17.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The amplitude and frequency of vibration as well as the fatigue resistance of the components are
critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
There is a high likelihood of cracking when the input load is synchronous or nearly synchronizes with
the natural frequency of the component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
A lack of or excessive support or stiffening allows vibration and possible cracking problems that
usually initiate at stress raisers or notches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.17.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Socket welds and small bore piping at or near pumps and compressors that are not sufficiently
gusseted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Small bore bypass lines and flow loops around rotating and reciprocating equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Small branch connections with unsupported valves or controllers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Safety relief valves are subject to chatter, premature pop-off, fretting and failure to operate properly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
High pressure drop control valves and steam reducing stations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Heat exchanger tubes may be susceptible to vortex shedding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.17.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Damage is usually in the form of a crack initiating at a point of high stress or discontinuity such as a
thread or weld joint ( Figure 4-57  and  Figure 4-58 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
A potential warning sign of vibration damage to refractories is the visible damage resulting from the
failure of the refractory and/or the anchoring system.  High skin temperatures may result from
refractory damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.17.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Vibration-induced fatigue can be eliminated or reduced through design and the use of supports and
vibration dampening equipment.  Material upgrades are not usually a solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Install gussets or stiffeners on small bore connections.  Eliminate unnecessary connections and
inspect field installations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Vortex shedding can be minimized at the outlet of control valves and safety valves through proper
side branch sizing and flow stabilization techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Vibration effects may be shifted when a vibrating section is anchored. Special studies may be
necessary before anchors or dampeners are provided, unless the vibration is eliminated by removing
the source.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.19 Reheat Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.19.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cracking of a metal due to stress relaxation during Post Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) or in service at
elevated temperatures above 750°F (399°C).  It is most often observed in heavy wall sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.19.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Low alloy steels, especially the Cr-Mo steels with vanadium added, as well as 300 Series SS and nickel
base alloys such as Alloy 800H.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.19.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Important parameters include the type of material (chemical composition, impurity elements), grain size,
residual stresses from fabrication (cold working, welding), section thickness (which controls restraint and
stress state), notches and stress concentrators, weld metal and base metal strength, welding and heat
treating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>From the various theories of reheat cracking for both 300 Series SS and low alloy steels, cracking
features are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Reheat cracking requires the presence of high stresses and is therefore more likely to occur in
thicker sections and higher strength materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Reheat cracking occurs at elevated temperatures when creep ductility is insufficient to accommodate
the strains required for the relief of applied or residual stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In the first half of 2008, numerous cases of reheat cracking occurred during 2 ¼ Cr-1 Mo-V reactor
fabrication. The cracks were in weld metal only, transverse to the welding direction, and in only SAW
welds. It was traced to a contaminant in the welding flux.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Reheat cracking can either occur during PWHT or in service at high temperature. In both cases,
cracks are intergranular and show little or no evidence of deformation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Fine intragranular precipitate particles make the grains stronger than the grain boundaries and force
the creep deformation to occur at the grain boundaries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Stress relief and stabilization heat treatment of 300 Series SS for maximizing chloride SCC and
PTASCC resistance can cause reheat cracking problems, particularly in thicker sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.19.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Reheat cracking is most likely to occur in heavy wall vessels in areas of high restraint including
nozzle welds and heavy wall piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
HSLA steels are very susceptible to reheat cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.19.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Reheat cracking is intergranular and can be surface breaking or embedded depending on the state
of stress and geometry.  It is most frequently observed in coarse-grained sections of a weld heat-
affected zone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In many cases, cracks are confined to the heat-affected zone, initiate at some type of stress
concentration, and may act as an initiation site for fatigue.  Figure 4-60  to   4-63 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.19.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Joint configurations in heavy wall sections should be designed to minimize restraint during welding
and PWHT.  Adequate preheat must also be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The grain size has an important influence on the high temperature ductility and on the reheat
cracking susceptibility. A large grain size results in less ductile heat-affected zones, making the
material more susceptible to reheat cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Metallurgical notches arising from the welding operation are frequently the cause of heat-affected
zone cracking (at the boundary between the weld and the heat-affected zone).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In design and fabrication, it is advisable to avoid sharp changes in cross section, such as short
radius fillets or undercuts that can give rise to stress concentrations.  Long-seam welds are
particularly susceptible to mismatch caused by fitup problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
For 2 ¼ Cr-1 Mo-V SAW weld materials, prequalification screening tests for reheat cracking such as
high temperature (650 o C) Gleeble tensile tests should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
For Alloy 800H, the risk of in-service cracking can be reduced by using base metal and matching
weld metal with Al+Ti <0.7%.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
For Alloy 800H which will operate >540 o C, the material may need to be purchased with a thermal
stabilization heat treatment, and with PWHT of welds and cold worked sections.  Welds should be
made with matching Alloy 800H filler material and should be stress relieved.  Refer to ASME Section
VIII, Div. 1 Code in UNF-56(e) for additional information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.20 Gaseous Oxygen-Enhanced Ignition and Combustion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.20.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many metals are flammable in oxygen and enriched air (>25% oxygen) services even at low pressures,
whereas they are non-flammable in air.  The spontaneous ignition or combustion of metallic and non-
metallic components can result in fires and explosions in certain oxygen-enriched gaseous environments
if not properly designed, operated and maintained.  Once ignited, metals and non-metals burn more
vigorously with higher oxygen purity, pressure and temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.20.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbon steels and low alloy steels are flammable in low pressure oxygen, greater than about 15 psig
(0.103 MPa). With special precautions, these materials are safely used in high pressure oxygen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Austenitic stainless steels (300 series) have better resistance to low pressure oxygen and are
generally difficult to ignite at pressures below about 200 psig (1.38 MPa).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Copper alloys (with >55% copper) and nickel alloys (with >50% nickel) are very fire resistant and are
generally considered non-flammable. Because of their excellent oxygen “compatibility” they are often
selected for impingement and turbulent services such as valves and instrumentation ( Figure 4-69 ).
Alloy 400 is highly resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Although widely used for oxygen cylinders and in oxygen manufacturing plants, aluminum is usually
avoided for flowing oxygen. If ignited it burns quickly and with a large energy release.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The easiest materials to ignite are plastics, rubbers, and hydrocarbon lubricants and these are
minimized in oxygen systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Titanium alloys are generally avoided in oxygen and oxygen-enriched service because they have low
ignition energies and release a large amount of energy during combustion. Tests indicate that
titanium can sustain combustion at oxygen pressure as low as 7 kPa (1 psi) absolute.  Most industry
documents caution against the use of titanium in oxygen systems (References 6 and 7).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note:  These are general guidelines and should not be considered for design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.20.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Many factors affect the likelihood of combustion and ignition in oxygen services including the system
pressure, oxygen content of the stream, line velocity, component thickness, design and piping
configuration, cleanliness and temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The primary concern under high velocity oxygen flow conditions is the entrainment of particulate and
their subsequent impingement on a surface, such as at a pipe bend. Oxygen velocities in carbon
steel and stainless steel piping should comply with industry limits as shown in Reference 1.
Allowable velocity is a function of pressure and flow condition (direct impingement or non-
impingement).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The temperature of a material affects its flammability.  As temperature increases, a lower amount of
additional energy is required for ignition and sustained combustion. The minimum temperature at
which a substance will support combustion, under a specific set of conditions is referred to as the
ignition temperature. Published ignition temperatures for most alloys are near the alloy’s melting
temperature. However, these are measured in non-flowing conditions. Actual systems can suffer
ignition and combustion at room temperature (and lower) due to particle impact and other
mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
System cleanliness is important for the safe operation of oxygen systems.  Contamination of with
metallic fines or hydrocarbons such as oils and greases during construction or maintenance activities
can lead to fires during subsequent start up of the unit.  These materials are easy to ignite and can
lead to a large fire and breach of the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API Recommended Practice 571
_____________________________________________________________________________________________<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Impingement areas such as sharp elbows, tees and valves have a higher risk of ignition than straight
pipe. Particles in the flowing oxygen can strike these areas and cause ignition. Operation of valves
and regulators (opening / closing) cause high turbulence and impingement and only components
selected and cleaned specifically for oxygen service should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.20.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
These guidelines apply to any unit that uses oxygen or enriched air for combustion or other process
reasons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Oxygen is sometimes used in sulfur recovery units (SRU) and fluid catalytic cracking units (FCCU),
Gasification, and Partial Oxidation (POX) units.   Figures 4-64  to  4-66 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Oxygen piping systems especially valves, regulators, and other impingement areas are potentially
vulnerable. Non-metals such as those used for seats and seals, are easier to ignite than metals
( Figure 4-69 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.20.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
In some cases a small component will burn, such as a valve seat, without kindling other materials
and without any outward sign of fire damage. It is noticed when the component is removed because
it is not functioning properly.  Figure 4-67  to  4-68 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Also, external heat damage (glowing pipe or heat tint) is a strong indication of an internal fire. This
can be caused by accumulation of flammable debris at a low point or other location and combustion
or smoldering of the debris.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The worst situation is when the pressure envelope is breached because of fire. Oxygen fires can
cause significant burning of metal components and extensive structural damage ( Figure 4-68 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.20.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Refer to industry recommended guidelines included in the references listed below.  Some general
considerations are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Oxygen fires are a sudden occurrence and not a progressive degradation or weakening of the
material. Prevention is best accomplished be keeping systems clean, or cleaning them after
maintenance or inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Maintain velocity within recommended limits.  If practical, avoid velocities that are nominally above
100 feet/second (30 m/sec) in gaseous oxygen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Ensure that replacement components are suitable for oxygen service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Oxygen systems should be thoroughly cleaned after maintenance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Minimize lubricants and use only “oxygen compatible” lubricants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Do not unnecessarily open oxygen systems for visual or other inspections as this could introduce
contamination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
A thorough review is needed before modifying oxygen systems to operate at higher pressures,
temperatures, or velocities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Minimize sudden changes in pressure in the system.  If high pressure oxygen suddenly enters a
system initially at low pressure by quick operation of a valve, the “dead end” of that system
experiences heating from adiabatic compression of the oxygen. Adiabatic compression heating can
ignite plastics and rubbers, but will not ignite metals. Valve seats, seals, non-metallic hoses, etc can
be ignited by this mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Do not use plastic pipe in oxygen piping systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
Personnel activities near oxygen piping and systems should be minimized during start ups.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Most commercial oxygen is dry and non-corrosive at normal ambient temperatures.  Because of the
sudden catastrophic ignition of metals under certain conditions this type of damage is difficult to
inspect for in advance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Tell-tale signs of a minor fire such as external heat damage, or signs of malfunctioning valves or
other components containing non-metallic components may be indicative of a problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Blacklights can be used to check for hydrocarbon contamination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 4-67 – Photograph of a burned 304 SS elbow. The fire started in an upstream stainless steel
wire filter (due to particle impact) and the burning filter material impacted the elbow and ignited it.
Thin stainless steel components (e.g., filter) are much more flammable than thicker SS. Thin SS
(<1/8”) is usually avoided in oxygen systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Uniform or Localized Loss of Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1
Galvanic Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A form of corrosion that can occur at the junction of dissimilar metals when they are joined together in a
suitable electrolyte, such as a moist or aqueous environment, or soils containing moisture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.2
Affected Material<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All metals with the exception of most noble metals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For galvanic corrosion, three conditions must be met:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Presence of an electrolyte, a fluid that can conduct a current.  Moisture or a separate water
phase is usually required for the solution to have enough conductivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Two different materials or alloys known as the anode and the cathode, in contact with an
electrolyte.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
An electrical connection must exist between the anode and the cathode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The more noble material (cathode) is protected by sacrificial corrosion of the more active material
(anode). The anode corrodes at a higher rate than it would if it were not connected to the cathode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
A typical listing of the relative position of alloys in seawater is shown in  Table 4-6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The farther the alloys are apart in the table, the higher the driving force for corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The relative exposed surface areas between anodic material and the cathodic material has a
significant affect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Corrosion rates of the anode can be high, if there is a small anode to cathode ratio.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Corrosion rates of the anode will be less affected if there is a large anode to cathode ratio.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
If there is a galvanic couple, the more noble material may need to be coated. If the active
material were coated, a large cathode to anode area can accelerate corrosion of the anode at
any breaks in the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
The same alloy may act as both an anode and a cathode due to surface films, scale, and/or
local environment (for example, old steel pipe connected to new steel pipe).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Galvanic corrosion can occur in any unit where there is a conductive fluid and alloys are coupled.
Heat exchangers are susceptible if the tube material is different from the tubesheet and/or baffles,
particularly if salt water cooling is utilized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Buried pipelines, electrical transmission support towers and ship hulls are typical locations for
galvanic corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Damage occurs where two materials are joined at welded or bolted connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The more active material can suffer generalized loss in thickness or may have the appearance of a
crevice, groove or pitting corrosion, depending on the driving force, conductivity and relative
anodic/cathodic areas ratio.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion of the anode may be significantly higher immediately adjacent to the connection to the
cathode, depending on solution conductivity ( Figure 4-70  and  Figure 4-71 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The best method for prevention/mitigation is through good design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Differing alloys should not be in intimate contact in conductive environments unless the
anode/cathode surface area ratio is favorable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Coatings can be helpful, but the more noble material should be coated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
For piping, specially designed electric insulating bolt sleeves and gaskets can eliminate the electrical
connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Galvanic corrosion is the principle used in galvanized steel, where the Zn corrodes preferentially to
protect the underlying carbon steel.  (If there is a break in the galvanized coating, a large anode to
small cathode area prevents accelerated corrosion of the steel).  This anode-to-cathode relationship
reverses at water temperatures over about 150°F (66°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Visual inspection and UT thickness gauging are very effective methods for detecting galvanic corrosion.
The damage may sometimes be hidden underneath a bolt or rivet head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2
Atmospheric Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A form of corrosion that occurs from moisture associated with atmospheric conditions.  Marine
environments and moist polluted industrial environments with airborne contaminants are most severe. Dry
rural environments cause very little corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel, low alloy steels and copper alloyed aluminum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Critical factors include the physical location (industrial, marine, rural); moisture (humidity), particularly
designs that trap moisture or when present in a cooling tower mist; temperature; presence of salts,
sulfur compounds and dirt.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Marine environments can be very corrosive (20 mpy) as are industrial environments that contain
acids or sulfur compounds that can form acids (5-10 mpy).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Inland locations exposed to a moderate amount of precipitation or humidity are considered
moderately corrosive environments (~1-3 mpy).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Dry rural environments usually have very low corrosion rates (<1 mpy).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Designs that trap water or moisture in crevices are more prone to attack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Corrosion rates increase with temperature up to about 250°F (121°C).  Above 250°F (121°C),
surfaces are usually too dry for corrosion to occur except under insulation (see  4.3.3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Chlorides, H 2 S, fly ash and other airborne contaminates from cooling tower drift, furnace stacks and
other equipment accelerate corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Bird turds can also cause accelerated corrosion and unsightly stains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Piping and equipment with operating temperatures sufficiently low to allow moisture to be present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
A paint or coating system in poor condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Equipment may be susceptible if cycled between ambient and higher or lower operating
temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Equipment shut down or idled for prolonged periods unless properly mothballed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Tanks and piping are particularly susceptible.  Piping that rests on pipe supports is very prone to
attack due to water entrapment between the pipe and the support.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Orientation to the prevailing wind and rain can also be a factor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Piers and docks are very prone to attack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Bimetallic connections such as copper to aluminum electrical connections<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The attack will be general or localized, depending upon whether or not the moisture is trapped.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
If there is no coating, corrosion or loss in thickness can be general.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Localized coating failures will tend to promote corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion of piping, pressure vessels and structural components resulting from water trapped under
insulation or fireproofing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel, low alloy steels, 300 Series SS, and duplex stainless steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
It affects externally insulated piping and equipment and those that are in intermittent service or
operate between:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
10°F (–12°C) and 350°F (175°C) for carbon and low alloy steels,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
140 º F (60°C) and 400 º F (205°C) for austenitic stainless steels and duplex stainless steels<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion rates increase with increasing metal temperature up to the point where the water
evaporates quickly.  For insulated components, corrosion becomes more severe at metal
temperatures between the boiling point 212°F (100°C) and 350°F (121°C), where water is less likely
to vaporize and insulation stays wet longer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Design of insulation system, insulation type, temperature and environment are critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Poor design and/or installations that allow water to become trapped will increase CUI.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Insulating materials that hold moisture (wick) can be more of a problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Cyclic thermal operation or intermittent service can increase corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Equipment that operates below the water dewpoint tends to condense water on the metal surface
thus providing a wet environment and increasing the risk of corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Damage is aggravated by contaminants that may be leached out of the insulation, such as chlorides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Plants located in areas with high annual rainfall or warmer, marine locations are more prone to CUI
than plants located in cooler, drier, mid-continent locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
Environments that provide airborne contaminants such as chlorides (marine environments, cooling
tower drift) or SO 2  (stack emissions) can accelerate corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All insulated piping and equipment are susceptible to CUI under conditions noted above even on
piping and equipment where the insulation system appears to be in good condition and no visual
signs of corrosion are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Examples of locations where CUI can occur are listed below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
CUI can be found on equipment with damaged insulation, vapor barriers, weatherproofing or
mastic, or protrusions through the insulation or at insulation termination points such as flanges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Equipment designed with insulation support rings welded directly to the vessel wall (no
standoff); particularly around ladder and platform clips, and lifting lugs, nozzles and stiffener
rings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Piping or equipment with damaged/leaking steam tracing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Localized damage at paint and/or coating systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Locations where moisture/water will naturally collect (gravity drainage) before evaporating
(insulation support rings on vertical equipment) and improperly terminated fireproofing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>18)  Carbon or low-alloy steel ﬂanges, bolting, and other components under insulation in high-alloy
piping systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>19) Locations  where  insulation  plugs  have  been  removed  to permit  piping  thickness
measurements on  insulated  piping and equipment should  receive  particular  attention.  These
plugs should be promptly replaced and sealed.  Several types of removable plugs are
commercially available that permit inspection and identiﬁcation of inspection points for future
reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>20) The first few feet of a horizontal pipe run adjacent to the bottom of a vertical run.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbon and low alloy steels are subject to localized pitting corrosion and or localized loss in
thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
300 Series SS are also subject to Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) if chlorides are present, while
the duplex SS are less susceptible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
300 Series SS and duplex SS are subject to pitting and localized corrosion.  For 300 Series SS,
specifically in older calcium silicate insulation (known to contain chlorides), localized pitting and
chloride stress corrosion cracking can occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
After insulation is removed from carbon and low alloy steels, CUI damage often appears as loose,
flaky scale covering the corroded component.  Damage may be highly localized ( Figure 4-73  to  4-
79 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
In some localized cases, the corrosion can appear to be carbuncle type pitting (usually found under a
failed paint/coating system).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Tell tale signs of insulation and paint/coating damage often accompany CUI.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Since the majority of construction materials used in plants are susceptible to CUI degradation,
mitigation is best achieved by using appropriate paints/coatings and maintaining the
insulation/sealing/vapor barriers to prevent moisture ingress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Flame-sprayed aluminum coatings have been used on carbon steels.  The coating corrodes
preferentially by galvanic action, thereby protecting the base metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
High quality non-metallic coatings, properly applied to the surfaces to be insulated can provide long
term protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Thin aluminum foil wrapped on stainless steel piping and equipment has been used on stainless
steels as an effective barrier under insulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Careful selection of insulating materials is important. Closed-cell foam glass materials will hold less
water against the vessel/pipe wall than mineral wool and potentially be less corrosive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Low chloride insulation should be used on 300 Series SS to minimize the potential for pitting and
chloride SCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
It is not usually possible to modify operating conditions.  However, consideration should be given to
removing the insulation on equipment where heat conservation is not as important.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
An inspection plan for corrosion under insulation should be a structured and systematic approach
starting with prediction/analysis, then looking at the more invasive procedures. The inspection plan
should consider operating temperature; type and age/condition of coating; and type and
age/condition of insulation material.  Additional prioritization can be added from a physical inspection
of the equipment, looking for evidence of insulation, mastic and/or sealant damage, signs of water
penetration and rust in gravity drain areas around the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Although external insulation may appear to be in good condition, CUI damage may still be occurring.
CUI inspection may require removal of some or all insulation. If external coverings are in good
condition and there is no reason to suspect damage behind them, it may not be necessary to remove
them for inspection of the vessel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Considerations for insulation removal are not limited to but include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
History of CUI for the vessel or comparable equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Visual condition of the external covering and insulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Evidence of fluid leakage, e.g. stains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Equipment in intermittent service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Condition/age of the external coating, if applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Common areas of concern in process units are high moisture areas such as those down-wind from
cooling towers, near steam vents, deluge systems, acid vapors, or near supplemental cooling with
water spray.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
When developing the inspection plan for CUI inspection, the inspector should consider<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Areas that are most susceptible to CUI.  If CUI damage is found, the inspector should inspect
other susceptible areas on the vessel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Utilize multiple inspection techniques to produce the most cost effective approach, including:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Partial and/or full stripping of insulation for visual examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
UT for thickness verification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Real-time profile x-ray (for small bore piping).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Neutron backscatter techniques for identifying wet insulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Deep penetrating eddy-current inspection (can be automated with a robotic crawler).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4
Cooling Water Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>General or localized corrosion of carbon steels and other metals caused by dissolved salts, gases,
organic compounds or microbiological activity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel, all grades of stainless steel, copper, aluminum, titanium and nickel base alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cooling water corrosion and fouling are closely related and should be considered together. Fluid
temperature, type of water (fresh, brackish, salt water) and the type of cooling system (once-through,
open circulating, closed circulating), oxygen content, and fluid velocities are critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Increasing cooling water outlet temperatures and or process side inlet temperatures tend to increase
corrosion rates as well as fouling tendency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Increasing oxygen content tends to increase carbon steel corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
If the process side temperature is above 140°F (60°C), a scaling potential exists with fresh water and
becomes more likely as process temperatures increase and as cooling water inlet temperatures rise.
Brackish and salt water outlet temperatures above about 115°F (46°C) may cause serious scaling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Fouling may occur from mineral deposits (hardness), silt, suspended organic materials, corrosion
products, mill scale, marine and microbiological growth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Velocities should be high enough to minimize fouling and drop out of deposits but not so high as to
cause erosion.  Velocity limits depend on the tube material and water quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Low velocities can promote increased corrosion.  Velocities below about 3 fps (1 m/s) are likely to
result in fouling, sedimentation and increased corrosion in fresh and brackish water systems.
Accelerated corrosion can also result from dead spots or stagnant areas if cooling water is used on
the shell side of condensers/coolers rather than the preferred tube side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
300 Series SS can suffer pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion and SCC in fresh, brackish and salt
water systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Copper/zinc alloys can suffer dezincification in fresh, brackish and salt water systems.  The
copper/zinc alloys can suffer SCC if any ammonia or ammonium compounds are present in the
water or on the process side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
ERW carbon steel may suffer severe weld and/or heated affected zone corrosion in fresh and/or
brackish water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k)
When connected to a more anodic material, titanium may suffer severe hydriding embrittlement.
Generally, the problem occurs at temperatures above 180°F (82°C) but can occur at lower
temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Cooling water corrosion is a concern with water-cooled heat exchangers and cooling towers in all
applications across all industries.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cooling water corrosion can result in many different forms of damage including general corrosion,
pitting corrosion ( Figure 4-81 ), MIC, stress corrosion cracking and fouling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
General or uniform corrosion of carbon steel occurs when dissolved oxygen is present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Localized corrosion may result from underdeposit corrosion, crevice corrosion or microbiological
corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Deposits or crevices can lead to underdeposit or crevice corrosion of any of the affected materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Wavy or smooth corrosion at nozzle inlets/outlets and tube inlets may be due to flow induced
corrosion, erosion or abrasion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Corrosion at ERW weld areas will appear as grooving along the weld fusion lines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Metallurgical analysis of tube samples may be required to confirm the mode of failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cooling water corrosion (and fouling) can be prevented by proper design, operation and chemical
treatment of cooling water systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Design for process side inlet temperatures below 140°F (60°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Minimum and maximum water velocities must maintained, particularly in salt water systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The metallurgy of heat exchanger components may need to be upgraded for improved resistance,
especially in waters with high chloride content, low velocity, high process temperatures, and/or
poorly maintained water chemistry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Periodic mechanical cleaning of tube ID’s and OD’s should be performed in order to maintain clean
heat transfer surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
With very few exceptions, cooling water should be on the tube side to minimize stagnant areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.4.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cooling water should be monitored for variables that affect corrosion and fouling including, pH,
oxygen content, cycles of concentration, biocide residual, biological activity, cooling water outlet
temperatures, hydrocarbon contamination and process leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Periodic calculation of U-factors (heat exchanger performance measurement) will provide information
on scaling and fouling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Ultrasonic flow meters can be used to check the velocity of water in the tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
EC or IRIS inspection of tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Boiler Water Condensate Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.5.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>General corrosion and pitting in the boiler system and condensate return piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.5.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Primarily carbon steel, some low alloy steel, some 300 Series SS and copper based alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.5.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion in boiler feedwater and condensate return systems is usually the result of dissolved gases,
oxygen and carbon dioxide, which lead to oxygen pitting corrosion and carbonic acid corrosion,
respectivley.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Critical factors are the concentration of dissolved gas (oxygen and or carbon dioxide), pH,
temperature, quality of the feedwater, and the specific feedwater treating system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion protection in the boiler is accomplished by laying down and continuously maintaining a
layer of protective Fe 3 O 4  (magnetite).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The chemical treatment for scale and deposit control must be adjusted to coordinate with the oxygen
scavenger for the specific water service and boiler feedwater treating system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Ammonia SCC of Cu-Zn alloys can occur due to hydrazine, neutralizing amines or ammonia-
containing compounds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.5.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion can occur in the external treatment system, deaerating equipment, feedwater lines, pumps,
stage heaters and economizers as well as the steam generation system on both the water and fire sides
and the condensate return system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.5.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion from oxygen tends to be a pitting type damage and can show up anywhere in the system
even if only very small quantities break through the scavenging treatment.  Oxygen is particularly
aggressive in equipment such as closed heaters and economizers where there is a rapid water
temperature rise ( Figure 4-82 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion in the condensate return system tends to be due to carbon dioxide although some oxygen
pitting problems can occur if the oxygen scavenging treatment is not working correctly.  Carbon
dioxide corrosion tends to be a smooth grooving of the pipe wall ( Figures 4-83  and  4-84 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.5.6
Prevention/Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Oxygen scavenging treatments typically include catalyzed sodium sulfite or hydrazine depending on
the system pressure level along with proper mechanical deaerator operation.  A residual of the
oxygen scavenger is carried into the steam generation system to handle any oxygen ingress past the
deaerator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
If the scale/deposit control/magnetite maintenance treatment scheme does not minimize carbon
dioxide in the condensate return system, an amine inhibitor treatment might be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.5.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Water analysis is the common monitoring tool used to assure that the various treatment systems are
performing in a satisfactory manner.  Parameters which can be monitored for signs of upset include
the pH, conductivity, chlorine or residual biocide, and total dissolved solids to check for leaks in the
form of organic compounds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

CO 2  Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.6.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) corrosion results when CO 2  dissolves in water to form carbonic acid (H 2 CO 3 ).  The
acid may lower the pH and sufficient quantities may promote general corrosion and/or pitting corrosion of
carbon steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.6.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel and low alloy steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.6.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The partial pressure of CO 2 , pH and temperature are critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Increasing partial pressures of CO 2  result in lower pH condensate and higher rates of corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion occurs in the liquid phase, often at locations where CO 2  condenses from the vapor phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Increasing temperatures increase corrosion rate up to the point where CO 2  is vaporized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Increasing the level of chromium in steels offers no major improvement in resistance until a minimum
of  12% is reached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.6.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Boiler feedwater and condensate systems in all units are affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Effluent gas streams of the shift converters in hydrogen plants can be affected. Corrosion usually
occurs when the effluent stream drops below the dew point, approximately 300°F (149°C). Corrosion
rates as high as 1000 mpy have been observed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Overhead systems of regenerators in CO 2  removal plants are affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.6.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Localized thinning and/or pitting corrosion of carbon steel ( Figure 4-85 ,  Figure 4-86  and  Figure 4-87 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Carbon steel may suffer deep pitting and grooving in areas of turbulence ( Figure 4-88 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion generally occurs in areas of turbulence and impingement and sometimes at the root of
piping welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.6.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion inhibitors can reduce corrosion in steam condensate systems. Vapor phase inhibitors may
be required to protect against condensing vapors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Increasing condensate pH above 6 can reduce corrosion in steam condensate systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The 300 Series SS are highly resistant to corrosion in most applications. Selective upgrading to
stainless steels is usually required in operating units designed to produce and/or remove CO 2  (such
as hydrogen plants and CO 2  removal units).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Steam condensate systems that experience CO 2  corrosion are usually the result of operating
problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
400 Series SS and duplex SS are also resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.6.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.7
Flue-Gas Dew-Point Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.7.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Sulfur and chlorine species in fuel will form sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide and hydrogen chloride within
the combustion products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
At low enough temperatures, these gases and the water vapor in the flue gas will condense to form
sulfurous acid, sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid which can lead to severe corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.7.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel, low alloy steels and 300 Series SS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.7.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The concentration of contaminants (sulfur and chlorides) in the fuel and the operating temperature of
flue gas metal surfaces determine the likelihood and severity of corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Since all fuels contain some amount of sulfur, sulfuric and sulfurous acid dewpoint corrosion can
occur if the metal temperatures are below the dewpoint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The dewpoint of sulfuric acid depends on the concentration of sulfur trioxide in the flue gas, but is
typically about 280°F (138°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Similarly, the dewpoint of hydrochloric acid depends on the concentration of hydrogen chloride. It is
typically about 130°F (54°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.7.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All fired process heaters and boilers that burn fuels containing sulfur have the potential for sulfuric
acid dewpoint corrosion in the economizer sections and in the stacks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Heat-Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG’s) that have 300 Series SS feedwater heaters may suffer
chloride-induced stress corrosion cracking from the gas side (OD) when the temperature of the inlet
water is below the dewpoint of hydrochloric acid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
300 Series SS feedwater heaters in HRSG’s are potentially at risk if the atmosphere of the
combustion turbine includes chlorine.  Cooling tower drift from cooling towers that use chlorine-
based biocides may blow into the combustion turbine and lead to potential damage in the feedwater
heaters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.7.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Sulfuric acid corrosion on economizers or other carbon steel or low alloy steel components will have
general wastage often with broad, shallow pits, depending on the way the sulfuric acid condenses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
For the 300 Series SS feedwater heaters in HRSG’s, stress corrosion cracking will have surface
breaking cracks and the general appearance will be somewhat crazed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.7.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Maintain the metallic surfaces at the back end of the boilers and fired heaters above the temperature
of sulfuric acid dewpoint corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
For HRSG’s, avoid the use of 300 Series SS in the feedwater heaters if the environment is likely to
contain chlorides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Similar damage occurs in oil-fired boilers when the units are water-washed to remove ash if the final
rinse does not neutralize the acid salts.  Sodium carbonate should be added to the final rinse as a
basic solution to neutralize the acidic ash constituents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8
Microbiologically Induced Corrosion (MIC)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A form of corrosion caused by living organisms such as bacteria, algae or fungi. It is often associated with
the presence of tubercles or slimy organic substances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Most common materials of construction including carbon and low alloy steels, 300 Series SS and 400
Series SS, aluminum, copper and some nickel base alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
MIC is usually found in aqueous environments or services where water is always or sometimes
present, especially where stagnant or low-flow conditions allow and/or promote the growth of
microorganisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Because there are several types, organisms can survive and grow under severe conditions including
lack of oxygen, light or dark, high salinity, pH range of  0 to 12, and temperatures from 0°F to 235°F
(–17°C to 113°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Systems may become “inoculated” by the introduction of organisms that multiply and spread unless
controlled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Different organisms thrive on different nutrients including inorganic substances (e.g., sulfur,
ammonia, H 2 S) and inorganic substances (e.g., hydrocarbons, organic acids).  In addition, all
organisms require a source of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous for growth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
In-leakage of process contaminants such as hydrocarbons or H 2 S may lead to a massive increase in
biofouling and corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
MIC is most often found in heat exchangers, bottom water of storage tanks, piping with stagnant or
low flow, and piping in contact with some soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
MIC is also found in equipment where the hydrotest water has not been removed or equipment has
been  left outside and unprotected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Product storage tanks and water cooled heat exchangers in any unit where cooling water is not
properly treated can be affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Fire water systems can be affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
MIC corrosion is usually observed as localized pitting under deposits or tubercles that shield the
organisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Damage is often characterized by cup-shaped pits within pits in carbon steel or subsurface cavities
in stainless steel ( Figure 4-89  through  Figure 4-95 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Microbes require water to thrive. Systems that contain water (cooling water, storage tanks, etc.)
should be treated with biocides such as chlorine, bromine, ozone, ultraviolet light or proprietary
compounds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Proper application of biocides will control but not eliminate microbes so that continued treatment is
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Maintain flow velocities above minimum levels. Minimize low flow or stagnant zones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Systems that are not designed or intended for water containment should be kept clean and dry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Empty hydrotest water as soon as possible. Blow dry and prevent moisture intrusion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Wrapping and cathodically protecting underground structures have been effective in preventing MIC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Effective mitigation of established organisms requires complete removal of deposits and organisms
using a combination of pigging, blasting, chemical cleaning and biocide treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Add biocides to water phase in storage tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Maintain coatings on the interior of storage tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
In cooling water systems, effectiveness of treatment is monitored by measuring biocide residual,
microbe counts and visual appearance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Special probes have been designed to monitor for evidence of fouling which may precede or
coincide with MIC damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Soil Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.9.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The deterioration of metals exposed to soils is referred to as soil corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.9.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel, cast iron and ductile iron.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.9.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The severity of soil corrosion is determined by many factors including operating temperature,
moisture and oxygen availability, soil resistivity (soil condition and characteristics), soil type (water
drainage), and homogeneity (variation in soil type), cathodic protection, stray current drainage,
coating type, age, and condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
There is no single parameter that can be used to determine soil corrosivity.  Instead, a number of
characteristics must be combined to estimate the corrosion in particular soil as outlined in ASTM
STP 741 as well as API RP 580 and API RPl 581.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Soil resistivity is frequently used to estimate soil corrosivity, mainly because it is easy to measure.
Soil resistivity is related to soil moisture content and dissolved electrolytes in the soil water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Soils having high moisture content, high dissolved salt concentrations, and high acidity are usually
the most corrosive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Soil-to-air interface areas are often much more susceptible to corrosion than the rest of the structure
because of moisture and oxygen availability ( Figure 4-96 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Corrosion rates increase with increasing metal temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Other factors that affect soil corrosion include galvanic corrosion, dissimilar soils, stray currents,
differential aeration corrosion cells, and microbiologically induced corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.9.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Underground piping and equipment as well as buried tanks and the bottoms of above ground
storage tanks ( Figure 4-97 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Ground supported metal structures ( Figure 4-98 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.9.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Soil corrosion appears as external thinning with localized losses due to pitting. The severity of
corrosion depends on the local soil conditions and changes in the immediate environment along the
equipment metal surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Poor condition of a protective coating is a tell tale sign of potential corrosion damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.9.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Soil corrosion of carbon steel can be minimized through the use of special backfill, coatings and cathodic
protection. The most effective protection is a combination of a corrosion resistant coating and a cathodic
protection system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.9.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The most common method used for monitoring underground structures is measuring the structure to
soil potential using dedicated reference electrodes near the structure (corrected for IR drop error).
Cathodic protection should be performed and monitored in accordance with NACE RP 0169.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10 Caustic Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Localized corrosion due to the concentration of caustic or alkaline salts that usually occurs under
evaporative or high heat transfer conditions.  However, general corrosion can also occur depending on
alkali or caustic solution strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Primarily carbon steel, low alloy steels and 300 Series SS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Major contributing factors are the presence of caustic (NaOH or KOH). The following are sources of
caustic:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Caustic is sometimes added to process streams for neutralization or as a reactant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
It is sometimes intentionally added to boiler feedwater at low concentrations or may enter
inadvertently during regeneration of demineralizers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Alkaline salts may also enter process streams through leaks in condensers or process equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Some process units utilize caustic solutions for neutralizing, for removal of sulfur compounds, or for
removal of chloride compounds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
A concentrating mechanism must exist to build up the caustic strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Caustic may become concentrated by departure from DNB, evaporation and deposition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Caustic corrosion is most often associated with boilers and steam generating equipment including
heat exchangers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Similar concentrating effects of caustic may occur where caustic is added to crude unit charge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Accelerated localized corrosion can occur in preheat exchangers, furnace tubes and transfer lines,
unless the caustic is effectively mixed in the oil stream.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Units that use caustic for removing sulfur compounds from product streams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Typically characterized by localized metal loss which may appear as grooves in a boiler tube or
locally thinned areas under insulating deposits ( Figure 4-99  and  Figure 4-100 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Deposits may fill corroded depressions and mask damage below.  Probing suspect areas with a
sharp instrument may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Localized gouging may result along a waterline where corrosives concentrate.  In vertical tubes, this
may appear as a circumferential groove.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In horizontal or sloped tubes, grooving may appear at the top of the tube or as longitudinal grooves
on opposite sides of the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Exposure to high solution strength caustic can result in general corrosion of carbon steel above
175°F (79°C) and very high corrosion rates above 200°F (93°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
In steam generating equipment, caustic corrosion is best prevented through proper design.  Damage
can be minimized by reducing the amount of free caustic, by ensuring adequate water flooding and
water flow, by ensuring proper burner management to minimize hot spots on heater tubes, and by
minimizing the ingress of alkaline producing salts into condensers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In process equipment, caustic injection facilities should be designed to allow proper mixing and
dilution of caustic in order to avoid the concentration of caustic on hot metal surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Carbon steel and 300 Series SS have serious corrosion problems in high strength caustic solutions
above about 150°F (66°C).  Alloy 400 and some other nickel base alloys exhibit much lower
corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For process equipment, UT thickness gauging is useful to detect and monitor general corrosion due
to caustic. However, localized losses due to caustic corrosion may be difficult to locate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Injection points should be inspected in accordance with API 570.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
UT scans and radiography can be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Steam generation equipment may require visual inspection with the use a boroscope.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Caustic corrosion is also referred to as caustic gouging or ductile gouging.  A related mechanism is
known as Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB) as discussed in steam blanketing (See  4.2.11 ).<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.11 Dealloying<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.11.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Dealloying is a selective corrosion mechanism in which one or more constituents of an alloy are
preferentially attacked leaving a lower density (dealloyed) often porous structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Component failure may occur suddenly and unexpectedly because mechanical properties of the
dealloyed material are significantly degraded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.11.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Primarily copper alloys (brass, bronze, tin) as well as Alloy 400 and cast iron.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.11.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Factors which influence dealloying include the composition of the alloy and exposure conditions
including temperature, degree of aeration, pH and exposure time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Dealloying occurs with several different alloys but is usually limited to very specific alloy-environment
combinations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Exact conditions under which dealloying occurs are often hard to define and damage may occur
progressively over many years in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Common examples of where dealloying has been found to occur are listed in  Table 4-7 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.11.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Underground cast iron piping when exposed to certain soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In cooling water applications, heat exchanger tubing (brass, Al brass) is susceptible to dealloying in
some brackish and seawater applications but often the tubesheets suffer significant damage.
Problems may also occur in some fresh or domestic water systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Boiler feedwater piping systems and afterboiler components may suffer dealloying including bronze
pumps, Monel strainers and brass pressure gage fittings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.11.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
There is often a significant color change or a deep etched (corroded) appearance as one element is
removed from the alloy.  However, depending on the alloy, the outward appearance of the affected
material may not be noticeable upon visual inspection, even where the full wall thickness is
degraded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Attack may be uniform through the cross-section (layer-type) or it can be localized (plug-type)
( Figure 4-101  and  Figure 4-102 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In some cases, the original material is completely dealloyed yet the component exhibits virtually no
dimensional or other visible changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.11.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
It is often difficult to predict whether conditions will be conducive to dealloying in a particular
environment or service, so that one must be cognizant of the susceptibility of certain alloys, and the
possible resulting consequences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Resistance to dealloying can sometimes be improved by the addition of certain alloying elements so
that a similar alloy with a different composition may be resistant.  For example, tin tends to inhibit
dealloying of copper alloys; admiralty brass is inhibited by the addition of a very small amount of
phosphorous, antimony or arsenic; and dealuminification of aluminum-bronze can be prevented by
heat treatment to produce an  α  and  β  microstructure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Continued degradation of a dealloyed component can only be prevented by altering the exposure
conditions or replacing it with a resistant material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Depending on the alloy-environment combination, cathodic protection or barrier coatings may be
effective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.11.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Many alloys change color in the affected area, however, scale removal may be required to determine
the depth of attack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Dealloying in brasses is visually evident by a reddish, copper color instead of the yellow brass color.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Metallographic examination may be required to confirm the extent of damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
A significant reduction in hardness may accompany dealloying, although affected areas may be
localized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Acoustic techniques (loss of “metallic ring”) and ultrasonic attenuation are applicable, but UT
thickness measurements are not.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Fitness-For-Service (FFS) analysis of dealloyed components should consider that the dealloyed
portion may be brittle and contribute little or no mechanical strength or load bearing capability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.11.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Dealloying is often referred to by the element removed, as in dezincification, destannification,
denickelification, dealuminification and graphitic corrosion.  Dealloying has also been referred to as
selective leaching.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Graphitic corrosion affects cast irons and is further described in  4.3.12 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.12 Graphitic Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.12.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cast irons are comprised of graphite particles embedded in an iron matrix. Graphitic corrosion is a
form of dealloying in which the iron matrix is corroded, leaving corrosion products and porous
graphite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Attack results in a porous structure with a loss of strength, ductility and density.  It usually occurs
under low pH and stagnant conditions, especially in contact with soils or waters high in sulfates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.12.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Primarily gray cast iron, but also nodular and malleable cast irons experience graphitic corrosion.
However, nodular and malleable cast irons tend to crumble when attacked.  White iron is not subject to
this damage because there is no free graphite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.12.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Graphitic corrosion occurs with several different cast iron alloys but is usually limited to very specific
microstructure-environment combinations.  Factors that influence graphitic corrosion include the
composition of the alloy and exposure conditions including temperature, degree of aeration, pH and
exposure time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Damage occurs in the presence of moisture or an aqueous phase, usually below 200°F (93°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Damage may take many months or years to progress but can increase in severity if the pH drops.
Much of the damage occurs during stagnant conditions when high concentrations of sulfates are
present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Graphite is cathodic to the iron matrix.  The iron matrix preferentially corrodes and cathodically
protects the graphite in certain conductive waters or soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Graphitic corrosion may affect adjacent components by causing galvanic corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.12.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Graphitic corrosion can occur in soft water, salt water, mine waters, dilute acids and in underground
piping as well as in boiler feedwater equipment.  Typical examples include feedwater piping, pumps
(including pump impellers), valves, and underground cast iron pipe. Fire water systems are particularly
vulnerable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.12.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Damage may be widespread or it may also occur in localized areas in which the majority of the
component is unaffected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The damage may not be noticeable upon visual inspection even where the full wall thickness is
degraded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Damaged areas will be soft and easily gouged with a knife or hand tool.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Metallographic examination may be required to confirm the extent of damage ( Figure 4-103  through
Figure 4-110 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.12.6
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
UT is not a good method for detecting damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Acoustic techniques (loss of “metallic ring”) and ultrasonic attenuation are applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
A significant reduction in hardness may accompany dealloying, although affected areas may be
localized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.12.7
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
It is often difficult to predict if exposure conditions will cause this form of dealloying in a particular
environment or service. One must be aware of the potential susceptibility of cast irons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Internal graphitic corrosion can be prevented by coatings and/or cement linings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
External graphitic corrosion can be prevented by external coatings or cathodic protection in severely
corrosive soils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.12.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Also known as selective leaching, graphitic corrosion is a form of dealloying (see  4.3.11 ) of cast irons.  It
should not be confused with graphitization, the decomposition of carbides at high temperatures (see
4.2.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1
Oxidation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Oxygen reacts with carbon steel and other alloys at high temperature converting the metal to oxide
scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
It is most often present as oxygen is in the surrounding air (approximately 20%) used for combustion
in fired heaters and boilers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All iron based materials including carbon steel and low alloy steels, both cast and wrought.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
All 300 Series SS, 400 Series SS and nickel base alloys also oxidize to varying degrees, depending
on composition and temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The primary factors affecting high temperature oxidation are metal temperature and alloy
composition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Oxidation of carbon steel begins to become significant above about 1000°F (538°C).  Rates of metal
loss increase with increasing temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In general, the resistance of carbon steel and other alloys is determined by the chromium content of
the material.  Increasing chromium levels produce a more protective oxide scale.  The 300 Series SS
are resistant to scaling up to about 1500°F (816°C). See  Table 4-8 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The presence of water vapor can significantly accelerate oxidation rates of some steels including
9Cr-1Mo (Reference 4.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1.4

Most alloys, including carbon steels and low alloy steels, suffer general thinning due to oxidation.
Usually, the component will be covered on the outside surface with an oxide scale, depending on the
temperature and exposure time ( Figure 4-111  to  4-113 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
300 Series SS and nickel alloys generally have a very thin dark scale unless exposed to extremely
high temperatures where metal loss rates are excessive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Resistance to oxidation is best achieved by upgrading to a more resistant alloy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Chromium is the primary alloying element that affects resistance to oxidation.  Other alloying
elements, including silicon and aluminum, are effective but their concentrations are limited due to
adverse affects on mechanical properties.  They are often used in special alloys for applications such
as heater supports, burner tips and components for combustion equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Process conditions should be monitored for establishing trends of high temperature equipment
where oxidation can occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.2
Sulfidation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.2.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion of carbon steel and other alloys resulting from their reaction with sulfur compounds in high
temperature environments. The presence of hydrogen accelerates corrosion.  This mechanisms is also
known as sulfidic corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.2.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All iron based materials including carbon steel and low alloy steels, 300 Series SS and 400 Series
SS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Nickel base alloys are also affected to varying degrees depending on composition, especially
chromium content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Copper base alloys form sulfide at lower temperatures than carbon steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.2.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Major factors affecting sulfidation are alloy composition, temperature and concentration of corrosive
sulfur compounds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Susceptibility of an alloy to sulfidation is determined by its ability to form protective sulfide scales.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Sulfidation of iron-based alloys usually begins at metal temperatures above 500°F (260°C).  The
typical effects of increasing temperature, chromium content and sulfur content on metal loss are
shown in  Figure 4-114  and  Figure115.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Note: These graphs are provided for reference only for general estimating of corrosion behavior and
trends, and should not be used to make an exact determination of corrosion rates.  The references at
the end of this section should be consulted for additional background on the development of these
curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
In general, the resistance of iron and nickel base alloys is determined by the chromium content of the
material.  Increasing the chromium content significantly increases resistance to sulfidation.  300
Series SS, such as Types 304, 316, 321 and 347, are highly resistant in most refining process
environments. Nickel base alloys are similar to stainless steels in that similar levels of chromium
provide similar resistance to sulfidation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Crude oils, coal and other hydrocarbon streams contain sulfur at various concentrations.  Total sulfur
content is made up of many different sulfur-containing compounds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Sulfidation is primarily caused by H 2 S and other reactive sulfur species as a result of the thermal
decomposition of sulfur compounds at high temperatures.  Some sulfur compounds react more
readily to form H 2 S. Therefore, it can be misleading to predict corrosion rates based on weight
percent sulfur alone.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
A sulfide scale on the surface of the component offers varying degrees of protection depending on
the alloy and the severity of the process stream.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.2.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Sulfidation occurs in piping and equipment in high temperature environments where sulfur-containing
streams are processed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Common areas of concern are the crude, FCC, coker, vacuum, visbreaker and hydroprocessing
units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Heaters fired with oil, gas, coke and most other sources of fuel may be affected depending on sulfur
levels in the fuel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Boilers and high temperature equipment exposed to sulfur-containing gases can be affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.2.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Depending on service conditions, corrosion is most often in the form of uniform thinning but can also
occur as localized corrosion or high velocity erosion-corrosion damage ( Figure 4-116  to  4-120 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
A sulfide scale will usually cover the surface of components.  Deposits may be thick or thin
depending on the alloy, corrosiveness of the stream, fluid velocities and presence of contaminants .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.2.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Resistance to sulfidation is generally achieved by upgrading to a higher chromium alloy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Piping and equipment constructed from solid or clad 300 Series SS or 400 Series SS can provide
significant resistance to corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Aluminum diffusion treatment of low alloy steel components is sometimes used to reduce sulfidation
rates and minimize scale formation, however, it may not offer complete protection.  300 Series SS
catalyst support screens in hydroprocessing reactors can also be treated to prolong life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.2.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Process conditions should be monitored for increasing temperatures and/or changing sulfur levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Temperatures can be monitored through the use of tubeskin thermocouples and/or infrared
thermography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Evidence of thinning can be detected using external ultrasonic thickness measurements and profile
radiography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Proactive and retroactive PMI programs are used for alloy verification and to check for alloy mix-ups
in services where sulfidation is anticipated (Reference 7).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.2.8

Carburization<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon is absorbed into a material at elevated temperature while in contact with a carbonaceous material
or carburizing environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel and low alloy steels, 300 Series SS and 400 Series SS, cast stainless steels, nickel base
alloys with significant iron content (e.g., Alloys 600 and 800) and HK/HP alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Three conditions must be satisfied:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Exposure to a carburizing environment or carbonaceous material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Temperature high enough to allow diffusion of carbon into the metal [typically above 1100°F
(593°C)].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Susceptible material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Conditions favoring carburization include a high gas phase carbon activity (hydrocarbons, coke,
gases rich in CO, CO 2 , methane, ethane) and low oxygen potential (minimal O 2  or steam).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Initially, carbon diffuses into the component at a high rate and then tapers off as the depth of
carburization increases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In carbon steels and low alloy steels, carbon reacts to form a hard, brittle structure at the surface that
may crack or spall upon cooling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
300 Series SS are more resistant than carbon steel and the low alloy steels due to higher chromium
and nickel content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Carburization can result in the loss of high temperature creep ductility, loss of ambient temperature
mechanical properties (specifically toughness/ductility), loss of weldability, and corrosion resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Fired heater tubes are the most common type of equipment susceptible to carburization in the
environments mentioned earlier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Coke deposits are a source of carbon that may promote carburization, particularly during decoke
cycles where temperatures exceed the normal operating temperatures, accelerating the
carburization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Carburization is sometimes found in heater tubes in catalytic reformers and coker units or other
heaters where steam/air decoking is performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Carburization is also encountered in ethylene pyrolysis and steam reformer furnaces. Significant
carburization occurs during decoking cycles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The depth of carburization can be confirmed by metallography.  Figure 4-121  to  4-122 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Carburization can be confirmed by substantial increases in hardness and loss in ductility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In a more advanced stage, there may be a volumetric increase in the affected component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
A change (increase) in the level of ferromagnetism can occur in some alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Carburization results in the formation of metal carbides depleting the surrounding matrix of the
carbide-forming element.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Select alloys with adequate resistance to carburization including alloys with a strong surface oxide or
sulfide film formers (silicon and aluminum).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Reduce the carbon activity of the environment through lower temperatures and higher oxygen/sulfur
partial pressures.  Sulfur inhibits carburization and is often added in the process stream in small
amounts in steam/gas cracking in olefin and thermal hydrodealkylation units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Inspection for carburization in the initial stages of attack is difficult.  If the process side surfaces are
accessible, hardness testing and field metallography can be used.  Destructive sampling and
magnetic based techniques (Eddy Current) have also been used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Inspection techniques based on determining increased levels of ferromagnetism (magnetic
permeability) are also useful for alloys that are paramagnetic when initially installed (austenitic
alloys). However, surface oxides may interfere with the results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In the advanced stages of carburization where cracking has initiated, RT, UT and some magnetic
techniques may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.4
Decarburization<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.4.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A condition where steel loses strength due the removal of carbon and carbides leaving only an iron
matrix.  Decarburization occurs during exposure to high temperatures, during heat treatment, from
exposure to fires, or from high temperature service in a gaseous environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.4.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steels and low alloy steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.4.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Time, temperature and carbon activity of the process stream are the critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The material must be exposed to a gas phase that has a low carbon activity so that carbon in the
steel will diffuse to the surface to react with gas phase constituents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The extent and depth of decarburization is a function of the temperature and exposure time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Typically, shallow decarburization can slightly decrease the strength of the material, but has no
detrimental effect on the overall performance of the component.  However, it is indicative that the
steel may have been overheated and suggests other effects may be present (e.g. decarburization
associated with HTHA in hydrogen services).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Potential loss in room temperature tensile strength and creep strength may occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.4.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Decarburization can occur in almost any equipment that is exposed to elevated temperatures, heat
treated or exposed to a fire.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Piping and equipment in hot hydrogen service in hydroprocessing units or catalytic reforming units as
well as fired heater tubes can be affected.  Pressure vessel components that are hot formed during
fabrication can be affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.4.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Damage can be verified by metallography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Damage occurs on the surface exposed to the gas environment but in extreme cases may be
through wall.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The decarburized layer will be free of carbide phases. Carbon steel will be pure iron ( Figure 4-123  to
4-124 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.4.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Decarburization can be controlled by controlling the chemistry of the gas phase and alloy selection
(API RP 941).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Alloy steels with chromium and molybdenum form more stable carbides and are more resistant to
decarburization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Steels operating in high temperature hydrogen environments should be selected in accordance with
API RP 941.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Field Metallography and Replication (FMR) can confirm decarburization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Decarburization results in a softening that can be confirmed by hardness testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5
Metal Dusting<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Metal dusting is form of carburization resulting in accelerated localized pitting which occurs in carburizing
gases and/or process streams containing carbon and hydrogen.  Pits usually form on the surface and
may contain soot or graphite dust.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Low alloy steels, 300 Series SS, nickel base alloys and heat resisting alloys.  There is currently no known
metal alloy that is immune to metal dusting under all conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Process stream composition, operating temperature and alloy composition are critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Metal dusting is preceded by carburization and is characterized by rapid metal wastage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Metal dusting involves a complex series of reactions involving a reducing gas such as hydrogen,
methane, propane or CO.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
It usually occurs in the operating temperature range of 900°F to 1500°F (482°C to 816°C). Damage
increases with increasing temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The mechanism of metal dusting is considered to be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Saturation of the metal matrix by carburization;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Precipitation of metal carbides at the metal surface and grain boundaries;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Deposition of graphite from the atmosphere onto the metal carbides at the surface;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Decomposition of the metal carbides under the graphite and metal particles; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Further deposition of graphite catalyzed by the metal particles on the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
In high nickel alloys, it is thought that metal dusting occurs without the formation of metal carbides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Metal dusting can also occur under alternating reducing and oxidizing conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Primarily fired heater tubes, thermowells and furnace components operating in carburizing
environments are affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Metal dusting has been reported in catalytic reforming unit heater tubes, coker heaters, gas turbines,
methanol reforming unit outlet piping and thermal hydrodealkylation furnaces and reactors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
In low alloy steels, the wastage can be uniform but usually is in the form of small pits filled with a
crumbly residue of metal oxides and carbides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The corrosion product is a voluminous carbon dust containing metal particles and sometimes metal
oxides and carbides.  Frequently, this dust will be swept away by the flowing process stream, leaving
behind only the thinned or pitted metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In stainless and high alloy steels, the attack is frequently local, appearing as deep, round pits ( Figure
4-125 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Metallography will show that the metal is heavily carburized under the attacked surface ( Figure 4-
126 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Sulfur in the carburizing atmosphere (usually as H 2 S), forms a protective sulfide that minimizes
carburization and metal dusting. It is thought that sulfur retards the carbon transfer from the
atmosphere to the metal and suppresses graphite nucleation and growth.  For protection, sufficient
H 2 S must always be in the process environment.  If the H 2 S level drops too low, even for a short
period of time, damage may occur.  Sulfur is a catalyst poison in some processing units so that the
introduction of H 2 S into a process stream may not always be practical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
There is currently no known metal alloy that is immune to metal dusting under all conditions.
Materials selection must be made based on the specific application and environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
An aluminum diffusion treatment to the base metal substrate can be beneficial in some applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For heater tubes with suspected damage, compression wave ultrasonic testing is probably the most
efficient method of inspection since large areas can be inspected relatively quickly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
RT techniques can be employed to look for pitting and wall thinning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
If internal surfaces are accessible, visual inspection is effective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Filtering the cooled furnace or reactor effluent may yield metal particles that are a tell tale indication
of a metal dusting problem upstream.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5.8

<<PARAGRAPH>>Metal dusting is also known as catastrophic carburization.  Carburization is discussed in  4.4.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Fuel Ash Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.6.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Fuel ash corrosion is accelerated high temperature wastage of materials that occurs when
contaminants in the fuel form deposits and melt on the metal surfaces of fired heaters, boilers and
gas turbines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion typically occurs with fuel oil or coal that is contaminated with a combination of sulfur,
sodium, potassium and/or vanadium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The resulting molten salts (slags) dissolve the surface oxide and enhance the transport of oxygen to
the surface to re-form the iron oxide at the expense of the tube wall or component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.6.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All conventional alloys used for process heater and boiler construction are susceptible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Alloys of the 50Cr-50Ni family show improved resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.6.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The concentration of molten salt forming contaminants, metal temperature and alloy composition are
the critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The severity of damage depends on the type of fuel (i.e., the concentrations of contaminants in the
fuel), sulfur content and metal temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion occurs by this mechanism only if the metal temperature is above the temperature of the
liquid species formed, and it is most severe where the temperatures are the highest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The corrosion rates differ depending on the alloy and location within the heater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The liquid species (slags) are different for the oil and coal ash and are also different for waterwall-
tube corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
For oil ash, the liquid species are mixtures of vanadium pentoxide and sodium oxide, or
vanadium pentoxide and sodium sulfate.  Depending on the precise composition, melting points
below 1000°F (538°C) are possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
For waterwall corrosion, the liquid species are mixtures of sodium and potassium pyrosulfates
that have melting points as low as 700°F (371°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
For coal ash, superheater and reheater corrosion is caused by sodium and potassium iron
trisulfates that melt between 1030°F and 1130°F (544°C and 610°C), depending on the ratio of
sodium and potassium. Reducing conditions, that is, a flue gas rich in carbon monoxide,
hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen will aggravate the corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Unburned coal particles also add carbon to the fly ash deposits and provide a reducing environment
on the tube surface where corrosion occurs. Carburization of the tube surface, especially on
austenitic alloys will decrease corrosion resistance and increase tube wastage rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Corrosion rates under reducing conditions may be 2 to 5 times faster than under oxidizing conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.6.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Fuel ash corrosion can occur in any fired heater or gas turbine utilizing fuels with the aforementioned
contaminants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Fuel ash corrosion is most often associated with fired heaters burning vanadium and sodium
contaminated fuel oils or residue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

_____________________________________________________________________________________________<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Heater tubes are sometimes not affected because their skin temperatures are cooler than the
threshold melting point of the slags in most heaters.  Tube hangers and supports, however, operate
hotter and can suffer severe fuel ash corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Some gas turbines suffer blade corrosion when switched over to burning fuel oil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
In some cases, coking of the heater tubes may cause operators to increase heat flux that may push
some components above the threshold temperature where fuel ash corrosion is possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Since the melting points of these liquid species are around 1000°F (538°C) and higher in the
superheaters and reheaters, any unit that has metal temperatures above the melting point of the
sulfates may have the problem.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
For oil-fired boilers, fuel oils that do not contain vanadium are less prone to liquid ash corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
For waterwalls, if the temperature can be maintained below the melting point of the pyrosulfates [that
is below 700°F (371°C)], damage will be minimized.  Thus, steam generating pressures below about
1800 psi are nearly immune.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.6.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Oil ash corrosion is manifested as severe metal loss associated with slagging.  In some cases,
corrosion rates of 100 to 1000 mpy may be experienced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Metallographic examination and deposit-analysis techniques can be used to verify the presence of
fuel ash corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
For oil ash corrosion of superheaters and reheaters, the appearance of the ash deposit will be in at
least two distinct layers.  The important deposit is adjacent to the component, which will have a dark
gray or black appearance at room temperature. As the liquid sulfates sinter the corrosion debris to
the surface,  a hard, glassy, tenacious scale is formed.  When removed, the surface of the steel will
have an “alligator-hide” appearance ( Figure 4-127  and  Figure 4-128 ) as shallow grooves will have
penetrated the steel in a cross-hatched pattern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
For waterwalls, the cracks are predominantly circumferential and, to a lesser extent, axial.  The
overall appearance on the waterwalls is one of circumferential grooving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
After the liquid ash layer develops, the “slush” can only hold a certain weight of ash.  When the
weight is excessive, the slag is shed, exposing a bare, uninsulated tube to the heat flux of the
firebox.  The temperatures will spike on waterwalls, by perhaps 100°F (38°C) and the cracking
is then similar to thermal fatigue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
The mechanism for the steam-cooled tubes is similar, except that the temperature spike is
probably less and, therefore, the thermal fatigue damage is less severe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
The alligator-hide morphology of superheaters and reheaters and the circumferential cracking
on waterwalls in coal-fired boilers is caused by a similar mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
For coal ash, the appearance will be a smooth interface between a glassy slag layer and the metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.6.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Fuel ash corrosion can be prevented by blending or changing fuel sources (minimizing the
contaminants) and by operating equipment so that hot components are below the temperature where
molten deposits are formed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Proper burner design and burner management can help to reduce flame impingement and localized
hot spots.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

_____________________________________________________________________________________________<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In some cases, the characteristics and melting points of the slags can be changed by firing with low
excess oxygen or by injecting special additives into the fuel.  These changes can increase the
melting point of the slags and reduce the tendency of the deposits to stick to metal surfaces or
dissolve the protective oxide scale.  Even with changes to reduce slag formation, corrosion may
continue if metal surfaces are not cleaned to remove slag and corrosion products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Corrosion of some components, such as tube hangers and supports, can be minimized by changing
to a 50%Cr-50%Ni alloy, such as Alloy 657.  Designs of tube hangers may need to be modified to
account for the lower stress-rupture strength of the 50Cr-50Ni alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.6.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Visual inspection is usually sufficient to detect hot ash corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Metal loss is likely to be severe and the presence of a slag will be apparent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Tubes need to be grit blasted in order to remove the tenacious glass-like ash deposit.  UT
examination may be useful to measure loss of thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.6.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Hot corrosion, hot ash corrosion, molten salt corrosion, oil ash corrosion and coal ash corrosion are
all terms used to describe this mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Circumferential cracking in waterwall tubes is similar to thermal fatigue aggravated by a corrosive
environment ( Figure 4-129 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.7
Nitriding<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.7.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A hard, brittle surface layer will develop on some alloys due to exposure to high temperature process
streams containing high levels of nitrogen compounds such ammonia or cyanides, particularly under
reducing conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.7.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbon steels, low alloy steels, 300 Series SS and 400 Series SS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Nickel base alloys are more resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.7.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Nitriding is a diffusion controlled process dependent on temperature, time, partial pressure of
nitrogen and metal composition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Temperatures must be high enough to allow for the thermal breakdown/disassociation of nitrogen
from ammonia or other compounds and for diffusion of nitrogen into the metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Nitriding begins above 600°F (316°C) and becomes severe above 900°F (482°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
High gas phase nitrogen activity (high partial pressures of nitrogen) promotes nitriding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Corrosion resistance may be adversely affected by nitriding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Alloys containing 30% to 80% nickel are more resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
A loss of high temperature creep strength, ambient temperature mechanical properties (specifically
toughness/ductility), weldability and corrosion resistance may result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.7.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nitriding can occur at any location where appropriate environment and temperature conditions are met,
but it is considered to be fairly rare.  Nitriding has been observed in steam methane-reformers, steam gas
cracking (olefin plants) and ammonia synthesis plants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.7.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Nitriding is usually confined to the surface of most components and will have a dull, dark gray
appearance.  However, during initial stages of nitriding, damage can only be seen with
metallography as shown in  Figure 4-130 ,  Figure 4-131  and  Figure 4-132 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In a more advanced stage, the material will exhibit very high surface hardness.  In most cases, a
slightly harder surface layer of a vessel or component will not affect the mechanical integrity of the
equipment. However, the concern is for the potential development of cracks in the nitrided layer that
could propagate into the base metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Nitriding of low alloy steels containing up to 12% chromium is accompanied by an increase in
volume. The nitrided layer tends to crack and flake.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Above 770°F (410°C), preferential grain boundary nitriding may lead to microcracking and
embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Stainless steels tend to form thin, brittle layers that may crack and spall from thermal cycling or
applied stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Nitrogen diffuses into the surface and forms needle-like particles of iron nitrides (Fe 3 N or Fe 4 N) that
can only be confirmed by metallography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.7.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Changing to more resistant alloys with 30% to 80% nickel is usually required.   It is usually not practical to
modify the process conditions to reduce the nitrogen partial pressure or to lower temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.7.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
A change in surface color to a dull gray may indicate nitriding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Materials exposed to nitriding conditions should be inspected thoroughly because good appearance
may mask damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Hardness testing of the affected surfaces (400 to 500 BHN or higher) can help indicate nitriding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Nitrided layers are magnetic. Therefore, 300 Series SS should be checked for magnetism as an
initial screening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Metallography is generally required to confirm nitriding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
EC testing may be used in some cases to detect nitriding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
In the advanced stages of nitriding, where cracking may have initiated, appropriate inspection
techniques include PT, RT and UT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Environment – Assisted Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1
Chloride Stress Corrosion Cracking (Cl - SCC)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surface initiated cracks caused by environmental cracking of 300 Series SS and some nickel base alloys
under the combined action of tensile stress, temperature and an aqueous chloride environment.  The
presence of dissolved oxygen increases propensity for cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All 300 Series SS are highly susceptible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Duplex stainless steels are more resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Nickel base alloys are highly resistant, but not immune.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Chloride content, pH, temperature, stress, presence of oxygen and alloy composition are critical
factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Increasing temperatures increase the susceptibility to cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Increasing levels of chloride increase the likelihood of cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
No practical lower limit for chlorides exists because there is always a potential for chlorides to
concentrate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Heat transfer conditions significantly increase cracking susceptibility because they allow chlorides to
concentrate. Alternate exposures to wet-dry conditions or steam and water are also conducive to
cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
SCC usually occurs at pH values above 2. At lower pH values, uniform corrosion generally
predominates. SCC tendency decreases toward the alkaline pH region.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Cracking usually occurs at metal temperatures above about 140 o F (60 o C), although exceptions can
be found at lower temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Stress may be applied or residual. Highly stressed or cold worked components, such as expansion
bellows, are highly susceptible to cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Oxygen dissolved in the water normally accelerates SCC but it is not clear whether there is an
oxygen concentration threshold below which chloride SCC is impossible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
Nickel content of the alloy has a major affect on resistance.  The greatest susceptibility is at a nickel
content of 8% to 12%.  Alloys with nickel contents above 35% are highly resistant and alloys above
45% are nearly immune.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k)
Low-nickel stainless steels, such as the duplex (ferrite-austenite) stainless steels, have improved
resistance over the 300 Series SS but are not immune.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
Carbon steels, low alloy steels and  400 Series SS are not susceptible to Cl-SCC .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All 300 Series SS piping and pressure vessel components in any process units are susceptible to Cl-
SCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracking has occurred in water-cooled condensers and in the process side of crude tower overhead
condensers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Drains in hydroprocessing units are susceptible to cracking during startup/shutdown if not properly
purged.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Bellows and instrument tubing, particularly those associated with hydrogen recycle streams
contaminated with chlorides, can be affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
External Cl–SCC has also been a problem on insulated surfaces when insulation gets wet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Cracking has occurred in boiler drain lines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Surface breaking cracks can occur from the process side or externally under insulation ( Figures 4-
133  to  4-134 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The material usually shows no visible signs of corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Characteristic stress corrosion cracks have many branches and may be visually detectable by a
craze-cracked appearance of the surface ( Figure 4-135  to  Figure 4-136 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Metallography of cracked samples typically shows branched transgranular cracks ( Figure 4-137  to  4-
139 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Sometimes intergranular cracking of sensitized 300 Series SS may also be seen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Welds in 300 Series SS usually contain some ferrite, producing a duplex structure that is usually
more resistant to Cl–SCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Corrosion-resistant nickel-based alloys are also susceptible to cracking under severe conditions
( Figure 4-140 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Fracture surfaces often have a brittle appearance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Use resistant materials of construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
When hydrotesting, use low chloride content water and dry out thoroughly and quickly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Properly applied coatings under insulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Avoid designs that allow stagnant regions where chlorides can concentrate or deposit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
A high temperature stress relief of 300 Series SS after fabrication may reduce residual stresses.
However, consideration should be given to the possible effects of sensitization that may occur,
increasing susceptibility to polythionic SCC, possible distortion problems and potential reheat
cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cracking is surface connected and may be detected visually in some cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
PT or phase analysis EC techniques are the preferred methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Eddy current inspection methods have also been used on condenser tubes as well as piping and
pressure vessels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Extremely fine cracks may be difficult to find with PT.  Special surface preparation methods,
including polishing or high-pressure water blast, may be required in some cases, especially in high
pressure services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
UT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Often, RT is not sufficiently sensitive to detect cracks except in advanced stages where a significant
network of cracks has developed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The critical factors are the material, corrosive environment, cyclic stresses and stress raisers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracking is more likely to occur in environments that promote pitting or localized corrosion under
cyclic stress due to thermal stress, vibration or differential expansion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Contrary to a pure mechanical fatigue, there is no fatigue limit load in corrosion-assisted fatigue.
Corrosion promotes failure at a lower stress and number of cycles than the materials’ normal
endurance limit in the absence of corrosion and often results in propagation of multiple parallel
cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Crack initiation sites include concentrators such as pits, notches, surface defects, changes in section
or fillet welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.2.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rotating equipment, deaerators and cycling boilers, as well as any equipment subjected to cyclic stresses
in a corrosive environment. Some examples include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Rotating Equipment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Galvanic couples between the impeller and the pump shaft or other corrosion mechanisms may
result in a pitting problem on the shaft. The pitting can act as a stress concentrator or stress riser to
promote cracking.  Most cracking is transgranular with little branching.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Deaerators<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the late 1980’s, deaerators in the pulp and paper, refining and petrochemical and fossil fueled
utility industries had major deaerator cracking problems. Complete vessel failures in the pulp and
paper industry resulted in a diligent inspection program that found major cracking problems across
the various industries. It was concluded that residual welding and fabrication stresses, stress risers
(attachments and weld reinforcement) and the normal deaerator environment could produce multiple
corrosion fatigue cracking problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Cycling Boilers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A cycling boiler may see several hundred cold starts over its useful life which, because of differential
expansion, continually cracks the protective magnetite scale, allowing corrosion to continue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The fatigue fracture is brittle and the cracks are most often transgranular, as in stress-corrosion
cracking, but not branched, and often results in propagation of multiple parallel cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Fatigue cracking will be evidenced by very little plastic deformation except that final fracture may
occur by mechanical overload accompanied by plastic deformation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In cycling boilers, the damage usually appears first on the water side of buckstay (structural)
attachments ( Figure 4-141 ).  The cracking pattern may be circular cracks surrounding the weld
between the buckstay attachment and the waterwall tube.  In cross-section, the cracks tend to be
bulbous with numerous lobes ( Figure 4-142 ).  The crack tips themselves may be somewhat blunted
but are oxide filled and transgranular  Figure 4-143  to  4-145 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In sulfidizing environments, cracks will have a similar appearance but will be filled with a sulfide
scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
In rotating equipment, most cracking is transgranular with minimal branching.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3
Caustic Stress Corrosion Cracking (Caustic Embrittlement)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Caustic embrittlement is a form of stress corrosion cracking characterized by surface-initiated cracks that
occur in piping and equipment exposed to caustic, primarily adjacent to non-PWHT’d welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Carbon steel, low alloy steels and 300 Series SS are susceptible.  Nickel base alloys are more resistant.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Susceptibility to caustic embrittlement in caustic soda (NaOH) and caustic potash (KOH) solutions is
a function of caustic strength, metal temperature and stress levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Increasing caustic concentration and increasing temperatures increase the likelihood and severity of
cracking.  Conditions likely to result in cracking have been established through plant experience and
are presented in  Figure 4-146 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Cracking can occur at low caustic levels if a concentrating mechanism is present.  In such cases,
caustic concentrations of 50 to 100 ppm are sufficient to cause cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Stresses that promote cracking can be residual that result from welding or from cold working (such
as bending and forming) as well as applied stresses ( Figure 4-147  and  Figure 4-148 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
It is generally accepted that stresses approaching yield are required for SCC so that thermal stress
relief (PWHT) is effective in preventing caustic SCC ( Figure 4-146 ).  Although failures have occurred
at stresses that are low relative to yield, they are considered more rare ( Figure 4-149  to  Figure 4-
150 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Crack propagation rates increase dramatically with temperature and can sometimes grow through
wall in a matter of hours or days during temperature excursions, especially if conditions promote
caustic concentration.  Concentration can occur as a result of alternating wet and dry conditions,
localized hot spots or high temperature steamout.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Special care must be taken with steam tracing design and steamout of non-PWHT’d carbon steel
piping and equipment ( Figure 4-151  to  Figure 4-152 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Caustic embrittlement is often found in piping and equipment that handles caustic, including H 2 S and
mercaptan removal units, as well as equipment that uses caustic for neutralization in sulfuric acid
alkylation units and HF alkylation units.  Caustic is sometimes injected into the feed to the crude
tower for chloride control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Failures have occurred in improperly heat-traced piping or equipment as well as heating coils and
other heat transfer equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Caustic embrittlement may occur in equipment as a result of steam cleaning after being in caustic
service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Traces of caustic can become concentrated in BFW and can result in caustic embrittlement of boiler
tubes that alternate between wet and dry conditions due to overfiring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Caustic stress corrosion cracking typically propagates parallel to the weld in adjacent base metal but
can also occur in the weld deposit or heat-affected zones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API Recommended Practice 571
_____________________________________________________________________________________________<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The pattern of cracking observed on the steel surface is sometimes described as a spider web of
small cracks which often initiate at or interconnect with weld-related flaws that serve as local stress
raisers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Cracks can be confirmed through metallographic examination as surface breaking flaws that are
predominantly intergranular.  The cracking typically occurs in as-welded carbon steel fabrications as
a network of very fine, oxide-filled cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Cracking in 300 Series SS is typically transgranular and is very difficult to distinguish from chloride
stress corrosion cracking ( Figure 4-153 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cracking can be effectively prevented by means of a stress-relieving heat treatment (e.g. PWHT).  A
heat treatment at 1150°F (621°C) is considered an effective stress relieving heat treatment for
carbon steel.  The same requirement applies to repair welds and to internal and external attachment
welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
300 Series SS offer little advantage in resistance to cracking over CS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Nickel base alloys are more resistant to cracking and may be required at higher temperatures and/or
caustic concentrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Steamout of non-PWHT’d carbon steel piping and equipment should be avoided.  Equipment should
be water washed before steamout.  Where steamout is required, only low-pressure steam should be
used for short periods of time to minimize exposure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Proper design and operation of the injection system is required to ensure that caustic is properly
dispersed before entering the high-temperature crude preheat system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Although cracks may be seen visually, crack detection is best performed with WFMT, EC, RT or
ACFM techniques.  Surface preparation by grit blasting, high pressure water blasting or other
methods is usually required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
PT may not be effective for finding tight, scale-filled cracks and should not be used as the only
means of detection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Fine cracks may be difficult to find with RT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Crack depths can be measured with a suitable UT technique including external SWUT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
AET can be used for monitoring crack growth and locating growing cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Amine cracking (see  5.1.2.2 ) and carbonate cracking (see  5.1.2.5 ) are two other similar forms of alkaline
SCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Liquid Metal Embrittlement (LME)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.5.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Liquid Metal Embrittlement (LME) is a form of cracking that results when certain molten metals come in
contact with specific alloys.  Cracking can be very sudden and brittle in nature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.5.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many commonly used materials including carbon steel, low alloy steels, high strength steels, 300 Series
SS, nickel base alloys and the copper alloys, aluminum alloys and titanium alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.5.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
LME occurs in very specific combinations of metals in contact with low melting point metals such as
zinc, mercury, cadmium, lead, copper and tin.  Typical combinations of industrial significance are
shown in  Table 4-9 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
High tensile stress promotes cracking, however, cracking can initiate simply through contacting the
molten metal with the susceptible alloy.  Very small quantities of the low melting point metal are
sufficient to cause LME.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Tensile stress contributes to crack propagation rates.  Cracking under load can be extremely rapid
such that cracks may pass through the wall within seconds of contact with the molten metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Cracking can occur after long periods of time when contaminated surfaces are exposed to liquid
metals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
A susceptible metal in contact with a low melting metal at low temperatures may crack later when the
temperature rises above the melting temperature of the low melting alloy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.5.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
During a fire, molten metals may drip onto or contact a susceptible metal.  Examples include melted
zinc galvanizing, cadmium electrical housings, tin or lead from solders, and melted copper
components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
LME can occur in any location where the LME couples are found.  A common example is 300 Series
SS piping or vessels in contact with (or previously rubbed against) galvanized steel ( Figure 4-157
and  Figure 4-158 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In refineries, mercury is found in some crude oils and can condense in the atmospheric tower
overhead system thereby embrittling brass, Alloy 400, titanium or aluminum exchanger components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Failure of process instruments that utilize mercury can introduce the liquid metal into refinery
streams ( Figure 4-159 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
LME of aluminum components has occurred in LNG facilities and cryogenic gas plant components
due to condensation of liquid mercury.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.5.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Damage resulting from LME will appear as brittle cracks in an otherwise ductile material.  LME can
only be confirmed through metallography by the presence of intergranular cracks, usually filled with
the low melting metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Techniques such as spectrographic analysis may be required to confirm the presence of the molten
metal species.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.5.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
LME can only be prevented by protecting metal substrates from coming into contact with the low
melting metal.  For example, galvanized steel components should not be welded to 300 Series SS.
300 Series SS should be protected to avoid contact with galvanized components and overspray from
zinc and inorganic zinc coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Once cracking from LME has initiated, grinding out the affected area is not an acceptable fix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.5.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cracks can be detected with MT examination for ferritic steel and PT examination for 300 Series SS
and nickel base alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Because of the high density of mercury, radiography has been used to locate deposits inside heat
exchanger tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.5.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
LME is also referred to as Liquid Metal Cracking (LMC).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Nickel alloys are susceptible to a similar mechanism caused by the nickel-nickel sulfide eutectic that
forms at 1157°F (625°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.6
Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.6.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A loss in ductility of high strength steels due to the penetration of atomic hydrogen can lead to brittle
cracking.  Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) can occur during manufacturing, welding, or from services that
can charge hydrogen into the steel in an aqueous, corrosive, or a gaseous environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.6.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel and low alloy steels, 400 Series SS, Precipitation Hardenable (PH) SS and some high
strength nickel base alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.6.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Three conditions must be satisfied:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Hydrogen must be present at a critical concentration within the steel/alloy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
The strength level and microstructure of the steel/alloy must be susceptible to embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
A stress above the threshold for HE must be present from residual stresses and/or applied
stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The hydrogen can come from:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Welding – if wet electrodes or high moisture content flux weld electrodes are used, hydrogen
can be charged into the steel (delayed cracking).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Cleaning and pickling in acid solutions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Service in high temperature hydrogen gas atmospheres, molecular hydrogen dissociates to
form atomic hydrogen that can diffuse into the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Wet H 2 S services or HF acid services in which atomic hydrogen diffuses into the steel.
(Cyanides, arsenic and FeS can act as hydrogen recombination poisons that diminish the
hydrogen gas reaction and allows for greater charging rates.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Manufacturing – melting practices or manufacturing processes particularly where components
are plated (hydrogen flaking).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6)
Cathodic protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The effect is pronounced at temperatures from ambient to about 300°F (149°C). Effects decrease
with increasing temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
HE affects static properties to a much greater extent than impact properties.  If the hydrogen is
present and a sufficient stress is applied, failure can occur quickly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The amount of trapped hydrogen depends on the environment, surface reactions and the presence
of hydrogen traps in the metal such as imperfections, inclusions and pre-existing flaws or cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
The amount of hydrogen needed to have a measurable effect on the mechanical properties varies
with the strength level, microstructure and heat treatment for the alloy.  In some cases, thresholds of
critical hydrogen concentrations have been established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Stresses include cooling during manufacture, residual stresses from welding or applied loads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Thick wall components are more vulnerable due to increased thermal stress and high restraint and
take longer for hydrogen to diffuse out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
In general, as strength increases, susceptibility to HE increases. Certain microstructures, such as
untempered martensite and pearlite, are more susceptible at the same strength level than tempered
martensite.  Carbon steel that is severely hydrogen charged will have lower toughness than with no
hydrogen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.6.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Services where HE is a concern include carbon steel piping and vessels in wet H 2 S services in FCC,
hydroprocessing, amine, sour water services and HF alkylation units.  However, mild steel used for
vessels and piping in most refining, fossil utility and process applications have low hardness and are
usually not susceptible to HE except at weldments, particularly the HAZ, if suitable PWHT is not
performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Storage spheres are often made of slightly higher strength steels and are more susceptible than
most other refinery equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Bolts and springs made of high strength steel are very prone to HE. (Alloys that have a tensile
strength above 150 ksi can absorb hydrogen during electroplating and crack.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Cr-Mo reactors, drums and exchanger shells on hydroprocessing units and catalytic reforming units
are susceptible if the weld heat-affected zone hardness exceeds 235 BHN.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.6.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Cracking due to HE can initiate sub-surface, but in most cases is surface breaking ( Figure 4-160  to
4-161 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
HE occurs at locations of high residual or tri-axial stresses (notches, restraint) and where the
microstructure is conducive, such as in weld HAZ’s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
On a macro-scale, there is often little evidence, although some materials will appear to have brittle
fracture surfaces.  On a microscale, the material will contain less ductile fracture surface, but must
often be compared to a fracture without the presence of hydrogen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In higher strength steels, cracking is often intergranular.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.6.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Dependent on the source of the hydrogen, alloy composition and fabrication/heat treatment history.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Use lower strength steels and PWHT to temper the microstructure, improve ductility and reduce
residual stresses and hardness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
During welding, use low hydrogen, dry electrodes and preheating methods.  If hydrogen is expected
to have diffused into the metal, an elevated temperature bake out [400°F or higher (204°C or higher)]
may be required to drive the hydrogen out prior to welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Heavy wall equipment in hot hydrogen service requires controlled shutdown and start-up procedures
to control the pressurization sequence as a function of temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
In corrosive aqueous services, apply a protective lining, SS cladding or weld overlay to prevent the
surface hydrogen reactions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.6.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For surface cracking inspection use PT, MT or WFMT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
UT may also be useful in finding HE cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
RT often is not sufficiently sensitive to detect HE cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
If the source of hydrogen is a low temperature aqueous environment, hydrogen flux can be
monitored using specialized instruments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.6.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Also known as hydrogen flaking, underbead cracking, delayed cracking, hydrogen assisted cracking,
hydrogen induced cracking.  Sulfide stress cracking (see  5.1.2.3 ) and hydrogen stress corrosion cracking
in HF (see  5.1.2.4 ) are closely related forms of hydrogen embrittlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.7
Ethanol Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.7.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surface-initiated cracks caused by environmental cracking of carbon steel under the combined action of
tensile stress and a fuel grade ethanol (FGE, ASTM D 4806) or FGE / gasoline blend environment.
Dissolved oxygen and the presence of variable stresses such as cyclic stress or component flexing,
increase the propensity for cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.7.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All grades of carbon steel are susceptible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Ethanol SCC has not been reported in materials other than carbon steel, but general corrosion may
be a concern with other materials including some alloys of aluminum, copper and copper alloys, lead
and zinc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
FGE and blends with gasoline may adversely affect non-metallic materials (e.g. coatings and seals)
causing swelling, hardness changes, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.7.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Several factors have been identified by field observations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Stress may be applied or residual.  Highly stressed, locally cold worked components, or
components with stress concentrators are susceptible to cracking.  Variable stresses, such as
those produced by loading and unloading of tanks, have led to cracking in tank bottoms and
floating roofs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Cracking has been found to occur in FGE meeting ASTM D 4806 specifications, including the
water content requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Corrosion inhibitors may be added to ethanol to prevent general corrosion in vehicle fuel
systems, but their affect on SCC is not fully understood.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Other factors have been identified in controlled laboratory conditions using conservative Slow Strain
Rate Test (SSRT) methods which stress the steel sample to failure.  Evidence of SCC is based on
the stress / strain behavior and an examination of the fracture surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Aeration (i.e. the dissolved oxygen content) of the ethanol appears to be the most important
factor for determining ethanol SCC susceptibility.  Cracking has not been found under
deaerated conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
The maximum potential for ethanol SCC occurs within a narrow range of water content between
0.1 and 4.5 vol%.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Ethanol SCC has been found to occur in blends of FGE and gasoline containing as little as 20
vol% FGE.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Galvanic coupling of a new steel to corroded steel increases the likelihood of ethanol SCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Increasing the chloride content of the ethanol tends to increase the severity of cracking and
changes the crack type from mainly intergranular found in the field to transgranular cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.7.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbon steel storage tanks, rack piping, and associated equipment are susceptible to ethanol SCC.
All grades of carbon steel are susceptible<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracking has also been reported in a pipeline used to transport FGE to and from a terminal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Ethanol SCC has not been reported in FGE manufacturers’ equipment and tankage, or in
transportation equipment (barges, trucks, railcars).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Cracking has not been reported in equipment handling FGE after it has been blended with gasoline
at end-use concentrations in unleaded gasoline (10 vol%).  There has been one reported failure of
an end-user E-85 tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.7.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Ethanol SCC is often found in the vicinity of welds and can appear as cracks that are parallel to the
weld or transverse to the weld ( Figures 4-162  to  4-169 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracks are typically tight and may be filled with corrosion product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Ethanol SCC cracks are typically branched and intergranular, but transgranular or mixed-mode
cracking has also been reported.  Field failures tend to be intergranular, while laboratory testing has
produced all crack morphologies.  The cracking mode appears to depend on the chloride level, with
an increased chloride content tending to shift the cracking from intergranular to transgranular or
mixed mode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Microrostructure of materials subjected to ethanol SCC are typically ferrite, or ferrite and pearlite.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.7.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The likelihood of ethanol SCC can be reduced though PWHT (when possible) or by applying
coatings.  Given the high threshold stress intensities required to initiate ethanol SCC, standard
carbon steel PWHT is expected to be effective.  Research to confirm this is currently under way.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Avoid designs with highly localized tensile stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Avoid the usage of lap seam welds that may concentrate strain in components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Minimize cold working during fabrication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.7.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
It is difficult to visually detect ethanol SCC because the cracks are typically tight and filled with
corrosion product.  Some small leaks may occur before an ethanol crack can be visually detected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
WFMT is the preferred method for detecting ethanol cracking.  Methods for ethanol SCC inspection
are similar to those used for detecting other types of SCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Shear wave UT may be used in instances where WFMT is not feasible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
ACFM can be used with less surface preparation than WFMT in areas such as weld HAZ’s.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
EC is unproven as a method for detection of ethanol SCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.8
Sulfate Stress Corrosion Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.8.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surface initiated cracks caused by environmental cracking of copper alloys in sulfate solutions over many
years.  Most commonly found in heat exchanger tubes, primarily in cooling water services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.8.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Some copper alloys are highly susceptible, especially admiralty brass.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The 90/10 and 70/30 copper nickel alloys are more resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.8.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Susceptible alloys may suffer cracking under the combination of stress and the presence of sulfate
chemical compounds.  Residual stresses are sufficient to promote cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The process environment must contain sulfates as part of the process or where sulfates can form
due to reactions with other chemical species.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Ammonia is usually present, often at very low concentrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Cracking usually occurs over a period of many years, sometimes taking as long as 10 to 15 years to
cause tube leaks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.8.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sulfate SCC is most often associated with tubes in heat exchanger bundles in overhead distillation
systems where sulfates can form or are present in low concentrations.  Crude tower overhead
exchangers are one example where this form of damage has been observed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.8.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Exchanger tubes show single or highly branched cracks on the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Upon metallurgical examination, the cracks will have a branched, transgranular appearance which
may be visually difficult to differentiate form ammonia stress corrosion cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Tube failures usually result in slow leaks as opposed to tube rupture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.8.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
It has been suggested that the life of susceptible copper alloy exchanger tubes may be lengthened
by periodic cleaning once every five years but limited published information is available to support
this claim.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Alloys that are highly resistant to ammonia stress corrosion cracking such as the 90-10CuNi and 70-
30CuNi alloys are also highly resistant to sulfate SCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Non-copper based alloys are immune from this form of damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.8.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Inspect heat exchanger tubes for cracking using EC or visual inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Physical bending of sample tubes can also be performed to detect shallow cracks indicative of
sulfate SCC in the beginning stages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Damage mechanisms found in the refining environment are discussed in the following sections. Section
5.2 includes process unit PFD’s. These PFD’s show the location in the unit where particular damage
mechanisms are most likely to be found.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1
Uniform or Localized Loss in Thickness Phenomena<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.1
Amine Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.1.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Amine corrosion refers to the general and/or localized corrosion that occurs principally on carbon
steel in amine treating processes. Corrosion is not caused by the amine itself, but results from
dissolved acid gases (CO 2  and H 2 S), amine degradation products, Heat Stable Amine Salts (HSAS)
and other contaminants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Stress corrosion cracking of carbon steel in amine services is discussed in  5.1.2.2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.1.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Primarily carbon steel. 300 Series SS are highly resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.1.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion depends on design and operating practices, the type of amine, amine concentration,
contaminants, temperature and velocity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Amine corrosion is very closely tied to the operation of the unit.  With a few exceptions, carbon steel
is suitable for most components in a properly designed and operated unit.  Most problems can be
traced to faulty design, poor operating practices or solution contamination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion is also dependent on the type of amine used.  In general, alkanolamine systems can be
rated in order of aggressiveness from most to least as follows: monoethanolamine (MEA),
diglycolamine (DGA), diisopropylamine (DIPA), diethanolamine (DEA), and methyldiamine (MDEA).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Lean amine solutions are generally not corrosive because they have either low conductivity and or
high pH. However, an excessive accumulation of heat stable amine salts (HSAS) above about 2%,
depending on the amine, can significantly increase corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Lean amine solutions contain a small amount of H 2 S which helps to maintains a stable iron sulfide
film. Overstripped lean solutions can be corrosive if there is inadequate H 2 S present to maintain the
protective iron sulfide film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Ammonia, H 2 S and HCN accelerate corrosion in the regenerator overhead condenser and outlet
piping as well as reflux piping, valves and pumps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Corrosion rates increase with increasing temperature, particularly in rich amine service.
Temperatures above about 220°F (104°C) can result in acid gas flashing and severe localized
corrosion due to 2-phase flow, if the pressure drop is high enough.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Process stream velocity will influence the amine corrosion rate and nature of attack. Corrosion is
generally uniform however high velocities and turbulence will cause localized thickness losses. For
carbon steel, common velocity limits are generally limited to 3 to 6 fps for rich amine and about 20
fps for lean amine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.1.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Amine units are used in refineries to remove H 2 S, CO 2  and mercaptans from process streams
originating in many units including the crude, coker, FCC, hydrogen reforming, hydroprocessing, and
tail gas units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The rich amine side of the lean/rich exchangers, hot lean amine piping, hot rich amine piping, the
amine solution pumps, and the reclaimers are also areas where corrosion problems occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.1.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbon steel and low alloy steels suffer general uniform thinning, localized corrosion or localized
underdeposit attack ( Figure 5-1  to  5-6 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Thinning will be uniform in nature when the process stream velocity is low while it will be localized for
high velocities associated with turbulence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.1.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Proper operation of the amine system is the most effective way to control corrosion, with particular
attention to acid gas loading levels.  In addition, to avoid corrosive amine degradation products, the
process temperature should not exceed recommended limits.  Proper control of the reboiler rate and
temperature is necessary in order to maintain a regenerator top temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Proper attention should be given to avoid the buildup of HSAS to unacceptable levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The system design should incorporate measures to control local pressure drop to minimize flashing.
In areas where it is unavoidable, upgrading to 300 Series SS or other corrosion resistant alloys may
be required.  SS410 trays and internals are also used in absorber and stripping towers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Oxygen inleakage causes high corrosion rates and contributes to heat stable salt formation.  Storage
tanks and surge vessels should be blanketed with inert gas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Solids and hydrocarbons should be removed from the amine solution by filtration and through
process control.  Filtration of rich amine solutions has the potential to be more effective than lean
amine filtration for solids removal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Corrosion inhibitors may be required to control amine corrosion within acceptable levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.1.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Visual examination and UT thickness measurement are the methods used for internal equipment
inspection. UT scans or profile radiography are used for external inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion monitoring can also be achieved with corrosion coupons and/or corrosion probes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Monitoring should target the hot areas of the unit such as the reboiler feed and return line, the hot
lean/rich amine piping, and the stripper overhead condenser piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Fouling of exchangers and filters can be a sign of corrosion problems on the unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Ammonium Bisulfide Corrosion  (Alkaline Sour Water)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.2.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Aggressive corrosion occurring in hydroprocessing reactor effluent streams and in units handling
alkaline sour water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Several major failures have occurred in hydroprocessing reactor effluent systems due to localized
corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.2.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbon steel is less resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
300 Series SS, duplex SS, aluminum alloys and nickel base alloys are more resistant, depending on
ammonium bisulfide (NH 4 HS) concentration and velocity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.2.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
NH 4 HS concentration, H2S partial pressure, velocity and/or localized turbulence, pH, temperature,
alloy composition and flow distribution are all critical factors to consider.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion increases with increasing NH 4 HS concentration and increasing velocity. Below 2 wt %,
solutions are not generally corrosive.  Above 2 wt % NH 4 HS, solutions are increasingly corrosive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In hydroprocessing reactors, FCC reactors and coker furnaces, nitrogen in the feed is converted to
ammonia and reacts with H 2 S to form NH 4 HS.  NH 4 HS precipitates out of the gas phase in the
reactor effluent stream at temperatures below about 150°F (66°C), depending on the concentration
of NH 3  and H 2 S, and may cause fouling and plugging unless flushed away with wash water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
NH 4 HS salt deposits lead to underdeposit corrosion and fouling.  The salts are not corrosive unless
they become hydrated at which point they are very corrosive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Oxygen and iron in the wash water injected into hydroprocessing reactor effluent can lead to
increased corrosion and fouling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Presence of cyanides increases severity of corrosion in FCC gas plants, coker gas plants and sour
water stripper overheads by destroying the normally protective sulfide film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.2.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Hydroprocessing Units<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
NH 4 HS salts precipitate in the reactor effluent streams when temperatures drop to within the
range of 120°F to 150°F (49°C to 66°C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Fouling and/or velocity accelerated corrosion may be found at:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Air cooler header boxes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Inlet and outlet piping of air coolers, as well as exchanger tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Effluent separators, and piping into and out of the reactor effluent separators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
Sour water draw piping from reactor effluent separators; flashing may cause severe
erosion-corrosion downstream of control valves ( Figure 5-7 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Vapor line from the high pressure separators.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Hydrocarbon lines from reactor effluent separators due to entrained sour water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Stripper Column overhead sour water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
FCC Units<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NH 4 HS concentrations are usually less than 2 wt % but high velocities and/or the presence of
cyanides can remove protective iron sulfide scales.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
NH 4 HS rapidly corrodes admiralty brass tubes and other copper alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.2.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Good design practice should consist of symmetrical and hydraulically balanced flow in and out of air
cooled exchangers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Carefully review design and localized velocities as process conditions change, particularly as NH 4 HS
concentrations exceed 2 wt % and begin to approach 8 wt % or higher.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Maintain velocities within industry guidelines of 10 to 20 fps for carbon steel.  Carbon steel may be
susceptible to high corrosion rates above about 8 wt % NH 4 HS concentration<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Use resistant materials of construction (e.g. Alloy 825, duplex SS) at velocities above 20 fps,
depending on NH 4 HS concentration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Properly design and maintain water wash injection with low oxygen content; provide sufficient excess
water to ensure that an adequate amount of water remains as liquid to dilute the NH 4 HS salts. Use
proper injection spray nozzles and metallurgy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)

steels, 300 Series SS, Alloys 400, duplex SS, 800, and 825, Alloys 625 and C276 and titanium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.3.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Concentration (NH 3 , HCl, H 2 0 or amine salts), temperature and water availability are the critical
factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Ammonium chloride salts may precipitate from high temperature streams as they are cooled,
depending upon the concentration of NH 3  and HCl, and may corrode piping and equipment at
temperatures well above the water dewpoint [> 300°F (149°C)]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Ammonium chloride salts are hygroscopic, and readily absorb water.  A small amount of water can
lead to very aggressive corrosion [>100 mpy (>2.5 mm/y] .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Ammonium chloride and amine hydrochloride salts are highly water soluble, highly corrosive and
form an acidic solution when mixed with water.  Some neutralizing amines react with chlorides to
form amine hydrochlorides that can act in a similar fashion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Corrosion rates increase with increasing temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
When they deposit above the water dewpoint, a water wash injection may be required to dissolve the
salts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.3.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Crude Tower Overheads<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Tower top, top trays, overhead piping and exchangers may be subject to fouling and corrosion.
Deposits may occur in low flow zones due to ammonia and/or amine chloride salts condensing
from the vapor phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Top pumparound streams may be affected if ammonia or amine chloride salts are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Hydroprocessing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reactor effluent streams are subject to ammonium chloride salt fouling and corrosion.  Water
washing may be required if exchanger fouling or loss in duty occurs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Catalytic Reforming<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reactor effluent streams and the H 2  recycle system are subject to ammonium chloride salting and
corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
FCCU and coker fractionator overheads and top pumparounds are subject to ammonium chloride
corrosion and salting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.3.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The salts have a whitish, greenish or brownish appearance.  Water washing and/or steamout will
remove deposits so that evidence of fouling may not be evident during an internal visual inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion underneath the salts is typically very localized and results in pitting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion rates can be extremely high.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Accumulation of ammonium chloride salts can be very localized and the resulting corrosion may be
difficult to detect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
RT or UT thickness monitoring can be used to determine remaining wall thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Monitoring of the feed streams and effluent waters will give an indication of the amount of ammonia
and chlorides present, however process simulation may be required to determine the concentration
and dewpoint temperatures.  If the ammonium chloride salt deposition temperature has been
calculated, temperature monitoring and control may be effective for maintaining metal temperatures
above the salt deposition temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The presence of deposits is often detected when the pressure drop increases or the thermal
performance of exchangers has deteriorated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Corrosion probes or coupons can be useful, but the salt must deposit on the corrosion probe element
to detect the corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.4.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Hydrochloric acid (aqueous HCl) causes both general and localized corrosion and is very aggressive
to most common materials of construction across a wide range of concentrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Damage in refineries is most often associated with dew point corrosion in which vapors containing
water and hydrogen chloride condense from the overhead stream of a distillation, fractionation or
stripping tower. The first water droplets that condense can be highly acidic (low pH) and promote
high corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.4.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All common materials of construction used in refineries.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.4.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
HCl acid concentration, temperature and alloy composition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The severity of corrosion increases with increasing HCl concentration and increasing temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Aqueous HCl can form beneath deposits of ammonium chloride or amine hydrochloride salts in
exchangers and piping. The deposits readily absorb water from the process stream or from injected
wash water.  Hydrogen chloride is normally not corrosive in dry process streams, but becomes very
corrosive where water is available to form hydrochloric acid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Carbon steel and low alloy steels are subject to excessive corrosion when exposed to any
concentration of HCl acid that produces at pH below about 4.5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
300 series SS and 400 series SS are not usefully resistant to HCl at any concentration or
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Alloy 400, titanium and some other nickel base alloys have good resistance to dilute HCl acid in
many refinery applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
The presence of oxidizing agents (oxygen, ferric and cupric ions) will increase the corrosion rate,
particularly for alloy 400 and Alloy B-2.  Titanium performs well in oxidizing conditions but fails rapidly
in dry HCl service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.4.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>HCl corrosion is found in several units, especially crude and vacuum units, hydroprocessing units and
catalytic reformer units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Crude Unit<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
In the atmospheric tower overhead system, corrosion from HCl acid occurs as the first droplets
of water condense from the vapor stream off the top of the tower.  This water can have a very
low pH and can result in high rates of corrosion in piping, as well as exchanger shells, tubes
and header boxes, and cold dead legs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
HCl corrosion can also be a problem in the vacuum ejector and condensing equipment off the
top of the vacuum tower.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Hydroprocessing Units<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Chlorides may enter the unit as organic chloride in the hydrocarbon feed or with the recycle
hydrogen and react to form HCl.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Ammonium chloride salts can form in various parts of the unit including the effluent side of the
hot feed/effluent exchangers because both NH 3  and HCl are present or they may condense with
water in the effluent train.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

chloride stress corrosion cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.4.6
Prevention/Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Crude Units<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Optimize the crude oil tank water separation and withdrawal and crude desalting operation to
reduce chloride in the feed to the crude tower.  A common target is 20 ppm or fewer chlorides in
the overhead accumulator water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Upgrading carbon steel to nickel base alloys or titanium can reduce HCl acid corrosion
problems. Titanium tubes will solve most overhead condenser tube corrosion problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Water washing can be added to quench the overhead stream and to help dilute the condensing
hydrochloric acid concentration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Caustic injection downstream of the desalter is another common method used to reduce the
amount of HCl going overhead.  Proper design and operating guidelines must be used to avoid
caustic SCC and fouling in the feed preheat train.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Various combinations of ammonia, neutralizing amines and filming amines can be injected in
the atmospheric tower overhead line before the water dewpoint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Hydrodroprocessing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Minimize carryover of water and chloride salts from upstream units including neutralizing amine
hydrochloride salts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Minimize HCl in H 2  streams (e.g., install scrubbers or guard beds to remove Cl- ions from
hydrogen produced in catalytic reforming units).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Selective use of corrosion resistant nickel base alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Catalytic Reforming<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Same as hydroprocessing, but in addition, water washing the hydrocarbon stream has also
been used to remove the highly water soluble chlorides. Special care in the design and
operation of this equipment is recommended.  Minimizing water and/or oxygenates in the feed
will reduce stripping of chlorides from the catalyst.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Special adsorbents in chloride beds and chloride treaters can be used to remove chlorides from
the recycle hydrogen streams and from liquid hydrocarbon streams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.4.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>

High Temp H 2 /H 2 S Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.5.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The presence of hydrogen in H 2 S-containing hydrocarbon streams increases the severity of high
temperature sulfide corrosion at temperatures above about 500°F (260°C).  This form of sulfidation
usually results in a uniform loss in thickness associated with hot circuits in hydroprocessing units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.5.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order of increasing resistance: carbon steel, low alloy steels, 400 Series SS, and 300 Series SS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.5.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The major factors affecting high temperature sulfidation are the temperature, the presence of
hydrogen, the concentration of H 2 S and the alloy composition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Depending on the quantity of hydrogen that is present, corrosion rates may be significantly different
than those associated with high temperature sulfidation in the absence of hydrogen (see  4.4.2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Sulfidation rates increase with increasing H 2 S content and especially increasing temperature as
illustrated in  Figure 5-8 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Higher corrosion rates are found more in gas oil desulfurizers and hydrocrackers than naphtha
desulfurizers by a factor of almost ‘2’.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Susceptibility to sulfidation is determined by the chemical composition of the alloy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Increasing chromium content of the alloy improves resistance ( Figure 5-9 ). However, there is little
improvement with increasing chromium content until about 7-9Cr as shown by the relative rate
reduction factors in  Table 5-1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Chromium-containing nickel base alloys are similar to stainless steel. Similar levels of chromium
provide similar corrosion resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.5.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
This form of corrosion occurs in piping and equipment in units where high temperature H 2 /H 2 S
streams are found including all hydroprocessing units such desulfurizers, hydrotreaters and
hydrocracking units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Noticeable increases in corrosion may be found downstream of hydrogen injection points.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.5.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion will appear as a uniform loss in thickness from the process side and is accompanied by
the formation of an iron sulfide scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Scale is about 5 times the volume of lost metal and may be in multiple layers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The tightly adherent shiny gray scale attached to the surface may be mistaken for unaffected metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.5.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The corrosion damage is minimized by using alloys with high chromium content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The 300 Series SS such as Types 304L, 316L, 321 and 347 are highly resistant at service
temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.5.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
UT, VT and RT thickness readings are used to monitor loss in thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Actual operating temperatures should be verified in the field to compare against design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.6
Hydrofluoric (HF) Acid Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.6.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion by HF acid can result in high rates of general or localized corrosion and may be accompanied
by hydrogen cracking, blistering and/or HIC/SOHIC (see  5.1.2.3  and  5.1.2.4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.6.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbon steel, copper-nickel alloys, Alloy 400.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Other nickel base alloys such as Alloy C276 have also been used in some applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Low alloy steels, 300 Series SS and the 400 Series SS are susceptible to corrosion and/or cracking
and are generally not suitable for HF service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.6.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
HF acid concentration (water content), temperature, alloy composition and the presence of
contaminants including oxygen and sulfur compounds are the controlling factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Carbon steel forms a protective fluoride scale in dry concentrated acid.  Loss of the protective scale
through high velocities or turbulence, will result in greatly accelerated corrosion rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The presence of water can destabilize the fluoride scale and convert it into a voluminous
nonprotective scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The primary concern is the “HF-in-water” concentration of the acid phase.  Although the process
stream may be comprised primarily of hydrocarbon, the acid is considered as a separate phase.
Concentration is determined by the amount of water present in the acid phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Typical HF alkylation units operate with 1% to 3% water in the acid, equivalent to an HF-in-water
concentration of 97% to 99% and the temperatures are generally below 150 o F (66 o C).  Under these
conditions carbon steel is widely used for all equipment except where close tolerances are required
for operation (i.e., pumps, valves, instruments).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Corrosion rates increase with increasing temperature and decreasing HF concentration (increasing
water content) as shown in  Figures 5-10  to  5-11 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
In carbon steel, the “Residual Element” (RE) content of base metal and weld metal may have an
affect on corrosion rates in certain parts of the unit.  This  RE content refers  to  the  effect  of  trace
elements, primarily %C, %Cu, %Ni, %Cr that are present in carbon steel during the steel
manufacturing process (References 1- 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Industry guidelines regarding RE content have been developed and implemented into some industry
consensus standards as indicated below.  A more detailed discussion of these guidelines is outlined
in References 1 and 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
•    For Base Metal:          %C > 0.18 wt.% and %Cu + %Ni < 0.15 wt.%<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
•    For Weld Metal:          %Cu + %Ni + %Cr < 0.15 wt.%<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Oxygen contamination increases the corrosion rate of carbon steel and promotes accelerated
corrosion and SCC of Alloy 400.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.6.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Piping and equipment in the HF alkylation unit, flare piping and downstream units exposed to acid
carryover are also affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Most equipment is made from carbon steel with the exception of the HF acid rerun/regenerator tower
and the acid relief neutralizer vessel which are usually made partially or completely from Alloy 400.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
High corrosion rates have been observed:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
In piping and equipment operating above 150°F (66°C);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
In deadlegs including inlets to relief valves, as well as small bore vents and drains;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Condensing overhead vapors in piping and exchangers off top of  the Isostripper, Depropanizer
and HF Stripper/Propane Stripper;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
On flange faces;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Heat exchanger bundles that heat acid-containing streams such as the acid vaporizer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Severe fouling due to iron fluoride corrosion product has been observed in the piping, heat
exchangers and in the tops of the Isostripper and Depropanizer towers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.6.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion is in the form of localized general or severe thinning of carbon steel.  Preferential corrosion
may not always conform to behavior predicted by the RE guidelines in API RP 751 ( Figure 5-12  to  5-
15 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion may be accompanied by cracking due to hydrogen stress cracking, blistering and/or
HIC/SOHIC damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Significant fouling due to iron fluoride scales may also accompany corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Alloy 400 shows uniform loss in thickness but is not accompanied by significant scaling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Alloy 400 is susceptible to stress corrosion cracking when in contact with moist HF vapors in the
presence of oxygen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.6.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbon steel operating above 150° o F (66°C) should be closely monitored for loss in thickness and
may need to be upgraded to Alloy 400.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion can be prevented by careful operation of the unit to minimize water, oxygen, sulfur and
other contaminants in the feed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Maintain strict controls on the water content of the circulating acid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Alloy 400 (solid or clad) can be used to eliminate the problems associated with blistering and
HIC/SOHIC.  A stress relieving heat treatment is required to help minimize, but not eliminate, the
possibility of SCC ( Figure 5-16  to  5-18  ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Alloy C276 has been used where there have been cracking problems with Alloy 400.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.6.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
UT and RT are used to monitor for loss in thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Special emphasis programs to monitor small bore piping, flange face corrosion, blistering and
HIC/SOHIC are recommended as outlined in API RP 751.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Track and monitor RE content of carbon steel components in accordance with API 751 guidelines.
Inspect for the potential for localized corrosion of piping components and or welds in accordance
with API 751 and industry best practices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.7
Naphthenic Acid Corrosion (NAC)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.7.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A form of high temperature corrosion that occurs primarily in crude and vacuum units, and downstream
units that process certain fractions or cuts that contain naphthenic acids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.7.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel, low alloy steels, 300 Series SS, 400 Series SS and nickel base alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.7.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
NAC is a function of the naphthenic acid content (neutralization number), temperature, sulfur
content, velocity and alloy composition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Severity of corrosion increases with increasing acidity of the hydrocarbon phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Neutralization number or Total Acid Number (TAN) is a measure of the acidity (organic acid content)
as determined by various test methods such as ASTM D-664.  However, NAC corrosion is
associated with hot dry hydrocarbon streams that do not contain a free water phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The Total Acid Number (TAN) of the crude may be misleading because this family of acids has a
range of boiling points and tends to concentrate in various cuts. Therefore, NAC is determined by the
acidity of the actual stream not the crude charge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The various acids which comprise the naphthenic acid family can have distinctly different corrosivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
No widely accepted prediction methods have been developed to correlate corrosion rate with the
various factors influencing it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Sulfur promotes iron sulfide formation and has an inhibiting effect on NAC, up to a point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Naphthenic acids remove protective iron sulfide scales on the surface of metals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
NAC can be a particular problem with very low sulfur crudes with TAN’s as low as 0.10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
NAC normally occurs in hot streams above 425 o F (218 o C) but has been reported as low as 350 o F
(177 o C).  Severity increases with temperature up to about 750 o F (400 o C), however, NAC has been
observed in hot coker gas oil streams up to 800 o F (427 o C)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k)
Naphthenic acids are destroyed by catalytic reactions in downstream hydroprocessing and FCCU
units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l)
Alloys containing increasing amounts of molybdenum show improved resistance. A minimum of 2%
to 2.5% is required depending on the TAN of the whole crude and its side cuts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>m) Corrosion is most severe in two phase (liquid and vapor) flow, in areas of high velocity or turbulence,
and in distillation towers where hot vapors condense to form liquid phase droplets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.7.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Crude and vacuum heater tubes; crude and vacuum transfer lines; vacuum bottoms piping, AGO
circuits; HVGO and sometimes LVGO circuits. NAC has also been reported in the LCGO and HCGO
streams on delayed coking units processing high TAN feed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Piping systems are particularly susceptible in areas of high velocity, turbulence or change of flow
direction, such as pump internals, valves, elbows, tees and reducers as well as areas of flow
disturbance such as weld beads and thermowells.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Crude and vacuum tower internals may also be corroded in the flash zones, packing and internals
where high acid streams condense or high velocity droplets impinge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

_____________________________________________________________________________________________<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
NAC may be found in hot hydrocarbon streams downstream of the crude and vacuum units,
upstream of any hydrogen mix points.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.7.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
NAC is characterized by localized corrosion, pitting corrosion, or flow induced grooving in high
velocity areas ( Figure 5-19  and  Figure 5-20 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In low velocity condensing conditions, many alloys including carbon steel, low alloy steels and 400
Series SS may show uniform loss in thickness and/or pitting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.7.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For units and/or components of systems which have not been designed for resistance to NAC, the
options are to change or blend crudes, upgrade metallurgy, utilize chemical inhibitors or some
combination thereof.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
NAC can be reduced by blending crude to reduce the TAN and/or increase the sulfur content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Use alloys with higher molybdenum content for improved resistance ( Table 5-2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
High temperature NAC inhibitors have been used with moderate success, however potential
detrimental effects on downstream catalyst activity must be considered.  Inhibitors effectiveness
needs to be monitored carefully.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
For severe conditions, Type 317L stainless steel or other alloys with higher molybdenum content
may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.7.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
UT and RT are used for thickness monitoring but localized erosion may be difficult to locate so RT
should be the primary detection method followed by UT thickness measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Monitor TAN and sulfur content of the crude charge and side streams to determine the distribution of
acids in the various cuts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Electrical resistance corrosion probes and corrosion coupon racks can be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Streams can be monitored for Fe and Ni content to assess corrosion in the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Hydrogen probes have also been reported to detect NAC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.7.8
Related Mechanisms<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sulfidation is a competing and complimentary mechanism which must be considered in most situations
with NAC.  In cases where thinning is occurring, it is difficult to distinguish between NAC and sulfidation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Phosphoric Acid Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.9.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Phosphoric acid is most often used as a catalyst in polymerization units.  It can cause both pitting
corrosion and localized corrosion of carbon steels depending on water content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.9.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order of increasing resistance: carbon steel, 304L SS, 316L SS and Alloy 20.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Acid concentration, temperature and contaminants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Solid phosphoric acid catalysts are not corrosive to carbon steel unless free water is present.  When
water is present, severe corrosion of carbon steel may occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion rates increase with increasing temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Corrosion can penetrate a 1/4-inch thick steel tube in eight hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Most corrosion probably occurs during water washing operations at shutdowns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Contaminants, such as chlorides, can increase phosphoric acid corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.9.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Piping and equipment in the polymerization unit where water mixes with catalyst.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion is usually found in low velocity areas where there is little or no circulation such as piping

Sour Water Corrosion (Acidic)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.10.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion of steel due to acidic sour water containing H 2 S at a pH between 4.5 and 7.0. Carbon
dioxide (CO 2 ) may also be present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Sour waters containing significant amounts of ammonia, chlorides or cyanides may significantly
affect pH but are outside the scope of this section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.10.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Primarily affects carbon steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Stainless steels, copper alloys and nickel base alloys are usually resistant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.10.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
H 2 S content, pH, temperature, velocity and oxygen concentration are all critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The H 2 S concentration in the sour water is dependent on the H 2 S partial pressure in the gas phase
as well as temperature and pH.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
At a given pressure, the H 2 S concentration in the sour water decreases as temperature increases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Increasing concentrations of H 2 S tend to decrease solution pH down to about 4.5.  Streams with a
pH below 4.5 indicate the presence of a strong acid which would be the main corrosion concern (see
5.1.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Above a pH of about 4.5, a protective, thin iron sulfide layer limits the corrosion rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
In some instances at a pH above 4.5, a thicker, porous sulfide film layer can form.  This can promote
pitting under sulfide deposits. Typically, this does not affect the general corrosion rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Other contaminants have a significant affect on water pH.  For example, HCl and CO 2  lower pH
(more acidic).  Ammonia significantly increases pH and is more often associated with alkaline sour
water where the main concern is ammonia bisulfide corrosion (see  5.1.1.2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
The presence of air or oxidants may increase the corrosion and usually produces pitting or
underdeposit attacks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.10.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acid sour water corrosion is a concern in overhead systems of FCC and coker gas fractionation plants
with high H 2 S levels and low NH 3  levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.10.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion damage from acidic sour water is typically general thinning. However, localized corrosion
or localized underdeposit attack can occur, especially if oxygen is present. Corrosion in CO 2
containing environments may be accompanied by carbonate stress corrosion cracking (see  5.1.2.5 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
300 Series SS are susceptible to pitting attack and may experience crevice corrosion and/or chloride
stress corrosion cracking (see  4.5.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.10.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
300 Series SS can be used at temperatures below about 140 o F (60 o C) where Chloride Stress
Corrosion Cracking (CSCC) is not likely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Copper alloys and nickel alloys are generally not susceptible to acid sour water corrosion. However,
copper alloys are vulnerable to corrosion in environments with ammonia.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Evidence of locally thinned areas can be found using scanning ultrasonic thickness methods or
profile radiography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
For carbon steel, damage is usually in the form general thinning but may be highly localized to
specific areas of high velocity or turbulence, typically where a water phase is condensing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Process and corrosion monitoring are important aspects of a well-developed program to minimize

Sulfuric Acid Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.11.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sulfuric acid promotes general and localized corrosion of carbon steel and other alloys. Carbon steel heat

Aqueous Organic Acid Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.12.1
Description of Damage.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organic compounds present in some crude oils decompose in the crude furnace to form low molecular
weight organic acids which condense in distillation tower overhead systems.  They may also result from
additives used in upstream operations or desalting.  These naturally occurring acids may contribute
significantly to aqueous corrosion depending on the type and quantity of acids, and the presence of other
contaminants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.12.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All grades of carbon steel are affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
b)  Most other corrosion resistant alloys used in crude tower overhead systems are generally not
affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.12.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion is a function of the type and quantity of organic acids, metal temperature, fluid velocity,
system pH, and presence of other acids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The low molecular weight organic acids that are formed include formic acid, acetic acid, propionic
acid, and butyric acid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The lower molecular weight acids such as formic acid and acetic acid are the most corrosive.  They
are soluble in naphtha and are extracted into the water phase, once the water condenses, and
contribute to a reduction of pH.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The presence of organic acids will contribute to the overall demand for neutralizing chemicals but
their affects may be completely masked by the presence of other acids such as HCl, H 2 S, carbonic
acid and others.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Corrosion is most likely to be a problem where relatively ‘non-corrosive’ conditions exist in an
overhead system and there is a sudden increase in low molecular weight organic acids that reduces
the pH of the water in the overhead system requiring a potentially unexpected increase in neutralizer
demand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
The type and quantity of organic acids formed in the overhead system are crude specific.  One
source of acid is believed to be the result of thermal decomposition of naphthenic acids in the crude
may be precursors to light organic acid formation and that processing of higher TAN crudes may
increase organic acid in the overheads but very little published data is available on this subject.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Some of the higher molecular weight organic acids condense above the water dew point in overhead
systems but are generally not present in sufficient quantities to cause corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Light organic acids such as acetic acid are sometimes added to upstream dehydrators or desalters
to improve performance and inhibit calcium naphthenate salt deposition (Reference 2). Such acids
will vaporize in the crude preheat and furnace, and go up the column into the crude tower overhead
system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Other high molecular weight acids used as additives can thermally decompose at crude unit
temperatures forming volatile acidic species, such as acetic and formic acids.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
In general, these light organic acids do not generate the severity of corrosion associated with
inorganic acids such as HCl.   Table 5-3  shows the HCl equivalent factor for corrosion in overhead
systems.  To calculate the HCl equivalent of an organic acid, multiply the content of the organic acid
(in ppm-weight) by the factor for that acid, and result will be the equivalent content of HCl (in ppm).
This number can then be used to estimate the neutralizer demand in the overhead system, and the
additional neutralizer needed to compensate for organic acids in overhead systems.  Excess
neutralizer can lead to amine hydrochloride salts in overhead systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.12.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All carbon steel piping and process equipment in crude tower, vacuum tower and coker fractionator
overhead systems including heat exchangers, towers and drums are susceptible to damage where
acidic conditions occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Corrosion tends to occur where water accumulates or where hydrocarbon flow directs water droplets
against metal surfaces.  For example, the bottoms of overhead exchangers, separator drums, boots
of separator drums, elbows, tees, pumps, and downstream of control valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion is also sensitive to flow rate and will tend to be more severe in turbulent areas in piping
systems including overhead transfer lines, overhead condensers, separator drums, control valves,
pipe elbows and tees, exchanger tubes, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.12.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Light organic acid corrosion typically leaves the corroded surface smooth and damage may be
difficult to distinguish from corrosion by other acids in the overhead system.  It is sometimes
mistaken for HCl corrosion or carbonic acid corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In pipe or other equipment where there is significant flow, the surfaces are sometimes smoothly
grooved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.12.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Corrosion caused by light organic acids in crude unit overhead systems can be minimized through
the injection of a chemical neutralizing additive.  However, problems may arise when frequent
changes in crude blends lead to changes in neutralizer demand.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The TAN of the crudes being processed can be used as an initial guide to setting the neutralizer by
anticipating an increase in the acid concentration in the overhead system.  After a new crude is
processed, a review of analyses of water samples from the boot of the overhead separator drum can
be used to determine how much light organic acid reaches the overhead system optimize future
additions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Filming amines can be used to prevent corrosion if the filming amine selected does not react with the
organic acid.  However, using filming amines is not as effective as neutralization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Upgrading to corrosion-resistant alloys will prevent organic acid corrosion but the selection of
suitable materials should account for other potential damage mechanisms in the overhead system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.12.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
UT and RT inspection for loss in thickness are the most common methods of inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Long range UT techniques can also be used for long runs of pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
For carbon steel, damage is usually in the form of general thinning but may be highly localized where
a water phase is condensing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Environment-Assisted Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1
Polythionic Acid Stress Corrosion Cracking (PASCC)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
A form of stress corrosion cracking normally occurring during shutdowns, startups or during
operation when air and moisture are present.  Cracking is due to sulfur acids forming from sulfide
scale, air and moisture acting on sensitized austenitic stainless steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Usually adjacent to welds or high stress areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Cracking may propagate rapidly through the wall thickness of piping and components in a matter of
minutes or hours.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>300 Series SS, Alloy 600/600H and Alloy 800/800H.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
A combination of environment, material, and stress are required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Environment - Metallic components form a surface sulfide scale when exposed to sulfur
compounds.  The scale may react with air (oxygen) and moisture to form sulfur acids
(polythionic acid).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Material - The material must be in a susceptible or “sensitized” condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Stress - Residual or applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Affected alloys become sensitized during exposure to elevated temperatures during manufacture,
welding or high temperature service. “Sensitization” refers to the composition/time/temperature
dependent formation of chromium carbide in the grain boundaries of the metal.  Sensitization occurs
in the 750 o F to1500 o F (400°C to 815°C) temperature range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The carbon content and the thermal history of the alloy have a significant effect on sensitization
susceptibility.  Regular and controlled carbon grades of stainless steels such as types 304/304H and
316/316H are particularly susceptible to sensitizing in the weld HAZ.  Low carbon ”L” grades (<
0.03% C) are less susceptible and usually can be welded without sensitizing.  The L grades will not
sensitize provided long term operating temperatures do not exceed about 750°F (399 o C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Residual stresses in most components are usually sufficient to promote cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All units where sensitized alloys are used in sulfur-containing environments.  Commonly damaged
equipment includes heat exchanger tubes, furnace tubes and piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Fired heaters burning oil, gas, coke and most other sources of fuel may be affected depending on
sulfur levels in the fuel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Severe cases have been found in FCC units (air rings, plenums, slide valves, cyclone components,
expansion joint bellows and piping).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In hydroprocessing units (heater tubes, hot feed/effluent exchanger tubes, bellows).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Crude and coker units (piping).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Boilers and high temperature equipment exposed to sulfur-containing combustion products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Typically occurs next to welds, but can also occur in the base metal ( Figure 5-24 ).  It is usually quite
localized and may not be evident until a leak appears during start-up or, in some cases, operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracking propagates intergranularly ( Figure 5-25 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Corrosion or loss in thickness is usually negligible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
If equipment will be opened or exposed to air, preventive measures should be taken to minimize or
eliminate PASCC include flushing the equipment with alkaline or soda ash solution to neutralize
sulfur acids immediately after or during shutdown or purging with dry nitrogen or nitrogen/ammonia
during the shutdown to prevent air exposure.  Refer to guidelines in NACE RP0170.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
For furnaces, keep the firebox heated above the dewpoint to prevent acids from forming on heater
tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Low carbon grades such as 304L/316L/317L provide some measure of improvement over controlled
carbon grades.  The L grades will sensitize if exposed more than several hours above about 1000 o F
(538 o C) or long term above 750 o F (400 o C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Improved resistance to PASCC cracking can be achieved with modified versions of these alloys
containing small amounts of Ti and Nb.  Typically used are the chemically stabilized grades
(austenitic stainless steel types 321 and 347 and nickel base Alloys 825 and 625).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
ASTM specifications allow mill products to be shipped in a stabilized condition rather than solution
annealed.  This heat treatment will minimize potential sensitization problems especially with type
321.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
A thermal stabilization heat treatment at 1650 o F (899 o C) may be applied to chemically stabilized
austenitic stainless steel welds after all welding is complete in an attempt to reduce sensitization and
PTA susceptibility.  This heat treatment is difficult to apply in the field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Susceptibility to PASCC can be determined by laboratory corrosion testing according to ASTM A262
Practice C.  A sensitizing heat treatment is often applied to L and/or chemically stabilized grades
prior to testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
PT examination can be used to detect PASCC cracking ( Figure 5-24  through  Figure 5-28 ). However,
because the cracks are filled with a tight deposit, flapper disc sanding may be needed to improve the
PT sensitivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
PASCC cracking can be an inspection challenge because the cracking may not occur until well into a
turnaround.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Monitoring for PASCC cracking during operation is not usually practical. Conditions causing the
cracking are not usually present while operating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Amine Stress Corrosion Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.2.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Amine cracking is a common term applied to the cracking of steels under the combined action of
tensile stress and corrosion in aqueous alkanolamine systems used to remove/absorb H 2 S and/or
CO 2  and their mixtures from various gas and liquid hydrocarbon streams.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Amine cracking is a form of alkaline stress corrosion cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
It is most often found at or adjacent to non-PWHT’d carbon steel weldments or in highly cold worked
parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Amine cracking should not be confused with several other types of SCC that can occur in amine
environments which are further described in  5.1.2.3  and  5.1.2.5 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.2.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Carbon steel and low alloy steels.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.2.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The critical factors are the level of tensile stress, amine concentration and temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracking is associated with residual stresses from welding, cold working or fabrication that have not
been removed through an effective stress-relieving heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Cracking is more likely to occur in lean MEA and DEA services but is also found in most amines
including MDEA and DIPA (ADIP).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Cracking has been reported down to ambient temperatures with some amines. Increasing
temperature and stress levels increases the likelihood and severity of cracking.  Refer to API RP 945
for guidelines on PWHT requirements for various amine services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Amine cracking is most often associated with lean amine services.  The pure alkanolamine does not
cause cracking. Cracking in rich amine services are most often associated with wet H2S problems
(see  5.1.2.3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Cracking can occur in non-PWHT’d piping and equipment as a result exposure to steamout and to
short-term amine carryover.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Amine concentration does not appear to have a significant effect on the propensity for cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Some refiners believe cracking will not occur below an amine concentration of about 2% to 5%.
However, local enrichment and steamout can reduce this limit and some plants have used lower
limits down to 0.2%.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Amine cracking results in surface breaking flaws that initiate on the ID of piping and equipment
primarily in the weld HAZ but has also been found in weld metal and high stress areas adjacent to
the HAZ.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracking typically develops parallel to the weld and there may be parallel cracks.  In weld metal, the
cracks are either transverse or longitudinal with the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
At set-on nozzles, the cracks are radial in the base metal, i.e., they fan out from the bore.  At set-in
nozzles, the cracks are usually parallel to the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Since the driving force for cracking is residual stress, cracks are often found on the process side,
opposite external attachment welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Positive identification of amine cracking can be confirmed by metallographic analysis.  The cracking
is typically intergranular, oxide filled with some branching ( Figure 5-29  through  Figure 5-32 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Although cracks may be seen visually, crack detection is best performed with WFMT or ACFM
techniques.  Surface preparation by grit blasting, high pressure water blasting or other methods is
required for WFMT but may not be necessary for ACFM.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
PT is usually not effective in finding tight and/or scale filled cracks and should not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
If the cracks have minimum branching, crack depths can be measured with a suitable UT technique
including external SWUT.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Wet H 2 S Damage (Blistering/HIC/SOHIC/SSC)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.3.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section describes four types of damage that result in blistering and/or cracking of carbon steel and
low alloy steels in wet H 2 S environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Hydrogen Blistering<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydrogen blisters may form as surface bulges on the ID, the OD or within the wall thickness of a pipe
or pressure vessel.  The blister results from hydrogen atoms that form during the sulfide corrosion
process on the surface of the steel, that diffuse into the steel, and collect at a discontinuity in the
steel such as an inclusion or lamination.  The hydrogen atoms combine to form hydrogen molecules
that are too large to diffuse out and the pressure builds to the point where local deformation occurs,
forming a blister.  Blistering results from hydrogen generated by corrosion, not hydrogen gas from
the process stream.  ( Figure 5-34  and  Figure 5-35 .)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Hydrogen Induced Cracking (HIC)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydrogen blisters can form at many different depths from the surface of the steel, in the middle of the
plate or near a weld.  In some cases, neighboring or adjacent blisters that are at slightly different
depths (planes) may develop cracks that link them together.  Interconnecting cracks between the
blisters often have a stair step appearance, and so HIC is sometimes referred to as “stepwise
cracking” ( Figure 5-36 ,  Figure 5-37  and  Figure 5-38 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Stress Oriented Hydrogen Induced Cracking (SOHIC)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SOHIC is similar to HIC but is a potentially more damaging form of cracking which appears as arrays
of cracks stacked on top of each other.  The result is a through-thickness crack that is perpendicular
to the surface and is driven by high levels of stress (residual or applied).  They usually appear in the
base metal adjacent to the weld heat affected zones where they initiate from HIC damage or other
cracks or defects including sulfide stress cracks ( Figure 5-39  and  Figure 5-40 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC) is defined as cracking of metal under the combined action of tensile
stress and corrosion in the presence of water and H 2 S.  SSC is a form of hydrogen stress cracking
resulting from absorption of atomic hydrogen that is produced by the sulfide corrosion process on the
metal surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SSC can initiate on the surface of steels in highly localized zones of high hardness in the weld metal
and heat affected zones.  Zones of high hardness can sometimes be found in weld cover passes and
attachment welds which are not tempered (softened) by subsequent passes.  PWHT is beneficial in
reducing the hardness and residual stresses that render steel susceptible to SSC.  High strength
steels are also susceptible to SSC but these are only used in limited applications in the refining
industry.  ( Figure 5-42  and  Figure 5-43 ).  Some carbon steels contain residual elements that form
hard areas in the heat affected zones that will not temper at normal stress relieving temperatures.
Using preheat helps minimize these hardness problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.3.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel and low alloy steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.3.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The most important variables that affect and differentiate the various forms of wet H 2 S damage are
environmental conditions (pH, H 2 S level, contaminants, temperature), material properties (hardness,
microstructure, strength) and tensile stress level (applied or residual).  These factors are outlined
below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

_____________________________________________________________________________________________<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
All of these damage mechanisms are related to the absorption and permeation of hydrogen in steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
pH<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Hydrogen permeation or diffusion rates have been found to be minimal at pH 7 and
increase at both higher and lower pH.  The presence of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the
water phase significantly increases permeation in alkaline (high pH) sour water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Conditions which are known to promote blistering, HIC, SOHIC and SSC are those
containing free water (in liquid phase) and:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
>50 wppm dissolved H 2 S in the free water, or
•
free water with pH <4 and some dissolved H 2 S present, or
•
free water with pH >7.6 and 20 wppm dissolved hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the water
and some dissolved H 2 S present, or
•
>0.0003 MPa (0.05 psia) partial pressure of H 2 S in the gas phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Increasing levels of ammonia may push the pH higher into the range where cracking can
occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
H 2 S<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Hydrogen permeation increases with increasing H 2 S partial pressure due to a concurrent
increase in the H 2 S concentration in the water phase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
An arbitrary value of 50 wppm H 2 S in the water phase is often used as the defining
concentration where wet H 2 S damage becomes a problem. However, there are cases
where cracking has occurred at lower concentrations or during upset conditions where wet
H 2 S was not ordinarily anticipated. The presence of as little as 1 wppm of H 2 S in the water
has been found to be sufficient to cause hydrogen charging of the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Susceptibility to SSC increases with increasing H 2 S partial pressures above about 0.05 psi
(0.0003 Mpa) H 2 S in steels with a tensile strength above about 90 ksi or in steels with
localized zones of weld or weld HAZ hardness above 237 HB.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
Temperature<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Blistering, HIC, and SOHIC damage have been found to occur between ambient and 300 o F
(150 o C) or higher.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
SSC generally occurs below about 180 o F (82 o C).  However, equipment operating above this
temperature are susceptible to SSC if there is an aqueous phase with H 2 S as outlined
above.  Some  susceptible  equipment  can  fail even during short sour water excursions
such as those encountered during equipment shutdowns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Hydrogen charging potential increases with increasing temperature if the aqueous phase is
not eliminated by elevated temperature.  Elevated temperature promotes  dissociation  of
H 2 S  (thereby producing  more  monatomic  hydrogen), together with an increase in the
diffusion rates of hydrogen in metals, resulting in increased level of hydrogen charging.
However, the SSC cracking potential is maximized at near-ambient temperature. This
distinction is important because metals can become charged during high-temperature
exposure and subsequently crack during excursions to lower temperatures (Reference 8).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Hardness<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Hardness is primarily an issue with SSC.  Typical low-strength carbon steels used in
refinery applications should be controlled to produce weld hardness <200 HB in accordance
with NACE RP0472.  These steels are not generally susceptible to SSC unless localized
zones of hardness above 237 HB are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
The time to failure by SSC decreases as material strength, applied tensile   stress, and
environmental charging potential increase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Blistering, HIC and SOHIC damage are not related to steel hardness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Steelmaking<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Blistering and HIC damage are strongly affected by the presence of inclusions and
laminations which provide sites for diffusing hydrogen to accumulate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Steel chemistry and manufacturing methods also affect susceptibility and can be tailored to
produce the HIC resistant steels outlined in NACE Publication 8X194.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Improving steel cleanliness and processing to minimize blistering and HIC damage may still
leave the steel susceptible to SOHIC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
The disadvantage is that an absence of visual blistering may leave a false sense of security
that H 2 S damage is not active yet subsurface SOHIC damage may be present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
HIC is often found in so-called “dirty” steels with high levels of inclusions or other internal
discontinuities from the steel-making process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6)
PWHT<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Blistering and HIC damage develop without applied or residual stress so that PWHT will not
prevent them from occurring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
High local stresses or notch-like discontinuities such as shallow sulfide stress cracks can
serve as initiation sites for SOHIC.  PWHT is highly effective in preventing or eliminating
SSC by reduction of both hardness and residual stress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
SOHIC is driven by localized stresses so that PWHT is also somewhat effective in reducing
SOHIC damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.3.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Blistering, HIC, SOHIC and SSC damage can occur throughout the refinery wherever there is a wet
H 2 S environment present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
In hydroprocessing units, increasing concentration of ammonium bisulfide above 2% increases the
potential for blistering, HIC and SOHIC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Cyanides significantly increase the probability and severity of blistering, HIC and SOHIC damage.
This is especially true for the vapor recovery sections of the fluid catalytic cracking and delayed
coking units.  Typical locations include fractionator overhead drums, fractionation towers, absorber
and stripper towers, compressor interstage separators and knockout drums and various heat
exchangers, condensers, and coolers. Sour water stripper and amine regenerator overhead systems
are especially prone to wet H 2 S damage because of generally high ammonia bisulfide concentrations
and cyanides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
SSC is most likely found in hard weld and heat affected zones and in high strength components
including bolts, relief valve springs, 400 Series SS valve trim, compressor shafts, sleeves and
springs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.3.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All four forms of wet H 2 S damage are best illustrated though the pictures and diagrams shown in
Figure 5-34  through  Figure 5-43 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Hydrogen blisters appear as bulges on the ID or OD surface of the steel and can be found anywhere
in the shell plate or head of a pressure vessel.  Blistering has been found on rare occasions in pipe
and very rarely in the middle of a weld.  HIC damage can occur wherever blistering or subsurface
laminations are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In pressure-containing equipment, SOHIC and SSC damage is most often associated with the
weldments.  SSC can also be found at any location where zones of high hardness are found in
vessels or in high strength steel components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

damage including alloy cladding and coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Process changes that affect the pH of the water phase and/or ammonia or cyanide concentration can
help to reduce damage.  A common practice is to utilize wash water injection to dilute the HCN
concentration, for example, in FCC gas plants. Cyanides can be converted to harmless thiocyanates
by injecting dilute streams of ammonium polysulfides. Injection facilities require careful design.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
HIC-resistant steels can be used to minimize the susceptibility to blistering and HIC damage.
Detailed materials and fabrication guidance can be found in NACE Publication 8X194.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
SSC can generally be prevented by limiting the hardness of welds and heat affected zones to 200
HB maximum through preheat, PWHT, weld procedures and control of carbon equivalents.
Depending on the service environment, small zones of hardness up to 22 HRC should be resistant to
SSC.   Refer to NACE RP0472 for additional details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
PWHT can also help to minimize susceptibility to SOHIC.  PWHT has limited value in preventing
blistering and HIC damage from initiating but is beneficial in reducing residual stresses and strength
levels that might otherwise contribute to crack propagation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Specialized corrosion inhibitors can be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.3.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Process conditions should be evaluated by process engineers and corrosion/materials specialists to
identify piping and equipment where conditions are most likely to promote wet H 2 S damage.  Field
sampling of the free water phase should be performed on a periodic or as-needed basis to monitor
conditions or changes in conditions, particularly if water washing or polysulfide injection is used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Inspection for wet H 2 S damage generally focuses on weld seams and nozzles.  Since the
consequences can be severe, refineries generally have a procedure to prioritize and execute
inspection for this type of damage.  General notes on inspection for wet H 2 S damage are included
below.  However, for the development of more detailed inspection plans including methods,
coverage and surface preparation, the reader is directed to extensive recommendations on detection
and repair outlined in NACE RP0296.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Although cracks may be seen visually, crack detection is best performed with WFMT, EC, RT or
ACFM techniques.  Surface preparation by grit blasting, high pressure water blasting or other
methods is usually required for WFMT but not for ACFM.  PT cannot find tight cracks and should not
be depended on.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
UT techniques including external SWUT can be used.  SWUT is especially useful for volumetric
inspection and crack sizing. Electrical resistance instruments are not effective for measuring crack
depth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Grinding out the crack or removal by thermal arc gouging is a viable method of crack depth
determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
AET can be used for monitoring crack growth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

SSC is a form of hydrogen stress cracking (hydrogen embrittlement).  Refer to  4.5.6 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Amine cracking (see  5.1.2.2 ) and carbonate cracking (see  5.1.2.5 ) can also occur in wet H 2 S
environments, may be similar in appearance, and are sometimes confused with the various forms of
wet H 2 S damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Hydrogen Stress Cracking - HF<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.4.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydrogen Stress Cracking is a form of environmental cracking that can initiate on the surface of high
strength low alloy steels and carbon steels with highly localized zones of high hardness in the weld metal
and HAZ as a result of exposure to aqueous HF acid environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.4.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel and low alloy steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.4.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Steel hardness, strength and stress are the critical factors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Susceptibility increases with increasing hardness. Hardness levels above Rockwell C 22 (237 BHN)
are highly susceptible. Time-to-failure decreases as the hardness increases (higher strength
materials).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Under high levels of applied or residual tensile stress (from cold-forming or welding) embrittlement
results in cracking of susceptible steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Cracking may occur very rapidly, within hours after exposure to the HF environment, or considerable
time may pass before cracking initiates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Hard microstructures may arise in welds, particularly in low heat input welds in the heat affected
zones, in low alloy steels, or may result from inadequate heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.4.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
All piping and equipment exposed to HF acid at any concentration with hardness levels above the
recommended limit are subject to hydrogen stress cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
High strength low alloy steels such as ASTM A193-B7 bolts and compressor components are
susceptible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
ASTM A193B7M bolts are also susceptible if overtorqued.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.4.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
This mode of cracking can only be confirmed by metallographic examination.  The cracking will be
intergranular.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Produces surface breaking cracks, usually associated with weldments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.4.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
PWHT is beneficial in reducing the hardness and residual stresses that render a steel susceptible to
SSC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Typical low-strength carbon steels used in refinery applications should be controlled to produce weld
hardness <200 HB in accordance with NACE SP0472.  These steels are not generally susceptible to
SCC unless localized zones of hardness above 237 HB are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Use carbon steels with Carbon Equivalents (CE) less than 0.43. Where CE is defined as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>CE = %C + %Mn/6+ %(Cr + Mo + V)/5 + %(Cu + Ni)/15<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
ASTM A193 grade B7M bolts are softer and lower strength than B7 bolts and are more resistant to
cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Alloy cladding or nonmetallic coatings that provide an effective barrier and protect the surface of the
steel from hydrogen permeation will prevent cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.5
Carbonate Stress Corrosion Cracking (ACSCC)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.5.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbonate stress corrosion cracking (often referred to as carbonate cracking) is the term applied to
surface breaking cracks that occur adjacent to carbon steel welds under the combined action of tensile
stress in systems containing a free water phase with carbonate, where some amount of H 2 S is also
present.  It is a form of Alkaline Stress Corrosion Cracking (ACSCC).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This type of damage has also been observed in other environments which are outside the scope of this
discussion.  Those environments include the outside surface of buried pipelines; and piping and
equipment containing aqueous carbonate solutions   (e.g., potassium carbonate) used in the carbon
dioxide (CO 2 ) removal facilities associated with hydrogen reformers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.5.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel and low alloy steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.5.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The residual stress level of carbon steel and the water chemistry are the critical factors that
determine the likelihood of carbonate cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Carbonate stress corrosion cracking can occur at relatively low levels of residual stress but usually
occurs at welds or cold worked areas that have not been stress relieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Additional details of water chemistry affecting susceptibility in FCC units are outlined below.  More
detailed information can be found in a NACE industry review published in 2008 (Reference 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Water - In all areas in which ACSCC has been reported, there has been a separate liquid water
phase present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
pH - The pH of the sour water is a critical factor; most failures have occurred in the range of pH
8 to 10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
H 2 S – Cracking occurs where alkaline water is present.  Although H 2 S is often present, no
threshold level has been established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Ammonia - NH 3  in the sour water is usually higher in cases  where ACSCC  has been observed
than in cases with no ACSCC (e.g., 4,800 ppmw vs. 2,500 pmmw).  Increasing NH 3  and
decreasing H 2 S together increase the likelihood   of ACSCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Carbonate ion concentration – Cracking occurs above a certain threshold concentration.  It has
been suggested that levels above 100 ppmw can cause ACSCC, depending on the pH of the
system.  However, specific guidelines are difficult to define, largely as a result of the difficulty of
sampling for carbonate ions and the lack of available data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6)
Cyanides – Cracking can occur with or without the presence of cyanides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7)
Polysulfides - There is  no  evidence  to suggest  that ammonium polysulfide injection increases
or  decreases the potential for ACSCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
FCCU feed quality and unit operation appear to have an effect on cracking susceptibility:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Feed Nitrogen - The  total  nitrogen in FCCU feed is usually higher  in  cases  where  ACSCC
has been observed than  in  cases  with  no  ACSCC  (e.g., 2,645 ppmw   vs.  940 ppmw).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
Feed Sulfur – In general, cracking is associated with low sulfur FCCU feeds as opposed to high
sulfur feeds.  Susceptibility to cracking appears to be much more likely with hydrotreated feed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
N to S ratio – Most cases of ACSCC have been associated with N/S ratio in the FCCU feed of 0
to 70<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
Full burn vs. partial burn – The likelihood of cracking occurring in the FCC Regenerator partial-
burn mode is approximately the same as full burn mode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
In CO 2  removal units, cracking may occur when the CO 2  content is above 2% and temperatures
exceed 200 o F (93 o C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.5.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbonate cracking has been most prevalent in the fluid catalytic cracking unit main fractionator
overhead condensing and reflux system, the downstream wet gas compression system, and the sour
water systems emanating from these areas.  Both piping and vessels are affected.  See  Figure 5-44
and  5-45  for typical locations where cracking has occurred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Carbonate cracking has also been observed in SWS units of the side-pumparound type in the
pumparound return line to the SWS tower; on the OD (process side) of highly cold worked SA179
condenser tube u-bends; and in the floor of tank storing sour water from an FCC unit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Carbonate cracking has also occurred in piping and equipment in potassium carbonate in Catacarb
and CO 2  removal facilities of hydrogen manufacturing units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.5.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Carbonate cracking typically propagates parallel to the weld in the heat-affected zone, or adjacent
base metal within 2 inches (50 mm) of the weld.  At least two cases have been reported to occur
more than 3 inches away (80 mm) in highly cold worked fittings including an elbow and reducer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracking can also occur in the weld deposit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The pattern of cracking observed on the steel surface is sometimes described as a spider web of
small cracks, which often initiate at or interconnect with weld-related flaws that serve as local stress
raisers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
These cracks may be easily mistaken for SSC or SOHIC, however, the carbonate cracks are usually
further from the toe of the weld and have multiple parallel cracks ( Figure 5-46  to  Figure 5-47 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Carbonate cracks are surface breaking flaws that are predominantly intergranular in nature and
typically occur in as-welded carbon steel fabrications as a network of very fine, oxide-filled cracks
similar in appearance to caustic stress corrosion cracking and amine stress corrosion cracking.  See
Figures 5-48  to  Figure 5-55 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.5.6
Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Application of a post-fabrication stress-relieving heat treatment of 1200 o F to 1225°F (649 o C to
663 o C) in accordance with WRC 452 (Reference 8) is a proven method of preventing carbonate
cracking.  Heat treatment requirements apply to repair welds as well as internal and external
attachment welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Cracking can be eliminated through the use of effective barrier coatings, solid or clad 300 Series SS,
Alloy 400 or other corrosion resistant alloys in lieu of carbon steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Water wash non-PWHT piping and equipment prior to steamout or heat treatment in hot carbonate
systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
A metavanadate inhibitor can be used in hot carbonate systems in CO 2  removal units in hydrogen
manufacturing units to prevent cracking.  Proper dosing and oxidation of the inhibitor must be
maintained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.5.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Monitoring the pH of FCC sour waters is the fastest and most practical and cost effective method to
locate areas where there is a potential for ASCC to occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The cracking can involve sporadic and rapid growth, depending on subtle changes in the process.
Periodic monitoring of CO3 -2  concentration in FCC sour waters should be done to determine
cracking susceptibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Although cracks may be seen visually, crack detection is best performed with WFMT or ACFM
techniques.  Surface preparation by grit blasting, high pressure water blasting or other methods is
usually required for WFMT.  PT usually cannot find tight or scale filled cracks and should not be
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
There is usually much branching so crack depths may be measured with a suitable UT technique
including external SWUT.  Electrical resistance type instruments that measure crack depth are not
effective because  the cracks typically contain magnetic iron oxide.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
This cracking is not susceptible to extension by grinding.  Grinding out the cracks is a viable method
of crack depth determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
AET can be used for monitoring crack growth and locating growing cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbonate cracking is more properly termed carbonate stress corrosion cracking and is a form of Alkaline
Stress Corrosion Cracking (ASCC).  Amine cracking (see  5.1.2.2 ) and caustic stress corrosion cracking
(see  4.5.3 ) are two other similar forms of ASCC.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1
High Temperature Hydrogen Attack (HTHA)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
High temperature hydrogen attack results from exposure to hydrogen at elevated temperatures and
pressures.  The hydrogen reacts with carbides in steel to form methane (CH 4 ) which cannot diffuse
through the steel.  The loss of carbide causes an overall loss in strength.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Methane pressure builds up, forming bubbles or cavities, microfissures and fissures that may
combine to form cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Failure can occur when the cracks reduce the load carrying ability of the pressure containing part.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order of increasing resistance: carbon steel, C-0.5Mo, Mn-0.5Mo, 1Cr-0.5Mo, 1.25Cr-0.5Mo, 2.25Cr-
1Mo, 2.25Cr-1Mo-V, 3Cr-1Mo, 5Cr-0.5Mo and similar steels with variations in chemistry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For a specific material, HTHA is dependent on temperature, hydrogen partial pressure, time and
stress. Service exposure time is cumulative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
HTHA is preceded by a period of time when no noticeable change in properties is detectable by
normal inspection techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The incubation period is the time period during which enough damage has occurred to be measured
with available inspection techniques and may vary from hours at very severe conditions to many
years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Figure 5-56  contains curves that show a temperature/hydrogen partial pressure safe operating
envelope for carbon and low alloy steels. Additional information on HTHA can be found in API RP
941.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
The curves are reasonably conservative for carbon steel up to about 10,000 psi hydrogen partial
pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
300 Series SS, as well as 5Cr, 9Cr and 12 Cr alloys, are not susceptible to HTHA at conditions
normally seen in refinery units.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1.4
Affected Units<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Hydroprocessing units, such as hydrotreaters (desulfurizers) and hydrocrackers, catalytic reformers,
hydrogen producing units and hydrogen cleanup units, such as pressure swing absorption units, are
all susceptible to HTHA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Boiler tubes in very high pressure steam service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,``,`,````,``,``,````,,,``-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
HTHA can be confirmed through the use of specialized techniques including metallographic analysis
of damaged areas as described below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The hydrogen/carbon reaction can cause surface decarburization of steel. If the diffusion of carbon
to the surface is limiting, the reaction can result in internal decarburization, methane formation and
cracking ( Figures 5-57  to  5-59 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In the early stages of HTHA, bubbles/cavities can be detected in samples by a scanning microscope,
although it may be difficult to tell the difference between HTHA cavities and creep cavities. Some
refinery services expose low alloy steels to both HTHA and creep conditions.  Early stages of HTHA
can only be confirmed through advanced metallographic analysis of damaged areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In later stages of damage, decarburization and/or fissures can be seen by examining samples under
a microscope and may sometimes be seen by in-situ metallography ( Figure 5-60  and  5-61 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Cracking and fissuring are intergranular and occur adjacent to pearlite (iron carbide) areas in carbon
steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Some blistering may be visible to the naked eye, due to either molecular hydrogen or methane
accumulating in laminations in the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1.6
Prevention/Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Use alloy steels with chromium and molybdenum to increase carbide stability thereby minimizing
methane formation.  Other carbide stabilizing elements include tungsten and vanadium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Normal design practice is to use a 25 o F to 50 o F (14 o C to 28 o C) safety factor approach when using
the API RP 941 curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
While the curves have served the industry well, there have been several failures of C-0.5Mo steels in
refinery service under conditions that were previously considered safe. C-0.5Mo carbide stability
under HTHA conditions may be due at least in part to the different carbides formed during the
various heat treatments applied to the fabricated equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
As a result of the problems with the 0.5 Mo alloy steels, its curve has been removed from the main
set of curves and the material is not  recommended for new construction in hot hydrogen services.
For existing equipment, this concern has prompted an economic review of inspection cost versus
replacement with a more suitable alloy.  Inspection is very difficult because problems have occurred
in weld heat affected zones as well as base metal away from welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
300 Series SS overlay and/or roll bond clad material is used in hydrogen service where the base
metal does not have adequate sulfidation resistance.  Although it is recognized that properly
metallurgically bonded austenitic overlay/clad will decrease the hydrogen partial pressure seen by
the underlying metal, most refiners make sure the base metal has adequate resistance to HTHA
under service conditions.  In some cases, refiners take the decrease in partial pressure into account
when evaluating the need for hydrogen outgassing while shutting down heavy wall equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Damage may occur randomly in welds or weld heat affected zones as well as the base metal,
making monitoring and detection of HTHA in susceptible materials extremely difficult.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Ultrasonic techniques using a combination of velocity ratio and AUBT have been the most successful
in finding fissuring and/or serious cracking.  HTHA damage can only be found using these
techniques if damage has progressed to the point where microvoids would be visible at a
magnification of 1500X or lower, if a sample of the metal was removed for examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
HTHA can occur in the base metal at locations remote from welds.  In clad vessels, in particular,
HTHA damage can occur in base metal at locations where cladding has become disbonded.  Bulging
of the cladding away from the underlying base metal may be a tell tale sign that HTHA has occurred.
Localized damage under cladding might be overlooked if inspection methods focus only on the weld
seams and nozzles (Reference 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In-situ metallography can only detect microfissuring, fissuring and decarburization near the surface.
However, most equipment has decarburized surfaces due to the various heat treatments used during
fabrication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Visual inspection for blisters on the inside surface may indicate methane formation and potential
HTHA.  However, HTHA may frequently occur without the formation of surface blisters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Other conventional forms of inspection, including WFMT and RT, are severely limited in their ability
to detect anything except the advanced stages of damage where cracking has already developed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Titanium Hydriding<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.2.1
Description of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydriding of titanium is a metallurgical phenomenon in which hydrogen diffuses into the titanium and
reacts to form an embrittling hydride phase. This can result in a complete loss of ductility with no
noticeable sign of corrosion or loss in thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.2.2
Affected Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Titanium alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.2.3
Critical Factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The critical factors are metal temperature, solution chemistry and alloy composition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
This is a phenomenon that occurs in specific environments at temperatures above 165 o F (74 o C) and
at a pH below 3, pH above 8 or neutral pH with high H 2 S content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Galvanic contact between titanium and more active materials such as carbon steel and 300 Series
SS promotes damage.  However, hydriding can occur in the absence of a galvanic coupling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Embrittlement occurs over a period of time as hydrogen is absorbed by the component and reacts to
form embrittling hydride phases.  The depth and extent of hydriding will continue to increase until a
complete loss of ductility results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Hydriding has also occurred in some chemical environments as a result of the corrosion of iron which
has been accidentally embedded into the surface of titanium during fabrication.  Corrosion of iron
and iron sulfide scale in the process streams brought in from upstream units can result in hydrogen
pickup.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
The solubility of hydrogen in pure titanium and alpha-beta alloys is limited (50 - 300 ppm) and once
this is exceeded, hydride is formed. Beta alloys, on the other hand, are more tolerant of hydrogen
and 2000 ppm can be tolerated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.2.4
Affected Units or Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Damage has occurred primarily in sour water strippers and amine units in the overhead condensers,
heat exchanger tubes, piping and other titanium equipment operating above about 165 ° F (74 ° C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Hydriding can also occur in hydrogen atmospheres at temperatures >350°F (177 ° C), especially in
the absence of moisture or oxygen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Cathodically protected equipment with protection potentials <-0.9 v SCE.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.2.5
Appearance or Morphology of Damage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Titanium hydriding is a metallurgical change that is not readily apparent, and can only be confirmed
through metallurgical techniques ( Figure 5-62 ,  Figure 5-63  and  Figure 5-64 ) or mechanical testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
A quick test for embrittlement is a bend test or a crush test in a vice.  Unaffected titanium will be
crushed in a ductile fashion while embrittled components will crack and/or shatter with little or no sign
of ductility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Heat exchanger tubes that have become embrittled may remain intact until disturbed by removal of
the bundle for inspection.  The tubes crack as the bundle flexes when it is removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Cracking can occur if there is an attempt to re-roll tube ends that have become embrittled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Another possible damage mode that has occurred is ignition and fire of titanium tubes.
Metallographic examination of titanium tubes from a bundle that burned showed significant amounts
of hydride, especially in the vicinity of the metal that had been melted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Prevention / Mitigation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Titanium should not be used in known hydriding services such as amine or sour water, where the
possibility of a leak is not acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Where galvanic contact has promoted hydriding, the problem can be avoided by using all titanium
construction or by electrically isolating the titanium from non-titanium components.  Eliminating the
galvanic couple may not prevent hydriding in alkaline sour water environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.2.7
Inspection and Monitoring<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Specialized eddy current techniques are reported to have been able to detect hydriding damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
There are no other techniques to monitor or inspect for titanium hydriding other than the metallurgical
and/or mechanical methods mentioned above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.1
Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API will consider written requests for interpretations of API Recommended Practice 571. The API staff will
make such interpretations in writing after consulting, if necessary, with the appropriate committee officers
and committee members.  The API committee responsible for maintaining RP 571 meets regularly to
consider written requests for interpretations and revisions and to develop new criteria dictated by
technological development.  The committee’s activities in this regard are limited strictly to interpretations
of the document and to the consideration of revisions to the current edition of the document on the basis
of new data or technology.  As a matter of policy, API does not approve, certify, rate, or endorse any item,
construction, proprietary device, or activity, and accordingly, inquiries that require such consideration will
be returned.  Moreover, API does not act as a consultant on specific engineering problems or on the
general understanding or application of RP 571.  If, based on the inquiry information submitted, it is the
opinion of the committee that the inquirer should seek other assistance, the inquiry will be returned with
the recommendation that such assistance be obtained.  All inquiries that cannot be understood because
they lack information will be returned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2
Inquiry Format<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.2.1
Inquiries shall be limited strictly to requests for interpretation of RP 571 or to the consideration of
revisions to the document on the basis of new data or technology.  Inquiries shall be submitted in the
format described in  A.2.2  .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.2.2
