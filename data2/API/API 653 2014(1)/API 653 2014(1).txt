<<HEADING level=2>>Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration, and Reconstruction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.1  This standard covers steel storage tanks built to API 650 and its predecessor API 12C. It provides minimum
requirements for maintaining the integrity of such tanks after they have been placed in service and addresses
inspection, repair, alteration, relocation, and reconstruction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.2  The scope is limited to the tank foundation, bottom, shell, structure, roof, attached appurtenances, and
nozzles to the face of the first flange, first threaded joint, or first welding-end connection. Many of the design, welding,
examination, and material requirements of API 650 can be applied in the maintenance inspection, rating, repair, and
alteration of in-service tanks. In the case of apparent conflicts between the requirements of this standard and API 650
or its predecessor API 12C, this standard shall govern for tanks that have been placed in service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.3  This standard employs the principles of API 650; however, storage tank owner/operators, based on
consideration of specific construction and operating details, may apply this standard to any steel tank constructed in
accordance with a tank specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.4  This standard is intended for use by organizations that maintain or have access to engineering and inspection
personnel technically trained and experienced in tank design, fabrication, repair, construction, and inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.5  This standard does not contain rules or guidelines to cover all the varied conditions which may occur in an
existing tank. When design and construction details are not given, and are not available in the as-built standard,
details that will provide a level of integrity equal to the level provided by the current edition of API 650 must be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1.1.6  This standard recognizes fitness-for-service assessment concepts for evaluating in-service degradation of
pressure containing components. API 579-1/ASME FFS-1,  Fitness-For-Service , provides detailed assessment
procedures or acceptance criteria for specific types of degradation referenced in this standard. When this standard
does not provide specific evaluation procedures or acceptance criteria for a specific type of degradation or when this
standard explicitly allows the use of fitness-for-service criteria, API 579-1/ASME FFS-1 may be used to evaluate the
various types of degradation or test requirements addressed in this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2 Compliance with This Standard<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/operator has ultimate responsibility for complying with the provisions of this standard. The application
of this standard is restricted to organizations that employ or have access to an authorized inspection agency as
defined in 3.3. Should a party other than the owner/operator be assigned certain tasks, such as relocating and
reconstructing a tank, the limits of responsibility for each party shall be defined by the owner/operator prior to
commencing work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.3 Jurisdiction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If any provision of this standard presents a direct or implied conflict with any statutory regulation, the regulation shall
govern. However, if the requirements of this standard are more stringent than the requirements of the regulation, then
the requirements of this standard shall govern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.4 Safe Working Practices<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An assessment shall be made of the potential hazards to which personnel may be exposed when conducting
internal tank inspections, making repairs, or dismantling tanks. Procedures shall be developed according to the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1-1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1-2
API S TANDARD  653<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>guidelines given in API 2015 and API 2217A that will include safeguard for personnel health and safety,
prevention of accidental fires and explosions, and the prevention of property damage. Conformance to permit
procedures is an essential safe work practice for protection of personnel and property.Where welding and hot
work are involved, API 2009 states “Except in areas specifically designated as safe for hot work, a hot work
permit shall be obtained before starting any work that can involve a source of ignition.” See also API
Recommended Practice 2016.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Special procedures may need to be developed for certain activities described in this standard that are not fully
covered by the referenced API publications; e.g. safety precautions for personnel accessing floating roof tanks that
are in service, or gas freeing the bottom side of a tank. Appendix B of API 2009 provides brief information on inerting
tanks. Use of inerting as a safety precaution should address personnel hazards introduced when using inert gas in
the workplace and implementation should be done in consultation with specialists that are familiar with such
processes. Finally, procedures must comply with any federal or state safety regulations pertaining to “confined
spaces” or any other relevant provisions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.2  The evaluation of the existing tank shell shall be conducted by a storage tank engineer and shall include an
analysis of the shell for the intended design conditions, based on existing shell plate thickness and material. The
analysis shall take into consideration all anticipated loading conditions and combinations, including pressure due to

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.1.3  Shell corrosion occurs in many forms and varying degrees of severity and may result in a generally uniform
loss of metal over a large surface area or in localized areas. Pitting may also occur. Each case must be treated as a
unique situation and a thorough inspection conducted to determine the nature and extent of corrosion prior to
developing a repair procedure. Pitting does not normally represent a significant threat to the overall structural integrity
of a shell unless present in a severe form with pits in close proximity to one another. Criteria for evaluating both
general corrosion and pitting are defined below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1.4  Methods for determining the minimum shell thickness suitable for continued operation are given in 4.3.2,

shall be repaired, or the allowable liquid level of the tank reduced, or the tank retired. The allowable liquid level for the
continued use of a tank may be established by using the equations for a minimum acceptable thickness (see 4.3.3.1
and 4.3.4.1) and solving for height,  H . The actual thickness, as determined by inspection, minus the corrosion
allowance shall be used to establish the liquid level limit. The maximum design liquid level shall not be exceeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4.2  The rivet joint efficiencies given in Table 4.3 are conservative minimums for riveted tank construction details
and are included to simplify riveted tank evaluations. However, in some cases it may be advantageous to calculate
the actual rivet joint efficiencies using computational methods applicable to lap and butt type riveted joints. When this
alternative of calculated joint efficiencies is used, the following maximum allowable stresses shall apply:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) for the maximum tensile stress in net section of plate, use the lesser of 0.80 Y  or 0.429 T ; use 21,000 lbf/in. 2  if  T  or  Y
is unknown;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) for the maximum shear in net section of rivet, use 16,000 lbf/in. 2 ;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) for the maximum bearing stress on plates or rivets, use 32,000 lbf/in. 2  for rivets in single shear, and 35,000 lbf/in. 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>for rivets in double shear.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.4.3  For tanks with riveted joints, consideration shall be given to whether, and to what extent, corrosion affects
such joints. If calculations show that excess thickness exists, this excess may be taken as corrosion allowance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.8 Shell Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The condition of the tank shell welds shall be evaluated for suitability for service using criteria from this standard,
the as-built standard, or fitness-for-service assessment. Any flaws or deterioration such as corrosion or pitting of
the existing welds shall be evaluated. If necessary, appropriate repair procedures shall be established or the tank
safe fill height reassessed. Some typical shell butt-welded flaws and recommended procedures for repairs are
given in 9.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.9 Shell Penetrations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.9.1  The condition and details of existing shell penetrations (nozzles, manways, cleanout openings, etc.) shall be
reviewed when assessing the integrity of an existing tank shell. Details such as type and extent of reinforcement, weld
spacing, and thickness of components (reinforcing plate, nozzle neck, bolting flange, and cover plate), are important
considerations and shall be reviewed for structural adequacy and compliance with the as-built standard. Existing
welds on the tank shell that are not to be modified or affected by repairs and are closer than required by API 650
(Seventh Edition or later) are acceptable for continued service if the welds are examined by the magnetic particle
method and have no rejectable defects or indications. Grinding to eliminate weld defects is permissible if the resulting
profile satisfies base thickness and weld size requirements. Weld repairs may not be used to accept weld spacings
closer than permitted by API 650 (Seventh Edition or later) except as permitted by 9.10.2.7. Any other
noncompliance, or deterioration due to corrosion, must be assessed and repair procedures established where
appropriate or the tank re-rated, as necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.1.1  Existing tanks that were originally designed and constructed to the requirements of API 650, Annex M-
1a or M-1b, shall be evaluated for continued service, as follows.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The tank shell shall be evaluated in conformance with 4.3.3, except that the allowable stress ( S ) for all shell
courses shall not exceed 0.80 Y . The value of  Y  shall be taken as the minimum specified yield strength of the shell
material multiplied by the yield strength reduction factor in of API 650, Table M-1. When the minimum specified
yield strength of the shell material is not known, the evaluation shall be based upon an assumed value of
30,000 lbf/in. 2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) If the bottom plate material in the critical zone has been reduced in thickness beyond the provisions of the original
tank bottom corrosion allowance, if any, the shell-to-bottom joint shall be evaluated for elevated temperature, liquid
head and thermal cycles. The simplified analysis technique recommended in API 650, Section M.4, may be used
to satisfy this requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.10.1.2  Existing elevated temperature service tanks that were not originally designed and constructed to the
requirements of API 650, Annex M, but have a successful service history of operation shall be evaluated for continued
service as noted in 4.3.10.1.1. If the tank diameter exceeds 100 ft and the tank was not constructed with a butt-
welded annular ring, an analysis of the critical zone is required [see 4.3.10.1.1 b)]. In addition, the maximum operating
temperature shall not exceed the temperatures at which the tank has operated successfully in the past.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.10.2 Conversion to Operation at Elevated Temperatures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Existing tanks that were not originally designed and constructed to the requirements of API 650, Annex M shall be

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The tank shell shall be evaluated in conformance with API 650, Annex M. The allowable shell stresses of this
standard (API 653) shall not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

material in the critical zone shall be based upon the requirements of this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Tank Bottom Evaluation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank bottom inspection strategies shall provide suitable data which, when used with the procedures in this
standard, will determine the tank bottom integrity necessary to prevent leakage of fluids that may cause
environmental damage. Each aspect of corrosion phenomena, and other potential leak or failure mechanism must
be examined. Periodic assessment of tank bottom integrity shall be performed in addition to the internal
inspections specified in 6.4. The assessment period shall be less than or equal to the appropriate internal
inspection interval given in 6.4.2. The use of leak detection tests or monitoring systems (such as double bottoms or
liners under tank bottoms with leak detection pipes) will satisfy the requirement for periodic assessment between
internal inspections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Excessive foundation settlement of storage tanks can affect the integrity of tank shells and bottoms. Therefore,
monitoring the settlement behavior of tanks is a recognized practice to assess the integrity of tank bottoms. See

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) internal pitting and pitting rates in the anticipated service;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) corrosion of weld joints (weld and heat affected zone);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) stresses placed on the bottom plates by roof support loads and shell settlement;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) underside corrosion (normally in the form of pitting);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) inadequate drainage resulting in surface water flowing under the tank bottom;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) the lack of an annular plate ring when required;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) uneven settlement that results in high localized stresses in the bottom plates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) roof support columns or other supports welded to the tank bottom where adequate allowance for movement was
not made;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j) rock or gravel foundation pads with inadequately filled-in surface voids;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>l) inadequately supported sumps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3 Tank Bottom Release Prevention Systems (RPSs)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API supports the use of a release prevention system (RPS) to maintain the integrity of tank bottoms. The term RPS
refers to the suite of API standards and recommended practices that are designed to maintain tank integrity and thus
protect the environment. With respect to tank bottoms, these include: internal inspection of the tank bottom; leak
detection systems and leak testing of the tank; installing cathodic protection for the underside of the tank bottom;
lining the bottom of the tank interior; providing a release prevention barrier (RPB) under the tank bottom; or some
combination of these measures, depending on the operating environment and service of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.1 Internal Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal inspection of the tank bottom is intended to assess the current bottom integrity and identify problem
conditions that may lead to future loss of integrity. Internal inspection techniques, such as bottom settlement
monitoring, and considerations for determining appropriate inspection frequency, are found in 4.4.6, Section 6, Annex
B, Annex C, and elsewhere.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.2 Leak Detection Systems and Leak Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank leak detection systems and leak testing are intended to identify, quantify, and/or locate a tank bottom integrity
failure that is not detectable visually or through inventory reconciliation. Leak detection may be integral to the tank
design, either as constructed or as modified (e.g. RPB with interstitial monitoring) or may operate separately (e.g. soil
vapor monitoring and chemical marker); may be operated by the tank owner or as a third party test or service; and
may detect leaks continuously or on a periodic basis. Tank leak detection systems and testing methods are listed and
discussed in API 575.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Cathodic protection systems are intended to mitigate corrosion of steel surfaces in contact with soil, such as the
underside of tank bottoms. A selection basis for cathodic protection systems is covered by API 651.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.4 Internal Lining Protection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal linings and coatings for the top side of the tank bottom are intended to mitigate corrosion by providing a
barrier between the tank bottom and corrosion sources. Applied linings and coatings for internal surfaces of tank
bottoms are covered by API 652.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.3.5 Release Prevention Barriers (RPBs)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An RPB includes steel bottoms, synthetic materials, clay liners, concrete pads, and all other barriers or combinations
of barriers placed in the bottom of or under a tank, which have the function of:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) preventing the escape of released material, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) containing or channeling released material for leak detection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RPB design is covered in detail in Annex I of API 650. Replacement of tank bottoms is covered in 9.10.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a decision is made to replace an existing bottom, API supports the evaluation of installing an RPB or continued use
of an RPS. The evaluation should consider the effectiveness of other RPS controls, the product stored, the location of
the tank, and environmental sensitivities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.4 Bottom Plate Thickness Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various methods for determining tank bottom plate soilside corrosion are available. The methods vary to the extent by
which they can reliably measure general corrosion and pitting. A combination of these methods may be required along
with extrapolation techniques and analysis to establish the probable conditions of the entire tank bottom. Magnetic flux
leakage (MFL) tools are commonly used, along with ultrasonic (UT) thickness measurement tools, to examine tank
bottoms. Ultrasonic thickness measurement techniques are often used to confirm and further quantify data obtained
by MFL examination, but these techniques may not be required depending on the specific procedure and application.
The quality of data obtained from both MFL and ultrasonic thickness techniques is dependent on personnel,
equipment and procedures. Annex G may be used to provide guidance in qualifying personnel and procedures for
obtaining thickness data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5 Minimum Thickness for Tank Bottom Plate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quantifying the minimum remaining thickness of tank bottoms based on the results of measurement can be done by
the method outlined in 4.4.5.1. Other approaches such as the probabilistic method in 4.4.5.2 may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.5.1  An acceptable method for calculating the minimum acceptable bottom thickness for the entire bottom or
portions thereof is as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>MRT  = (Minimum of  RT bc  or  RT ip ) –  O r  ( StP r  +  UP r )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>MRT  is the minimum remaining thickness at the end of interval  O r    . This value must meet the requirements of
Table 4.4 and 4.4.5.4 and 4.4.6;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>O r
is the in-service interval of operation (years to next internal inspection) not to exceed that allowed by 6.4.2;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_30>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4-14
API S TANDARD  653<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RT bc   is the minimum remaining thickness from bottom side corrosion after repairs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>RT ip   is the minimum remaining thickness from internal corrosion after repairs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>StP r
is the maximum rate of corrosion not repaired on the top side.  StP r  = 0 for coated areas of the bottom. The
expected life of the coating must equal or exceed   O r   to use  StP r   = 0;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>UP r   is the maximum rate of corrosion on the bottom side. To calculate the corrosion rate, use the minimum
remaining thickness after repairs. Assume a linear rate based on the age of the tanks.  UP r  = 0 for areas
that have effective cathodic protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1  For areas of a bottom that have been scanned by the magnetic flux leakage (or exclusion) process, and do
not have effective cathodic protection, the thickness used for calculating  UP r  must be the lesser of the MFL threshold

remaining thickness to be detected in the areas examined. This value should be predetermined by the tank owner
based on the desired inspection interval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Areas of bottom side corrosion that are repaired should be evaluated with the corrosion rate for the repaired area
unless the cause of corrosion has been removed. The evaluation is done by using the corrosion rate of the repaired
area for  UP r , and adding the patch plate (if used) thickness to the term “minimum of  RT bc  or  RT ip .”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

thicknesses providing acceptable risk as determined by an RBI assessment per 6.4.2.2.2, the bottom shall be lined,
repaired, replaced, or the interval to the next internal inspection shortened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.5.4  Unless a stress analysis is performed, the minimum bottom plate thickness in the critical zone of the tank
bottom defined in 9.10.1.2 shall be the smaller of one-half the original bottom plate thickness (not including the
original corrosion allowance) or 50 % of  t min  of the lower shell course per 4.3.3.1 but not less than 0.1 in. Isolated
pitting will not appreciably affect the strength of the plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.5.5  The repair of internal pitting, when performed to extend the in-service period of operation, shall be by pit
welding, overlay welding, or lap patching, followed by inspection and testing. The extent of weld repairs is limited in
the critical zone in accordance with 9.10.1.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Tank Foundation Evaluation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1.1  The principal causes of foundation deterioration are settlement, erosion, cracking, and deterioration of
concrete initiated by: calcining, attack by underground water, attack by frost, and attack by alkalies and acids. To
ensure suitability for service, all tank foundations shall be inspected periodically (see 6.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.1.2  Some mechanisms of concrete deterioration are briefly described below.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Calcining (loss of water of hydration) can occur when concrete has been exposed to sufficiently high temperature
for a period of time. During intermediate cooling periods, the concrete can absorb moisture, swell, lose its strength,
and crack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Deterioration of concrete exposed to underground water can be caused by chemical attack, by cyclic changes in
temperature, and by freezing moisture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Expansion of freezing moisture in porous concrete, or in concrete with minor settlement cracks or temperature
cracks, can result in spalling and/or the development of serious structural cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Sulfate-type alkalies, and to a lesser extent, chlorides, can act corrosively to destroy the bond of the concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Temperature cracks (hairline cracks of uniform width) do not seriously affect the strength of the concrete foundation
structure; however, these cracks can be potential access points for moisture or water seepage that could
eventually result in corrosion of the reinforcing steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.1.3  When a tank is to be used in elevated temperature [> 93  ° C (200  ° F)] service, the provisions of API 650,
Section B.6 shall be considered in the evaluation of the suitability for service of the tank foundation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.2 Foundation Repair or Replacement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2.1  If there is a need for foundation replacement or installation, the new foundation elevation profile must
meet the tolerance in 10.5.6. Alternatively, if the new foundation is to be constructed up to the bottom, changing
the levelness of the tank is not required if reviewed and approved by a storage tank engineer considering the
plumbness of the shell, presence, or absence of shell distortion, and original construction levelness which warrant
leaving the tank at the current state of levelness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.2.2  Concrete pads, ringwalls, and piers, showing evidence of spalling, structural cracks, or general deterioration,
shall be repaired to prevent water from entering the concrete structure and corroding the reinforcing steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.3 Anchor Bolts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Distortion of anchor bolts and excessive cracking of the concrete structures in which they are embedded may be
indications of either serious foundation settlement or a tank overpressure uplift condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Section 5—Brittle Fracture Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section provides a procedure for the assessment of existing tanks for suitability for continued operation or
change of service with respect to the risk of brittle fracture and does not supplement or replace the requirements of
Section 12 for the examination and testing for the hydrostatic testing of repaired, modified, or reconstructed tanks.
The procedure applies to both welded and riveted tanks; however, the procedure is based primarily on experience
and data obtained from welded tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Basic Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1  A decision tree (see Figure 5.1) is used to present the assessment procedure for failure due to brittle fracture.
The decision tree is based on the following principles.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.2  In all reported incidents of tank failure due to brittle fracture, failure occurred either shortly after erection during
hydrostatic testing or on the first filling in cold weather, after a change to lower temperature service, or after a repair/
alteration. This experience shows that once a tank has demonstrated the ability to withstand the combined effects of
maximum liquid level (highest stresses) and lowest operating temperature without failing, the risk of failure due to
brittle fracture with continued service is minimal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3  Any change in service must be evaluated to determine if it increases the risk of failure due to brittle fracture. In
the event of a change to a more severe service (such as operating at a lower temperature or handling product at a
higher specific gravity) it is necessary to consider the need for a hydrostatic test to demonstrate fitness for a new
more severe service. The following aspects should be considered:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the likelihood of repairs/alterations since the original hydrostatic test not meeting requirements of this standard;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) deterioration of the tank since original hydrostatic test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Assessment Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1  The assessment procedure illustrated in Figure 5.1 shall be used. Each of the key steps, numbered 1 through
11 on the decision tree, correspond sequentially to the explanations provided below.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2  Step 1— The tanks meet the requirements of API 650 (Seventh Edition or later) or API 650, Appendix G (Fifth
and Sixth Editions) to minimize the risk of failure due to brittle fracture. Alternatively, tanks may also be shown to meet
the toughness requirements of API 650 (Seventh Edition or later) by impact testing coupon samples from a
representative number of shell plates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.3  Step 2 —Many tanks that continue to operate successfully in the same service were not built to the
requirements of API 650 (see editions and appendices named in 5.3.2). These tanks are potentially susceptible to
failure due to brittle fracture and require an assessment as illustrated by the decision tree.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.4  Step 3 —For the purpose of this assessment, hydrostatic testing demonstrates fitness for continued service
with minimal risk of failure due to brittle fracture, provided that all governing requirements for repairs, alterations,
reconstruction, or change in service are in accordance with this standard (including a need for hydrostatic testing
after major repairs, major alterations or reconstruction). The effectiveness of the hydrostatic test in demonstrating
fitness for continued service is shown by industry experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Section 6—Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Periodic in-service inspection of tanks shall be performed as defined herein. The purpose of this inspection is to assure
continued tank integrity. Inspections, other than those defined in 6.3 shall be directed by an authorized inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2
Inspection Frequency Considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1
Several factors must be considered to determine inspection intervals for storage tanks. These include, but are
not limited to, the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the nature of the product stored;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the results of visual maintenance checks;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) corrosion allowances and corrosion rates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) corrosion prevention systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) conditions at previous inspections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) the methods and materials of construction and repair;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) the location of tanks, such as those in isolated or high risk areas;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) the potential risk of air or water pollution;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i) leak detection systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j) change in operating mode (e.g. frequency of fill cycling, frequent grounding of floating roof support legs);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) jurisdictional requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>l) changes in service (including changes in water bottoms);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>m)the existence of a double bottom or a release prevention barrier.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2
The interval between inspections of a tank (both internal and external) should be determined by its service
history unless special reasons indicate that an earlier inspection must be made. A history of the service of a given
tank or a tank in similar service (preferably at the same site) should be available so that complete inspections can be
scheduled with a frequency commensurate with the corrosion rate of the tank. On-stream, nondestructive
examination methods shall be considered when establishing inspection frequencies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3
Jurisdictional regulations, in some cases, control the frequency and interval of the inspections. These
regulations may include vapor loss requirements, seal condition, leakage, proper diking, and repair procedures.
Knowledge of such regulations is necessary to ensure compliance with scheduling and inspection requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3
Inspections from the Outside of the Tank<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1
Routine In-service Inspections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1.1
The external condition of the tank shall be monitored by close visual inspection from the ground on a routine
basis. This inspection may be done by owner/operator personnel, and can be done by other than authorized<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>inspectors as defined in 3.4. Personnel performing this inspection should be knowledgeable of the storage facility
operations, the tank, and the characteristics of the product stored.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1.2
The interval of such inspections shall be consistent with conditions at the particular site, but shall not exceed
one month.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1.3
This routine in-service inspection shall include a visual inspection of the tank’s exterior surfaces. Evidence of
leaks; shell distortions; signs of settlement; corrosion; and condition of the foundation, paint coatings, insulation
systems, and appurtenances should be documented for follow-up action by an authorized inspector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2
External Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2.1
All tanks shall be given a visual external inspection by an authorized inspector. This inspection shall be
called the external inspection and must be conducted at least every five years or  RCA /4 N  years (where  RCA  is the
difference between the measured shell thickness and the minimum required thickness in mils, and  N  is the shell
corrosion rate in mils per year) whichever is less. Tanks may be in operation during this inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2.2
Insulated tanks need to have insulation removed only to the extent necessary to determine the condition of
the exterior wall of the tank or the roof.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2.3
Tank grounding system components such as shunts or mechanical connections of cables shall be visually
checked. Recommended practices dealing with the prevention of hydrocarbon ignition are covered by API 2003.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.3
Ultrasonic Thickness Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3.1
External, ultrasonic thickness measurements of the shell can be a means of determining a rate of uniform
general corrosion while the tank is in service, and can provide an indication of the integrity of the shell. The extent of
such measurements shall be determined by the owner/operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.3.2
When used, the ultrasonic thickness measurements shall be made at intervals not to exceed the following.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When the corrosion rate is not known, the maximum interval shall be five years. Corrosion rates may be estimated
from tanks in similar service based on thickness measurements taken at an interval not exceeding five years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) When the corrosion rate is known, the maximum interval shall be the smaller of  RCA /2 N  years (where  RCA  is the
difference between the measured shell thickness and the minimum required thickness in mils, and  N  is the shell
corrosion rate in mils per year) or 15 years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.3.3
Internal inspection of the tank shell, when the tank is out of service, can be substituted for a program of
external ultrasonic thickness measurement if the internal inspection interval is equal to or less than the interval
required in 6.3.3.2 b).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4
Cathodic Protection Surveys<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.4.1
Where exterior tank bottom corrosion is controlled by a cathodic protection system, periodic surveys of the
system shall be conducted in accordance with API 651. The owner/operator shall review the survey results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4.2
The owner/operator shall assure competency of personnel performing surveys.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4
Internal Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.1.1
Internal inspection is primarily required to do as follows.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Gather the data necessary for the minimum bottom and shell thickness assessments detailed in Section 6. As
applicable, these data shall also take into account external ultrasonic thickness measurements made during in-
service inspections (see 6.3.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Identify and evaluate any tank bottom settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.1.2
All tanks shall have a formal internal inspection conducted at the intervals defined by 6.4.2. The
authorized inspector shall supervise or conduct a visual examination and assure the quality and completeness of
the nondestructive examination (NDE) results. If the internal inspection is required solely for the purpose of
determining the condition and integrity of the tank bottom, the internal inspection may be accomplished with the
tank in-service utilizing various ultrasonic robotic thickness measurement and other on-stream inspection
methods capable of assessing the thickness of the tank bottom, in combination with methods capable of
assessing tank bottom integrity as described in 4.4.1. Electromagnetic methods may be used to supplement the
on-stream ultrasonic inspection. If an in-service inspection is selected, the data and information collected shall be
sufficient to evaluate the thickness, corrosion rate, and integrity of the tank bottom and establish the internal
inspection interval, based on tank bottom thickness, corrosion rate, and integrity, utilizing the methods included in
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.2
Inspection Intervals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Initial and subsequent inspection intervals shall be in compliance with the requirements of 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.2.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For existing tanks, tank owner/operators shall review the internal inspection interval and be in compliance with this

<<PARAGRAPH>>For example, the maximum interval for a ¼ in. bottom that has a release prevention barrier and a fiberglass lining
would be determined as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>10 years (initial) + 5 years (fiberglass lining) + 10 years (release prevention barrier) = 25 years.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Alternative to Internal Inspection to Determine Bottom Thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where construction, size, or other aspects allow external access to the tank bottom to determine bottom
thickness, an external inspection in lieu of an internal inspection is allowed to meet the data requirements of
Table 4.4. However, in these cases, consideration of other maintenance items may dictate internal inspection
intervals. This alternative approach shall be documented and made part of the permanent record of the tank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

recommendations. The recommended maximum inspection interval and basis for calculation that interval shall also
be stated. Additionally, reports may include other less critical observations, suggestions and recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.9.3.2
It is the responsibility of the owner/operator to review the inspection findings and recommendations,
establish a repair scope, if needed, and determine the appropriate timing for repairs, monitoring, and/or
maintenance activities. Typical timing considerations and examples of repairs are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  prior to returning the tank to service —repairs critical to the integrity of the tank (e.g. bottom or shell repairs);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  after the tank is returned to service —minor repairs and maintenance activity (e.g. drainage improvement, painting,
gauge repairs, grouting, etc.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  at the next scheduled internal inspection —predicted or anticipated repairs and maintenance (e.g. coating renewal,
planned bottom repairs, etc.);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)  monitor condition for continued deterioration —(e.g. roof and/or shell plate corrosion, settlement, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/operator shall ensure that the disposition of all recommended repairs and monitoring is documented in
writing and that reasons are given if recommended actions are delayed or deemed unnecessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any specific design considerations other than normal product loading shall be specified by the owner/operator. See
4.4.3 for release prevention systems and release prevention barrier definition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 New Weld Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.1  Weld joint details shall meet the welding requirements of the current applicable standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.2  All new shell joints shall be butt-welded joints with complete penetration and complete fusion.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Existing Weld Joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Existing weld joints shall meet the requirements of the as-built standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4 Shell Design<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.1  Thickness to be used for each shell course when checking tank design shall be based on measurements
taken within 180 days prior to relocation. (See 4.3.2 for measuring procedure, number, and locations of measured
thicknesses.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.2  The maximum design liquid level for product shall be determined by calculating the maximum design liquid
level for each shell course based on the specific gravity of the product, the actual thickness measured for each shell
course, the allowable stress for the material in each course, and the design method to be used. The allowable stress
for the material shall be determined using API 650, Table 5-2a or Table 5-2b. For material not listed in Table 5-2a or
Table 5-2b, an allowable stress value of the lesser of  2 / 3  yield strength or  2 / 5  tensile strength shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.3  The maximum liquid level for hydrostatic test shall be determined by using the actual thickness measured for
each shell course, the allowable stress for the material in each course, and the design method to be used. The
allowable stress for the material shall be determined using API 650, Table 5-2a or Table 5-2b. For material not listed in
Table 5-2a or Table 5-2b, an allowable stress value of the lesser of  3 / 4  yield strength or  3 / 7  tensile strength shall be
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.4  If a corrosion allowance is required for the reconstructed tank, the required corrosion allowance shall be
deducted from the actual thickness before calculating the maximum liquid level. If the actual thickness is greater than
that necessary to allow the liquid level required, the extra thickness can be considered as corrosion allowance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4.5  The joint efficiency and allowable stress levels used for the design liquid level calculations shall be consistent
with the design method used and with the degree and type of examination made on welded joints. The joint efficiency
and allowable stress levels for existing welded joints that are not to be removed and replaced shall be based on the
original degree and type of examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5 Shell Penetrations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.1  Replacement and new penetrations shall be designed, detailed, welded, and examined to meet the

shell assuming a hole exists in the shell using a joint efficiency of 0.35.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3.4.3  The repair plate thickness shall not exceed the shell plate thickness at the perimeter of the repair plate by
more than one-third, but no more than  1 / 8  in. The repair plate thickness shall be no thinner than  3 / 16  in. nor thicker
than  1 / 2  in. A full fillet perimeter weld is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3.4.4  This repair method shall not be used if exposure of the fillet welds to the product will produce crevice
corrosion or if a corrosion cell between the shell plate and repair plate is likely to occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3.4.5  This repair method shall not be used to repair shell leaks if the presence of product between the shell plate
and repair plate will prevent gas freeing from the tank to perform hot work.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3.4.6  The existing shell plate under the repair plate shall be evaluated at each future inspection to ensure it
satisfies the requirements of 9.3.4.1. If the existing shell plate thickness does not satisfy 9.3.4.1 or the repair plate does
not satisfy 9.3.3, the area is to be repaired in accordance with 9.2 or 9.3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.4 Repair of Defects in Shell Plate Material<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The need for repairing indications such as cracks, gouges or tears (such as those often remaining after the removal
of temporary attachments), widely scattered pits, and corroded areas discovered during an inspection of the tank
shell shall be determined on an individual case basis in accordance with Section 4. In areas where the shell plate
thickness exceeds that required by design conditions, it is permissible to grind surface irregularities to a smooth
contour so long as the remaining thickness is adequate for the design conditions. Where grinding to a smoothly
contoured surface will result in unacceptable shell plate metal thickness, the shell plate may be repaired by
deposition of weld metal, followed by examination and testing in accordance with 12.1.8. If more extensive areas of
shell plate require repair, use of butt welded shell replacement plate or lap-welded patch plate shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5 Alteration of Tank Shells to Change Shell Height<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tank shells may be altered by adding new plate material to increase the height of the tank shell. The modified shell
height shall be in accordance with the requirements of the current applicable standard and shall take into
consideration all anticipated loadings such as wind and seismic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6 Repair of Defective Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Types of weld defects that need repair are described in 9.6.1 through 9.6.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.1  Cracks, lack of fusion, and rejectable slag and porosity that need repair shall be removed completely by
gouging and/or grinding and the resulting cavity properly prepared for welding.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.6.2  Generally, it is not necessary to remove existing weld reinforcement in excess of that allowed by API 650
when discovered on an existing tank with a satisfactory service history. However, if operating conditions are such that
the excessive weld reinforcement may be deleterious (such as for a floating roof with flexible seals), consideration
shall be given to repairing the welds by grinding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

by additional weld metal, or grinding, as appropriate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.4  Welded joints that have experienced loss of metal due to corrosion may be repaired by welding.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.5  Arc strikes discovered in or adjacent to welded joints shall be repaired by grinding and/or welding. Arc strikes
repaired by welding shall be ground flush with the plate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.6  After repairing weld defects listed in API 653, Section 9.6, the repaired areas shall be examined in accordance
with the requirements of API 653, Section 12.1.3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7 Repair of Shell Penetrations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7.1  Repairs to existing shell penetrations shall be in compliance with API 650, Section 5.7.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.7.2  Reinforcing plates may be added to existing unreinforced nozzles when deemed appropriate. The reinforcing
plate shall meet all dimensional and weld spacing requirements of API 650, Section 5.7. See Figure 9.7 and Figure
9.8 for acceptable details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.7.3  As an alternative, the reinforcing plates may be added to the inside of the tank provided that sufficient nozzle
projection exists.<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.8.2  The required penetration reinforcement area of API 650, Section 5.7.2, shall be determined using the required
shell thickness calculated by the equation in 4.3.3.1 b) of this standard except the variable  S  shall be the allowable
design stress from API 650, Table 5-2a or Table 5-2b for the existing shell plate; use 20,000 lbf/in. 2  if of unknown
material. A joint efficiency of 1.0 may be used (see 9.8.5). The variable  H  shall be the height from the centerline of the
penetration to the maximum liquid level, in ft.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.8.3  Penetrations shall be prefabricated in thermally stress relieved insert assemblies when required by API 650,
Section 5.7.4. API 650, Section 4.1.5, may be used when reinforcing material is from API 650 Group-IV through
Group-VI and the existing shell is a Group-I through Group-IIIA material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8.4  The following erection requirements shall be met:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) if an integral reinforcement design is used, the insert plate at its periphery shall have a 1:4 reduction taper to match
the shell plate thickness when the insert plate exceeds the shell plate thickness by more than  1 / 8  in.;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.8.6  Penetrations larger than 2 in. NPS shall be installed with the use of an insert plate if the shell plate thickness is
greater than  1 / 2  in. and the shell plate material does not meet the current design metal temperature criteria. In
addition, the following requirement shall be met:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the minimum diameter of the insert plate shall be at least twice the diameter of the penetration or the diameter plus
12 in., whichever is greater;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) when reinforcing plates are used, the minimum diameter of the insert plate shall equal the diameter of the
reinforcing plate plus 12 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9 Alteration of Existing Shell Penetrations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.9.1  Existing shell penetrations may be altered if the altered details comply with the requirements of API 650,
Section 5.7 including the requirements for minimum reinforcing area and the requirements for spacing of welds
around connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.9.2  When installing a new tank bottom above the existing bottom, it may be necessary to alter existing shell
penetrations in the bottom course of a tank shell. If the new bottom is slotted through the tank shell several inches
above the existing bottom, the spacing between existing welds around penetrations and the new bottom-to-shell weld
may not comply with API 650 requirements. Options for altering the penetrations and/or reinforcing plates are given in
9.9.2.1 through 9.9.2.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.9.2.1  The existing reinforcing plate may be trimmed to increase the spacing between the welds provided that the
altered detail complies with the requirements of API 650, Section 5.7. Care must be exercised during the trimming
operation to avoid damaging the shell material beneath the reinforcing plate. The existing weld attaching the portion
of the reinforcing plate to be removed shall be completely removed by gouging and grinding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.9.2.2  The existing reinforcing plate may be removed and a new reinforcing plate added except that reinforcing
plate replacement is not permitted in existing stress relieved assemblies unless the requirements of 11.3 are met. If it
is not known whether the assembly was thermally stressed relieved, then the alteration shall meet the requirements
of API 650, Section 5.7.4. Care must be exercised when removing the existing reinforcing plate to avoid damaging
the shell plate beneath the reinforcing plate. When the upper half of the existing reinforcing plate meets all
requirements of API 650, it can be left in place with approval of the purchaser. In this case, only the lower half of the
existing reinforcing plate need be removed and replaced with the new one. The existing upper half of the reinforcing
plate and the new lower section shall be provided with new a telltale hole, if needed, or drilled hole, and a welded pipe
coupling for the pneumatic test. The shell plate thickness under the telltale hole or drilled hole shall be checked after
drilling and the thickness shall not be less than  1 / 2   t min , as calculated in 4.3.3.1, plus any required corrosion
allowance. The welds to be replaced around the perimeter of the reinforcing plate and between the reinforcing plate
and neck of the penetration shall be completely removed by gouging and grinding. The new reinforcing plate shall be
in accordance with Figure 9.7. If required to maintain weld spacing, a tombstone shaped reinforcing plate may be
used (see Figure 9.8).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.9.2.3  The existing penetration may be moved by cutting the section of the shell containing the fitting and
reinforcing plate, and raising the entire assembly to the correct elevation (see Figure 9.9).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.9.3  Any components of the penetration (neck, flange, and reinforcing plate) that are in serviceable condition after
removal may be reused.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.9.4  A new bottom may be installed through an existing tombstone reinforcing plate, provided all weld spacing and
reinforcement requirements, as specified in API 650, are met. One of the following methods shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Remove only that portion of the existing reinforcing plate necessary to weld and test the new bottom-to-shell weld.
The lower edge of the reinforcing plate shall be cut reasonably straight and horizontal and beveled to facilitate
welding. See Figure 9.10 for weld joint details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Bevel the shell from the inside to allow for a full penetration weld between the bottom and shell. This method
shall only be used on tanks where the annular plate or bottom sketch plate thickness is equal to or greater
than 10 mm ( 3 / 8  in.). This weld detail shall be used along the full width of the reinforcing plate and shall extend
a minimum of 25 mm (1 in.) beyond the edges of the reinforcing plate. Once beyond the reinforcing plate, the
full penetration weld shall tie in to the outside shell-to-bottom fillet weld to create a “water stop” and then
transition to the typical shell-to-bottom weld detail. See Figure 9.11 for weld joint details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The bottom portion of the reinforcing plate may be removed using a horizontal cut between the bottom invert
of the nozzle neck and the new bottom per requirements of Figure 9.12. The removed (or new) reinforcing
plate shall be prepared for a full fusion splice weld with telltale hole added (see Figure 9.12). The removed (or
new) reinforcing plate shall be re-installed after the shell-to-bottom weld has been completed, inspected, and
tested. The splice weld shall be made prior to the reinforcing plate weld to bottom plate weld. The completed
splice weld shall be magnetic particle examined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The lower portion of the existing reinforcing plate may be removed and re-installed after the new shell-to-bottom weld
is complete. The existing reinforcing plate shall be cut at the horizontal centerline of the nozzle. Telltale holes are
required in both parts of the reinforcing plate (see Figure 9.8).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) The existing reinforcing plate may be removed, modified and re-installed after the new shell-to-bottom weld is
complete (see Figure 9.8).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.10.1.2.4  If more extensive repairs are required within the critical zone than those listed in 9.10.1.2, the bottom
plate welded to the shell shall be cut out and a new plate shall be installed. Weld spacing requirements shall be in
accordance with 9.10.2.4, and API 650, Section 5.1.5.4 and Section 5.1.5.5. The shell-to-bottom weld shall be
removed and replaced for a minimum distance of 12 in. on each side of the new bottom plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.10.1.3  The use of welded-on patch plates that do not meet the requirements of 9.10.1.1 or 9.10.1.2 is permitted if
the repair method has been reviewed and approved by an engineer experienced in storage tank design in
accordance with API 650. The review shall consider brittle fracture, stress due to settlement, stress due to shell-
bottom discontinuity, metal temperature, fracture mechanics, and the extent and quality of NDE.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.10.1.4  Unacceptable indications such as cracks, gouges, tears, and corroded areas discovered in bottom

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.10.2.1.4  Except as permitted in 9.10.2.7, existing shell penetrations shall be raised or their reinforcing plates
modified if the elevation of the new bottom results in inadequate nozzle reinforcement details (see Figure 9.8 and API
650, Section 5.7.2) or if the weld space requirements given in API 650, Section 5.7.3 are not met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.10.2.1.5  For floating roof tanks, the new bottom profile must keep the roof level when it is resting on its support
legs. The levelness of the floating roof can be adjusted by changing the length of the support legs. The support legs
can either remain the same length to maintain the original height above the bottom or be shortened by the same
amount as the thickness of the cushion and new bottom plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.10.2.2  New bearing plates for fixed roof support columns shall be installed. For steel floating roof legs, steel pads or
other means shall be used to distribute the loads on the bottom of the tank and provide a wear surface. If pads are used,
they shall be continuously welded to the tank bottom. For aluminum floating roofs, the pads may be omitted if the owner/
operator approves and new austenitic stainless steel or acceptable non-metallic (e.g., Teflon) spacers are installed to
isolate legs from the carbon steel bottom. For aluminum floating roofs, austenitic stainless steel or acceptable non-
metallic (e.g., Teflon) spacers may installed to isolate legs from the carbon steel bottom instead of welded pads if the
spacers will not damage bottom coatings, there is no evidence of corrosion damage from such spacers on the previous
bottom, and if the owner/operator approves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.10.2.3  When removing an existing tank bottom, the tank shell shall be separated from tank bottom either by:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) cutting the shell parallel to the tank bottom a minimum of  1 / 2  in. above the bottom-to-shell weld (cut line B-B as
shown in Figure 10.1), or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) removing the entire shell-to-bottom attachment weld, including any penetration and heat affected zone by suitable
methods such as arc gouging and/or grinding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All arc-gouged areas of the tank shell-to-bottom weld shall be magnetic particle examined, and defective areas
repaired and re-examined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.10.2.4  Installation of a new tank bottom, after removal of the existing tank bottom, shall meet all requirements of
API 650. Except as permitted in 9.10.2.7, existing shell penetrations shall be raised or their penetration reinforcing
plates modified if the elevation of the new bottom results in inadequate nozzle reinforcement (see Figure 9.8 and API
650, Section 5.7.2) or if the weld spacing requirements given in API 650, Section 5.7.3 are not met. For tanks with shell
plate of unknown toughness as defined in Section 3, new weld joints in the bottom or annular ring shall be spaced at
least the greater of 3 in. or 5 t  from existing vertical weld joints in the bottom shell course, where  t  is the thickness of the
bottom shell course, in inches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.10.2.5  Replacement of portions of an existing tank bottom (entire rectangular plates or large segments of plates)
not within the critical zone (see 3.10 for definition) are permitted under the same rules that govern installation of
bottoms in new tank construction per API 650, Sections 5.4 and 5.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.10.2.6  The following shall be considered for tanks with cathodic protection and under-bottom leak detection.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For tanks having cathodic protection (CP) installed under the existing bottom, consideration shall be given to
removal of the entire bottom and unused dead shell to prevent shielding of CP current to the new bottom. Removal
of the old bottom is also important in preventing galvanic corrosion (refer to API 651). Where this is possible,
removal of the entire old bottom, except the unused dead shell and not more than 18 in. of bottom annulus
attached to the shell, shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Consideration shall be given to installing under-bottom leak detection at this time (such as a RPB) to contain and
channel any bottom leak to a location where it can readily be observed from outside of the tank. See 4.4.3.5 and

<<HEADING level=2>>Evaluation of Tank Bottom Settlement<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1
Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.1
In determining the effects of soil settlement on storage tanks, it is common practice to monitor settlement of
the tank bottom. In most cases, such a monitoring program is initiated during the construction and continued during
hydrostatic testing and operations. During operations, settlement measurements should be taken at a planned
frequency, based on an assessment of soil settlement predictions. For existing tanks that do not have initial
settlement data, a program of settlement monitoring should be based on prior service history.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.2
If at any time settlement is deemed excessive, the tank should be emptied and re-leveled. Re-leveling of a
sizable tank is expensive and rather difficult to achieve. Thus, a decision to re-level a tank is a crucial one, and
relies very much on the proper interpretation and evaluation of the monitored settlement data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.1.3
Approaches used to correct tank shell and bottom settlement include techniques such as localized repairs
of the bottom plates, partial re-leveling of the tank periphery, and major re-leveling of the entire tank bottom. Major
re-leveling of the tank, involving total lifting of the tank shell and bottom at one time, can introduce highly localized
stresses in the structure and impair its integrity. Therefore, when choosing techniques for correcting settlement
problems, an alternative to total lifting of the tank shell and bottom should be considered as a first choice. If it is
decided to lift the entire tank shell and bottom at one time, it should be done by personnel with demonstrated
experience in this technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2
Types of Settlement<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.1
Settlement Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements of tank settlement should be performed by personnel experienced in the types of measurement
procedures being performed, using equipment capable of sufficient accuracy to distinguish settlement differences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The principle types of tank settlement consist of settlements that relate to the tank shell and bottom plate. These
settlements can be recorded by taking elevation measurements around the tank circumference and across the tank
diameter. Figure B.1 and Figure B.2 show minimum recommended locations on a tank shell and bottom plate for
settlement measurements. Data obtained from such measurements should be used to evaluate the tank structure.
Additional settlement readings may be required to better define local bottom depressions or edge settlements, to
refine shell settlement measurements in areas suspected to have local out-of-plane settlements, or to otherwise
improve bottom or shell settlement evaluation. Settlement measurement locations should be re-used in any future
settlement surveys and evaluations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases of distortion or corrosion of the tank bottom extending beyond the shell, shell settlement measurements
taken near lap welds in the tank bottom can result in significant errors in measured elevation. Repaired or replaced
bottom plates, or new slotted-in bottoms may not have been installed parallel to the bottom shell course. In some
cases, more consistent and accurate results may be obtained by surveying the elevation of the weld between the first
and second courses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measure bottom and edge settlement carefully, taking into account that measurements taken when the bottom is not
in contact with the soil or foundation under the tank can overestimate or underestimate edge or bottom settlement
significantly. If the measured settlement is near the maximum allowable settlement, consider repeating the
measurement with the bottom forced down to the soil, e.g. standing on it, or take an additional set of measurements in
the same area, where the bottom is in firm contact with the soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Shell Settlement Evaluation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Settlement of a tank is the result of either one, or a combination of the following three settlement components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.2.1
Uniform settlement.  This component often can be predicted in advance, with sufficient accuracy from soil
tests. It may vary in magnitude, depending on the soil characteristics. Uniform settlement of a tank does not induce
stresses in the tank structure. However, piping, tank nozzles, and attachments must be given adequate consideration
to prevent problems caused by such settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.2.2
Rigid body tilting of a tank (planar tilt).  This component rotates the tank in a tilted plane. The tilt will cause an
increase in the liquid level and, therefore, an increase in the hoop stress in the tank shell. Also, excessive tilting can
cause binding of peripheral seals in a floating roof and inhibit roof travel. This type of settlement could affect tank
nozzles that have piping attached to them. Figure B.3 shows that the settled location of the tank shell, after rigid body
tilt, can be represented by either a cosine or sine wave with respect to its original position in a horizontal plane.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.2.3
Due to the fact that a tank is a rather flexible structure, the tank may settle in a non-planar configuration,
inducing additional stresses in the tank shell. The out-of-plane settlements of the shell can lead to out-of-roundness at
the top of the shell, and depending on the extent of the induced out-of-roundness, may impede the proper functioning
of the floating roof in such a way that re-leveling is required. The out-of-roundness caused by settlement may also
affect internal roof support structures such as columns, rafters, and girders. Also, such settlements may cause flat
spots to develop in the tank shell. This type of settlement could affect tank nozzles that have piping attached to them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.2.4
While uniform settlement and rigid body tilt of a tank may cause problems as described in B.2.2.1 and
B.2.2.2, the out-of-plane settlement is the important component to determine and evaluate in order to ensure the
structural integrity of the shell and bottom. Based on this principle, a common approach is to determine the
magnitudes of the uniform settlement and rigid body tilt (if a rigid tilt plane exists or can be identified) for each data
point on the tank periphery. If a plane of rigid tilt can be distinguished, it becomes important as a datum from which to
measure the magnitudes of the out-of-plane settlements. When the out-of-plane settlement pattern of a tank has an
easily distinguishable plane of rigid tilt, the methodology in this paragraph can be used to evaluate the acceptability of
the tank’s out-of-plane settlement. If a rigid tilt plane can not be readily determined, the methodology in B.2.2.5 can be
used to evaluate the acceptability of the tank’s out-of-plane settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A graphical representation illustrating tank shell settlement with a rigid tilt plane well–defined by a cosine curve fit is
shown in Figure B.3. The construction of this settlement plot has been developed in accordance with the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The actual settlement (in most cases an irregular curve) is plotted using points around the tank circumference as
the abscissa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The vertical distance between the abscissa and the lowest point on this curve (Point 22) is the minimum
settlement, and it is called the uniform settlement component. A line through this point, parallel to the abscissa,
provides a new base or datum line for settlement measurements called adjusted settlements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The plane of rigid tilt settlement, if well-defined, is represented by the optimum cosine curve. Several methods exist
for determining the optimum cosine curve. The least accurate method is by free hand drawing techniques, a kind of
trial and error procedure to fit the best cosine curve through the data. A better method is to use the mathematical
and graphical capabilities of a computer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The vertical distances between the irregular curve and the cosine curve represent the magnitudes of the out-of-
plane settlements ( U i   at Data Point i).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) A commonly used and accepted method is to use a computer to solve for constants  a ,  b , and  c , to find the optimum
cosine curve of the form:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Elev pred  =  a  +  b   ×  cos ( θ  +  c )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where  Elev pred  is the elevation predicted by the cosine curve at angle theta. A typical starting point for a computer
best-fit cosine curve is a least-square fit where  a ,  b , and  c  are chosen to minimize the sum of the square of the
differences between measured and predicted elevations. The optimum cosine curve is only considered valid (i.e.
accurately fits the measured data) if the value   R 2  is greater than or equal to 0.9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Linear least square fitting and the  R 2  method of curve fitting are basic statistical tools. The use of a more rigorous
statistical method to determine the optimum cosine curve, such as non-linear or iterative procedures, may be used by
those experienced in their use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Obtaining a statistically valid cosine curve may require taking more measurements than the minimums shown in
Figure B.1. In many cases, the out-of-plane settlement may be concentrated in one or more areas. In such cases, the
least-squares fit approach may under predict the local out-of-plane settlement and is not conservative. In these
cases,  R 2  will typically be less than 0.9, and more rigorous curve-fitting procedures should be considered.
Alternatively, the settlement may not indicate a well-defined rigid tilt plane and the procedure in B.2.2.5 should be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) The vertical distances between the irregular curve and the optimum curve represent the magnitudes of the out-of-
plane settlements ( U i   at Data Point i).  S i  is the out-of-plane deflection at Point i (see Figure B.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
When determining the optimum cosine curve described in B.2.2.4 e), taking additional measurements around the shell
will result in a more accurate cosine curve fit. However, using all of the measurement points in the equation shown in B.3.2.1 will
result in very small allowable out-of-plane settlements,  S max  since the arc length  L  between measurement points is small. It is
acceptable to all measurement points to develop the optimum cosine curve, but only use a subset of these points spaced no further
than 32 ft (8 minimum) when calculating  S i  and  S max . The points used must include the points furthest from the optimum cosine
curve. For example, if 8 points are required, but 16 measurements are taken, and the arc length between measurement points is
only 15 ft, calculate the optimum cosine curve using all 16 points, but use only 8 points to calculate  S i  . The equations in Figure B.3
would be revised to read:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>S i  =  U i  – ( 1 / 2   U i   – 2  +  1 / 2   U i   + 2 )<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.2.5
If a well-defined rigid tilt plane can not be determined or the maximum out-of-plane settlement determined in
accordance with B.3.2.1 is exceeded, the procedures given in this section may be used in lieu of more rigorous
analysis or repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.2.5.1
For settlement profiles without a well-defined rigid tilt plane, the settlement arc length,  S arc , and out-of-
plane settlement at the point under consideration,  S i , must be determined from a plot of the measurement data. Figure
B.4 is a graphical illustration of the various measurement terms and procedures for determining estimates of the
settlement arc length and the corresponding out-of-plane settlement, including the refinement of measurements,
when needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The actual settlement is plotted using points around the tank circumference as the abscissa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) An initial settlement arc length and maximum settlement is determined from the points on the plotted data that
indicate a change in direction of settlement slope (see Figure B.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Additional settlement measurement points may be needed halfway between the points indicating a change in
direction of the settlement slope to further refine the settlement arc length and location and magnitude of maximum
settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Step c) may need to be repeated. The best estimate of the settlement arc length and maximum settlement shall be
considered in the procedure given in B.3.2.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.2.5.2
If a valid cosine fit of the rigid tilt plane can be determined, but the maximum out-of-plane settlement
determined in accordance with B.3.2.1 is exceeded, the procedure in B.3.2.2 may be used to evaluate the settlement.
In this case, see Figure B.5 for a graphical illustration of the determination of the settlement arc length and the
corresponding out-of-plane settlement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Edge Settlement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.3.1
Edge settlement occurs when the tank shell settles sharply around the periphery, resulting in deformation of

<<PARAGRAPH>>B.2.3.2
The equation given in B.3.4 can be used to evaluate edge settlement. Alternatively, a rigorous stress
analysis can be carried out for the deformed profile. The determination of the deformed profile should take into
consideration the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>[text moved to B.2.1]<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Locating the breakover point where the settled area begins requires some judgment. Placing a straight edge on the

help define the breakover point.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Section B.3.4 provides methods for evaluation of measured edge settlement  B  against allowable edge
settlement  B ew  and  B e . Since  B ew  is more conservative than  B e , the simplest approach is to initially evaluate measured
settlement  B  against  B ew  for all settled areas. If all areas meet this criterion, the settlement is acceptable and no
further evaluation is necessary. If necessary, different settled areas can be evaluated separately against  B ew  and  B e .
For areas containing lap welds at an arbitrary angle to the shell, interpolation to find an allowable settlement between
B ew  and  B e  based on the angle of the weld to the shell is allowed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For existing tanks with history of successful service, it may be possible to accept greater settlement and distortion of the
foundation from a true plane than new tank construction standards allow. Each tank must be evaluated based on service
conditions, materials of construction, soil characteristics, tank foundation design, and tank service history. The methods
discussed in following sections are not mandatory and approximate the maximum permissible settlement. However,
experience has shown that if settlements exceed the following requirements, further assessment or repair is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Serviceability may also be a concern for tanks with significant out-of-plane settlement. Out-of-roundness
can impede floating roof operation and also affect internal roof support structures. The out-of-roundness that a tank
experiences with out-of-plane settlement is fairly sensitive to the actual pattern of settlement. The owner may wish to
specify additional inspection or a more rigorous assessment of the tank’s out-of-roundness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If measured out-of-plane settlement exceeds the applicable limits described in B.3.2.1 or B.3.2.2, a more
rigorous evaluation may be performed to determine the need for repairs. This evaluation should be done by an

essentially parallel to the shell (±20 ° ). In settled areas where the measured settlement  B  exceeds 75 % of allowed
settlement  B ew ,  all shell-to-bottom welds and bottom welds should be examined visually and with magnetic particle

Maximum allowable settlement for areas of edge settlement with a lap weld at an arbitrary angle to the shell
may be interpolated from  B e  and  B ew  from Figure B.11 and Figure B.12, and the following equation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B α  =  B e  – ( B e  –  B ew )  ×  sin   α<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where  α  is the angle of the weld to a tank centerline and  B α  is the allowable settlement for an area with a weld at that
angle (see Figure B.13).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.3.4.5
In general, settlement occurs slowly, and for most existing tanks, the majority of settlement is presumed to
have occurred in the first few years of service. Significant additional settlement will not be expected after the initial
inspections. Therefore, typical practice is to compare the measured edge settlement with the maximum allowable
edge settlement  B ew  and  B e , and not include allowance for additional settlement during subsequent operation. Note
that erosion of the pad adjacent to the tank may cause local settlement. In this case the settlement will continue
unless the pad is repaired and future erosion prevented. For cases where significant additional settlement is
expected, an engineer experienced in tank settlement evaluation should evaluate the settlement expected at the next
inspection with the limits in B.3.4. This is analogous to a corrosion allowance for components expected to corrode.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.4.6
The edge settlement limits described in B.2.3.1 through B.2.3.4 were developed for typical  1 / 4 -in. thick tank
bottoms with minimal corrosion.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Edge settlement limits can be applied with reasonable accuracy to  5 / 16 - and  3 / 8 -in. thick tank bottoms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Edge settlement limits can be applied with reasonable accuracy to bottoms with general corrosion, as long as the
areas near all welds are thicker than  3 / 16  in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Edge settlement limits can be applied with reasonable accuracy to bottoms with local corrosion, if all locally thin
areas in the settled area (closer than “ R ” to the shell) thinner than  3 / 16  in. are smaller than 12 inches in diameter
and the thin area does not include a weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Settlement is presumed to be slow, and a small amount of additional settlement is expected to occur prior to the
next inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.3.4.7
Edge settlement increases secondary stress at the bottom-to-shell weld. If weld repairs are made to the
bottom-to-shell weld in an area where settlement exceeds  1 / 2  of  B e , these additional stresses should be evaluated by
an engineer experienced in tank settlement evaluation before waiving a hydrostatic test per 12.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.4
Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.4.1
If it is determined that settlements have occurred which are beyond the permissible limits established in the
previous sections, then consideration should be given to making repairs or a rigorous stress analysis should be
performed to evaluate the deformed profile. Various repair techniques have been discussed above. The judgment
on repairs should be tempered with knowledge of tank service history, previous repairs, previous inspections, tank
foundation conditions, soil characteristics, the material of construction, and estimates of future settlement. See
9.10 for suggested repair details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>B.4.2
For tanks with edge settlement exceeding the limits and assumptions given in B.2.3.1 through B.2.3.7,
the tank should be repaired. Any plate exceeding acceptable strains (typically 2 % to 3 %) should be replaced.
Re-leveling the tank will not remove the plastic strain, so leveling the tank without replacing the strain may not be
a sufficient repair. Welds in the area of the high strains should be removed and replaced, or be subjected to a
fitness-for-service evaluation by an engineer experienced in tank settlement evaluation. The condition leading to
the unacceptable settlement should be corrected. Depending on the severity and location of the settlement,
required repairs may include regrading the soil under the tank bottom, and/or repairing the foundation. Jacking
and re-leveling the shell may be required to prevent additional settlement damage. Jacking and leveling are
usually done in conjunction with, not instead of, replacing damaged plate and welds. In lieu of repairs, a detailed
analysis of the settled area may be performed by an engineer experienced in tank design and settlement
evaluation. The analysis should consider primary and secondary stress and the risk of brittle fracture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Deck Plate Internal Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For safety, before accessing the roof, check with ultrasonic instrument or lightly use a ball
peen hammer to test the deck plate near the edge of the roof for thinning. (Corrosion
normally attacks the deck plate at the edge of a fixed roof and at the rafters in the center
of the roof first.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.1.4.2
Deck Plate External Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Visually inspect for paint failure, holes, pitting, and corrosion product on the roof deck.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.1.4.3
Roof Deck Drainage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Look for indication of standing water. (Significant sagging of fixed roof deck indicates
potential rafter failure. Large standing water areas on a floating roof indicate inadequate
drainage design or, if to one side, a nonlevel roof with possible leaking pontoons.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.1.4.4
Level of Floating Roof<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At several locations, measure distance from roof rim to a horizontal weld seam above the
roof. A variance in the readings indicates a nonlevel roof with possible shell out-of-round,
out-of-plumb, leaking pontoons, or hang-up. On small diameter tanks, an unlevel
condition can indicate unequal loading at that level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Qualification of Tank Bottom Examination Procedures and Personnel<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.1.1  This annex provides guidance for qualifying both tank bottom examination procedures and individuals that
perform tank bottom examinations. Owner/operators may elect to either apply this annex as written or modify it to meet
their own applications and needs. Tank bottom examinations are an important factor in providing the owner/operator
increased assurance of tank integrity. As a result, it is important that qualified examination procedures and personnel
are used in these examinations. Specific agreements and requirements for qualification of tank bottom examination
procedures and tank bottom examiners should be established between the owner/operator and the authorized
inspection agency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.1.2  There have been many NDE tools developed for examining tank bottoms. Most of these tools are complex
and require the operator to have a high level of knowledge and skill. The effectiveness of these examinations may
vary greatly depending on the equipment used, the examination procedure, and the skill of the examiner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Often the owner/operator will not have the ability to easily determine if the tank bottom examination has been effective
in assessing the actual condition of the tank bottom. The requirements in this annex will provide the owner/operator
additional assurance that the tank bottom examination will find significant metal loss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.2 Definitions<<HEADING_END>>

A record of the qualification test for a specific scanning operator. This record must contain the data for all essential
variables and the results of the qualification test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.2.12
tank bottom procedure qualification record
TBPQ
A record of the qualification test for a tank bottom examination procedure. This record must contain the data for all
essential variables and the results of the qualification test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.2.13
variables or procedure variables
The specific data in a procedure that provides direction and limitations to the scanning operator. Examples include:
plate thickness, overlap of adjacent bottom scans, scanning speed, equipment settings, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.3 Tank Bottom Examination Procedures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.3.1  Each authorized inspection agency performing tank bottom examinations is responsible to have and use
TBPs. These procedures provide direction for examiners performing tank bottom examinations. A procedure also
allows the owner/operator or authorized inspector to verify whether the examiners are correctly performing the
examinations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.3.2  The authorized inspection agency that performs the tank bottom examinations should develop the TBPs.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.3.3  Each TBP shall address essential and non-essential variables. Section G.5.3 provides guidance for
determining appropriate TBP essential and non-essential variables. Each procedure should specify limits on
appropriate variables, e.g. plate thickness range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.4 Tank Bottom Examiners<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.4.1  Examiners need only to be qualified for the work they do in the field. For example, scanning operators who
only use the bottom scanning equipment and do not prove-up the flaw with a follow-up method need only to be
qualified for the scanning operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.4.2  The purpose of qualifying the tank bottom examiner is to determine if the examiner is capable of satisfactorily
using a qualified procedure to determine the condition of the tank bottom.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.4.3  Each authorized inspection agency is responsible to train, test and qualify the scanning operators and
examiners they employ using follow-up techniques. Qualifications gained through one authorized inspection agency
are not necessarily valid for any other authorized inspection agency [see G.4.4 and G.4.9 f)].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.4.4  The authorized inspection agency is responsible for training each scanning operator they employ. Each
scanning operator should receive a minimum of 40 hours of training. This training should include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) instruction on the NDE principles/methods used by the bottom scanner, limitations and application of the specific
scanning equipment and procedure, scanning equipment calibration and operation, key scanning equipment
operating variables, etc.;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) hands-on operation of the bottom scanner under the direct supervision of a qualified scanning examiner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When hiring experienced examiners, the authorized inspection agency should verify and document previous
examiner training and provide any additional training if necessary. Experienced examiners should be provided
training regarding specific procedural requirements and test equipment to be utilized by the new employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.4.5  The authorized inspection agency is responsible for testing each scanning operator by written examination.
The test questions should be appropriate for the scanning method to be used. The authorized inspection agency
should establish the passing score for the written examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.4.6  The authorized inspection agency is responsible for qualifying all examiners they employ. All examiners
(scanning operators and examiners performing prove-up on the indications) shall be qualified by performing an
examination on test plates as specified in G.5. Only third-party companies, having no conflict of interest in tank bottom
examination applications, or owner/operator companies may facilitate qualification tests. The examiner shall be
considered qualified if the acceptance criteria specified in G.5.3 has been met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examiners performing prove-up of indications using ultrasonic testing methods should be qualified in accordance
with API 650, Section 8.3.2 and supplemental requirements given in this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.4.7  During the qualification test, a TBEQ must be completed for each examiner. The TBEQ is a record of the
variables used during the qualification test. On the TBEQ, the qualifying company must record:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the essential variables from the qualification test;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the qualification test results;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) number of hours the individual has been trained;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) test score from the written training examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The TBEQ shall be certified (signed) as accurate by a representative of the authorized inspection agency and a
representative of the company facilitating the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>G.4.9  The bottom-scanning examiners (operators and/or UT examiners) should be re-qualified when any of the
following apply:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) when the examiner is not qualified to the TBP that is to be used at the owner/operator facility;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) when the authorized inspection agency changes the TBP and that change requires the procedure to be re-
qualified;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) when the operator has not performed a tank bottom scan in six months;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) when the operator has not used the specific procedure (TBP) for 12 months;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) when the authorized inspection agency has reason to question the ability of the examiner;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) when an examiner changes to a new employing authorized inspection agency that uses procedures with essential
variables that are different from the previous employer’s procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.5 Qualification Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.5.1 Qualification Test Plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>G.5.1.1  The qualification test will be performed on a sample tank bottom with designed flaws. The sample tank bottom
should be a minimum of 70 ft 2  to provide space for the designed flaws. The plate material used to fabricate sample
plates may be either new steel or used steel. It should be noted that the results obtained during qualification tests might
not be indicative of the results of examinations performed on other plates of differing quality or permeability. When used
steel is utilized for qualification purposes, the qualification test acceptance standards recommended in G.5.2 may not be
appropriate. The owner/operator should establish its own acceptance standards in such cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.5.1.2  The minimum number and types of underside test pits located on the test plates are described below:<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>t
is the remaining bottom thickness at test plate flaws.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   Test pits should generally be hemispherical having a depth-to-diameter ratio of from 20 % to 50 %. Test pits should
not be flat bottom holes since examiners may interpret these as a lamination. Also, machined conical holes should not be
used since they are difficult to size with UT methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/operator may consider placing additional flaws near the plate edge, i.e. less than 6 in. from the edge, to
determine if such flaws can be detected by authorized inspection agency procedures. Any flaws placed closer than
6 in. to the plate edge should be in addition to those shown above and should not be included in determining
qualification unless specifically required by an owner/operator and such defects are stated as being detectable in
authorized inspection agency procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>H.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex provides guidance for conducting a similar service assessment to establish inspection intervals for tanks
for which corrosion rates have not been directly measured as referenced in 6.3.2 and 6.4.2. This annex is intended for
use by an authorized inspector, storage tank engineer and other person(s) having knowledge and experience in
performing similar service assessments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.2 Similar Service Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Several criteria must be evaluated to determine whether the candidate tank is in similar service with the control tank.
Similar service assessment requires a sufficient amount of data collection and analysis and needs to be performed in a
comprehensive and thorough fashion in accordance with an established risk management program. Similar service
assessment is conducted using design, construction, operation, maintenance and inspection data. Data should be
obtained by using direct and indirect examination procedures such as MT and UT, evaluating product corrosivity,
measuring CP levels, determining soil properties, and other factors. Refer to the “Similar Service Assessment—
Datasheet,” which provides a place to record the required data. Data should be collected for each of the tank
characteristics listed on the datasheet for both the control tank and candidate tanks and an assessment made to
determine if the services are similar. Typically, there will not be an exact match of all data, or some of the required data
will not even be known. When there is not an exact match between one or more criteria, additional evaluation is
necessary to determine whether the tanks can be considered to be in similar service. Figure H.1 illustrates the steps in
conducting a similar service assessment. The “Similar Service Assessment—Datasheet” is to facilitate the comparison
of data for the two tanks. If the criteria for the control tank and candidate tank match, the candidate tank may be
considered in similar service as the control tank for that particular criterion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.2.1 Additional Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When additional assessment is required because an individual basic criterion does not match, the table references
the section describing additional factors that must be assessed. If the additional factors in the specified reference
section are assessed to be sufficiently similar, the tanks are considered in similar service for that factor. If all additional
provisions are satisfied, the tanks are considered in similar service. Additional assessment(s) must be documented
and maintained in the record file as per 6.8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.2.1.1   Year Tank Erected :   If the criteria for the control tank and candidate tank do not match, the following
additional provisions must be satisfied to consider both tanks in similar service:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the difference in ages of the tanks must be considered in the corrosion rate calculations, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) any substantive differences in the design and/or construction standards to which the tanks were constructed must
be considered in the similar service evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.2.1.2    Bottom Material : If the criteria for the control tank and candidate tank do not match, the following additional
provisions must be satisfied to consider both tanks in similar service:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the bottom material of the candidate tank must have similar corrosion-resistance properties as the bottom material
of the control tank,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the candidate tank, or both the candidate and the control tanks, utilize an effective lining to prevent corrosion of the
product-side of the bottom, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the potential for corrosion of the soil-side of the bottom is assessed to be similar for both tank bottom materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the shell material of the candidate tank must have similar corrosion-resistance properties as the shell material of
the control tank,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the candidate tank, or both the candidate and the control tanks, utilize a suitable lining to prevent corrosion of the
product-side of the shell, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the candidate tank, or both the candidate and the control tanks, utilize a suitable paint or coating to prevent
corrosion of the external side of the shell.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H.2.1.4  Corrosion Allowance, Bottom/Shell : If the criteria for the control tank and candidate tank do not match, the
difference in corrosion allowance should be accounted for in the remaining life and inspection interval calculations to
consider both tanks in similar service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H.2.1.5  Bottom Lining Type/Thickness/Age :   If the criteria for the control tank and candidate tank do not match, the
differences in the bottom lining systems must be assessed. The provisions of API 652 should be used to assess the
relative corrosion protection provided by the different lining systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H.2.1.6  Cathodic Protection : If the criteria for the control tank and candidate tank do not match, the following
additional provisions shall apply. The provisions of API 651 should be used to assess the relative corrosion protection
provided by the cathodic protection systems:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) if the candidate tank is protected with a properly designed and functional cathodic protection system, and the
control tank is not, the candidate tank may be considered to be in similar service with respect to cathodic
protection;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) if the control tank is protected with a properly designed and functional cathodic protection system, and the
candidate tank is not, the candidate tank may not be considered to be in similar service with respect to cathodic
protection;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) if the control tank and the candidate tank are protected with properly designed and functional cathodic protection
systems, the tanks may be considered to be in similar service with respect to cathodic protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>H.2.1.7  Double Bottom :   If the candidate tank and/or the control tank has multiple bottoms, the similar service
assessment of soil-side corrosion should be based on the material that is in contact with the underside of the primary

different services than the current service, the same factors described in H.2.1.10 should be evaluated for the
previous service conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>H.3 Example of Remaining Life Determination<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.3.1 Tank Bottom<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure H.2 illustrates one method of determining the time interval in which a tank bottom will reach its minimum
bottom plate thickness, beyond which the tank should be repaired or removed from service. In this example, the
original metal thickness was  1 / 4  in. when the tank was constructed in 1970. The minimum bottom plate thickness at
the next inspection interval was 0.05 in. (See also Table 4.4.) At the time of this evaluation (June 10, 1990), the tank
was in sour crude service. Previous service included 20 years in sour crude service. Based on thicknesses measured
and the calculated corrosion rate, the remaining life, or time to reach the minimum bottom plate thickness of 0.050 in.
is projected to be approximately 20 years, or June 10, 2010. See 4.4.5 for the minimum thickness calculation for a
tank bottom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>H.3.2 Tank Shell<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure H.3 illustrates one method of determining the time interval in which a tank shell course will reach its limit of
metal loss, beyond which the tank should be repaired or removed from service. In this example, the original metal
thickness was  1 / 2  in. when the tank was constructed in 1990. The limit of metal loss of the top shell course was
calculated to be  1 / 4  in. At the time of this evaluation (November 15, 2002), the tank was in sweet gasoline service.
Previous services included nearly seven years in sweet crude and nearly three years in sour crude service. Based
on thicknesses measured at periodic inspections and corrosion rates calculated from them, the remaining life, or
time to reach the metal loss limit of  1 / 4  in. is projected to be approximately four years, or August 1, 2006. See 4.3.3
for the minimum thickness calculation for an entire shell course.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>I.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex describes the process established by API for 1) submitting inquiries to API, and 2) for submitting
suggestions for changes to this standard. Inquiries and suggestions for change are welcome and encouraged
because they provide useful reader feedback to the responsible API Committee regarding technical accuracy, current
technology use, clarity, consistency, and completeness of the standard. API will attempt to answer all valid inquiries.
Submittals not complying with this Annex will be returned unanswered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sections I.2 through I.7, below, cover the submitting of inquiries. See Section I.8 for instructions about submitting
suggestions for change.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.2 Inquiry References<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.2.1  API maintains several websites that provide information that should be considered when considering
submitting an inquiry.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.2.2  Your inquiry may have been previously formally addressed by the Subcommittee and the resulting
interpretation posted on the API website as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— For all standards: http://mycommittees.api.org/standards/techinterp/default.aspx<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— For Refining Standards: http://mycommittees.api.org/standards/techinterp/refequip/default.aspx<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>— For Refining Standards: http://www.api.org/standards/addenda/add-ref.cfm<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.3 Definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.3.1  Inquiry: A question that asks what is the meaning of a specific paragraph, figure, or table in the standard; i.e.
what do the words say. It is not a question that asks about the intention of the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.3.2  The answer to the inquiry. Typically, the answer is simply a “Yes” or “No” response, with a brief clarification if
needed. This term is also used to refer to the combined question and answer.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.4 API Policy Regarding Inquiries<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.4.1  API has established the following limits on its activity in the handling of inquiries.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) API does not approve, certify, rate, or endorse any item, construction, proprietary device, or activity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) API does not provide information on the general understanding or application of the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.4.2  All inquiries that result in interpretations will be made available to the public on the API website.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.5 Submission of Inquiries<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.5.1  An electronic form for submitting a request can be found on the API Web site at http://rfi.api.org/. Please use
this means to submit your inquiry.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.5.2  All inquiries must comply with the following.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Current standard: If an inquiry refers to a version or addendum that is not the latest, the Subcommittee will develop
the interpretation based on the requirements stated in the current version.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Specific Reference: The applicable paragraph number, figure number, or table number must be cited in the inquiry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Sentence Structure: Inquiries must be written such that the answer can be a YES or NO, with technical details
added if necessary. The inquiry statement should be technically and editorially correct, and written in
understandable English.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Background: Providing a background explanation is optional, but is encouraged to assist the committee in
understanding the query.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Single Subject: The scope of an inquiry shall be limited to a single subject or a group of closely related subjects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) General Format:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) The general format of the inquiry should be as follows: “Does Paragraph XXX of API-6XX require that ….?”<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) The inquirer shall state what is required in his or her option, as the answer to the query.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) If a revision to the standard is believed to also be needed, provide recommended wording.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) The Inquirer should not use the inquiry process to improve his general understanding, design skills, and usage of
the standard. Consultants not affiliated with API are available for this purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) It is important that the Inquirer understand the difference between an inquiry and a suggestion for change. API
encourages both, but the submittal and committee handling procedures are different.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.5.3  General guidelines for submission can also be found on the API web site at:<<HEADING_END>>

reason(s) for not answering the inquiry. A form or checklist will typically be used for this response.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) If the Coordinator believes inquiry is valid, it will be forwarded to the Subcommittee for study, and the inquirer will
be advised using the form letter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) The Subcommittee will evaluate the inquiry and either develop a response or determine that the inquiry cannot be
answered, and advise the Coordinator accordingly. The Subcommittee will consider the need for modifying the
standard to resolve technical issues, add new requirements, make editorial corrections, improve clarity, remove
conflicts, etcetera.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f) The interpretation will be published on the API website when approved by the Subcommittee.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.6.2  The time required to process a valid inquiry as described in I.6.1 may take as long as a year.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.7 Interpretations Responding to Inquiries<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.7.1  An interpretation is written by the Subcommittee to provide the specific answer to an inquiry. It typically will not
state the intent of the standard, nor give reasons for the requirements, nor give historical bases, nor provide overall
understanding of the standard. If the inquiry is properly phrased, the interpretation can be a one-word response. With
many inquiries, there may be a need to provide clarifying statements, such as the limits on the applicability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.7.2  Although it is not possible to develop interpretations quickly to remedy immediate needs, the industry benefits
as a whole when inquiries are utilized as a means of trying to understand the technical requirements in the standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.8 Suggestions for Changes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.8.1  “Suggestion for Change” is not an inquiry; it is simply a communication (email preferred) from a reader to API
proposing that a specific change be made to the standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.8.2  Any format is acceptable, as long as the content is clear.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>I.8.3  The most effective means to submit suggestions is to send an email to the API Coordinator
(standards@api.org).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.8.4  The content of a suggestion must include the standard number, edition, and addendum in question. The
relevant paragraph numbers, table number, figure number, etc. must also be stated. Provide as much explanation as
necessary to be sure the Subcommittee understands the technical issues. Provide specific language that you think is
needed to implement the change. Last, include your name, company affiliation if any, and your return email or mailing
address.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I.8.5  API will forward all suggestions that are suitably written to the Subcommittee for consideration. The
Subcommittee will evaluate each suggestion and determine if a change is needed. Suggestions that are accepted by
the Subcommittee will be reflected in a future edition or addenda, but a reply advising the submitter of the
Subcommittee's decision may not be issued.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
