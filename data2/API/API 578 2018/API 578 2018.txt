for New and Existing Assets<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.1 Purpose<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of this recommended practice (RP) is to provide guidelines for an owner/user to develop and
implement a material verification program (MVP) as part of an asset integrity program. The MVP uses
positive material identification and other methods to verify that the nominal composition of an asset, an asset
component, or weldment within the pressure envelope is consistent with the selected or specified
construction materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A well-designed and well-implemented MVP is an important management system used to minimize the
potential for release of hazardous substances due to nonconforming materials of construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.2 About this Document<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This recommended practice provides the guidelines for material verification programs involving ferrous and
nonferrous alloys during the construction, installation, maintenance, and inspection of new and existing
process equipment. It applies to metallic materials purchased for use either directly by the owner/user or
indirectly through distributors, fabricators, or contractors, and includes the supply, fabrication, and installation
of these materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This recommended practice is applicable to all refining and petrochemical industries, and may be applied in
other industries and or businesses at the discretion of the owner/user. It is intended to be applied by any
owner/user wishing to verify and/or validate that the materials of construction received, fabricated, and/or
installed are in accordance with material and/or company specification(s).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1.3 Supersedes Notice<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This version of API RP 578 (third edition) supersedes and wholly replaces the second edition (2010) of API
RP 578 ( Material Verification Program for New and Existing Alloy Piping Systems ). The third edition contains
many of the same paragraphs and language of the second edition, but it has been revised, reformatted, and
re-visualized into a more encompassing document for all types of assets that may have an applicable
material verification program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Considerations and General Concerns<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Carbon Steel Substitutions in Low-alloy Steel Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When considering the likelihood of material nonconformances, it is worth noting that, historically, the greatest
number of material nonconformances with serious consequences have involved placing unapproved carbon
steel components into low-alloy steel (e.g. 1¼Cr-½Mo, 2¼Cr-1Mo, 5Cr-½Mo, 9Cr-1Mo) piping systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Alloy Substitutions for Carbon Steel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When determining the need to perform material verification on carbon steel, the owner/user should evaluate
the effect that the process stream could have on substituted materials. In some cases, the substitution of
hardenable alloy materials for carbon steel has resulted in failure and loss of containment. Examples of such
systems include those handling wet hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), hydrofluoric acid (HF), or sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ).
Where material substitution could lead to failure and/or loss of containment, the extent of verification should
be planned and/or increased in order to foster effectiveness, as well as validate the materials specified for
use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Stainless Steel and Nonferrous Substitutions Within High-alloy Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is an assortment of stainless steels with varying compositions and varying corrosion resistances to
different process streams. PMI should be considered by the owner/user depending upon the level of risk
(probability and consequence of failure) based upon the potential damage mechanisms and damage rates
associated with the installation of an unapproved high alloy during fabrication and installation. Examples of
these situations include the substitution of stainless steels for Alloy 400 in HF Alkylation services, the
substitution of a nonstabilized grade of stainless steel for a stabilized grade in a high-temperature service, or
substitution of Type 304 SS for Type 316 SS where the molybdenum content is important for corrosion
resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Residual Elements in Carbon Steels in Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation Units<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steels in some specific locations in HF acid service can experience increased corrosion rates based
on the residual element (RE) content in the steels; e.g. Cr, Ni, Cu  (refer to  API RP 751). PMI methods can
be used to assess the suitability of materials for HF service. Consideration should be given to the ability
and/or accuracy of the PMI method to detect the various elemental concentrations, which are miniscule in

<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Process Units Susceptible to Sulfidation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steels with low silicon (Si < 0.10%) content can corrode at a greater rate than carbon steels with
higher silicon (Si > 0.10%) content when exposed to hydrogen ‐ free sulfidation conditions. These phenomena
are discussed more extensively in API RP 571 and API RP 939-C. Owner/users with assets at risk from this
type of degradation should consider the risks and the requirements needed to apply PMI material control in
order to verify silicon levels and the effect on predicted corrosion rate. Alternatively, the owner/user may
want to consider locating and conducting thickness measurements on all potentially susceptible carbon steel
materials in a circuit exposed to hot sulfidation in order to determine if low-silicon components originally
installed may be resulting in higher corrosion rates than the rest of a piping circuit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6 Gasket Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gaskets in incompatible service may result in premature failures. The principles outlined in this document
can be applied to gasket materials. The owner/user should define the material control methods to be used.
The actual test procedures may be complex due to the construction of the gasket.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Material Verification Programs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user shall establish a written material verification program indicating the extent and type of PMI to
be conducted during the construction of new assets, retroactively on existing assets, and during the
maintenance, repair, or alteration of existing assets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For higher-risk systems, the owner/user should consider the need for employing a higher extent of in-process
and final examination (up to 100 %) rather than random sampling, which may be more appropriate for lower-
risk systems. The owner/user should also consider the need to conduct examinations after fabrication is
complete at the point-of installation, to provide assurance that inadvertent substitutions did not occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Asset Components Included in a Material Verification Program<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of pressure-containing components exposed to process conditions that are found in equipment

<<PARAGRAPH>>A material verification program may involve participation of several groups within the operating plant or the
shop of a contractor, distributor, or fabricator. When establishing a material verification program,
consideration should be given to the roles and responsibilities that each group has within the specific
organization. These roles and responsibilities should be clearly defined and documented. In the operating
plant, this can include those groups responsible for purchasing, engineering, warehousing/receiving,
operations, reliability, maintenance, and inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user or designee should specify the:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Prioritizing Assets for Retroactive PMI
5.6.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2.1
General Factors to Consider<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the owner/user elects to prioritize equipment or systems for the material verification program or needs to
determine whether PMI is needed at all, the owner/user should consider the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Likelihood of unapproved material substitutions during previous projects and maintenance activities: The
effectiveness of the material verification program when these activities occurred is an important
consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Consequences of a failure due to improper material being installed: Flammability and potential for
spreading fire, toxicity, proximity to other equipment or community, temperature, pressure, mode of
failure, and size of release should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Reason for a specific material specification (i.e. corrosion resistance or product purity): This refers to the
criticality of the material of choice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Historical data relating to unapproved material substitutions: This may be related to previous experience
with material nonconformities in the process unit/operating plant or within published information
available within the company and industry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Taken together, these factors can be used to determine the risk associated with possible material
nonconformances in an asset.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user should establish a methodology for estimating the relative priority for PMI within a given unit.
This methodology may be based on a qualitative or quantitative risk analysis. API RP 580 discusses risk-
based approaches and what should be considered when conducting a risk analysis (such as material,
service conditions, service fluid, and mode of failure). The owner/user may also want to consider the
opportunity to conduct PMI relative to upcoming planned maintenance opportunities (e.g. outages,
turnarounds).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.2.2
Site-specific Factors to Consider<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Site-specific and/or experienced-based factors should be considered when prioritizing equipment or piping
systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Construction and maintenance practices: In assessing the likelihood of material nonconformances, the
owner/user should also consider the materials handling, material control, and any PMI procedures
followed during construction of the process unit. Process-unit maintenance procedures are also
important. Process units in which rigorous procedures for material verification are used would be
expected to have a lower likelihood of nonconformances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Reason for alloy specification: In some cases, alloys are used in equipment systems for reasons other
than corrosion resistance or structural integrity. In these cases, the mechanical integrity of the system
may not be compromised by material nonconformances. A material verification program may not be
necessary in these systems. Two examples would be stainless steel lube oil systems in which stainless
steel is used for maintaining oil purity, or stainless steel in a chemical manufacturing process where
corrosion of carbon steel might cause product discoloration where any grade of stainless steel would be
an acceptable substitution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Based on experience, some types of components can have a higher likelihood of unapproved substitution of
a nonspecified material. This can provide a basis for prioritizing specific equipment in a given system or
process unit. Examples are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.7 MVP as an Element of Maintenance Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
5.7.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The principles associated with materials verification as part of an installation of new equipment should also
be applied to provide confidence that proper materials are being installed as part of maintenance activities.
The concepts noted in 5.4 should be reviewed and applied as applicable to the maintenance function.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Responsibilities
5.7.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall be the responsibility of the owner/user to evaluate maintenance systems so that material verification
programs can be designed and implemented to effectively support the mechanical integrity needs of assets.
The owner/user should establish a written procedure for the material verification program to be used for
repair of assets during maintenance and turnaround activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Control of Incoming Materials and Warehousing
5.7.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A material verification program should be directly applied to activities associated with receiving materials into
a warehouse system. PMI may be performed as part of this receiving function, or, when appropriate, may be
performed at the supplier’s location as a condition of release for shipment. The material verification program<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>G UIDELINES FOR A  M ATERIAL  V ERIFICATION  P ROGRAM  (MVP)  FOR  N EW AND  E XISTING  A SSETS
9<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>that is adopted should provide for proper documentation and methods for indicating which materials have
been tested and are approved for use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of material verification program principles to check materials received into a warehouse system
should be regarded as a quality assurance practice to minimize the potential for discovering an alloy material
discrepancy during subsequent PMI. PMI within the warehouse should not be regarded as an alternative to
PMI of the fabricated assets when PMI is specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Maintenance Activities
5.7.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are a number of in-service maintenance activities where material verification should be established.
Some examples include, but are not limited to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Temporary removal of piping spool pieces, including the removal of blind flanges used for access: These
activities need to be properly managed to minimize the potential for unapproved material substitutions.
Incidents have occurred when same-size spool pieces were removed and reinstalled in the wrong
locations. Consideration should be given to a material control system, such as “tagging” spools as they
are removed, or the use of PMI prior to reinstallation to prevent these incidences from occurring<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Replacement of small bore threaded pipe nipples and plugs, frequently found as drains and vents in
process areas: An immediate need may necessitate the installation of nonconforming materials in a
temporary repair; it is important to recognize even small changes need to be documented and reported
for possible future follow-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Replacement of welded-in valves:  Manufacturers/distributors may substitute low-alloy valves for carbon
steel valves in higher-temperature/pressure services, and if this is not communicated, the craftsmen
may end up using the incorrect welding procedure during installation. This error may produce cracks in
the new welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
In turnaround situations where many heat exchangers in varying services are disassembled for cleaning,
inspection, and repair: It is essential that all original components, or correct replacement components,
are returned to the same exchanger during reassembly. An adequate marking and tracking system, as
well as PMI, can be utilized to assure the proper components are returned to the correct service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
When tower internals, such as tray parts (e.g. clips, tray flapper valves or bubble caps, and fasteners)
are replaced, one may consider performing point-of-installation PMI (or other material control program)
to assure the replacement parts are as specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important that repair procedures include consideration of PMI. Much of this can be controlled through
awareness of the issues at all levels within the repair process. Consulting with those involved with
implementing the programs where the repair will be performed, prior to commencement of work, can help
ensure that systems, processes, and activities are in place to provide material control and verification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6
PMI Methodology and Technology<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A variety of PMI methods are available to determine the identity of alloy materials. The primary methods
include portable spectroscopy and laboratory chemical analysis. A description of several test methods is
listed below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to these methods, there are a variety of alloy sorting techniques that may be appropriate for the
purposes of this RP, including magnetic testing to differentiate between ferritic and austenitic materials. It is
important that users define the objectives and accuracies required of the PMI tool they wish to apply. All of
the tools have benefits and limitations on the elements that can be detected, in addition to the accuracy and
ability to differentiate between different material grades that have only slight variations in alloying elements.

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 MVP Test Method Objectives<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test methods outlined in this document are intended to identify materials and are not intended to
establish the exact conformance of a material to a particular specification. Depending on the test method
selected, the method may only identify the nominal composition of materials. Identification of materials by
visual stamps/markings alone should not be considered as a substitute for PMI but may be an important
component of an overall quality assurance program.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 PMI Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The PMI procedure should identify and include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the techniques to be applied;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— equipment calibration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— qualification requirements for personnel conducting the PMI;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— surface preparation requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— testing methodology applied;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— acceptance criteria; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— documentation requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Personnel Qualifications<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Person(s) performing PMI should be knowledgeable about all aspects of operation of the PMI equipment and
the test method being applied. Qualifications of the person performing the test, including training and
experience, should be submitted for review and approval by the owner/user.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user is responsible to assure that all individuals performing PMI are trained and qualified in
accordance with the applicable procedure used during the examination. Certification and qualification are two
of the most effective methods to prove requirements are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5 Chemical Analysis Techniques<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Laboratory Chemical Analysis
6.5.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Owner/user-approved material analysis laboratories using X-ray emission spectrometry, optical emission
spectrometry, or wet chemical analysis can provide the most accurate analytical results for all elements. The
accuracy is typically much higher than is normally needed for PMI. Laboratory analysis may involve the
removal of significant amounts of material, and is typically slower than field PMI techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Chemical Spot Testing
6.5.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The chemical spot test is typically accomplished by electrochemically removing a minute amount of surface
metal and depositing it onto moistened filter paper. Reagents dropped onto the paper produce distinct colors
that are indicative of the presence of specific elements in the sample tested. Chemical spot testing is much
slower than the other field PMI methods, and interpretation is subjective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.6 Sorting Analysis Techniques<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Resistivity Testing
6.6.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The principle employed in this test method is known as the Seebeck effect, or thermoelectric principle. A
heated junction of dissimilar metal is created when the heated probe [300 °F (150 °C)] and the metal being
tested are in contact with each other. The voltage generated at this junction is representative of the
chemistry and crystalline structure of the metal being tested. Every alloy of a given crystalline structure will
generate the same voltage regardless of the geometry or size of the piece being tested or the pressure
applied. By references to known standards, these instruments are capable of sorting and identifying a wide
range of ferrous and nonferrous materials. Alloy sorters have not proved to be consistently capable of sorting
low-alloy (< 5 % Cr) and austenitic stainless steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Other Techniques
6.6.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Techniques such as eddy-current sorting, electromagnetic alloy sorting, triboelectric testing (e.g. ferrite
meters), and thermoelectric testing are qualitative and as such may only be appropriate for limited sorting
applications and not for specific alloy identification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7 Spectrometer Technology<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Portable X-ray Fluorescence
6.7.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are several variants of portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometers available. The principle of
operation is that one or more gamma ray or X-ray sources are used to generate a beam of low-energy
radiation to excite the material under analysis. The material under analysis then emits a characteristic
radiation spectrum that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively to determine which elements
are present and in what quantity. The results of this analysis can be reported in either of the following
formats:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— as a match against one of many reference spectra stored in the instrument ( i.e. “316 Stainless Steel” or
“5 Cr –½Mo Steel”); and/or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— each element present reported as a percentage (i.e. “Iron = 87.5 %” or “Iron = 0.875” as part of an entire
elemental list that should be normalized against 100 %).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A number of PMI instruments are available. These instruments can have the sensitivity to determine the
elemental levels that meet the ASTM limits. Advancements in XRF technology, such as 50KV, X-ray tubes,
and silica drift detectors (SDD), allow the user to detect light elements down to very low concentrations in
steel substrates. For example, the latest generation of handheld X-ray fluorescence analyzers now measure
light elements (Mg, Al, Si, P, and S) to very low limits of detection (see Annex A) and can provide for field
measurement of silicon in steel down to very low concentrations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These advancements in technology allow for accurate, nondestructive measurements to be conducted.
However, to get this near-laboratory-quality measurement, significant care regarding surface preparation and
cleanliness is required, as contamination of the prepared surface can lead to inaccurate results. Most assets
are exposed to environments that promote surface corrosion and contamination, which can interfere with the
analysis. Typically, a small test area is prepared with a portable grinding disk (60 to 80 grit, minimum
zirconium aluminum oxide disposable abrasive disk) to properly clean the sample location prior to analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inherent limitations of the technique mean it is not possible to detect all elements. XRF analyzers are
capable of detecting elements from magnesium (Mg) to Uranium (U) in the periodic tables. This excludes
some of the important elements in carbon steels, such as carbon and boron. It is important to define exactly
what elemental analysis is required and select an appropriate instrument.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_19>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>12
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  578<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Portable Optical Emission Spectrometry
6.7.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In optical emission spectrometry (OES), an electric arc, spark, or laser stimulates atoms in the test sample to
emit a characteristic spectrum of light for each element in the sample. The combined light spectra from
different elements are passed through a light guide to the optical analyzer. In the analyzer, the light is
dispersed into its spectral components, and then measured and evaluated against stored calibration curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These devices fall into three groups:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
The first is a lightweight, portable, and operator-evaluated device that can typically identify up to 16
elements but depends upon operator evaluation of the light spectra. These devices do not directly
indicate alloy grade or composition, but produce an output in the form of visible light spectra that permits
semi-qualitative alloy identification. This technique is highly sensitive to operator skill and experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
The second group refers to field-portable, laboratory grade analyzers. These were originally difficult to
use due to their size and weight; however, modern units are now available that can be considered
lightweight, including the small argon cylinders required for operation. Some of these analyzers operate
in a pure arc mode for routine PMI applications, while the more sophisticated units have a spark mode
allowing laboratory quality analysis. The significant advantage of these instruments is the expansion of
elements that can be analyzed, including carbon. Another advantage of these advanced instruments is
that they are not subject to operator interpretation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar to X-ray fluorescence devices, results can be reported in either a spectral match or elemental
percentage mode. As these techniques generate arcs and sparks, a potential ignition source occurs
during their operation; therefore, prior to use of this technique in the field, a review shall be conducted in
order to determine if gas testing and hot work permits are required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
The third group is known as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), in which an atomic emission
spectroscopy technique uses highly energetic laser pulses. The laser is focused to form plasma, which
atomizes and excites samples. Plasma light emissions provide the spectral signature of chemical
composition for practically any material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When calibrated for metal analysis, LIBS can provide both qualitative and quantitative information to
determine which elements are present and in what quantity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Considerable progress has been made during the past few years in LIBS technology. Handheld LIBS
metal analyzers are becoming available that can provide fast in situ chemical analysis with appropriate
precision and detection limits (Annex A). The significant advantage of LIBS technology is its wide
element range. In principle, LIBS can detect all elements, limited by the power of the laser as well as the
sensitivity and wavelength range of the spectrograph and detector. The LIBS technology also can
provide low-level carbon analysis, which, in principle, enables LIBS to positively identify a wide range of
ferrous alloys.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This technique generates a laser during operation, which is a potential ignition source. Therefore, before
using this technique in the field, a review shall be conducted in order to determine if gas testing and hot
work permits are required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Equipment Calibration
6.7.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Persons performing PMI should calibrate and/or verify the test equipment performance as specified by the
equipment manufacturer. The PMI procedure should provide the frequency interval for this
calibration/verification. If calibration procedures are not provided by the equipment manufacturer, they should
be established by the owner/user. Typically, these procedures should include calibration/verification using
certified standards. The owner/user may consider requirement of equipment verification checks on a routine
(e.g. once per shift) using certified standards of the same alloy family.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Equipment Precision
6.7.4<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The precision of the test equipment should be consistent with the established test objectives (see 5.2). When
elemental composition is desired, the owner/user should establish the acceptable precision and repeatability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Accuracy and the method in which it is determined need to be understood (reference Annex A). For example,
in some tools the sensitivity may depend on duration of the test in order to improve signal averaging
algorithms. Failure to understand these issues may produce inaccurate results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.8 Safety Issues<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>General
6.8.1<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specific requirements for each PMI technique should be clearly reviewed as to the amount of
mechanical preparation. Consideration should be given to the anticipated thickness of the sample before
mechanical methods are used to prepare the sample. In addition, considerations for electrical arcing and “hot
spots” should be considered, as well as appropriate electrical and hot work permits. Chemical spot testing
involves the use of a variety of chemicals. Appropriate safety precautions should be taken when handling
these chemicals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.8.2.2
Radiation Safety<<HEADING_END>>

is expected to observe local jurisdictional requirements that govern radiation safety, and consult the
manufacturer’s instructions for safe operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>PMI of Welding Consumables
6.8.3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Performing PMI of a weld cap does not assure the root pass or subsequent weld passes are made with the
specified chemistry. An acceptable method to address in-process PMI during welding is explained here:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Prior to use in fabrication, sample “buttons” should be welded using each heat of bare wire, lot of
covered electrodes, or flux-cored electrodes. PMI can then be used to confirm that weld metal meets
specification. The size of the weld button should be adequate to assure accurate test results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Some weld rods have the alloying elements contained in the flux, and do not meet the alloy specification
until welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— It is not necessary to test a button of bare wire if the test chosen can identify the composition of the wire
before welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.8.3.1
Longitudinal Pipe and Fitting Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where there is reason to suspect problems, longitudinally welded alloy pipe and fittings should receive PMI
verification of the base metal and weld metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.8.3.2
Autogenous Welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the owner/user determines that material verification testing is required on autogenous-welded (with no
added filler metal) alloy pipe or fittings, it is necessary to conduct testing on only the base metal. If repairs<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  578<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>are made during original fabrication, the fabricator is to conduct testing on the base metal and the weld metal
if a filler metal was used for the repair.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.8.3.3
Dissimilar Metal Welds and Weld Overlays<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Results from testing dissimilar metal welds should take into account the effects of dilution, which occurs
during weld deposition. The owner/user should establish the minimum compositional requirements of the as-
deposited weld metal necessary for the intended service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7
Evaluation of Testing Results<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Material Acceptance Methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The owner/user may elect any one of the following methods of material acceptance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Materials can be confirmed to contain the nominal amounts of alloying elements specified in the relevant
materials specification (e.g. ASME Section II or ASTM specifications).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Materials can be classified through a qualitative sorting technique (see 6.7) to establish the conformance
with the intended material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
When PMI indicates that alloying elements are outside the ranges indicated in the material specification,
the owner/user may still choose to allow the use of the tested materials in situations where a person
knowledgeable of the appropriate damage mechanisms confirms that the material will perform
satisfactorily in the service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
If testing using one of the portable or qualitative analysis methods leads to the potential rejection of a
component, a more accurate analysis may be used to determine component acceptance (see
Section 6).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Follow-up PMI after Discovery of a Nonconformity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If any one of a representative sample is rejected, all items of that inspection lot should be considered
suspect. A more extensive inspection of the remaining lot should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8
Materials Identification<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Identification Process<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alloy materials should be identified by their alloy designation or nominal composition. Examples of some
acceptable identification methods are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
color coding by alloy;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
a low-stress stamp marking indicating that the test has been performed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
documentation showing both the PMI results and the PMI locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Test locations should be shown on appropriate drawings so that each test site can be traceable to the
fabricated components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Color Coding/Marking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.1
If the material verification program procedure established by the owner/user requires a visual
identification such as color coding or marking, the owner/user should maintain a record of the alloy
material/color code combinations. PFI Standard  ES22  is an example of one such system. Materials<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

15<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>identification by color coding is not a substitute for permanent manufacturers’ markings required by
applicable ASTM or other materials specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.2
Where reliance on color marking is used, persons responsible for reading the colors should be
confirmed as being able to distinguish the difference between the colors being used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Marking of Components<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the owner/user’s documentation process requires physical marking of equipment components, it should
specify one of the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— whether or not the marking system should remain legible for the expected life of the component without
deterioration due to corrosion or elevated temperature;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— whether or not the marking system is only temporary to facilitate proper handling and identification from
the point of PMI to final installation. This marking can be semi-permanent paint applied to each item. The
markers should not contain additives such as metallic pigments (Al, Pb, or Zn), sulfur, or chlorides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9
Documentation and Recordkeeping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1 Shop and Field PMI Documentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Those individuals performing PMI should obtain and follow the PMI procedure approved by the owner/user.
This procedure should include the technique used, equipment calibration, the qualification requirements of
PMI personnel, the testing methodology, and documentation requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When documentation, such as drawings, is used in lieu of physical marking, the documentation should allow
the owner/user to identify which components were tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2 New and Existing Equipment or System Documentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When PMI is conducted on new or existing assets and systems, records of the results should be kept as long
as the equipment exists in its original location. If equipment or a portion of an equipment system that has not
received material verification is relocated, the owner/user should consider the need for PMI prior to placing
the relocated components into service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where applicable, some owner/users have created master PMI piping isometric drawings to track the
components that were tested and test results. These drawings are maintained and updated as piping
modifications occur from projects or process changes. A single documentation system eliminates the need to
search for data in multiple locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3 PMI Records<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical PMI records should contain the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— reference to the PMI procedure(s) used;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— date of testing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— test instrument identification number or serial number, where appropriate;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— name of each person performing the tests, with identification of their respective employer;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— results of the tests;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_23>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>16
API   R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  578<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— basis and action for resolving and documenting PMI nonconformances, including those that have been
left in service;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— documentation of the criteria used for prioritization of equipment or systems and extent of PMI
performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The information listed should be reported in such a manner that it is traceable to the point of installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, the owner/user may choose to include this within the written material verification procedure.
When included in the owner/user’s written material verification procedure, the date and edition number of the
written procedure should be documented in the test record.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Annex A
(informative)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Statistical Terminology<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Below are some of the terms regarding statistics that may be encountered when using the methodology
and/or technology discussed within this document.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Accuracy: The closeness of agreement between the test result and the accepted reference value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Precision: The closeness of agreement between independent test results. The precision depends only on
the distribution of random errors and does not relate to the accepted standard certified value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Bias: The difference between the expectation of the test results and an accepted reference value. Bias is
a systematic error, in contrast to a random error. There may be one or more systematic error
components contributing to the bias.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Limit of detection (LOD): The lowest concentration of analyte that can be reliably distinguished from zero
concentration in a sample by defining a 99 % confidence to show that the analyte concentration is
greater than zero. Therefore, 3-sigma calculations must be used to determine LOD (see definition for
standard deviation (SD) below).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Instrument detection limit (IDL): The lowest (best) detection limit generated by an instrument in a clean
matrix (blank).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Method detection limit (MDL): The typical detection limit obtained when running a typical sample. It is
matrix dependent, and will vary from matrix to matrix.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Limit of quantitation (LOQ): The lowest concentration that can be reliably measured to allow quantitative
readings. It is typically defined as 10-sigma (or 3.33 times the LOD).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Standard deviation (SD): The standard deviation is a statistic that defines how tightly all the data is
clustered around the mean in a dataset. It essentially measures the variability (spread or dispersion)
from the mean (average) and is defined mathematically. For “normal” distributions, we can apply an
empirical rule that states that 68 % of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean; 95 % of the
data is within two standard deviations of the mean; and 99.7 % of the data is within three standard
deviations of the mean.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Relative standard deviation (RSD): The standard deviation is divided by the mean of the data and
multiplied by 100 to give a % value. The bigger the % value, the “noisier” the signal and less confidence
in the final value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Repeatability: The duplicate (or more) analysis within the shortest possible time, performed by the same
person using the same method. The standard of many analyses using repeatability conditions indicates
the minimum deviation achievable in the particular conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— Reproducibility: This is a duplicate (or more) analysis performed by a different person, preferably using a
different method or (different instrument).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
