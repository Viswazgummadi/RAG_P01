<<PARAGRAPH>>API publications necessarily address problems of a general nature. With respect to partic-
ular circumstances, local, state, and federal laws and regulations should be reviewed.
API is not undertaking to meet the duties of employers, manufacturers, or suppliers to
warn and properly train and equip their employees, and others exposed, concerning health
and safety risks and precautions, nor undertaking their obligations under local, state, or fed-
eral laws.
Information concerning safety and health risks and proper precautions with respect to par-
ticular materials and conditions should be obtained from the employer, the manufacturer or
supplier of that material, or the material safety data sheet.
Nothing contained in any API publication is to be construed as granting any right, by
implication or otherwise, for the manufacture, sale, or use of any method, apparatus, or prod-
uct covered by letters patent. Neither should anything contained in the publication be con-
strued as insuring anyone against liability for infringement of letters patent.
Generally, API standards are reviewed and revised, reafﬁrmed, or withdrawn at least every
ﬁve years. Sometimes a one-time extension of up to two years will be added to this review
cycle. This publication will no longer be in effect ﬁve years after its publication date as an
operative API standard or, where an extension has been granted, upon republication. Status
of the publication can be ascertained from the API<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Upstream Segment [telephone (202) 682-
8000]. A catalog of API publications and materials is published annually and updated quar-
terly by API, 1220 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005.
This document was produced under API standardization procedures that ensure appropri-
ate notiﬁcation and participation in the developmental process and is designated as an API
standard. Questions concerning the interpretation of the content of this standard or com-
ments and questions concerning the procedures under which this standard was developed
should be directed in writing to the general manager of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Petroleum Institute, 1220 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005. Requests for permission
to reproduce or translate all or any part of the material published herein should also be
addressed to the general manager.
API standards are published to facilitate the broad availability of proven, sound engineer-
ing and operating practices. These standards are not intended to obviate the need for apply-
ing sound engineering judgment regarding when and where these standards should be
utilized. The formulation and publication of API standards is not intended in any way to
inhibit anyone from using any other practices.
Any manufacturer marking equipment or materials in conformance with the marking
requirements of an API standard is solely responsible for complying with all the applicable
requirements of that standard. API does not represent, warrant, or guarantee that such prod-
ucts do in fact conform to the applicable API standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>FOREWORD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This recommended practice is under the jurisdiction of the API Subcommittee on Stan-
dardization of Tubular Goods.
No provision of this recommended practice shall be cause for rejection of casing or tubing
provided the threads are in accordance with the requirements of the latest edition of API
Standard 5B.
This recommended practice is presented as a guide and instructional tool for pipe mill
inspectors, third party inspectors, and users interested in developing skills in inspection of
threads on oil country tubular goods and line pipe. It includes pictures of numerous gauges
and measuring instruments. Every effort has been made to present gauges without regard to
the origin of manufacture. Additionally, inclusion of certain gauges should not be construed
as an endorsement of the instrument or its manufacture. Similarly, the exclusion of any
gauge is not an indication of dissatisfaction with that instrument.
API publications may be used by anyone desiring to do so. Every effort has been made by
the Institute to assure the accuracy and reliability of the data contained in them; however, the
Institute makes no representation, warranty, or guarantee in connection with this publication
and hereby expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility for loss or damage resulting
from its use or for the violation of any federal, state, or municipal regulation with which this
publication may conﬂict.
Suggested revisions are invited and should be submitted to the general manager of
the Upstream Segment, American Petroleum Institute, 1220 L Street, N.W., Washington,

<<HEADING level=2>>Gauging and Inspection of Casing, Tubing, and Line Pipe Threads<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>publication uses the terms casing and tubing in the mill/API
sense. In most cases, this will also conform to the end use
description.
Each of the pipe connections must be capable of with-
standing internal and/or external pressure without leakage.
The competence of the design and the accuracy of manufac-
ture of the connection provides assurance of the required leak
resistance. API connections are among the most accurately
machined threads currently mass produced. Each component
shape and size is designed and machined to interact with the
mating component to form a ﬂuid seal.
Inspecting the threaded ends of pipe determines if the manu-
factured product is in compliance with the design speciﬁcation.
Oil country tubular goods and line pipe are inspected at the
manufacturer’s facility prior to shipment. Additionally, the pipe
may be inspected at the pipe yard, job site, and/or drilling rig.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ability of line pipe and oil country tubular goods (such
as, oil and gas well casing and tubing) to perform properly
depends on the physical integrity of the pipe body and con-
nections. Threads at each end of the pipe provide a means of
joining the pipe segments into a continuous “string” of pipe.
There are many thread conﬁgurations applied to oil country
tubular goods. However, they all have two functions in com-
mon: they must resist leakage and tensile failures. This is
accomplished by applying threads which are specially
designed and accurately machined. Laboratory and prototype
testing prior to marketing of the connection veriﬁes the
proper design. Accurate machining depends on a repetitive
process to simulate tool wear. Excessive tool wear and/or
damage after machining reduces the thread’s performance.
This recommended practice provides guidance and instruc-
tion on the correct use of thread inspection techniques and
equipment to assure dimensionally accurate connections. The
inspector carries a heavy responsibility. This responsibility can
be discharged properly only if the inspector is adequately
trained. This recommended practice provides the training and
insight necessary to perform an adequate inspection of line
pipe and oil country tubular goods connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

BACKGROUND<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>are two terms which are used to
describe oil country tubular goods that become part of a com-
pleted oil and gas well.
When these terms are used in ﬁeld drilling and production
operations, the term “casing” applies to pipe that is used to
line the drilled hole to protect the well from formation ﬂuid
ﬂow or formation collapse. It is a permanent part of the well in
which bottom sections of casing are cemented in place. At
times, cement is circulated to the surface. Among the various
types of casing are conductor pipe, surface casing, intermedi-
ate or protective casing, and production casing (Figure 1).
These casing strings extend to the surface. A section of the
hole lined with pipe that does not reach the surface is called a
liner. Liners may or may not be cemented in place.
The term “tubing” applies to the innermost pipe in a well.
Well ﬂuids are brought to the surface through the tubing. The
tubing may be isolated from the casing by a production packer.
Tubing is frequently removed from the hole and at times is
replaced.
The terms<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Casing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>tubing<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>, when used in a steel mill or
in API speciﬁcations, are oriented to size and not necessarily
to end use. The mills may not know what will be the end use
of their pipe. Accordingly, in mill practice and in API speciﬁ-
cations, casing generally covers pipe 4<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The manufacturer’s inspection is not normally an inspec-
tion of each individual connection. Rather, it is normally an
inspection of a statistically designed sample based on manu-
facturer’s experience. The ﬁeld inspection generally is an
inspection of each threaded end. The scope of the ﬁeld
inspection varies based on the owner’s desires and the inher-
ent constraints of ﬁeld inspection.
Corrosion resistance and sealing ability of connections are
improved by plating the threads, usually in the coupling or
box, with zinc, tin, or metallic phosphate. The plating pro-
duces a beneﬁcial effect; however, it generally interferes with
the precision of gauging of these threads because it’s difﬁcult
to plate threads uniformly. This is particularly true of zinc and
tin, which are electroplated. The portion of the thread closest
to the anode receives the greatest thickness of plated metal.
Some manufacturers may prefer to apply the coating to the
pipe (pin end) member, particularly on special or premium-
type connections. In all cases, coatings are applied for the
purposes of (a) antigalling during makeup, (b) anticorrosion
while in storage, or (c) as an aid to sealing (in threads) for
leak resistance.
Gauging of threads by manufacturers is performed prior to
coating. Field gauging of coated threads may be less accurate
than gauging at the manufacturer’s facility. Discretion should
be used, therefore, in interpreting the results of ﬁeld gauging
of coated threads. Additionally, manufacturer gauging is per-
formed prior to assembly of the pipe components. Accord-
ingly, gauging of assembled (made-up) threaded components
can result in the components not conforming with the speciﬁ-
cation values because of makeup distortion.
Off-speciﬁcation components of coated, but unmade-up
components can be recognized by ﬁeld gauging. If a dispute
arises, however, the coating shall be removed and the compo-
nent regauged.
The manufacturers make a conscious effort to eliminate
off-speciﬁcation tubular goods within the ﬁnancial and statis-
tical constraints of the manufacturer. Users, particularly at
critical wells or pipelines, desire an inspection at the drilling
rig or ﬁeld site to eliminate any thread damage which
occurred during shipment, or any off-speciﬁcation threads
which may not have been found at the manufacturer’s facility.
It is important to locate and eliminate damaged or off-spec-
iﬁcation pipe. Rejecting “good” pipe, however, results in a
ﬁnancial burden being imposed on the manufacturer and/or
operator. Thus, inspection shall be performed with care
and reason.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This publication was prepared under the auspices of the
API Subcommittee of Tubular Goods and the Resource
Group on Threading and Gauging. As such, the scope is lim-
ited to inspection of API casing, tubing, and line pipe connec-
tions. However, the basic techniques of gauge usage apply to
any threads for which the thread element speciﬁcations are
known. Speciﬁcally, this recommended practice was written
to supplement and augment the latest editions of API Speciﬁ-
cations 5CT and 5L, which mandate physical and mechanical
properties of casing, tubing, and line pipe. Additionally, this
recommended practice is designed to be used with the latest
edition of API Speciﬁcation 5B,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Speciﬁcation for Threading,
Gauging, and Thread Inspection of Casing, Tubing, and Line
Pipe Threads<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>. It does not duplicate the massive dimensional
tables contained in the latest edition of API Spec 5B. Instead,
it provides instruction in inspection techniques appropriate to
comparing the dimension of the product with speciﬁed
dimensions and tolerances for that product. Accordingly, the
primer can be used for the inspection of API thread elements
without direct reference to the latest edition of Spec 5B. In all
cases, the latest edition of Spec 5B takes precedence if a dis-
pute arises between parties.
This publication uses photographs to demonstrate the
proper use of representative gauges normally used by thread
inspectors. Gauges presented are limited to those appropriate
to both mill and ﬁeld use. Thus, nonportable instruments such
as comparators and contour readers are not included. How-
ever, there is no intent to limit the use of such instruments or
methods by inspectors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API Threaded Connections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A threaded connection consists of two members: a pipe or
pin member and a coupling or box member. The externally
threaded member is called the pipe or pin member. The inter-
nally threaded member is called the coupling or box member.
Two pin members are connected together by means of a cou-
pling, which is a short segment of pipe slightly larger in
diameter than the pipe, but threaded internally from each end
(Figure 2). The pins may be the same thickness as the pipe
body (non-upset) or thicker than the pipe body (upset). All
API threaded and coupled (T&C) casing and line pipe are
non-upset.
Tubing is manufactured with either non-upset or external
upset ends. The approximate internal diameter of the pipe
ends is equal to that of the pipe body (Figure 2). However, the
outside diameter (OD) at the upset ends is larger than the pipe
body (Figure 2). API integral joint tubing connections are
upset on both ends.
Threads, as applied to tubular connections, are used to
mechanically hold two pieces of pipe together in axial align-
ment. The threads may or may not be required to act as a leak
resistant element.
API tubular good speciﬁcations cover four styles of
threads, namely line pipe threads (Figure 3); round threads
(Figure 4); buttress threads (Figures 5 and 6); and extreme-
line threads (Figure 7). Line pipe, round, and buttress threads<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>are required to ﬁt together in made-up assembly such that
with sealant they will resist leakage through the threads. The
threads in extreme-line casing are not designed to be leak
tight. Leak resistance of the extreme-line connection is
accomplished by the use of a metal-to-metal seal (Figure 7).
On a threaded connection, the stab or front ﬂank of a thread
is the radial surface facing the nearest end of the pipe (Figures
3, 4, 5, and 7). The load or back ﬂank is the radial surface fac-
ing toward the pipe body. The top and bottom of a thread are
designated as crest and root, respectively (Figures 3, 4, 5, and
7). On a pipe member, the crest is the largest diameter of a
thread and the root is the smallest diameter, with the coupling
member, the largest diameter is called the root, and the crest is
the smaller diameter (Figures 3, 4, 5, and 7).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

LINE PIPE THREAD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thread is a 60° Vee-type thread with the included angle
between ﬂanks being 60° (Figure 3). The crests and roots are
truncated on a cone parallel with the taper. When the joint is
assembled, the crest and root clearance will be 0.005 in. radi-
ally. This void can be a leak path unless a suitable thread
compound is used. The stab and load ﬂanks are interference-
bearing surfaces when the connection is properly made up,
and unless these ﬂank surfaces are damaged or malformed,
they will prevent leakage from crest to root (or vice versa). If
such a thread is made up with insufﬁcient interference
between pin and coupling members, the coupling (or box)
member will not retain enough contact load on the thread
ﬂanks to resist high internal pressure. Leakage will then occur
radially over the thread ﬂanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2
ROUND TUBING AND CASING THREADS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>most critical consideration is to ensure that there are no
detectable protrusions on the threads to peel off the protective
coating on the coupling threads or score mating surfaces.
Cosmetic repair of thread surfaces by hand is permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This thread is basically the same thread form as used on
line pipe except that the thread crests and roots are truncated
with a radius (Figure 4). The purpose of the round top (crests)
and round bottom (roots) is to: (a) improve the resistance of
the threads from galling in makeup, (b) provide a controlled
clearance between made-up thread crest and root for foreign
particles or contaminants, and (c) make the crests less suscep-
tible to harmful damage from minor scratches or dings.
If insufﬁcient interference is applied during makeup, the
leak path through this connection could be through the annu-
lar clearance between mated crest and roots. Again, proper
thread compound is necessary to ensure leak resistance.
The clearance (radially) between an assembled thread crest
and root is approximately 0.003 in., but unlike line pipe, the
round thread clearance is a crescent shape (Figure 4).
Superﬁcial scratches, minor dings, and surface irregulari-
ties on the thread surface are occasionally encountered and
may not necessarily be detrimental. Because of the difﬁculty
in deﬁning superﬁcial scratches, minor dings, and surface
irregularities, the degree to which they affect thread perfor-
mance can not be established. As a guide to acceptance, the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

BUTTRESS THREAD-CASING
(THREADED AND COUPLED)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Buttress threads are designed to resist high axial tension or
compression loading in addition to offering resistance
to leakage.
For sizes 4 1 / 2  in. through 13 3 / 8  in. (Figure 5), the threads
are 5 pitch (pitch = 0.200 in.) per in. on a  3 / 4 -in. taper per ft
on diameter. The stab ﬂank is 10° from radial, and the load
ﬂank is 3° from radial. The crests and roots are conical and
parallel with the taper. The stab ﬂank radius at the crest is
large (0.030 in.  R ) as compared to the load ﬂank radius at the
crest (0.008 in.  R ). This is to aid in stabbing and running. The
threads are full-form ﬁt when assembled resulting in a maxi-
mum thread crest-to-root clearance of 0.002 inch. Inherent
machining variations in threading may cause the threads to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>bear on one thread ﬂank at one end of the thread element of
the connection and on the opposite thread ﬂank at the other
end of the element. In any event, leak resistance is again
accomplished with use of the proper thread compound and/or
thread coating agent. Leak resistance is controlled by proper
assembly (interference) within the perfect thread length only.
The thread root of this connection runs out on a continuous
cone to the OD of the pipe body, and the coupling (box)
member engages the root diameter of the imperfect threads
which extend from the last full thread (on the pin) to the van-
ishing point or from the last imperfect thread on the pipe OD.
The 3° load ﬂank offers resistance to disengagement under
high axial tension loading, while the 10° stab ﬂank offers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>resistance to high axial compressive loading. Attempted repair
by hand dressing should be done with discretion and limited to
a small part of the perfect thread length. Discretionary repair
to the imperfect thread area of the pin does not affect leakage
control.
Buttress casing threads on sizes 16-in. diameter and larger
have ﬁve threads per inch on a 1-in. taper per ft on diameter
and have ﬂat crests and roots parallel to the pipe axis
(Figure 6). This is to aid in stabbing and running casing. All
other dimensions and thread radii are the same as those for
13 3 / 8  in. and smaller sizes.
The application of proper thread compound and a suitable
thread coating are essential for assurance of leak resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

EXTREME-LINE THREAD
(INTEGRAL CONNECTION)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>r<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Extreme-line casing in all sizes uses a modiﬁed Acme-type
thread having a 12° included angle between stab and load
ﬂanks, and all threads have crests and roots ﬂat and parallel to
the pipe axis (Figure 7). For sizes 5 in. through 7 5 / 8  in.,
the threads are of 6 pitch (six threads per inch) on a taper of
1 1 / 2  in. per ft on diameter. For sizes 8 5 / 8  in. through 10 3 / 4  in.,
the threads are of 5 pitch (ﬁve threads per inch) on a taper of
1 1 / 4  in. per ft on diameter. For all sizes, the threads are not
intended to be leak resistant when made up. Threads are used
purely as a mechanical means to hold the joint members
together during axial tension loading. The connection uses
upset pipe ends for pin and box members that are an integral
part of the pipe body. Axial compressive load resistance is
primarily offered by external shouldering of the connection
on makeup.
Box (or internal) member threads make up with the pin
member threads by interference bearing between the box
thread crests and pin thread roots. The pin crests and stab
ﬂanks of all threads have radial clearance ranging from
0.005 in. to 0.009 in. between crest of pin and root of box
threads and 0.005 in. to 0.011 in. between mated stab ﬂanks.
Therefore, the load ﬂanks and pin root to box crests are in
bearing load contact makeup.
Leak resistance is obtained on makeup by interference of
metal-to-metal seal between a long, radius curved seal sur-
face on the pin member engaging a conical metal seal surface
of the box member (Figure 7).
Thread compound is not necessarily a critical agent to
ensure leak resistance but instead is used primarily as an anti-
galling or antiseizure agent.
All threads, including partial depth threads, are functional
in axial tension load resistance. Therefore, discretionary
repairs for minor damage to threads only may be made with-
out adversely affecting leak resistance of the connection. No
hand dressing or repair to seal surfaces is advisable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Visual Thread Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1
VISUAL THREAD INSPECTION (VTI)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Visual thread inspection is a procedure for locating thread
imperfections without the use of magnetic particles or thread
gauges other than a proﬁle gauge. This inspection applies to
exposed round threads on casing and tubing, and exposed
buttress threads on casing. Visually evident manufacturing
defects or mechanical damage to the threads are detected by
this inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note: Extreme-line threads are excluded from these inspection pro-
cedures. For Extreme-line threads refer to API Spec 5B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Internal Threads<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Remove the thread protectors and stack them out of the
way so that they will not be a work hazard. From this step,
until the thread protectors are reinstalled, great care shall be
used to ensure that two lengths of pipe do not strike each
other and damage the unprotected threads. Pipe should never
be loaded, unloaded, or removed to another rack without
thread protectors installed. Never leave threads exposed to
moisture or condensation overnight. Use of light corrosion
inhibitor is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspect for imperfections in the counterbore, PTL, and
threaded area beyond the PTL. Seal-ring grooves shall be
inspected for ﬁns, wickers and ribbons that are loose or can
become loose on each side of the groove. The proﬁle gauge
may be applied to the threads to detect machining errors.
Caution shall be used when applying the proﬁle gauge to
avoid damaging thread coating. If the proﬁle gauge bridges
the ring groove, the metal moved in machining the groove
may give a false indication of thread machining errors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Note: Martensitic Chromium Steels (9 Cr and 13 Cr, Spec 5CT, Group

<<PARAGRAPH>>Note: Internal threads do not have an  L c  area. All of the threads
within the interval from the counterbore to a plane located at a dis-
tance  J  plus one thread turn from the center of the coupling or small
end of Integral Joint, are to be inspected to the  L c  area requirements.
This area is deﬁned as the internal Perfect Thread length (PTL).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5.2
Thread classiﬁcation depends on the location of an
imperfection. Imperfections located in the  L c   area of external
threads or PTL of the internal threads have different criteria
for acceptance and rejection than those outside these regions.

<<PARAGRAPH>>Note: Threads that are not full-crested have historically been and
continue to be referred to as “black-crested threads” because the

Minor pitting and thread discoloration may also be
encountered and may not necessarily be detrimental. Because
of the difﬁculty in deﬁning pitting and discoloration and the
degree to which they affect thread performance, no blanket

GENERAL<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gauges used for the inspection of tubular goods are deli-
cate and subject to damage, if mishandled. Extreme care and
cleanliness must be observed in the storing, handling, verify-
ing, and using of thread element gauges.
Two types of gauges are used for thread inspection: dial
indicator gauges and ﬁxed gauges. As the name implies, dial
indicator gauges are provided with a dial indicator (Figure 11),
which when placed on the thread must read within a certain
range if the element is within speciﬁcation. The ﬁxed gauge
(Figure 12) is a rigid gauge which is screwed onto the thread.
The thread is properly machined if the other thread elements
are within speciﬁcation and the ﬁxed gauge standoff is within
speciﬁcations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

triangle cannot be located or is in the wrong position (outside
±  1 / 32  in. from  A 1 ), it shall be cause for rejection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

end of the coupling to the end of the pin inside the coupling.
If the measured distance is different from the nominal dis-
tance by more than + 0.200 in. (+ 0.300 for 13 3 / 8  and
smaller), or – 0.375 in.,  the condition should be reported to

USE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thread shall be clean when the gauge is being applied.
The temperature of the gauge shall be as close as practical to
the temperature of the product being inspected for accurate

inspected. Don’t let the gauge remain on the product while
the gauge is unattended. Return the gauge temporarily to the
case and cover with a cloth if work must be performed
between inspection operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Calibration and Veriﬁcation of
Dial Indicators and Fixed Gauges<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All gauges should be stored in a ﬁtted box equipped with a
dry desiccant bag (Figure 13). The gauge surfaces should be
lightly oiled with engine oil prior to storage. In some mills
gauges are retained in glass cases located in air conditioned
rooms. Storage of gauges used in ﬁeld inspection require box-
ing. Do not remove the gauge from the box until immediately
before verifying (dial gauge) and/or using (ﬁxed gauges).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1
CALIBRATION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Calibration is the process of determining if a dial indicator,
ring gauge, or plug gauge operates accurately. This process
includes determining the accuracy of dial indicators over the
entire range of plunger travel. In case of ring and plug gauges,
calibration permits determining whether the standoff between
the working gauge and the master gauge has not changed or if
a change has occurred, the amount of change is known.
Calibration normally is not performed in the ﬁeld or at the
inspection table since the measuring equipment is precise and
subject to deterioration outside of a laboratory environment.
Accordingly, details can be found in API Spec 5B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3
HANDLING<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gauges shall be handled in as clean an environment as
practicable. Prior to and after use, the gauge should be wiped
clean with a soft clean cloth. Foreign matter entering the
working mechanism or abrading the gauge surfaces will<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Veriﬁcation is the process of determining if the dial indica-

gauge should be determined at the beginning of each inspec-
tion, the ﬁrst time an out-of-speciﬁcation thread is found or
after 25 pieces have been inspected, whichever occurs ﬁrst.
However, if the gauge has been dropped or hit, the gauge
should be immediately reveriﬁed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Thread Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1
INTRODUCTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of threaded connections provides a means of
quality assurance at the manufacturer’s facility and ﬁeld loca-
tions. Each type of thread is inspected by similar procedures,
but the dimensions vary. This section discusses the use of each
gauge for measuring the accuracy of the thread elements.
Correct thread element limits and/or tolerances are pub-
lished in the latest edition of API Spec 5B. All dimensions
necessary for proper gauging of API threads are contained in
this publication.
API threads are gauged from the end of the pipe or the face
of the coupling except for internal taper which can be mea-
sured from  J  + 1p position out toward the face. The vanish
point is the last visible evidence of the continuous machined
thread root as it stops on round or line pipe threads or runs out
on buttress thread. For round or line pipe threads the length
from the end of the pipe to the vanish point is known as the  L 4
dimension (Figure 15).
Inspection of the threaded connection consists of verifying
the dimensions of the following thread elements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2
INSPECTION PROCEDURE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pipe shall be prepared for inspection by removing the
thread protector and cleaning the threads of lubricant, dirt,
scale, and other foreign material with a brush and/or solvent.
It is recommended that a longitudinal line be drawn on the
pin end threads using a felt tipped pen, crayon or a soft pencil.
This line should pass through the last tool mark to facilitate
thread length measurements (Figure 16). Mark inspection
intervals of 1-in. length along the longitudinal line starting
with the ﬁrst perfect thread (pin end). The last inspection inter-
val shall coincide with the last perfect thread, or an overlap-
ping interval shall be provided. An overlapping interval is
provided by starting at the last perfect thread and marking
toward end of the pin until the new interval overlaps the previ-
ously marked interval (Figure 16). For the gauging of external
or internal threads, measurements shall be made at the ﬁrst<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

A similar longitudinal line should be drawn on the threads
of the box or coupling to be inspected. Mark inspection inter-
vals of 1-in. length along the longitudinal line starting with
the ﬁrst perfect thread at the open end of the box or coupling.
Marks should be placed at (a) ﬁve threads from the center of
the casing and tubing coupling (8-round thread); (b) six
threads for 10-round thread tubing; (c) the last perfect thread
from the coupling center (Vee thread); or (d) the perfect

Tables 3 through 6 (Figure 17).
The coupling length,  N L , is a minimum length (Tables 3
through 6). This measurement is performed by placing the
steel rule or caliper longitudinally along the outside surface of
the coupling.
The inside of the coupling should have a recess at each end.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

with contact points having an included angle of 50° (Table 7).
Accordingly, care must be taken to apply the correct contact
points to the gauge. The recommended contact point radius for

Balanced-Dial Type<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Balanced-dial type gauges establish the difference (error)
between the setting standard notch depth and the thread
height being inspected. The balanced-dial type gauge can be
recognized by the equal “plus” and “minus” divisions on each
side of zero on the dial indicator (Figure 18). The accuracy of
the gauge is veriﬁed by placing the gauge on the setting stan-
dard (Figure 20) with the contact point within the U-notch
and contacting the bottom of the notch (Figure 21). The dial
indicator should register zero. If not, the thumb screw should
be loosened and the dial revolved until the indicator reads
zero. The gauge should be rechecked on the setting standard
after the dial thumb screw is tightened. Additionally, the
round thread contact point wear should be veriﬁed by apply-
ing the gauge to the Vee block (Figures 20 and 22). The dial
indicator shall read within ± 0.0005 in. of zero, or the contact
point shall be replaced and the gauge reveriﬁed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.3
Lead<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lead is the distance from a point on a thread to the corre-
sponding point on the next thread turn measured parallel to the
thread axis. The distance is small. Thus, the required accuracy
would be excessive if lead was determined from thread to
thread. Accordingly, lead is usually measured at 1-in. intervals.
Cumulative lead is measured over the  L 4 – g  crested threads
from the end of the pipe. Only perfect (full-crested) threads
shall be included in the cumulative lead measurement. The
thread should be provided with a longitudinal line divided into
1-in. ( 1 / 2 -in.) intervals as discussed in Inspection Procedure
(8.2 and Figure 16). For the gauging of external or internal
threads, lead measurements shall be made starting at the ﬁrst or
last perfect thread and continued from either 1-in. intervals for
products having a distance between the ﬁrst and last perfect
threads of more than 1 in.;  1 / 2 -in. intervals for products having
a distance between the ﬁrst and last perfect threads of  1 / 2  in. to
1 in.; and intervals consisting of 4 threads for products having
11 1 / 2  threads per inch. The gauging of cumulative lead on
external or internal threads shall be measured over an interval
(between the ﬁrst and last perfect threads), which has a length
equal to the largest multiple of  1 / 2  in. for an even number of
threads per inch, or 1 in. for an odd number of threads per inch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.2.2
Applying the Gauge to the Product<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accuracy of the determination of thread height depends
on the anvil resting on top of full-crested threads. The ﬁrst few
threads are slightly truncated (Figure 15) by the pipe end
bevel. The amount of truncation depends on the pipe and the
bevel diameters and the degree of bevel. Care must be taken to
make thread height measurements at a point no closer to the
pipe end than a location that has full-crested threads on both
sides of the thread root for the anvil to rest upon.
The last perfect thread location on external threads shall be
L 4 – g  for tubing and last scratch (Last Thread Groove), – 0.500
in. for casing round threads. For casing, the distance from the
end of the pipe to the Last Perfect Thread is called the Thread
Element Control Length, or TECL. The last perfect thread
location on internal threads is  J  + 1p, measured from the phys-
ical center of the coupling or from the small end of the box for
integral joint tubing.
Place the tip of the thread height gauge (Figure 24) in the
thread groove and anvil of the gauge resting on top of full-
crested threads. The anvil shall be held in ﬁrm contact with
the thread crests. The gauge shall be aligned with the axis of
threads by rocking the gauge about the longitudinal axis of
the anvil (Figure 24). The thread height is indicated correctly
when the dial indicator stops moving near the center of the
rocking motion, the null point.
The dial indicator reads the actual thread height (Table 8)
at the null point if a continuous-dial type gauge is used
(Figure 24), or the dial indicator reads the error in the thread
height at the null point if a balanced-dial type gauge is used
(Figure 25). The maximum permissible thread height error is
+ 0.002 inch to – 0.004 inch.
Veriﬁcation of thread height should be performed at the
ﬁrst and last full-crested threads within the perfect threads
and at intervals as speciﬁed in Section 8.2 (Figure 16). For
inspection purposes, the coupling full-crested threads extend
from the ﬁrst perfect thread to the  J  + 1p thread length (ﬁfth<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.3.1
Gauges<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Several types of gauges are available (Figure 26).
The accuracy of a gauge shall be veriﬁed by applying the
gauge to the lead setting standard (Figure 27).
Prior to adjusting the lead gauge, the contact point diame-
ter shall be checked with a micrometer. The recommended
contact point dimensions for 8- and 10-round threads are
listed in Table 9. Points having more than ± 0.002-in. toler-
ance shall be replaced.
Two contact points are provided—a ﬁxed point and a mov-
able point (Figure 26).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.3.2
Adjusting the Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lead gauge shall register zero when applied to the set-
ting standard (Figure 27). Adjustment is necessary if the
gauge does not register zero. The gauge should be removed
from the standard and reapplied to the standard to conﬁrm
correctness of the adjustment. The setting standard is pro-
vided with intervals of  1 / 2  inch up to a maximum of 4 inches.
This permits the inspection of cumulative lead error.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Taper<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gauge is used in the same fashion for inspecting exter-
nal and internal threads. The gauge shall be properly adjusted
prior to applying the gauge to the product. The length of the
threads from the ﬁrst perfect thread through the last perfect
thread shall be inspected.
The ﬁrst perfect thread location is the thread nearest the
chamfer on the pin or face of the coupling with a root having
a full crest on both sides.
The last perfect thread location on external threads shall be
L 4 – g  for tubing and line pipe,  L 7  for buttress, and last scratch
(last thread groove) – 0.500 in. for casing round threads. For
casing, the distance from the end of the pipe to the Last Per-
fect Thread is called the Thread Element Control Length, or
TECL. The last perfect thread location on internal thread is  J
+ 1p, measured from the physical center of the coupling or
from the small end of the box for integral joint tubing.
The ﬁxed gauge point is placed on the line in the ﬁrst full
thread groove near the small diameter of the thread
(Figure 16). With the movable point (Figure 27) in the thread
groove (Figure 26), the gauge should be pivoted in a small arc
about the ﬁxed point on either side of the longitudinal line.
The maximum deviation from zero in either the fast (+) or
slow (–) direction represents the error in lead.
For inspection purposes, the coupling full-crested thread
length extends from the ﬁrst perfect thread (third thread root
from end of recess) to the  J  + 1 thread length (ﬁfth thread and
sixth thread from coupling center for 8-round and 10-round,
respectively) [Tables 3 through 6].
The lead tolerance is ± 0.003 in. per inch (± 0.0015 in. per
1 / 2  inch).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Taper is the change in the pitch diameter of the thread
expressed as inches per foot or inches per inch of thread
length. The taper caliper (Figure 28) should not be capable of
measuring a thread for a pipe more than three times the size
being inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Taper Calipers With Dial Indicators<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following types of calipers are available for inspecting

<<PARAGRAPH>>a. External—thread taper caliper (Figure 28).
b. Internal—thread taper calipers (Figure 29 and 30).
These calipers always are provided with a continuous-dial
type indicator. The gauge contact points shall be ﬁtted with
contact points of diameter as listed in Table 10. These contact
points are ball-type. The point diameter should be checked
with a micrometer. The point shall be discarded if there is
more than 0.002-in. wear. Two contact points are provided—
a ﬁxed point and a movable point (Figure 28).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The last perfect thread location on external threads
shall be  L 4 – g  for tubing and last scratch (Last Thread
Groove) – 0.500 in. for casing round threads. For casing, the
distance from the end of the pipe to the Last Perfect Thread
is called the Thread Element Control Length, or TECL. The
movable contact point (Figure 28) should be placed in the
same groove diametrically opposite the ﬁxed contact point.
The ﬁxed point should be held ﬁrmly within the thread
groove while the movable point is oscillated through an arc
within the groove. The dial pointer should indicate zero at
the maximum reading. The dial pointer indicator should be
adjusted if the reading is not zero. This adjustment is made
by loosening the thumb screw and rotating the dial until a
zero reading is indicated. Tighten thumb screw and recheck
the dial for a zero reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The external taper caliper (Figure 28) is provided with an
arm adjustable to the appropriate pipe OD. Depending on the
caliper type, the internal taper caliper is adjusted to ﬁt the
coupling by installing extensions on the indicator plunger
shaft (Figure 29) or by sliding the arm to the corresponding
pipe OD size (Figure 30).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

dure (Section 8.2 and Figure 16). The caliper is adjusted
(zeroed) by placing the ﬁxed contact point (Figure 28) on the
longitudinal line in the groove past the full-crested thread.
The ﬁrst perfect thread location is the thread nearest the

Applying the Caliper<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The external taper caliper is applied in the same fashion as
during adjustment. The caliper is applied at 1-inch intervals
from the small toward the large diameter of the thread.
The taper is designated in API Spec 5B as  3 / 4 -in. taper per
ft of thread length (Figure 4). However, for inspection pur-
poses this taper, including the appropriate tolerance, is
rounded to the equivalent of 0.060 to 0.068 in. per in. The use
of a  1 / 2 -in. gauge length results in dividing tolerances by two,
or 0.030 to 0.034 in. per inch.
Taper is measured over the perfect thread length for tubing
and the TECL length for round thread casing. If the last inter-
val of measurement is less than 1 in., the gauge should be
placed in the last (large end of the thread) full thread groove
on the longitudinal line and the measurement made toward
the end of the pipe. One 1-in. reading will provide overlap if
the last interval overlaps the one interval previously
inspected. The same tolerances apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Adjusting the Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gauge is adjusted on the coupling. The coupling
threads should be provided with a longitudinal line divided
into 1-in. intervals as discussed in Section 8.2 (see also Figure
16). For inspection purposes, the coupling full-crested thread
length extends from the ﬁrst perfect thread (perfect crest on
either side of the roots) to the  J  + 1 thread length (ﬁfth thread
and sixth thread from coupling center for 8-round and 10-
round, respectively) (Figure 15).
Several types of internal calipers are provided (Figures 29
and 30). The  large internal taper caliper  for couplings 4 1 / 2 -in.
OD and larger is adjusted by installing ﬁxed gauge extensions
(Figure 29) of sufﬁcient length to bring the dial indicator
approximately to the center of dial travel.
The large internal taper gauge should be inserted into the
coupling so the movable contact point (short end) is at the top

<<PARAGRAPH>>The  small internal taper gauge  (Figure 30) is adjusted and
used in the same fashion as the large internal taper gauge
except that the dial indicator is placed on an extension arm
permitting the contact pins to reach into the small diameter
coupling. The taper may be checked directly by comparing the
difference between two adjacent 1-in. readings to the tolerance
above. The tolerance is reduced to 0.030 in. to 0.034 in. per
inch for adjacent  1 / 2  in. readings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of the coupling and the ﬁxed contact point (large end) is at the
bottom of the coupling (Figure 31). The gauge is adjusted by
placing the ﬁxed contact on the longitudinal line in a thread
groove ﬁve threads from the center of the coupling for 8-
round and six threads for 10-round threads, The movable
point shall be placed in the same groove 180° opposite from
the ﬁxed point. The dial indicator should be at zero at the null
point as the movable point is moved through a small trans-
verse arch. If not, the thumb screw shall be loosened and the
dial face rotated until the indicator reads zero. Tighten the
thumb screw and recheck the dial for a zero reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.5
Standoff<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Standoff is the distance measured axially between the end
of the pipe or coupling and the standoff position of the ring or
plug gauge (Figures 32 and 33). There are two levels of ring
and plug gauges:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3.4.3.2

<<PARAGRAPH>>The taper is measured by taking successive readings at 1-in.

difference is the taper in in. per in. The permissible tolerance is
0.060 in. per inch to 0.068 in. per inch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

inspected.
b. Certiﬁed master gauges, which are used to verify the accu-

Normally, inspection is made using a working gauge
unless a dispute arises, at which time the certiﬁed master
gauge may be used to resolve the dispute.
Ring and plug gauges for 8-round threads are made in both
short- and long-thread conﬁgurations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

External Threads—Ring Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ring gauge is used by screwing the ring gauge hand-
tight onto the pin to be inspected. A short casing thread gauge
may be used to inspect a long thread pin. However, the pin
will extend beyond the gauge point. Thus, tolerance must be
measured from this new gauge point.
The tolerance is ± 1 thread (± 1 1 / 2  thread on 10-round) on
either side of the reference point. Accurate inspection may be
affected by plating on the threads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Some ring gauges are ﬂush-type where the end of the pipe
is ﬂush with the end of the gauge when the thread size is at
zero tolerance (Figure 32). Other ring gauges are ﬁtted with
step plates extending beyond the gauge proper. The zero tol-
erance is equivalent to the end of the pipe being ﬂush with the
middle step (Figure 34). The ﬁrst step on either side of the
middle step represents the tolerance. Old-style ring gauges
were provided with a template. The template was marked
with zero and the plus and minus tolerances (Figure 35).
The use of a short-casing thread ring gauge on a long thread
requires determination of the distance the pin extends beyond
the gauge end. Flush gauges and template-type gauges require
the use of a steel scale, calipers, or templates on which the
extensions and ± tolerances are marked. Step gauges are pro-
vided with two sets of tolerance steps, one for long thread
inspection and another for short thread inspection.
The distance the long pin extends beyond the short ring
gauge is determined from Formula 8.3.5.1:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The plug gauge for small sizes (5 in. and less) normally is
held in a jig (holding device) so the coupling can be screwed
onto the gauge hand-tight. However, for large sizes, the cou-
pling normally is held in a jig and the gauge screwed into the
coupling. Accurate gauging can only be performed prior to
thread coating. Also, accurate gauging of a coupling which
has been installed power-tight on a pin is not possible. This is
true even if the coupling has been removed from the pin.
When a seal-ring groove has been cut in a coupling, accu-
rate gauging may not be possible because of interference
from the yielded featheredge fade-out where the threads enter
and leave the seal-ring groove. Plug gauge readings can be
taken before cutting the seal ring or after removing the
yielded featheredge fade-out. The method used to remove the
featheredge fade-out shall not damage the remaining threads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Plug gauges are made in three styles: insert, standoff lines,
and template. The insert style gauge is provided with an insert
containing three scribe lines. The middle represents the basic
size. The ±1 thread pitch (± 1 1 / 2  for 10-round threads) is indi-
cated from the middle line by lines ahead and behind the
basic line (Figure 33). The standoff lines style of plug gauge
is provided with three lines representing the tolerance and the
basic size and a fourth line representing the vanish point
(Figure 37). The orientation of the lines is the same as for the
insert-style. The template style plug gauge has no lines.
Instead, the tolerance is measured from the back shoulder of
the plug to the end of the coupling (Figure 38) using a tem-
plate, scale or caliper.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

LINE PIPE THREAD INSPECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API line pipe threads vary in pitch from 8 to 27 threads per
inch (Table 12).
Line pipe thread diameters vary from  1 / 8 -in. nominal diame-
ter to 20-in. OD (Table 12). Threads cut on pipe less than 1-in.
nominal diameter are not gauged for thread height, lead or
taper. Instead, these small diameter pipe threads are checked
for standoff only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.1
Total Thread Length<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Total thread length, the  L 4  dimension (Table 12) is mea-
sured parallel to the pipe axis from the end of pipe to the van-
ish point of the thread (Figure 15).
The measurement shall be made using a metal scale ( 1 / 32 -in.
minimum dimension) (Figure 17). The total thread length is
acceptable if  L 4  is within ±1 pitch (Table 12).
L 4  is acceptable if the distance from the end of the pipe to
the vanish plane (at the point where the outside diameter of
the pipe is a maximum) is within the minus tolerances as
expressed in Table 12; or, if the distance from the end of the
pipe to the vanish plane (where the outside diameter of the
pipe is a minimum) is within the plus tolerances of Table 12.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.2
Thread Height<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thread height is the measurement of the distance from the
thread root to the thread crest normal to the thread axis
(Figure 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). All line pipe threads are Vee threads.
Two types of thread height gauges are used for line pipe
threads: (a) external/internal gauges for threads 3 1 / 2 -in. OD
and larger (Figure 18), and (b) internal gauges for threads 3-in.
OD and smaller (Figure 19).
All line pipe thread height gauges are equipped with con-
tact points having an included angle of 50° (Table 7). Two
types of dial indicators are provided on the thread height
gauge: (a) balanced-dial type (Figure 18), and (b) continuous-
reading type (Figure 19). Refer to 8.3.2.1 for details on the
two types of dial indicators and their adjustments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 38—Template Style Plug Gauge<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The measured thread height for 1-in. nominal pipe diame-
ter and larger pipe threads are compared with the theoretical
values (Table 8).
Applying the height gauge to a line pipe thread is performed
in the same manner as for the round thread form. Also, the ﬁrst
perfect thread is located in a manner similar to that for the
round thread (perfect crests on either side of the thread root).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The 4-thread interval applies to threads on pipes 1-, 1 1 / 4- ,
1 1 / 2 -, and 2-nominal diameter (Table 12).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The length to the last perfect thread (Figure 15) is estab-
lished by  L 4 – g .
For inspection purposes, the coupling full-crested thread
length extends from the ﬁrst perfect thread (perfect crests on
either side of the thread root) to the  J  + 1 thread from the cou-
pling center.
The maximum permissible thread height error is + 0.002 in.,
– 0.006 in. from the nominal reading (Table 8). Veriﬁcation of
thread height should be performed at the ﬁrst and last full-
crested thread and within the perfect thread length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.3.1
Gauges<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gauge for measuring lead tolerance is equipped with
two contact points and a balanced dial-type indicator. Exam-
ples of lead gauges are shown in Figure 26.
The accuracy of lead gauges is veriﬁed by applying the
gauge to the lead-setting standard (Figure 27). Prior to adjust-
ing the lead gauge, the contact point size should be checked
with a micrometer. The contact point dimensions for line pipe
threads shall be within ± 0.002 in. of the API recommended
size (Table 9).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.3
Lead<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lead is the distance from a speciﬁc point on a thread to the
corresponding point on the next thread measured parallel to
the thread axis.
The distance is small. Thus, the required accuracy would
be excessive if lead were determined from thread-to-thread.
Accordingly, lead is measured at 1-in. intervals,  1 / 2 -in. inter-
vals or at 4-thread intervals depending on the thread length.
The 1-in. interval applies to line pipe greater than 6-in. nom-
inal diameter. The  1 / 2 -in. interval applies to 2 1 / 2 -in. through
6-in. nominal diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.3.2
Adjusting the Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lead gauge should register zero when applied to the
setting standard (Figure 27). It must be noted the normal lead-
setting standard (Figure 27) cannot be used for line pipe with
11 1 / 2  threads per inch.
Accordingly, a special 4-thread, lead-setting standard shall
be used. Adjustment is necessary if the gauge does not regis-
ter zero. Adjustment is performed as described in 8.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The gauge is used in the same manner as for round threads.
Line pipe threads are inspected over the entire length of per-
fect threads (Refer to 8.4.2).
The error in the lead shall be reported in inches of error per
inch of thread. The reading is direct for 1-in. intervals. The 1-in.
tolerance is divided by two for  1 / 2 -in. intervals and 2.875, for 4-
thread intervals. The 1-in. lead tolerance is ± 0.003 in. per inch
Thus, the observed tolerance is ± 0.0015 in. for  1 / 2 -in. intervals
and ± 0.001 in. for 4-thread intervals.
In addition to the per-inch inspection, the thread should be
inspected for cumulative lead.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Taper calipers are adjusted on the pipe thread. Refer to
8.3.4 for details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.4.2.2
Applying the Caliper<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The taper caliper is applied to line pipe as it is to casing

to 8.4.2 for ﬁrst and last perfect thread locations. The toler-
ance for taper is the same as for round threads: 0.060 to 0.068
in. per inch.
This tolerance applies directly when a 1-in. gauge length is
used (Table 12). The tolerance is divided by two for  1 / 2 -gauge
length. For 11 1 / 2  thread pipe the tolerance is 0.021 to 0.023
in. per inch.
The perfect thread length shall be inspected. Thus, the
same overlapping procedure should be followed for line pipe
as described for round thread.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Cumulative Lead<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cumulative lead is measured over the  L 4  length from the

lead on external or internal threads shall be measured over an
interval (between the ﬁrst and last perfect threads) which has
a length equal to the largest multiple of  1 / 2  in. for an 8-pitch

Adjusting the Caliper<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The caliper is adjusted on the coupling as described in
8.3.4. Coupling full-crested thread length extends from the
ﬁrst perfect thread (full-crested threads on either side of the
root) to the  J  + 1 thread length from the coupling center.
(Table 12). The perfect thread length shall be inspected for
taper. The same tolerances apply to the coupling as apply to
the pin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.4
Taper<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Taper is the change in pitch diameter of the thread
expressed as inches per foot or inches per inch of thread
length. A taper caliper (Figure 28) should not be capable of
measuring a thread for a pipe more than three times the size
being inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Taper Calipers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The diametral size of line pipe threads can be measured
with ring and plug gauges (Figures 32 and 33). There are two
levels of ring and plug gauges. These levels are the same dis-
cussed in 8.3.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various types of calipers are available for inspecting thread
taper:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. External—thread taper caliper (Figure 28).
b. Large internal—thread taper caliper (Figure 29).
c. Small internal—thread taper caliper (Figure 30).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.5.1
External Thread—Ring Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ring gauge is used by screwing the gauge hand-tight
onto the pin to be inspected and observing the number of
threads between the end of the pin and the reference point of
the ring gauge. The standoff tolerance is ± 1 thread pitch on
either side of the reference point (end of gauge, step or tem-
plate mark). Refer to 8.3.5 for details on the types of ring
gauges available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These calipers are provided with a continuous-dial type
indicator. The recommended caliper contact points must ﬁt
the thread being inspected. Line pipe taper caliper contact
points range from 0.072 inch to 0.050 inch (Table 10). The
contact points are ball-type. The contact diameters should be
checked with a micrometer prior to starting an inspection.
The tolerance for the contact points is ± 0.002 inch. Two con-
tact points are provided: a ﬁxed point and a movable point
(Figure 28).
The taper caliper (Figure 28) is provided with an adjustable
arm. The large internal taper caliper is adjusted to ﬁt the cou-
pling by installing extensions (Figure 29). The small internal
taper caliper is adjusted to the coupling size by sliding the
adjustable arm to the corresponding pipe OD size (Figure 30).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.5.2
Internal Threads—Plug Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The plug gauge is used by screwing the gauge hand-tight
into the coupling to be inspected. The coupling should not be
made-up on a pin since the resulting stresses will deform the
coupling. The number of threads between the reference point
of a gauge and the face of the coupling should be observed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The coupling length,  N L  (Table 13), is the minimum per-
missible length. The measured length of the coupling must
equal or exceed the  N L  value (Table 13).

The step provides correct positioning of the contact within the
thread to assure a correct reading.
This same step causes the standard to be unidirectional.
Accordingly, care shall be exercised when using a stepped
standard to position the gauge on the product in the same
direction as on the setting standard.
The balanced-dial type indicator should read zero when
placed in the U-groove setting standard (Figure 20).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.2
Thread Height<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thread height is the measurement of the distance from the
thread root to the crest normal to the thread axis (Figures 5
and 6). The following two styles of thread height gauges are
used for inspection:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. Straight-anvil-type external/internal height gauge (Figure 18)
used for buttress pin and coupling threads 13 3 / 8 -in. OD and
smaller.
b. Step-anvil-type external/internal height gauge (Figure 40)
used for buttress pin and coupling threads of 16-in., 18 5 / 8 -in.,
and 20-in. diameter.
A balanced-dial (Figure 18) gauge shall be used.
Thread height gauges for buttress threads can use a cone
point or a ball-type, provided the contact point does not con-
tact the thread ﬂanks and does not exceed 0.092 in diameter.
The cone point shall have a maximum angle of 50°.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.2.2
Applying the Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Applying the gauge to the product is performed by placing
the contact point of the thread height gauge (Figure 25) in the
thread groove. The anvil must be held in ﬁrm contact with the
thread crest. The gauge shall be aligned with the axis of the
pipe. This is best accomplished by rocking the gauge about
the longitudinal axis of the anvil (Figure 25). The thread
height is correct when the dial indicator stops moving near
the center of the rocking motion, the null point.
Veriﬁcation of buttress thread depth shall be performed at
the ﬁrst perfect thread (full-crested threads on either side of
the root) and at 1-in. intervals along the pin until the ﬁrst
black-crested thread is encountered within the  L 7  length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.2.1
Adjusting the Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accuracy of each type of gauge is veriﬁed by use of set-
ting standards. The setting standard for the height gauge used
on 13 3 / 8 -in. OD and smaller buttress threads is similar to the
standard for round and line pipe threads (Figure 20). A step-
type setting standard is used for the height gauge associated<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Cumulative Lead Measurement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Do not inspect black-crested threads because they are not
full-crested threads and will not support the anvil properly.
Any perfect thread interval which cannot be inspected,
because less than 1 in. remains between the last perfect thread
and the last 1-in. interval inspected, shall be inspected by start-
ing at the last perfect thread and gauging the thread at 1-in.
intervals toward the end of the pin. This provides one overlap-
ping interval to assure complete coverage.
The coupling thread height inspection commences at  J  + 1
thread from the center of the coupling and progresses at 1-in.
intervals to the ﬁrst perfect thread (ﬁrst root from the open
end of coupling having full-crested threads on both sides).
Again, an overlapping 1-in. interval near the coupling face
may be necessary to provide complete gauging coverage of
the coupling threads. The tolerance for coupling thread height
(Table 6) is ± 0.001 inch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cumulative lead is the lead measured starting with the ﬁrst
perfect thread over an interval which is the largest multiple of
1 inch (Table 13). The gauge is applied to the product as dis-
cussed above for the per-inch measurement, except the cumu-
lative lead length may include partial threads as long as the
gauge contact point is in contact with the thread root and the
ﬂank of the partial thread, provided that the partial thread has
at least half of the nominal height. The cumulative lead toler-
ance is ± 0.004 in.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.3.3.3
Lead Measurements in Couplings With
Seal Rings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a seal-ring groove is present in a coupling, lead mea-
surements shall be taken with the ﬁxed contact point of the
gauge simultaneously touching the root and the 3° ﬂank of a
full-crested thread form. The partial threads adjacent to the
groove shall be avoided when measuring any thread element.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.3
Lead<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lead is the distance from a speciﬁc point on a thread to the
corresponding point on the next thread measured parallel to
the thread axis. The distance is small. Accordingly, the
required accuracy would be excessive if lead were deter-
mined from thread to thread. Thus, lead is determined at 1-in.
intervals and over the perfect thread length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.4
Taper<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Taper is deﬁned as the change in diameter along the minor
cone of the external threads and the major cone of the internal
threads. On all threads, taper tolerances are expressed in
terms of “inches-per-inch of thread” and taper deviation shall
be determined accordingly. The measurements are made for
the speciﬁc interval lengths and the observed deviation shall
be calculated to the inches-per-inch basis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.3.1
Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lead gauge used for buttress thread inspection is the
same as used for larger round threads. (Figures 26 and 27).
The recommended contact points are 0.062 in. in diameter
(Table 9). Points varying more than ± 0.002-in. tolerance
shall be replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.4.1
Caliper<<HEADING_END>>

thread taper:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Adjusting the Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a. External—thread taper caliper (Figure 28).
b. Internal—thread taper caliper (Figure 29).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gauge should register zero when applied to the setting
standard (Figure 27). The adjustment to establish the zero
reading is the same as outlined in 8.3. Pressure shall be
applied against the gauge so the thread contact points are in
contact with the load ﬂank (3° ﬂank) and thread root simulta-
neously (Figures 5, 6, and 27).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These have continuous-dial type indicator gauges.
The recommended contact points for taper calipers are 0.090
in. in diameter (Table 18) and of the ball-type. The points
should be checked with a micrometer. The points shall be
replaced if the diameter exceeds the tolerance of ± 0.002 inch.

outlined in 8.3, except that the contact points should simulta-
neously touch the root and the 3° ﬂank of the threads
(Figure 26). Lead is inspected over the perfect thread length
as discussed in the buttress thread height section 8.5.2.
The tolerance is ± 0.002 in. for buttress threads of 13 3 / 8  OD
and smaller, and ± 0.003 in. for buttress threads of 16 OD
and larger.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The taper caliper is applied to the product in the same fash-
ion as during adjustment. The round thread inspection proce-
dure is followed. The interval thread inspection starts at the
ﬁrst perfect thread (ﬁrst root from the open end of coupling
having full-crested threads on both sides) and proceeds to the
J  + 1 thread pitch from the coupling center.
Only perfect thread tapers and tolerances are determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.5
Thread Runout<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thread runout is the measurement of the abruptness with
which the buttress thread is terminated at the triangle end of
the thread. A rapid pullout of the cutting toll results in steep
slope at the end of the thread. This causes high stress at the
contact point when the coupling is made-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 41—Buttress Thread Runout Gauge<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.5.1
Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the thread terminates before the apex of the triangle
(Table 13), the movable pointer is placed in the last thread
groove 90° prior to the thread termination and the gauge tra-
versed clockwise until the pointer exits the thread groove and
rides on the pipe surface.
If the thread terminates at or beyond the apex, place the
movable pointer in the thread groove 90° prior to the apex
and traverse the gauge clockwise until the pointer passes the
triangle apex.
The runout is satisfactory if the dial indicator does not
exceed + 0.005 in. during the traverse of the thread groove. A
dial indicator reading in excess of + 0.005 in. is not accept-
able. Readings + 0.005 in. and less, and all negative readings
are acceptable.
A runout measurement of the coupling is not required
since the thread is continuous as it exits the coupling.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The runout gauge is a three-point gauge having two ﬁxed
points and one movable point attached to a balanced-dial
indicator (Figure 41).
The runout gauge (see Figure 41) shall be used to check the
runout thread root and ensure that the external thread is sufﬁ-
ciently long and is a true runout thread. The runout gauge indi-
cator shall be set to zero using a ﬂat surface as a setting
standard for size 13 3 / 8  and smaller. For size 16 and larger cas-
ing, the runout gauge indicator shall be set to zero using the
perfect thread roots as a setting standard. These perfect thread
roots shall be checked for acceptable taper prior to setting the
runout gauge. If the indicator does not read zero, the dial is
adjusted by unscrewing the thumb screw (Figure 41), turning
dial to zero and tightening the thumb screw. The gauge zero
should be veriﬁed after tightening the thumb screw.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

pipe end), and (b) at or beyond the apex of the triangle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Standoff is the distance measured axially from the end of

<<PARAGRAPH>>end. Similarly, the long face step must either contact the end of
the coupling and the end of the gauge or there shall be a space
between the step and the end of the plug (Figure 38).
Both conditions must be satisﬁed for the coupling to be
acceptable. Accurate gauging can only be performed prior to
thread coating. Also, accurate gauging of a coupling that has
been installed power-tight on a pin is not possible. This is true
even if the coupling had been removed from the pin.
When the seal-ring groove has been cut in a coupling,
accurate gauging may not be possible on some couplings
because of interference from the yielded featheredge fade-out
where the threads enter and leave the seal-ring groove. Plug
gauge readings may be made either before cutting the seal
ring or after removing the yielded featheredge fade-out. The
method used to remove the featheredge fade-out shall not
damage the remaining threads.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The ring gauge is used by screwing the ring gauge hand-
tight onto the pin to be inspected. The reference point of a
buttress ring gauge is the bottom of the notch or the end of the
gauge (Figure 42). The thread is acceptable if the end of the
pipe is ﬂush with the end of the gauge or visible within
the notch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

EXTREME-LINE THREAD INSPECTION<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.6.1
Thread Length<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The various lengths associated with extreme-line threads
can be inspected using a scale (0.01-in. markings) or tem-
plates. Either method is satisfactory. Inspection is facilitated
using the templates since the various lengths and tolerances
are inscribed on the templates (Figure 43). However, the tem-
plates shall be veriﬁed for accuracy using a toolmaker’s
microscope or other laboratory technique.
Two templates are required for the range of extreme-line
pipe sizes: (a) 5-in. through 7 5 / 8 -in. OD, and (b) 8 5 / 8 -in.
through 10 3 / 4 -in. OD.
Four lengths shall be measured separately on the pin and
box threads (Figures 44 and 45 and Table 15). The scale or
template is aligned parallel with the thread axis. The dimen-
sions are read directly from the scale or template (Figures 46
and 47). The length to the tangent point is measured in a sim-
ilar fashion after the tangent point is established using the

Internal Threads—Plug Gauges<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some buttress plug gauges are of the template-type
(Figure 38). Two faces are provided on the template represent-
ing a Go-No-Go gauge. Both faces must be used during the
inspection. Other buttress plug gauges use steel scales or other
suitable measuring devices to determine proper standoff.
The plug of 7 5 / 8  and smaller OD pipe normally is held in a
jig so the coupling may be screwed hand-tight onto the plug
gauge. Plug gauges for couplings larger than 7 5 / 8  OD should
be provided with a means of support so the gauge can be
screwed into the coupling. A counterweight device works
well. The coupling shall be held ﬁrmly while installing the
gauge since the weight of the gauge will cause the coupling to
turn. When the gauge is in place, the template—one face at a
time—is placed on the end of the coupling. The short face step
shall either contact the end of the coupling and the end of the
plug, or there shall be a space between the step and the gauge<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Applying the Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.6.2
Thread Height<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The balanced-dial type gauge establishes the difference
between the setting-standard depth and the thread height
being inspected. The same procedures of alignment and rock-
ing apply as discussed in the round thread section 8.3. The
allowable tolerance is ± 0.001 in. The thread should be
inspected within tapers A and B (Figures 44 and 45).
The continuous-reading dial-type gauge measures the dis-
tance from the line of crests to the thread root. Again, the pre-
cautions of alignment and rocking of the gauge apply. The
permissible error is ± 0.001 in. from the setting-standard
depth (Table 17). The thread should be checked within tapers
A and B (Figures 44 and 45).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thread height is the measurement of the distance from the
thread root to the thread crest normal to the thread axis
(Figure 7). The same type of gauge is used for all sizes of
extreme-line casing (Figure 18).
For 5-in. through 7 5 / 8 -in. OD product, the recommended
contact points are tapered for  1 / 8  in. from 0.062 in. to
0.050 inch. For 8 5 / 8 -in. through 10 3 / 4 -in. product, the recom-
mended contact points are tapered for  1 / 8  in. from 0.079 in. to
0.050 inch (Table 7).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.6.2.1
Adjusting the Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accuracy of the gauge is veriﬁed by using a setting
standard having two plateaus and a 12° included-angle
groove (Table 16 and Figure 48). The balanced-dial type indi-
cator should be adjusted to read zero when the contact point
is seated in the 6° ﬂank groove (Figure 48). The continuous-
dial type indicator should read the thread height marked on
the setting standard when the contact point is seated in the
bottom of the groove (Table 17). No contact-point diameter
measurement is required, since the point does not rely on
ﬂank or Vee contact for accuracy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.6.3
Lead<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lead is the distance from a speciﬁc point on a thread to the
corresponding point on the next thread measured parallel to
the thread axis.
A standard lead gauge (Figure 26) equipped with a ﬂat-
tened bottom ball-type contact having a 0.023-in. diameter
ﬂat (Table 9) is used for inspecting extreme-line pipe.
The adjustment of a lead gauge used for extreme-line
threads is identical with the adjustment for round thread.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

diameter pin-type having ﬂattened contact ends (Table 10).
No dimensional tolerance is necessary for the contact point
since it makes no ﬂank contact.
Two different tapers are included in each extreme-line box
and pin thread (Figures 44 and 45). Accordingly, each taper
shall be located and inspected separately.
The use of the gauges is identical with the procedure dis-
cussed in 8.3.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The internal micrometer (Figure 49) cannot be zeroed.

Gauges<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thread width is inspected using a Go-No-Go gauge
(Figure 51) or thread microscope (Section 9). Two sizes of
Go-No-Go gauges are required: one gauge for 6-thread
products (5 in. through 7 5 / 8  in.) and another for 5-thread
products (8 5 / 8  in. through 10 3 / 4  in.). Inspection need be
made at only one point on the thread, preferably at or near
the intersection of tapers A and B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Invert the gauge. The Go end of the gauge, after bluing, is
inserted into the thread root at the same place as the No-Go
gauge. Contact between the gauge end and the thread root
should occur. Thus, bluing should be transferred to the thread
root. Remove gauge and observe to verify that the bluing was
transferred.
The thread width is satisfactory if both above conditions
are satisﬁed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.6.5.2
Applying the Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External and internal thread widths can be measured using
the same Go-No-Go gauge (Figure 50) or by using the thread
contour microscope. The Go-No-Go gauge is more conve-
nient to use that the microscope. Accordingly, it will be dis-
cussed here. The tips of the Go-No-Go gauge are coated with
Prussian blue so thread root-to-gauge contact can be noted.
The No-Go end of the gauge, after bluing, is inserted into the
full depth thread on the longitudinal inspection line
(Figure 16) near the intersection of tapers A and B (1 15 / 16  in.
from the pin shoulder for 5 in. through 7 5 / 8  in., 2 1 / 8  in. from
the pin shoulder for 8 5 / 8  in. through 10 3 / 4  in.). Contact
between the gauge end and the thread root bottom should not
occur. Thus, no bluing should be transferred to thread root
bottom. Remove gauge and observe to verify that no bluing
was transferred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.6.6
Standoff<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Standoff is the distance measured axially between the end
of the pipe or box and a ﬁxed position on the ring or plug
gauge. The proper diametrical size of the thread and seals is
measured using ring and plug gauges (Figures 51 and 52) in
conjunction with Go-No-Go gauges. Extreme-line ring and
plug gauges are provided for each size of casing to be
inspected. However, the different Go-No-Go feeler gauges
(Figures 51 and 52) may be required for various weights per
foot of casing (Table 18). Each feeler gauge has the ability to
measure four dimensions across the faces (Figures 53 and 54).
The same levels of gauges exist for extreme-line threads as
for round thread gauges. Again, inspection is made with the
working gauge unless a dispute arises.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

External Threads—Ring Gauge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The extreme-line ring gauge is a two-element gauge
(Figure 51). One element gauges the thread diameter. The
other element makes contact with the curved seal near the
small end of the pin (Figures 43 and 45). The seal contact sur-
face of the gauge is coated with Prussian blue before mating
the gauge with the thread to be inspected. Bluing is not
required each time the ring gauge is used. Generally, bluing is
performed when a seal problem is suspected.
The gauge is advanced onto the thread while the seal gauge
ring is fully retracted (pulled away from the pipe thread).
Additionally, the thread ring gauge is advanced while apply-
ing axial back pull (pulling away from the pipe) so all clear-
ance is removed between the makeup ﬂanks of the gauge and
the threads of the product. The seal ring is rotated and pushed
(advanced) into contact with the pin seal using the heels of
the hands after the thread ring gauge is installed hand-tight.
The seal ring will mark the seal tangent point as a blue line so
that length measurement (Figures 44 and 45) can be per-
formed after removing the ring gauge. Additionally, a contin-
uous line of blue shall be observed on the pin seal for the
member to be acceptable.
To measure the  thread diameter , insert the Go-No-Go
gauge (Figure 53) between the front of the ring gauge and the
product pin shoulder (Figure 55). The smaller of the wide
ends of the Go-No-Go gauge shall slip into the space, but the
larger end must not enter the space. If these conditions are
satisﬁed, the pin member thread diameter is acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

but the large end shall not enter this space. If these conditions

<<PARAGRAPH>>When the seal gauge is advanced into position, the gauge
will be secured onto the pin. Thus, the gauge handles should
be struck a sharp blow with the heels of the hands to unthread
the gauge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gauge is threaded into the box element while the seal
element is fully retracted (pulled away from the pipe). Addi-
tionally, the thread plug gauge is advanced into the box ele-
ment while applying axial back-pull (pulling away from the
pipe) so all clearance is removed between the makeup ﬂanks
of the gauge and the threads of the box element. The seal
plug is pushed and rotated (advanced) into contact with the
box element seal using the heels of the hands after the thread
plug gauge is installed hand-tight. The seal plug will transfer
the Prussian blue to the seal surface of the box. There shall
be a continuous contact line of bluing on the seal surface
of the box for the product to be acceptable. This contact line
may be observed after the gauge is removed from the
box element.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

surface of the gauge is coated with Prussian blue before mat-
ing the gauge with the box to be inspected. The seal need not
be blued each time the gauge is used. Generally, bluing is per-
formed when a seal problem is suspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>To measure the  thread diameter , insert the Go-No-Go
gauge (Figure 54) between the plug-gauge thread element
and the end of the box member (Figure 57). The smaller end
of the Go-No-Go gauge shall slip into the space, but the larger
end shall not enter. If these conditions are satisﬁed, the box
member thread diameter is acceptable.
To measure the  seal diameter , insert the Go-No-Go gauge
(now turned 90°) into the slot provided in the plug gauge (Fig-
ures 52 and 58) between the end of the product box member
and the face of the seal gauge element (Figure 58). The
smaller end of the Go-No-Go gauge shall slip into the slot, but
the larger end shall not enter this slot. If these conditions are
satisﬁed, the box member seal diameter is acceptable.
The product box seal contact surface must have a continu-
ous ring of bluing observed after the plug gauge is removed.
Otherwise the box member is not acceptable.
When the seal element is advanced into position, the plug
gauge will be secured onto the box member. Thus, the gauge
handles should be struck a sharp blow with the heels of the

THREAD CONTOUR MICROSCOPE<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 59—Thread Contour Microscope<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thread forms and angles can be examined by the thread
contour microscope (Figure 59). These microscopes are man-
ufactured by several companies. Each style is different in con-
ﬁguration and operation. Therefore, no attempt is made here to
describe the operation of the microscope. Instead, refer to the
manufacturer’s instructions supplied with the microscope.
Use the thread contour microscope to examine ﬂank angles
or thread forms of external thread. The microscope is ﬁtted to
the thread in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
(Figure 59), a thread form template is installed and adjusted
to conform to the thread being inspected, and the error, if any,
is read on the scale provided.
To use the microscope for internal threads replicate the thread
with material such as plaster of Paris. The replicate is viewed
in the microscope as a negative image of the product thread.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Use a thread height gauge with a ﬂat-type tip. With the anvil
of the gauge resting on the thread crests and the penetrant in
the seal-ring groove against the side nearest the center of the
coupling, read radial depths from the thread crests to the seal-
ring groove bottom on selected increments over the circumfer-
ence of the groove (Figures 60 and 61). Avoid placing anvil
near featheredge fade-outs. If the maximum differences in
indicated reading exceed 0.020 in., the coupling is rejected.
