<<HEADING level=3>>4 Pipeline Construction Inspector Responsibilities<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This section outlines the responsibilities, personal conduct, and job performance expectations for pipeline
construction inspectors that enable them to effectively carry out their duties using the knowledge and skills covered in
the following sections on inspector requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An inspector is an individual qualified to monitor, assess, evaluate, verify, discuss, decide, resolve, report, and
document pipeline construction activities to ensure the requirements of the design, drawings, specifications,
regulations, and industry practices are being met safely, efficiently, and in an environmentally sound manner.
Inspector or inspection team authority is backed up by contractual provisions that state all work done, as well as
material provided, shall be subject, at all times, to inspection by the company in charge of the project.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Owner/Operator Representative<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors are expected to function at all times as representatives of the pipeline company (or other entity) owning
and/or managing the project. In most cases, the inspector works for or represents a pipeline company, where strict
procedures and/or contract provisions are in place that spell out the expectations and obligations of the inspector’s
performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Quality Assurance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Quality assurance includes those activities focused on providing confidence that quality requirements are consistently
fulfilled. Inspectors are expected to be the principal means of assuring work and material quality during field
construction. Early insistence that work is not to be performed without an inspector present strengthens quality
assurance. Any questions that may arise regarding quality and acceptability of work, materials furnished, and
services provided are decided upon by the inspector, inspection team, and/or owner/operator. Inspectors are required
to reject work, materials, and services that do not meet the standards, contract terms, specifications, drawings, or
other requirements of the project. Decisions by the inspector, inspection team, and/or owner/operator regarding
quality, acceptability, and materials provided are final and conclusive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

5<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Relationship with Contractors, Suppliers, and Vendors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors are expected to establish a professional business relationship with the contractor, suppliers, and vendors.
These relationships should be based on interactions that are characterized by a reasonable, prudent, and forthright
attitude and grounded in the highest degree of integrity. Inspectors must remember that contractors are to function as
independent contractors with the power and authority to select the means, methods, and manner to perform the
contracted work. Inspectors must respect this position and not direct nor supervise the contractor’s work. However, in
some cases, inspectors are required to implement cost control measures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Planning Activities<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should mutually plan upcoming tasks with their contractor counterparts and owner/operator
representatives, which will aid in smoother job performance and work completion. This should solidify a team
approach in tackling each day’s work and lessen the threat of potential problems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6 Authority to Stop Work<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors are empowered and expected to shut down any work on the basis of, but not limited to, conditions,
situations, or activities that have occurred, are occurring, or may occur that could result in:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— imminent danger to any person, including contractor or owner/operator personnel;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— imminent danger to owner/operator or other property or the environment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— substandard quality/work techniques that do not meet owner/operator specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7 Reporting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors are expected to report deficiencies, unsatisfactory work, thefts, vandalism, missing materials/property, or
suspicious activities/occurrences and other concerns in a timely, complete, and accurate manner to the chief inspector
(Annex A), project manager, or designated owner/operator personnel depending on the project team organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.8 Documentation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should complete required documentation in a timely, concise, and accurate manner, including daily
inspection reports, pipe tallies, red line drawing markups (showing physical changes) for as-built, extra work
authorizations (if allowed by owner), and other reports/forms as directed in a format acceptable to the owner/operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.9 Public Relations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Landowners, residents, and the general public with whom the inspector comes in contact typically consider the
inspector to be a representative of the company. In dealing with these individuals or groups, the inspector should
always conform to owner/operator expectations. Unfavorable publicity from inappropriate behavior could reflect
adversely on all parties involved in the construction of the pipeline. Each inspector should ensure that complaints,
misunderstandings, and other concerns expressed by landowners, residents, and the public are reported to the
appropriate owner/operator representative for investigation and resolution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.10 Media Relations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection personnel do not interact with representatives of newspapers, TV, or other media seeking information,
unless expressly allowed to do so by the owner/operator. Inquiries from the media should be received in an open,
honest way but referred to project management, public relations staff, or others designated by the owner/operator to
handle these situations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_12>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6
API R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  1169<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.11 Safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each inspector is responsible for their personal safety and share responsibility for those personnel around them.
Attentiveness, caution, and awareness of hazards (outlined in Section 5) should be a continuous and integral part of
each inspector’s behavior. If required by the owner/operator, inspectors are expected to pass a standard drug/alcohol
test (see 49  CFR  199) and a background check.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.12 Work Ethics<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should be aware of owner/operator policies regarding work ethics and behavior and understand the
consequences of taking part in any activity that would not withstand the scrutiny of pipeline owner/operator
management or other observers due to the appearance of the activity. These activities include offers of gifts,
entertainment, trips, excursions, etc. offered by contractors, vendors, or suppliers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 Personnel and General Pipeline Safety Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Th e r equirements set forth in this section should be used to establish pipeline construction inspector knowledge and
awareness of hazards inherent to new pipeline construction and the safety regulations, practices, and responses
needed to address these hazards. This section highlights many of the basic OSHA requirements, specifically
29  CFR  1910 and 29  CFR  1926, that apply to construction safety and general requirements that may go beyond
those spelled out in the regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is the duty of pipeline owner/operators and their contractors to be aware of, and comply with, all applicable federal,
state, and local laws/regulations and manufacturer’s requirements that apply to specific work activities being
performed and materials used. Inspectors must report any unacceptable practices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Job Safety Analysis (JSA)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Job safety analysis (JSA) should be conducted per owner/operator requirements, and inspectors are required to
participate. This analysis determines potential hazards and the plans and mitigative measures needed to address
these hazards. Pipeline owner/operator documents will supplement these safety awareness concepts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The practice of analyzing and planning hazardous jobs, use of written procedures or permits, job review and
discussion among key personnel, and walk through inspections ensure personnel understand potential hazards and
the precautions needed to address them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2 Hazard Recognition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should evaluate the following areas to avoid incidents and raise awareness of hazards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Job Site —Job site incidents, including, but not limited to: slips, trips and falls, pinch points, elevated work surfaces,
planned lifts, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Environmental —Changing environmental conditions, such as flooding, wind, dust, fires, and other potential
conditions that could affect personnel and their work performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

moving equipment and lifting and carrying heavy loads in the proximity of personnel, trenches, holes, welding,
metal sparks, and other hazardous activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)  Emergency Conditions —Preparation for response to safety-related incidents. Inspectors should be familiar with
the emergency response plan, including but not limited to emergency phone numbers and locations of response
equipment, such as water, fire extinguishers, first-aid supplies, etc. (see OSHA 1910.151, 1910.157, 1926.23, and
1926.24).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3 Contractor Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should be familiar with the contract provisions regarding contractor(s) and their safety procedures (i.e.
the contractor’s safety program and owner/operator expectations). The contractor is responsible for all safety on
the work site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The JSA (5.2) identifies hazards that necessitate the use of PPE. Inspection personnel should know when personal
protective equipment (PPE) is necessary, what PPE is needed, and how PPE is to be properly used, including its
limitations. Typically, PPE for pipeline construction includes but is not limited to approved eye, head, foot, hand, and
hearing protection; safety apparel; respiratory devices; and various protective shields. (See OSHA 1910.132 and
1926.95.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2 Eye Protection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Eye protection includes safety glasses, safety glasses with side shields, goggles, face shields, and welding goggles

<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.7 Wearing Apparel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Approved clothing identified in the JSA or depending on the tasks involved that protects against work hazards and the
environment are required. For example, apparel could minimally include: fire retardant clothing, chemical resistant
suits, leather for metal spark protection, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.8 Respiratory Protection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This protection involves proper use of air-purifying respirators, air-supplied respirators, or self-contained breathing
apparatus (SCBA). The type of respirator depends on the type of hazard encountered. Users of this equipment
should have knowledge of owner/operator and contractor requirements and be trained in its use, especially mask fit
test and the operation of the devices. (See OSHA 1910.134 and 1926.103.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Loss Prevention Systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5. 4 .1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should have a basic knowledge of general loss prevention systems and require additional training in
owner/operator-specific processes. Inspectors should be familiar with these systems, which are designed to aid in
observation, analysis, and reporting with easy to use forms for occurrences or actions that could harm/damage
property, equipment, or materials. Examples include: lifting/hoisting pipe and equipment, excavation near pipelines or
other utilities, marking/labeling, and other programs to increase awareness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.2 Near Misses<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should be familiar with these programs, which formalize observation, analysis, reporting, and
communication of occurrences that have happened, but did not lead to injury or damage. These programs can
improve awareness and avoid future reoccurrences. Near misses should be discussed and communicated with
everyone on the job site because some may not have known the event was a near miss.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4.3 Safety Meetings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should be capable of organizing and conducting daily safety meetings, prior to beginning work, to cover
such topics as potential hazards likely to be encountered, precautions necessary to lessen their threat, use of PPE,
lessons learned, near misses, and other topics relevant to the safety of workers, the general public, and the
inspection team and potential property damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Protective Measures for Radiation<<HEADING_END>>

Isolation of Hazardous Energy Sources<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should have an understanding of when and how electrical, mechanical equipment or pressure in the
system is deenergized and isolated to prevent unexpected startup or release of stored energy that may cause a
hazard. (See OSHA 1910.147.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9.2
Electrical Energy Sources<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should recognize energy sources, deenergized and energized, requiring lockout/tagout (LOTO) or other
practices to prevent exposure to electrical hazards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 .9.3
Other Energy Sources<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should recognize equipment and piping, valves, etc. requiring LOTO or other precautions to prevent

<<HEADING level=3>>5.10
Excavation, Trenching, and Boring Safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.10.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors should be knowledgeable about excavation safety. New pipeline construction involves an extensive
amount of excavation and trenching work in one form or another. As a result, the existence of and exposure to
potential hazards related to this activity is widespread. Because of the magnitude of this activity and its associated
hazards, pipeline inspectors are required to know what facets to observe, how to take corrective action, and what
protective systems and procedures should be employed. (See OSHA 1926 Subpart P.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.10.2
One Call<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One call is a telephonic excavation notification system set up to coordinate excavators’ activities with utility owner/
operators to prevent damage to underground facilities. Inspectors should have an understanding of these systems,
know the appropriate contact information for the area of pipeline construction activity, and assure the work can
proceed safely after utilities are located and marked by the one call responder(s). (See CGA’s  Best Practices —
Chapter 3, One Call Center and/or applicable state one call provisions/requirements.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.10.3
Excavation Regulations and Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions included in OSHA 1926 Subpart P should be part of pipeline inspectors knowledge. These provisions
are often supplemented by pipeline owner/operator requirements. Qualified inspectors should know pertinent
definitions such as competent person, benching, sloping, and shields as well as hazardous conditions that could be

ROW allows construction to proceed smoothly and safely);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— that clearing, grubbing, and grading are typically permitted activities and that those activities meet the permit
conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.3 Landowner/Tenant Assets<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors need to be aware of landowner requirements, including but not limited to the following: monitoring removal
of permanent fencing, installation of temporary fencing and gates, handling cattle guards, construction pathway
offsets, and bypassing other man-made facilities will aid in smooth construction progress and minimize landowner/
tenant concerns and damage to surrounding property. These requirements are normally found on the construction
“line list” typically developed and maintained by the land agents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.4 Interfacing with Landowners/Tenants<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspectors need to conduct open and forthright communication with landowner/tenants in communicating
construction plans and requesting feedback on concerns and meet with the owner/operator concerning the release of
procedures in order to to minimize discontent and misunderstandings. Some owner/operators require that this
