<<HEADING level=3>>4 Common Heater and Boiler Designs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Types of Heaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are a variety of designs for tubular fired heaters. Some of the more commonly used designs are the box,
cylindrical, and cabin designs. Typical heater designs are represented in Figure 1. The tubes in the radiant section of
the heater are called radiant tubes. The heat pickup in these tubes is mainly through radiation from the burner flame,
radiating flue gas components, and the incandescent refractory. The shock or shield tubes are located at the entrance
to the convection section. Because these tubes absorb both radiant and convective heat, they usually receive the
highest heat flux. These bare rows protect or shield the remaining convection-section tubes from direct radiation,
excessive heat flux and excessive fin tip temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Beyond the shock bank is the convection section where heat pickup comes from the combustion gases primarily
through convection. Convection tubes are commonly finned or studded to increase the surface area for heat transfer.
Sometimes the lowest rows of these extended surface tubes can absorb more heat per unit bare tube surface area
than the radiant tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.2 Box-type Heaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A box-type heater is a heater whose structural configuration forms a box. There are many different designs for box-
type heaters. These designs involve a variety of tube coil configurations, including horizontal, vertical, and arbor
configurations. Figure 2 shows a typical box-type heater with a horizontal coil and identifies the main heater
components. This type of heater can have locations or zones of different heat densities. The size and arrangement of
the tubes in a box-type heater are determined by the type of operation the heater is meant to perform (e.g. crude oil
distillation or cracking, the amount of heating surface required, and the flow rate through the tubes). Box-type heaters
are usually updraft with gas-fired or oil-fired burners located in the end or side wall, the floor or downdraft with the
roof. After the process convection section tubes, auxiliary tubes are often added to preheat combustion air or to
generate or superheat steam. In Figure 2, the convection section is centered in the upper portion of the box-type
heater and the radiant tubes are on the two side walls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.3 Heaters with Vertical Coils<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A vertical coil heater may be positioned cylindrical or in a rectangular (box-type heater). Most vertical coil heaters are
bottom fired with the stack mounted directly on top of the heater. Downdraft vertical heaters have also been used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.4 Heaters with Helical Coils<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Helical coil heaters are cylindrical with the surface of the radiant section in the form of a coil that spirals up the wall of
the heater. They do not usually have a convection section, but if one is included, the convection surface may be in the
form of a flat spiral or a bank of horizontal tubes. The stack of a helical coil heater is almost always mounted directly
on top of the heater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.5 Heaters with Arbor Coils<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heaters with arbor or wicket coils are used extensively in catalytic reforming units for preheat and reheat service and
as heaters for process air or gases. These heaters have a radiant section that consists of inlet and outlet headers
connected with inverted or upright L or U tubes in parallel arrangement. The convection sections consist of
conventional horizontal tube coils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.6 Heaters Used in Steam Methane Reforming<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The vaporized feed in these heaters contain a mixture of light hydrocarbons, usually flowing through multiple rows of
parallel vertical tubes that operate from 1500 °F (816 °C) to 1800 °F (982 °C). Figure 3 shows a steam methane
reforming heater. These heaters are normally down fired from the roof side, fired at many levels, or bottom fired from
the floor to achieve even heat distribution across the entire length of the radiant tubes. The tubes may be made of
wrought high strength materials, including Alloy 800 and Alloy 800H, or of cast materials, including HK40, HP, and
their proprietary modifications. Typically, small diameter pipes, called pigtails, connect the tubes to the inlet and outlet
headers. Most outlet pigtails are of Alloy 800H or similar wrought materials since they operate at about 1400 °F
(760 °C). Inlet pigtails operate at lower temperatures and can be a low Cr-Mo material. Heater outlet headers have
various designs. Some headers and outlet lines are made of carbon steel, C-Mo steel, or low-Cr-Mo steel and have
refractory lining inside. Those that are internally uninsulated have been made of cast materials conforming to ASTM
A297, Grade HT or HK, or of wrought materials, including Alloy 800H.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.7 Pyrolysis Heaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pyrolysis heaters are similar to steam methane reforming heaters and are used to crack various hydrocarbon
feedstocks in the production of ethylene. The same materials are often used for both. There are a few notable
differences. Both Ys and U-bends are used in pyrolysis heaters and suffer erosion. The reaction in the tubes is
usually carburizing and requires that the surfaces be smooth from boring or honing and that the material be more
resistant to carburization. The material used in pyrolysis heaters is often a modification of a high-strength material that
is adequate in reforming heaters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.8 Tube Metallurgy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The selection of materials for heater tubes is based on the design temperature and pressure of the tubes and the
corrosivity of the process. The economics associated with the materials should not be overlooked. Suitable materials
are evaluated looking at the total installed cost, including availability of the material, fabrication and heat treatment
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carbon steel, Cr-Mo steels, and austenitic stainless steels are common tube metallurgies. Carbon steel is limited to
the low temperature applications. Many companies choose to limit carbon steel to applications below 800 °F (427 °C)
to prevent problems from spheroidization and graphitization. The addition of chromium and molybdenum improve
high-temperature strength, resistance to spheroidization, and resistance to oxidation and some corrosion
mechanisms. Austenitic stainless steels are often used for tube applications where temperatures exceed about
1300 °F (704 °C) or the corrosivity of the process requires its use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

temperature limits per API 530 are listed in Table 1. The design metal temperature shown is the upper limit of the
reliability of the rupture strength. Tube wall calculations per API 530 should be completed to determine tube life at
these temperatures. Other factors (i.e. hydrogen partial pressure and resistance to oxidation) often result in lower
temperature limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Types of Boilers<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fired boilers are boilers in which fuel is burned in a combustion chamber associated with the boiler. The heat of
combustion is absorbed by the boiler to heat the water and convert it to steam. Fired boilers that are most prevalent in
industry are either fire tube boilers or water tube boilers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2 Fire Tube Boiler<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A fire tube boiler consists of a drum with a tube sheet on each end in which the fire tubes are fastened. Water is
contained within the drum surrounding the fire tubes. Fuel is burned in a combustion chamber associated with the
boiler and arranged in such a manner that the heat and products of combustion (flue gases) pass through the inside
of the fire tubes to heat the water surrounding them. The combustion chamber may be a refractory-lined box located
against one end of the drum or a steel chamber located within the drum and surrounded on all but one side by the
water in the drum. In the first instance, the boiler may be described as externally fired; in the second, as internally
fired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Horizontal-return-tube boilers were popular in the early refineries. The Scotch marine boiler is of a fire tube design
commonly employed in refinery package-type sulfur plants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3 Water Tube Boiler<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A water tube boiler usually has two drums including a steam drum and a water drum or mud drum. The upper drum
supplies water to the lower drum. The upper drum in the steam chest section collects the saturated steam and dries it
by means of cyclonic separators and chevrons and then discharges the dried steam to the superheater section of the
boiler. The water drum supplies water to the steam generating tubes and to water distribution headers serving the
boiler water walls. The fuel is burned in a combustion chamber arranged so that radiant heat and convection heat is
transferred to the outside of the water tubes to heat the water within.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water tube boilers may be either straight tube boilers or bent tube boilers. The tubes of most straight tube boilers are
connected into headers, which in turn are connected to the boiler drums. Water tube boilers are always used when
large steam capacities are needed. They are also used for high pressures and temperatures. They have been built in
sizes up to 5,000,000 lb (2,268,000 kg) of steam per hour at pressures up to 5000 psi gauge (34,474 kPa) and
temperatures of up to approximately 1200 °F (649 °C).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bent tube boilers are made in a variety of arrangements. They are similar to straight tube boilers, but they are almost
always multi-drum, and the tubes are connected directly into the boiler drums. The tubes are bent to allow them to
enter the drums radially, to facilitate installation, to allow for expansion and contraction, and to allow for flexibility in
design. Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate typical bent tube boilers. Bent tube boilers may be either balanced draft boilers
or positive pressure boilers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 5—Another Variation of a Two-drum Bent Tube Boiler<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some boilers are fired using hot process waste gas streams, including fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU)
regenerator flue gas as fuel to recover both sensible heat and fuel value. Carbon monoxide boilers can still be found
in some refineries. Figure 6 illustrates one type of carbon monoxide boiler. Some refineries also use the combined
cycle system that utilizes the hot exhaust from gas turbines as combustion air in the boilers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4 Waste Heat Boiler (Heat Recovery Steam Generators)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Waste heat boilers can be either a fire tube or water tube design and can have nearly identical configurations to their
“fired” counterparts. However, waste heat boilers generate steam by transferring heat from high-temperature gaseous
products of combustion or products of chemical reaction or other hot process fluids. These boilers can often be found
on units with high-temperature streams and are used to recover the heat and cool the stream. They are described
here simply because the types of deterioration and inspection are similar to the fired boilers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.5 Economizers and Air Preheaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Economizers and air preheaters are heat exchangers used by some boilers as auxiliaries to recover more heat from
the flue gases, heat that otherwise may be lost up the stack. Air preheaters can be classified into the following types:
indirect exchange, external heat source, or direct exchange. An economizer normally consists of a bank of tubes
located in the path of the flue gases downstream of the steam generating surfaces in the boiler. The low-temperature
boiler feedwater is pumped through the tubes in this tube bank and is heated before passing into the boiler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Air preheaters raise the temperature of air before it enters the combustion chamber. The two basic types of air
preheaters are recuperative and regenerative. The recuperative type is similar in principle to a conventional heat
exchanger with the hot flue gases on one side of the heat transfer surface and the cool air on the other side. The most
common recuperative type is the tubular air preheater that consists of a tube bank with the tubes rolled into a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_25>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
17<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>stationary tube sheet at the top of the unit and a floating tube sheet at the bottom. Flue gas flows on the outside of the
tubes and air flows on the inside of the tubes. The use of a floating tubesheet accommodates the difference in
expansion caused by temperature differences between the tubes and the casing. In this type, the hot gases flow
through the tubes and the air passes around the tubes. Another recuperative type is made up of plates arranged with
passages for the flue gas on one side of the plates and passages for air on the other side. Figure 7 illustrates a
recuperative type of air preheater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most common regenerative type is called a rotating heat transfer wheel and is made up of many closely spaced
sheets of metal. This metal absorbs heat as it rotates through the flue-gas compartment of its housing and gives up
heat as it rotates through the air compartment (see Figure 8). The heat transfer wheel is rotated at approximately 3
rpm by a driving motor through a reduction gear. Diaphragms and seals divide the unit lengthwise to separate the hot
flue gases from the air that flows through the preheater in opposite directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preheating of combustion air has high economic value. In the conventional air preheater, cold air from the forced
draft fan flows through the air preheater and extracts heat from the flue gases as they flow to the stack. Economizers
or air preheaters are used when fuel savings justify them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.6 Superheaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Superheaters consist of a bank of tubes located within the boiler setting through which saturated steam flows from the
steam drum and is superheated by the same flue gas that generates steam in the boiler. They may be of the radiant
design, convection design, or a combination of both, depending on the manner in which heat is transferred from the
heater gases to steam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Superheaters may have tubes in hairpin loops connected in parallel to inlet and outlet headers. They may also be of
the continuous tube design in which each element has tube loops in series between inlet and outlet headers. In either
case, they may be designed for drainage of condensate or may be in non-drainable pendent arrangements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Non-drainable or pendant arrangements are susceptible to tube failure due to overheating on start-up. Water
collected in the pendent shall be slowly vaporized to assure a flow path for the steam. If the boiler is heated too
rapidly, some pendants may still contain liquid; therefore, steam does not flow and the tube will overheat and fail.
Special start-up instructions should be taken into consideration with this type of arrangement. Both straight and
pendent arrangement superheaters are susceptible to failure due to steam impurities. When steam is used in
processing operations, superheated steam may be required to obtain the desired process temperature. Most of the
large-capacity, high-pressure steam generators, especially those used for power production, are equipped with
superheaters. Superheated steam is also necessary for the most efficient production of power, especially when used
in high-pressure, high-speed steam turbine drives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.7 Tube Metallurgy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Boiler tubes are generally carbon steel, 1 1 / 4  Cr- 1 / 2  Mo and 2 1 / 4  Cr-1 Mo steel. The material selection depends on the
temperature and pressure of the application. Typically, the governing criterion is the oxidation rate of the material
being evaluated. Carbon steel is often used in the water-filled and steam-generating tubes where the metal
temperature is below 800 °F (427 °C). Tubes used in the steam superheat section should be higher alloys for
improved strength and resistance to external oxidation. Again, the selection depends on the metal temperature and
operating stress of the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.8 Flue Gas Stacks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flue gas stacks vent the flue gas produced as part of the combustion process of the burners to the atmosphere. They
are typically located directly above the heater or boiler or located nearby and connected to them by ductwork. Flue
gas stacks are generally constructed of carbon steel and internally lined with refractory. The stack may have an
organic coating to protect the steel from internal corrosion beneath the refractory lining. Stacks may be either self-
supporting or guyed, and their height should be above that of nearby platforms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Reliability Programs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Reliability programs have evolved from inspection during unit maintenance outages to risk-based integrity
management programs encompassing on-stream process tube life monitoring, continual heater and boiler efficiency
analyses and increasingly detailed and varied inspections during maintenance opportunities. In the simplest
programs, heater and boiler reliability focus on preventing failures of the pressure boundary. The strategy is to
prevent leaks and ruptures of the tubes and in the case of boilers, the drums too. Further refinements to these
programs consider the establishment and implementation of integrity operating windows (IOW) for the key process<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1  Process safety management (PSM) systems are also needed to support a rigorous inspection and
mechanical integrity program to avoid and prevent heater and boiler damage and corrosion, leaks and failures and
improve reliability. Three key elements of those supporting PSM programs include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the establishment, implementation and maintenance of Integrity Operating Windows (IOWs);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— an effective method of transferring all the knowledge about heater and boiler IOWs to all process unit
operators and others that need to know; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— an effective management of change (MOC) program to identify any changes to the process or the physical
hardware that may affect the integrity and reliability of heaters and boilers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2  Tube failures result from progressive deterioration from a variety of deterioration mechanisms. Therefore, one
needs to understand the active and potential mechanisms in a particular heater and boiler to develop an appropriate
inspection and monitoring strategy in order to prevent them from causing a failure. For example, in elevated
temperature services like boiler and heater tubes, creep and stress rupture are potential deterioration mechanisms.
The tube operating variables that affect tube creep life and stress rupture life include: the base metal creep and stress
rupture properties, tube metal temperatures, applied stress from internal operating pressure and from mechanical
loading (i.e. from supports or lack of supports), and time operating at each unique combination of stress and metal
temperature. Each deterioration mechanism should be understood similarly and shall be discussed more fully in
Section 6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3  Tube reliability not only requires an understanding of the mechanisms by which the tubes can fail, but also
requires data on how the previous operating history has impacted tube life, predictions of deterioration rate, how the
future operations can impact tube life, and monitoring of operations and deterioration to ensure the analyses and
predictions are accurate and appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Historically, inspection data gathered during outages assessed the immediate condition of the tubes with varying
degrees of accuracy or success. Typically, these inspections include a visual examination for bulges in tubes or
changes in diameter and thickness measurements of accessible tubes. Areas where a measurable increase in tube
diameter has occurred can be identified using fixed-diameter feeler gauges along the length of the tube OD. These
areas may warrant a more detailed assessment of creep damage. Inspections can also include detailed strapping
and gauging for bulges, internal ultrasonic inspection pigs to gather detailed tube wall thickness and diameter maps
(including the difficult to inspect heater convective tubes), on-stream infrared tube temperature measurements,
destructive testing to identify specific types of deterioration or to determine actual remaining creep life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Typically, the individual tasks associated with these activity categories are itemized in unit operations manuals, on
itemized checklists, or are programmed into portable “intelligent” devices. The significant results of these monitoring
activities are recorded in unit log books. Two examples of operator rounds checklists are shown in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A leak or failure in a heater can be a minor or a significant incident depending on the temperature, pressure, process
fluid, heater location, response of operators and other controls. The process fluid is often flammable, and can result in
a fire when a leak or failure occurs. The potential for personnel injury and environmental impact also exists. Boilers,
depending on their pressure, have the potential to cause injury due to the significant stored energy. Significant injuries
and incidents have occurred from boiler failures. An inspection and reliability program for heaters and boilers is an
important component to maintaining safe and environmentally responsible operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Purpose of Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of inspection in a reliability program is to gather data on the tubes and equipment so that it can be
analyzed and a reasonable assessment made of the equipment’s mechanical integrity for continued service. Repairs
can be made if analyses of the data indicate that life is shorter than the planned run length. In addition, repairs or
replacements can be predicted for the future by analyses of appropriate data accumulated at regular internal
equipment inspections and during routine on-stream monitoring of actual service conditions. Planned repairs and
replacements allow all necessary drawings, lists of materials, and work schedules to be prepared in the most effective
manner. Necessary materials can be estimated and replacement parts either wholly or partly fabricated at the most<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>convenient times prior to shutdown. If work schedules are properly prepared and reviewed, each craft knows exactly
what has to be done and the sequence so that overall quality is improved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Inspection of Fired Boilers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements governing inspection of boilers can differ widely from one location to another since they are often
regulated by jurisdictions. Under some jurisdictions, inspections are made by state, municipal, or insurance company
inspectors. Other jurisdictions may allow inspections by qualified owner-user inspectors. In either case, the inspector
is usually commissioned by the regulatory authority and has to submit reports of the inspection to the official
responsible for enforcement of the boiler law. If the boiler is insured, inspection by the insurance company inspector
also serves to satisfy his company that the boiler is in an insurable condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally, governmental and insurance company inspectors concern themselves only with the pressure parts of the
boiler, the safety valves, level indicators, pressure gauges, and feedwater and steam piping between the boiler and
the main stop valves, superheaters, and economizers. The plant inspector should also be concerned with related
nonpressure parts, including the furnace, burners, flue-gas ducts, stacks, and steam-drum internals since these can
affect equipment reliability and performance. When inspection by an outside agency is necessary, joint inspections by
the outside inspector and the plant inspector can reduce the length of boiler outages and result in shared learning.
The outside inspector is primarily interested in seeing that minimum legal safety requirements are met. The plant
inspector should be interested not only in safety but also in conditions that affects reliability and efficiency. The outside
inspector has an opportunity to examine many boilers that operate under widely varying conditions and often can offer
valuable advice on the safe operation of boilers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Inspection of Fired Heaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fired heaters are frequently subjected to additional or unique degradation mechanisms due to the combination of
heat, internal pressure and the various chemical characteristics of process fluids. Alloys designed to counteract
specific corrosion mechanisms often exhibit other sensitivities requiring specialized inspection techniques and
operating controls. Inspectors should prepare by carefully reviewing the furnace history briefs and become familiar
with the type of heater being inspected, corrosion control measures, critical reliability and process variables, past
problems and furnace repair history.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Critical reliability and process variables associated with integrity operating windows are monitored for abnormal
trends and exceedances. This data should be monitored and tracked as an integral component of a fired heater’s
history. This data in conjunction with on-line visual and IR monitoring and mapping is valuable in the determination of
excessive heat flux, sag/strain, localized or accelerated corrosion, coking, creep and metal dusting associated with
the various metallurgies and chemistries presented by fired process heaters. This information is essential in creating
risk-based inspection plans for fired heater integrity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 Inspector Qualifications<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of heaters and boilers should be performed by someone trained and experienced with heater operation,
heater deterioration mechanisms and the appropriate inspection techniques to identify or monitor them. The inspector
should have experience with or have access to an individual(s) with understanding of burners, tubes, tube hangers
and supports, refractories, and overall heater operation. Examiners performing specific NDE procedures should be
trained and qualified in the applicable procedures in which the examiner is involved. In some cases, the examiner
may be required to hold other certifications necessary to satisfy owner or user requirements. Examples of other
certifications include American Society for Non-Destructive Testing SNT-TC-1A, CP-189, Canadian General
Standards Board 48.9712, Euronorm Standard EN 473, or American Welding Society QC1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1 Internal Tube Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal corrosion is a function of the chemical composition of the process fluid, process and tube metal temperatures,
the fluid velocity and tube metallurgy. Some critical species include sulfur compounds and organic acids (naphthenic
acid). The level of these species in the fluid influences the type and rate of corrosion on the internal surface of the
heater tubes. Sulfur compounds in particular promote sulfidic corrosion that can manifest itself as localized and
general wall thinning. Similarly, corrosion from organic acid can appear localized in turbulent regions or general
thinning in areas. Typically, sulfidation rates are predicted based on industry experience or by calculations based on
empirical data (e.g. modified-McConomy curves). Often the corrosion rate can be more localized in the vapor phase of
horizontal convection tubes in Hydrotreating Unit furnaces and is greater than observed in the liquid phase. The
presence of hydrogen increases corrosion rates predicted by the modified-McConomy curves. Some industry data
also indicates that under certain operating conditions, the modified-McConomy curves can be non-conservative. Refer
to API 571 and API 939-C for more information on sulfidation corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fluid and metal temperatures influence the corrosion rate. The highest tube metal temperature predominantly occurs
at the fire side front face of the radiant tube where the heat flux is greatest. The corrosion rate profile often follows the
heat flux profile. Figure 9 shows an example of increased corrosion on the fire side of a tube. Differences in the
corrosion rate along the length or around a cross section of a tube are often the result of temperature differences
between locations. An example of temperature influence is the increase in corrosion rate with a rise in temperature to
750 °F (399 °C) for processes with sulfur compounds. Above 750 °F (399 °C) the corrosion rate decreases due to
stable sulfide scale that inhibits further corrosion. Figure 10 is a convection tube that failed from internal corrosion
attributed to high-temperature sulfidic attack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>High-velocity fluids, fluids containing particulate, or tubes with two-phase flow can increase the corrosion rate by
stripping away protective scale and exposing fresh metal to continue the corrosion process. Corrosion from organic
acids and sulfur compounds are significantly influenced by fluid velocity. Particular attention should be given to high
turbulent regions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 9—ID of Fireside Portion of Tube Showing Severe Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 10—Convective Tube Failure from Internal, High-temperature Sulfidic Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tube failures resulting from corrosion are generally due to local stress rupture in which the wall thickness becomes
too thin and is overstressed at the metal operating temperature. These failures can appear as small leaks through pits
or “fish-mouth” ruptures if the thinning is general or if it causes longitudinal grooving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2 External Tube Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External corrosion of the tube depends on the heater atmosphere and temperatures. Generally, the external surface
of the tube corrodes from oxidation. The heater atmosphere contains excess oxygen necessary for combustion of the
fuel at the burners. Oxidation rates for a metal increase with increased temperature. Oxidation may either be a
localized condition or extend over the entire length of the tube inside the heater. Excessive oxidation and scaling is
usually the result of operating the tubes above recommended levels. This can be the result of over-firing the heater or
internal fouling of the tubes due to the increase in the tube wall temperature. Combustion deposits may have the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>appearance of oxide scale, but they can be distinguished by checking them with a magnet. Oxide scales are
magnetic; whereas, combustion deposits are not.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other types of corrosion attack are possible. Heaters operating with insufficient oxygen or fuel-rich can cause
corrosion from the resulting reducing environment. Depending on the type and quality of the fuel, corrosion can occur
from sulfidation or carburization. Acid attack can result from the combustion of heater fuels depending upon the sulfur
content of the fuel. When the gas or fuel oil has a high sulfur content, one of the combustion products formed and
deposited on the outside surfaces of the tubes is a sulfate. This sulfate is harmless during operational periods, but
when the deposit is allowed to cool, it becomes highly hygroscopic and absorbs moisture from the air, hydrolyzing to
produce sulfuric acid that corrodes the underlying metal. Figure 11 shows a tube exhibiting external corrosion from
this type of attack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<IMAGE_3>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 11—General Metal Loss and Pitting of Tubes Exposed to Moisture and Corrosive Deposits
During Idle Periods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the fuel has a high vanadium content, metal at temperatures above a critical point in the range from 1200 °F
(649 °C) to 1400 °F (760 °C) is subject to rapid attack from low-melting vanadium based compounds (vanadates) and
sodium-vanadium compounds (sodium vanadates). The vanadates and sodium vanadates deposit on the hot metal
surface, melt, and act as a fluxing agent to remove the protective oxide scale on the tubes. The cycle repeats itself as
oxide and deposit builds back up on the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Convection sections where flue gas dew point temperatures occur during operations suffer metal loss because of acid
material from the products of combustion. Metal loss on the exterior of convection tubes may be difficult to evaluate
because of inaccessibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3 Creep and Stress Rupture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Creep and stress rupture are high-temperature mechanisms that depend on both the stress level and type of material.
At high temperatures, metal components can slowly and continuously deform under load below the yield stress.
Creep is defined as the time dependent deformation of stressed components under an applied load below the yield
strength at the operating temperature of the material. Stress rupture is similar to creep except that the stresses are
higher and the time to failure is shorter than those used for creep. Stress rupture failures are typically short-term
failures while creep failures are typically long-term failures. Tubes that have been in-service for long periods of time
can fail by stress rupture if the operating severity has increased significantly during operation or the condition of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_35>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
27<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>tube has deteriorated. Tubes are exposed to biaxial stresses as the result of hoop stress caused by the operating
pressure, and longitudinal stress caused by inadequate tube support or inappropriate design and construction that
causes localized high stresses. Thick-walled tubes are exposed to triaxial stresses caused by hoop, longitudinal, and,
in addition, radial stresses caused by the uneven distribution of stresses through the thickness of the tube wall. Creep
and stress rupture are described in API 571.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The metal temperature plays a major role in the type and severity of the deterioration of the heater tubes. The metal
temperature of individual tubes or along the length of any specific radiant tube of a given heater can vary
considerably. The principal causes of abnormal variation in metal temperature are internal fouling of the tubes that
insulates the tube wall from the process and improper or poor firing conditions in the heater. Some potential signs of
creep in tubes are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Sagging . Excessive sagging is usually because of a decrease in the structural strength of the tube caused by
overheating. It may also be caused by improper spacing of hangers, uneven metal temperatures, or failure of one
or more tube supports or hangers. Figure 12 shows some roof tubes exhibiting excessive sagging due to the
failure of tube hangers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Bowing . Excessive bowing is generally caused by uneven metal temperatures that may be due to flame
impingement or coke accumulation inside the tube. Heating on one side of the tube causes greater thermal
expansion on the hotter side and bowing toward the heat source. Bowing may also be caused by binding of the
tube in the tube sheets or improper suspension of the tube so that longitudinal expansion is restricted or by the
use of improper tube lengths when individual tube replacements are made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  Bulging . Bulging is generally an indication of overheating. Continuing under the same temperature and stress
conditions eventually lead to creep and stress rupture. The amount of bulging varies with the specific metal and
the type of damage, creep or overstress. If the bulge is attributed to overstress (short-term overheating), and the
temperature and stress have been returned to normal, typically the life of the tube has not been reduced. Creep
life can be reduced if the bulge is the result of creep damage (long-term overheating). Bulging is considered more
serious than sagging or bowing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.4 Metallurgical Changes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steels subjected to high temperatures and stress for long periods can undergo metallurgical change. This change
results in various conditions, including carburization, decarburization, spheroidization and grain growth. All of these
conditions lead to a general reduction in mechanical strength or a change in ductility that may eventually result in
failure of the material. Some materials, including 5 Cr- 1 / 2  Mo, may be susceptible to precipitation hardening when
concentrations of residual elements (i.e. phosphorus, tin and antimony) are above certain threshold levels and
exposed to heater operating temperatures for a sufficient time period. The result may be temper embrittlement with a
loss of elongation and notch ductility as these elements precipitate in the grain boundaries after about a year at
temperatures from 572 °F (300 °C) to 1112 °F (600 °C). Accordingly, the tube materials have ductile-to-brittle
transition temperatures as high as 300 °F (149 °C) and brittle cracking has been experienced. See API 571 for a
detailed description of these forms of deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Type 410 stainless steel can be susceptible to alpha-prime embrittlement or “885 °F embrittlement”, depending on the
trace elements present in the composition. Alpha-prime significantly reduces the toughness of the metal at
temperatures below 200 °F (93 °C). Brittle fracture can result from impact loads during downtime so extra caution
during handling is prudent. At operating temperatures, the material has acceptable toughness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.5 Erosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The velocity of flow through a heating coil may cause severe erosion in heater tubes and fittings if the velocity is
critical or if direct impingement occurs. Often, the metal loss is aggravated by the corrosive nature of the process.
Erosion in heater tubes is usually the result of velocity. Erosion in heater fittings usually results from a combination of
impingement and velocity. If the charge rate on a heater is materially increased, the increased velocity may cause
metal loss from erosion and corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.6 Thermal Fatigue<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Metal that operates under cyclic temperature conditions, especially over a wide range, may develop cracks from
thermal fatigue. Cracks start at the surface of the material where the stresses are normally higher, progressing slowly
at first and then more rapidly with each cycle of temperature change. Thermal fatigue is often found at locations
where metals that have different coefficients of expansion are joined by welding. Other common locations for thermal
fatigue are in convective tubes where the tube fins can promote cyclic temperature swings, tubes with two-phase flow,
and bracing and weld attachments that do not allow for thermal expansion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.7 Thermal Shock<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermal shock is caused by a sudden marked change in temperature either from hot to cold or from cold to hot. The
stresses resulting from the sudden unequal expansion or contraction of the different parts may cause distortion only
or distortion plus cracking. Thick metals are more susceptible to cracking than are thin ones. The most likely time of
temperature shock is during unit start-ups and process upsets. Heating or cooling rates should be controlled to avoid
thermal shock.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.8 Liquid Metal Cracking and Embrittlement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Liquid metal cracking is a form of environmental cracking where molten metal penetrates the grain boundaries of the
steel. Series 300 austenitic stainless steel tubes are particularly susceptible to this mechanism from molten
aluminum, zinc and cadmium. Fireboxes provide adequate temperatures for these metals to be molten since they
have relatively low melting points. Contact of stainless steel surfaces with a low melting point metal should be avoided
during maintenance outages in particular; including incidental contact (i.e. using marking pens containing zinc and
galvanized or aluminum scaffolding poles rubbing against tubes).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.9 Polythionic Acid Stress Corrosion Cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heaters used in hydrodesulfurization, hydroforming, hydrocracking, and similar processes usually process reactor
feed or recycled gas containing hydrogen sulfide and sulfur compounds. Polythionic stress corrosion cracking
(PASCC) occurs when three conditions coexist. The conditions required for cracking to occur include a suitable:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) Environment—Polythionic acids are formed when sulfide scales developed during service exposure are
subsequently exposed to oxygen and water, primarily during outages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) Material—Sensitized Type-300 series stainless steel and higher-nickel base austenitic alloys. Sensitization can
occur in these austenitic alloys after exposures to temperatures ranging from 750 °F to 1500 °F (398 °C to
816 °C) during manufacturing, fabrication or in service. Sensitization occurs after relatively short exposure times
at the high end of the temperature range, while prolonged exposure is necessary at the lower end of the
temperature range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) Stress—This can be either residual stresses from fabrication (e.g. welding) or applied stresses (e.g. hoop or
axial).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, the risk of cracking increases during downtime when water and air are present. Cracking can be rapid as
the acid corrodes along the grain boundaries of the austenitic alloy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cracking can initiate from either the inside or outside of the tube. Cracking from the process side is more common
because the process often contains sulfur compounds resulting in sulfide scales. However, cracking can occur from
the tube OD if the firebox operates fuel rich and there is sufficient sulfur in the fuel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Preventive measures include using materials less susceptible to sensitization, preventing acid from forming, and
neutralizing the acids. Specific details are as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Stabilized grades of stainless steel (e.g. Type 321 or Type 347) are more resistant to sensitization, but even these
materials can become sensitized after a longer exposure to slightly higher temperatures. A thermal stabilization
heat treatment of a stabilized grade of stainless has been shown to significantly improve resistance to
sensitization and thereby minimize the potential for cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Preventing oxygen and moisture prevents polythionic acid from forming. This can be accomplished by purging
with an inert gas, like nitrogen, and keeping the tubes pressurized with it. When blinding is required, a positive flow
of inert gas should be maintained while the flanges are open and a blind is being installed. If desired, a small
amount of ammonia can be added to the inert gas as a neutralizing agent. Maintaining a positive flow of inert gas
excludes air and moisture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) A wash with a soda ash solution can effectively neutralize acids and maintain a basic pH. Tubes, crossovers,
headers, or other parts of the heater that have to be opened should be soda ash washed. The usual solution is a
2 wt. % soda ash (Na 2 CO 3 ) with a suitable wetting agent. The solution should be circulated so that all gas pockets
are moved and all surfaces are wetted. Sodium nitrate at 0.5 wt. % may also be added to the solution to inhibit
chloride cracking. The solution may then be drained and reused in piping or another heater. The 2 % solution
contains enough soda ash to leave a film, but a weaker solution may not. The film is alkaline and can neutralize
any reaction of iron sulfide, air, and water. It is important to remember that the film, the residue from the soda-ash
solutions, may not be washed off during downtime. Most units are put back on stream with the film remaining. If
the film has to be removed, flushing during start-up followed by inert gas may be acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Preventing moisture exposure by maintaining tube temperatures above the dew point prevents acid from forming.
This is typically applied to external tube surfaces that are not neutralized. Depending on the dew point
temperature, this may be accomplished either by keeping pilots burning during down times or keeping a burner at
minimum fire when access is not needed and safety procedures allow. Tube temperatures should be monitored to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

detail in NACE RP 0170.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.10 Carburization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carburization can occur when metals are exposed to carbonaceous material or carburizing environment at elevated
temperatures. Carbon from the environment combines with carbide-forming elements (i.e. Cr, Mo, Nb, W, Mo, Ti, and
Fe) in the alloy to form internal carbides. These carbides precipitate at the grain boundaries of the alloy or inside the
grains. As a rule, carburization problems only occur in Cr-Mo alloys at temperatures above 1100 °F (593 °C), and in
austenitic alloys above 1500 °F (815 °C). In refining operations, carburization damage is sometimes found in ferritic
heater tubes in catalytic reformers and Coker units. The effect of carburization is to reduce the ambient temperature
ductility, toughness, and weldability of the alloy. Carburization also reduces oxidation resistance by tying up chromium
in the form of stable chromium-rich carbides. The creep strength of the alloy may also be adversely affected as the
result of the reduced ductility of the alloy due to the carbide precipitation within in the grains and at the grain boundary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In petrochemical operations, carburization is typically found in austenitic heater tubes in ethylene pyrolysis and steam
reformer furnaces where significant carburization can occur during decoking cycles. Carburization has been identified
as the most frequent failure mechanism of ethylene furnace tubes. Experience has indicated that the severity of
carburization damage in ethylene cracking is process dependent. Some important factors identified include the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— steam dilution, which tends to decrease the rate of damage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the use of lighter feeds versus heavier feeds, the former having a higher carbon potential; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the frequency and nature of decoking operations (decoking is thought to be a major contributor to carburization
damage).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Carburization causes the normally nonmagnetic wrought and cast heat-resistant alloys to become magnetic. As
shown in Figure 13 for a cast HK-40 tube alloy, the actual percentage of chromium depleted from the matrix is
proportional to the magnetic permeability. The resulting magnetic permeability provides a methodology for monitoring
the extent of carburization damage. Measurement devices range from simple hand-held magnets to advanced multi-
frequency eddy current instruments. Carburization patterns can also reveal uneven temperature distributions that
might otherwise have gone undetected. Most alloys tend to have more carburization penetration with increasing
temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As in the case of oxidation and sulfidation, chromium is considered to impart the greatest resistance to carburization.
Aluminum and silicon alloying additions can also contribute positively to resistance to carburization. It should be noted
that the addition of aluminum or silicon to the heat-resistant alloys in quantities to develop full protection involves
metallurgical trade-offs in strength, ductility, and weldability. Considering fabrication requirements and mechanical
properties, viable alloys are generally restricted to about 2 % for each element. Other approaches to reducing the
potential for carburization damage includes reducing the carbon activity of the environment through lower
temperatures and higher oxygen and sulfur partial pressures. Also, the addition of H 2 S in the process stream inhibits
carburization in steam and gas cracking in olefin and thermal hydrodealkylation units<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Originally, tubes in ethylene cracking furnaces were manufactured out of cast HK-40 alloy (Fe-25Cr-20Ni). Since the
mid-1980s, more resistant HP alloys have been utilized, but carburization problems have not been eliminated as the
result of more severe operating conditions in the form of higher temperatures. Some operators have implemented a
35Cr-45Ni cast alloy with various additions to combat these conditions. For short residence-time furnaces with small

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.11 Metal Dusting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Metal dusting is a catastrophic form of carburization that may result in rapid metal wastage in both ferritic and
austenitic alloys. This damage mechanism typically has the appearance of localized pitting or grooving along the
inner walls of pipe and tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Environments with high carbon activity (greater than one) and low oxygen partial pressures can be prone to this type
of damage if temperatures become high enough for carbon diffusion to occur in the base metal. Depending on the
type of alloy, this temperature may be as low as 800 °F (427 °C) and as high as 1400 °F (760 °C). In iron-based
alloys, this mechanism initiates with the saturation of the alloy matrix with carbon, usually in a very localized manner,
followed by the formation of metastable Fe 3 C or cementite. The cementite decomposes as the carbon activity
increases and approaches unity to form iron particles and powdery carbon. With nickel-based alloys, there is no
intermediate formation of a metastable carbide. Instead, carbon diffuses into the matrix material and then
decomposes into graphite and metal particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Common process streams where metal dusting has been known to occur include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) methanol production – where the production of a synthetic hydrogen gas results in ideal conditions for this to
occur,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) hydroforming units – where the 9 % Cr material used in many of the fired heaters have been found with this type
of damage, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) waste heat boilers – where high metal temperatures and high activity of carbon lead to initiation of this damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Protection of an alloy against metal dusting requires the presence of an adherent, protective, self-healing oxidation
layer on the surface of the material. In general, nickel-based alloys perform much better in a metal dusting
environment than do iron based alloys. Alloy 800H is one of the most susceptible austenitic alloys to this mechanism,
with a fast initiation rate and high wastage rates. Similarly, alloys with 20 % to 40 % nickel are also strongly attacked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.12 Mechanical Deterioration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mechanical deterioration may materially reduce the service life of heater tubes and fittings. The two most common
causes of this are leakage in the tube rolls—the rolled joints between tubes and fittings—and damage during
mechanical cleaning. Leakage in the tube rolls may result from faulty roll procedures or workmanship when the tubes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>were originally installed or may be caused from thermal upsets during operation. Similarly, damage to a tube during
mechanical cleaning may be caused by faulty procedures or workmanship. One of the most common causes is
allowing the cleaner to operate in one position for so long that it cuts the tube metal. Machined surfaces of plug-type
header fittings can be damaged by contact with cleaning tools. Cleaning by steam-air decoking can cause serious
oxidation and other deterioration of tubes unless temperatures are carefully controlled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Undue force used to close fittings may result in the development of cracks in the fitting body or at the base of fitting
ears and may cause excessive wear or distortion of the plugs of U-bend seats, fitting ears, or holding sections and
members-dogs or caps and screws. The use of excess force commonly occurs because of improper cleaning of
ground surfaces or mismating of plugs to return bends. Training and close supervision of personnel with regard to the
proper care, use, and amount of tightening permissible are essential to prevent this damage. Casting or forging
defects may also result in cracks in the fitting body or at the base of fitting ears. One common practice to aid in
removing plugs and to reduce the chance of damaging the casting is to heat the fittings. Overheating with a torch may
cause the fitting to crack. The depth and seriousness of cracks formed by overheating with a torch should be
investigated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermal expansion that has not been accommodated can cause deterioration. Tube materials expand when heated.
If the expansion cannot be accommodated, it can create stresses that are high enough to cause serious weakening
and deformation of the tube or fitting. For instance, tube failures have resulted from refractory repair work, which did
not allow the tubes to expand, and created high enough local stresses to result in creep rupture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.13 Deterioration Specific to Steam Methane Reformer Heaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.13.1 Tubes and Pigtails<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steam methane reformer heater tubes and pigtails are susceptible to creep and stress rupture due to high thermal
and mechanical stresses and high operating temperatures. Failures generally occur due to stress rupture at the
hottest, most highly stressed portion of the tube. The hottest areas are normally near the bottom for down-flow
systems or top of the tube for up-flow systems, since the temperature of the gas inside the tubes rises during reaction
by about 500 °F (260 °C), from about 900 °F (482 °C) to about 1400 °F (760 °C). If flame from burners or from
combustion products deflected off walls and impinges upon the tube, stress rupture can occur in the hottest parts of
the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steam methane reformer heater tubes can fail by creep rupture that is different from most other heater tubes. The
tubes have a thick wall with a large thermal gradient across it such that there are significant thermal stresses in the
region between the ID and mid-wall. These thermal stresses are high enough to promote creep initiating where the
combination of stress and temperatures are above a threshold and propagating to the inner diameter. Finally, the
cracks propagate to the outer diameter resulting in failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Minimizing mechanical stresses from thermal growth are critical to pigtail and tube reliability. Steam methane reformer
heaters have an elaborate support and hanger system designed to allow the tubes to grow in service and to reduce
the stress on the pigtails and headers. If the support system is not functioning as designed, it can produce high
stresses on the pigtails and tubes to the extent of promoting creep rupture. Without adequate support, tubes can bow
in service, further increasing stresses. Bowed tubes have higher stress levels at their bends than do straight tubes.
Bending stresses are induced on pigtails from tube bowing, tube movement, sagging of the pigtail under its own
weight, and thermal expansion of a pigtail loop. The pigtails are susceptible to thermal fatigue if the movement is
cyclic because of swings in operation or numerous start-ups and shutdowns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some cast tube materials may embrittle after exposure to high temperatures. Weld materials that embrittle during
postweld cooling have high residual stresses. Weld material with a carbon-silicon ratio that does not match that of the
base metal fissures easily during welding. Any microfissures not detected during fabrication can propagate during
subsequent heating, thermal cycles, or continual high stresses from bowing or localized heating. Welding flux has to
be removed from tube welds. Grit blasting is recommended for flux removal. Flux of lime with fluorides is corrosive if
the combustion gases are reducing (because of very little excess air) and sulfur is present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.13.2 Outlet Headers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cast alloy headers, like those fabricated from HK material, have a history of cracking near junctions because of
embrittlement due to carbide precipitation and sigma formation. Other areas of concern include inlets, outlets, laterals,
tees and elbows. These headers are horizontal and do not float freely. The embrittlement that occurs does not allow
any restraint of the thermal growth and results in high stresses with resultant cracking. Because of the embrittlement,
welding repairs are difficult unless the surfaces are annealed or buttered with a ductile weld material before welding.
Proprietary cast materials have been developed to avoid embrittlement and their use in outlet headers has been
satisfactory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wrought alloy headers (e.g. Alloy 800H) operating at temperatures near 1400 °F (760 °C) have also had a good
service history. They maintain ductility and can yield by creep or stress relaxation to reduce localized stresses. As in
any high temperature design, stresses have to be kept low, particularly at supports and at openings in the headers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Headers fabricated from carbon steel or low Cr-Mo require internal refractory to keep metal temperatures low enough
to have an adequate design stress and to resist high-temperature hydrogen attack. Because the base metal is not
resistant to hydrogen at high temperatures, the refractory has to be sound to preserve its insulating properties.
Refractory used in hydrogen and carbon monoxide service should have low iron and silicon content to avoid the
possibility of hydrogen or carbon monoxide reacting with components of the refractory and the degradation of the
refractory's essential properties. Start-up and shutdown procedures minimize wetting of the refractory, partly to avoid
destroying the insulating refractory and partly to avoid carbonic acid corrosion of the steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Deterioration of Boiler Tubes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar to heater tubes, boiler tubes can also experience deterioration from internal and external mechanisms. The
following subsections describe common deterioration mechanisms. Table 3 also summarizes these common
mechanisms in boiler plants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1 Internal Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion of tubes and the drums is largely dependent on the water and water chemistry used within the boiler. Some
of the more common types of waterside corrosion include caustic corrosion, dilute acid corrosion, oxygen pitting or
localized corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. A significant factor in the degree of waterside corrosion is the
amount of corrosion product deposited. Deposits restrict the heat transfer and lead to local overheating, which can
cause concentration of contaminants and corrosives. Depending on which contaminants are present in the feedwater
during a period of chemical unbalance, different deposition locations, rates, and effects can be experienced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Caustic corrosion or caustic gouging can occur from deposition of feedwater-corrosion products in which sodium
hydroxide can concentrate to high pH levels. At high pH levels, the steel’s protective oxide layer is soluble and rapid
corrosion can occur. Deposits normally occur where flow is disrupted and in areas of high heat input. When the
deposit thickness is great enough to locally concentrate caustic, severe corrosion resulting in irregular thinning or
gouging of the tube wall can occur. Figure 14 illustrates this form of localized corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hydrogen damage may occur if the boiler is operated with low-pH water. This may be caused by the ingress of acidic
chemicals from the water treatment facility, a leak in a saline-cooling water condenser, contamination from chemical
cleaning, or other factors that may lower the boiler feedwater pH to less than seven. Close control over boiler water
chemistry and monitoring practices are important factors in preventing hydrogen damage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Boiler tube failures caused by pitting or localized corrosion often result from oxygen attack on the internal side of the
boiler tube. Pitting corrosion of economizer tubing normally results from inadequate oxygen control of the boiler
feedwater. For full protection against oxygen pitting during shutdown, the boiler should be kept full of water treated
with an oxygen scavenger and blanked or capped with nitrogen. Figure 15 illustrates a boiler tube with a through-wall
oxygen pit.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 14—Localized Tubing Wall Loss Caused by Caustic Gouging<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While stress corrosion cracking is usually associated with boilers in which austenitic tubes are used for superheater
and reheater tubing, failures have occurred in ferritic tubes where a desuperheater or attemperator spraying station
introduced high levels of caustic concentration. Stress corrosion cracking of B-7 studs may also occur in areas where
a leaking gasketed joint may allow caustic concentration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 15—Boiler Tube Showing Penetration of the Tube Wall by a Localized Oxygen Pit<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2 External Corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fuel constituents and metal temperatures are important factors in the promotion of fireside corrosion. Fireside
corrosion can be classified as either low-temperature attack or high-temperature oil-ash corrosion. Corrosion may
occur on the flue-gas side of economizer and air preheater tubes. The severity of this corrosion depends on the
amount of sulfur oxides or acid in the fuel burned and on the temperature of the flue gas and of the media being
heated. When sulfur oxides are present in the flue gases, corrosion tends to be severe if the gases cool down to the
dew-point temperature. The gas temperature in economizers and preheaters should be kept above 325 °F (163 °C) to
prevent condensation of corrosive liquid. Actual dew point can be calculated from the flue gas composition and
should be performed for fuels with high sulfur levels. This may be best achieved by designing the tubing and the water
flow in the tubing so that the gas temperatures are controlled as noted in the preceding text.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External corrosion of boiler parts may be expected when boilers are out of service for long periods of time. The
sulfurous acid formed from the reaction of condensed moisture with the sulfur in ash deposits can cause rapid
corrosion of boiler parts. Also, if a unit remains idle for an appreciable length of time, a warm humid atmosphere tends
to corrode boiler parts and supports unless adequate mothballing procedures are followed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3 Creep and Stress Rupture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Overheating is one of the most serious causes of deterioration of boilers. Overheating of the boiler tubes and other
pressure parts may result in oxidation, accelerated corrosion, or failure due to stress rupture. Although overheating
can occur during normal boiler operations, most often it results from abnormal conditions, including loss of coolant
flow or excessive boiler gas temperatures. These abnormal conditions may be caused by inherently faulty circulation
or obstructed circulation resulting from water tubes partly or wholly plugged by sludge or dislodged scale particles.
Over-firing or uneven firing of boiler burners may cause flame impingement, short term overheating, and subsequent
tube failure. The results may be oxidation of the metal, deformation of the pressure parts, and rupture of the parts,
allowing steam and water to escape. Figure 16 and Figure 17 show boiler tubes that have failed due to overheating..<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Boiler tubes may be damaged by poor circulation. Under certain conditions of load and circulation, a tube can become
steam-bound long enough to overheat locally and fail. If circulation is periodically reestablished, the hot portion of the
tube is quenched by relatively cool water. This often causes thermal fatigue cracks that may eventually result in tube
failure. This condition can also result in caustic or chelate corrosion. Steam binding may be caused by the insulating
effect of slag deposits on the outside of the lower part of the tube. This demonstrates the importance of avoiding, as
much as possible, non-uniform slagging of waterwalls. Steam superheaters can become overheated and severely
damaged during start-up if cold boilers are fired at an excessive rate before a sufficient flow of steam is established to
keep the superheaters cool. They can also become overheated if the steam vented from the superheater outlet is not
sufficient to provide steam flow through the superheater during warm-up or low-load operations. The overheating
results in warped tubes and oxidation of the tube metal leading to early tube failure<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The faulty operation of steam-separating devices may result in deposition of boiler water solids in the superheater
tubes with subsequent damage to the tubes from overheating as the deposits impede heat transfer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.4 Mechanical Deterioration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mechanical deterioration of boiler parts can result from a number of causes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) fatigue from repeated expansion and contraction and corrosion-fatigue from the combined action of fatigue and
corrosion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) abnormal stresses created by rapid changes in temperature and pressure, especially in the case of thick-walled
drums;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) improper use of cleaning tools;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) improper use of tube rollers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) settlement of foundations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
excessive external loading from connected piping, wind, earthquake, and similar sources;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) breakage and wear of mechanical parts;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) firebox explosion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
vibration due to improper design or support failure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
improper gaskets that allow steam leaks to score the seating surface; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>k) non-weather-tight casing that allows external tube corrosion during extended shutdowns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If metal is cyclically stressed in operation repeatedly, it can eventually fatigue and may crack under a stress far below
its normal breaking load, as discussed in API 571. The metal in boiler parts may experience expansion and
contraction because of temperature changes involved in taking a boiler out of service and putting it back into service.
Also, expansion and contraction can be caused by the normal temperature fluctuations during operation. Tubes may
also become fatigued as a result of alternate wetting by steam and water that causes fluctuating conditions. If
corrosion acts concurrent with fatigue, the resistance of the metal is reduced because of the corrosion medium and
the corrosion fatigue cracks that develop. When very rapid temperature changes occur in metal parts (especially thick
metal parts), they may be overstressed by the expansion or contraction of the portions of the metal that have changed
in temperature against the portions of the metal that have not changed in temperature. A similar situation exists when
a cold glass tumbler is only partly filled with hot liquid and shatters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

37<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Improperly employed tube cleaners allowed to operate too long in one position may cause damage by cutting
grooves inside the tube. Incorrect or excessive cleaning operations especially utilizing acid based products can lead
to excessive removal of protective oxide films in boiler tubes and may lead to accelerated corrosion upon re-
commissioning. Improper use of tube-rolling tools by under-rolling or over-rolling may cause tube-roll leaks or
damage to the tube ends or tube seats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Deterioration Mechanisms of Other Components<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Non-pressure parts, including refractory linings of heaters, burners, supporting structures, and casings, may also be
damaged from overheating. Usually, such overheating is caused by improper operating conditions or is a result of
deterioration of other protective parts. For example, if the refractory lining of a heater is permitted to deteriorate from
normal wear, erosion, spalling, or mechanical damage, it no longer can protect the outer heater casing and structural
supports adequately, and such parts may in turn begin to deteriorate rapidly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2 Tube Hangers and Supports<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hangers and supports are made from heat resistant alloys chosen for their high-temperature strength, creep
properties, and resistance to corrosion. Most of this hardware is originally made from castings although wrought
materials tend to be installed for replacements due to good availability of plate and bars. The form of the material, cast
vs. wrought, and the grade of material influence the deterioration mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tube hangers and supports deteriorate for several reasons including stress and creep rupture, mechanical damage,
corrosion and poor quality castings. Similar to previous discussions about stress and creep rupture of tubes, hangers
and supports fail from an excessive combination of stress and temperature. Components made from a casting
generally have better stress rupture and creep properties than the wrought equivalent. Therefore, extra attention
should be given to those wrought components. Especially vulnerable are those fabricated for an unplanned
replacement of a cast component. Corrosion of the supports and rods can reduce the cross-section enough to elevate
the stress level to promote failure. Corrosion can occur from high-temperature oxidation, fuel ash, and acid attack
(during turndown). Oxidation can be avoided by proper alloy selection. Fuel ash and acid turndown attack from sulfur
in deposits can be severe depending on the fuel quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mechanical damage from vibration in service or mechanical impact during maintenance work can crack the
components. Castings are particularly susceptible to mechanical impact damage since they tend to have poor
resistance to impact loads. In addition, some alloys can change metallurgically from long-term exposure at elevated
temperatures to become brittle at room temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Poor casting quality can be the root cause for premature failures. Casting defects like voids and cracks can initiate
failure from other mechanisms like stress rupture or mechanical damage. These cast components do not usually
receive significant inspection after casting. Some purchasers have found it necessary to require supplemental
radiographic inspection to assure themselves of acceptable components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.3 Casing and Structural Steel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosive agents are produced in the combustion of fuels that contain sulfur. Deterioration from sulfur can occur on
cold steelwork when it has been exposed to the heater gases as a result of deterioration of the refractory or insulating
linings or if a heater is operated under a positive pressure. It is imperative that the outer casing of heaters be
maintained in a tight condition. When flue gases are permitted to permeate to the atmosphere at various locations,
they deposit sulfurous acid on the casing and metal parts that are below the dew point. Such deposits are acidic,
accelerating corrosion of the casing and the refractory supports. Figure 18 illustrates dew point corrosion of a header
box. Most fired heaters are designed to operate at negative pressure. Operation at positive pressure results in flue
gas leakage and shell corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The rate of deterioration caused by climatic conditions primarily depends on whether the atmosphere is dry, humid, or
salty and on the industrial fumes that may be present. Deterioration resulting from a humid atmosphere may not be
due to geographic location but may be the result of the location of the heater within the refinery. Locations near
cooling ponds or towers when the prevailing winds are toward the heater may cause deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The types of deterioration resulting from climatic conditions are rusting of exposed or unpainted steelwork, general
deterioration of painted surfaces, and erosion and further deterioration of the external housing of a heater. If the
external housing is allowed to deteriorate, rain or other moisture can enter the openings and deteriorate the internal
refractory, insulation, and steelwork, especially when the heater is out of service for any reason (see API 571).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4 Firebox and Ductwork Liners<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Firing conditions and heater temperature are the main causes of deterioration of the materials that form the internal
lining of the heater. The severity of the deterioration varies with the heater temperature, which in turn is determined by
the process operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of the internal materials, including refractory or insulating linings, is to provide heat protection to the
structural steel framing, roof structures, and tube sheets, and to improve the thermal efficiency of the heater. At high
temperatures, refractory can deteriorate after long-term exposure by spalling, failure of the binding material, melting,
and loss of structural strength. When the insulating value of refractory or insulating material is reduced, the supporting
steel is subjected to high temperatures and may deteriorate rapidly as a result of oxidation, scaling, and possible
metallurgical changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fluxing may occur when fuel ash and refractory are in contact at a moderately high temperature, producing a slag
that may be fluid. Metal oxides, including those of vanadium, molybdenum, and sodium, are fluxing agents. At least
three deteriorating actions of this slag formation can be recognized:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  Melting . The flux melts at a lower temperature; thereby, causing the refractory to become liquid and flow, which
reduces the refractory thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  Penetration . The flux can penetrate into the sound refractory; thereby, compromising its properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  Chemical action . The flux can react with the refractory and chemically degrade it much like metal thickness being
reduced by corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The general effects of slagging are to decrease the thickness and to reduce the insulating effect of the refractory;
thereby, allowing a high metal temperature on the supporting steel parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.5 Structures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Foundation settlement may be a serious cause of deterioration in boilers because of the severe stress that may be
set up in the complicated interconnection of parts, in the external piping, and especially in the refractory linings and
baffling. Excessive loads on the boiler by the connection of large pipe lines may cause damage to the boiler
foundation and pressure parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Settlement of foundations may also result from heat transmission from the firebox and subsequent drying of the soil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In zones with seismic activity, earthquakes may cause severe damage. The damage can be somewhat similar to that
caused by foundation settlement and may be particularly severe to refractory linings. Not only can refractory linings
be affected but internal, firebrick gravity walls (also known as bridgewalls or centerwalls) may also be damaged and
should be inspected. Vibrations from high and moderate winds, earthquakes, burner operating instability, and high
flue-gas flow across tube banks can damage various parts of boilers as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) stacks may be so damaged that they overturn;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) air and flue-gas ductwork may be damaged, resulting in cracks at corners or connections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) expansion joints may crack;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>e) piping and tubing may be overstressed and fail; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
anchor bolts of stacks may be overstressed and fail.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7 Frequency and Timing of Inspections<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The first inspection of a heater or boiler is necessary to confirm the anticipated rate of deterioration and to identify any
unanticipated deterioration. Typically, a comparison is made with the initial inspection at the time of construction and
with design records that detail considerations of corrosion, erosion, and other factors. The first inspection also helps
to maintain the safety and efficiency of continued operation and forecast maintenance and replacements, based on
the indicated deterioration rate. In the same way, all subsequent inspections are compared with the preceding
inspection of the same specific purpose. The determination of the physical condition and the rates and causes of
deterioration in the various parts makes it possible to schedule repairs or replacements prior to compromising
mechanical integrity and resulting failure. Many of the parts that make up a boiler or fired heater depend on some
other part, and when deterioration and serious weakening occur in one part, some other part may become
unprotected or overstressed, which can shorten service life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Boiler Inspection Frequency<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The interval between boiler inspections is typically set by the jurisdiction in most U.S. states and some provinces of
Canada. In jurisdictions or countries that have no such laws, the inspection interval may be set by the insurance
carrier insuring the boiler. Otherwise, external and internal inspections should be scheduled periodically considering,
at a minimum, the age of equipment, conditions of operation, type of equipment, kind of fuels fired, method of water
treatment, previous inspection results, and deterioration rate and remaining life of boiler tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Heater Inspection Frequency<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heater reliability often depends on periodic internal inspections and routine, on-stream monitoring and inspection.
Typically, heaters are an integral section of a process unit such that internal inspection can only be accommodated
during unit outages. However, the length of time between internal inspections should consider the historical and
predicted deterioration rates for components (including the impact of any process change), the historical inspection
findings, the results of on-stream monitoring and inspection, previous maintenance activities and their quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar information can be inputted into a risk assessment that considers the probability of failure and the
consequence of failure. The inspection strategy and interval could be modified by a risk assessment. Additional
information on risk-based inspection can be found in API 580. Routine, on-stream monitoring and inspection is a
necessary component for improved reliability. Some common on-stream inspections include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) visual inspection of the firebox and in particular burner flame patterns by operations personnel on a routine basis;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) installation and monitoring of tubeskin thermocouples for tube metal temperatures;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) periodic infrared inspection of tubes for “hot spots”, heater ducts, and air preheater casings to determine if
refractory or insulation degradation has occurred; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) tell-tale” holes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8 Safety Precautions, Preparatory Work, and Cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety precautions shall be taken before any heater, boiler, flue duct, or stack is entered. In general, these
precautions include but may not be limited to isolating energy sources, lock-out-tag-out, atmospheric gas checks and
reduction of confined space temperatures before entering. Dust and acid-containing material on internal surfaces are
to be expected. The problem they present may be complicated if fuel-oil additives that leave toxic residues have been
used. Protective equipment should be made available and used until it has been determined that safe conditions
exist. When vanadium dust is present, protective apparatus and clothing should be used when internal inspections
are performed. Consult all applicable common site-specific, OSHA and other federal, local, and state safety rules and
regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 General Preparatory Work<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before the inspection, the tools needed for inspection should be checked for availability, proper working condition,
and accuracy. This includes tools and equipment that are needed for personnel safety. Safety signs should be
provided where needed before work is started. The following tools are needed to inspect fired heaters and stacks:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   When selecting products that can be used to mark or applied to stainless steel tubes, these products shall not contain
chlorides to prevent stress corrosion cracking. Additionally, any equipment or paint that may contact the stainless steel tube
surfaces should not be made or coated with aluminum, zinc, lead, and cadmium to prevent liquid metal embrittlement concerns.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other related equipment that may be provided for inspection includes planking, scaffold material, a bosun’s chair, and
portable ladders. If external scaffolding is required, it may be possible to erect it before the unit is shut down.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before the inspection is started, all persons working around a fired heater or boiler, flue duct, or stack should be
informed that people may be working on the inside. A safety guard (“hole watch”) should be stationed at the
inspection door of the equipment being inspected. This person can serve as a guard and can also record data from
the inspection findings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Personnel working inside this equipment should be informed when any work is going to be done on the outside so
that any unexpected noise does not cause needless alarm. Vibration of the tubes and the setting should be minimized
while internal inspection work is being performed to prevent injuries due to the dislodging of loose refractory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3 Precautions To Avoid Polythionic Acid Stress Corrosion Cracking In Stainless Steel Tubes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Polythionic acid stress corrosion cracking (PASCC) on austenitic stainless steel is a phenomenon that may occur on
the external surface of tubes during downtime under the conditions listed in 6.1.9. For heaters with stainless steel
tubes, an evaluation should be made to determine their susceptibility to internal and external PASCC. If deemed
necessary, specific steps should be taken to prevent cracking during downtime. These procedures are detailed in
6.1.9 and in NACE RP 0170. When using a soda ash wash solution to externally protect tubes, care should be taken
to protect any ceramic fiber insulation from becoming wetted as the fiber can sag under the weight of the absorbed
liquid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4 Cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.1 External Cleaning—Heater Tubes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubes may be externally cleaned by various methods. The specific method is usually determined by the accessibility
of the tubes and the purpose for which they are to be cleaned. Readily accessible tubes may be cleaned by wire
brushing or grit blasting. Grit blasting is preferred if defects are suspected and a close inspection is required, since all
deposits can be removed and the bare metal exposed. Refractory should be protected from grit blasting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All radiant surfaces should be cleaned. Cleaning only a portion of the radiant surfaces may promote overheating of
the cleaned surfaces. Scaled or fouled surfaces may obstruct heat transfer and cause the clean surfaces to absorb
more heat. Usually, it is physically impossible to clean the economizer or convection tubes by wire brushing or grit
blasting because of tube arrangement. Other methods (i.e. the use of a steam lance or a stream from a water hose or
high-pressure water equipment) may be used. In such instances, cleaning is performed primarily to remove external
deposits and improve the heat transfer. Before resorting to steam or water cleaning of the tubes, careful consideration
should be given to possible damage to the refractory insulation and brickwork, particularly in a service where a fuel
with a high sulfur content is used. In addition, for stainless steel tubes, consider using a soda ash solution as detailed
in 6.1.9 and maintaining the chloride content of the water at less than 50 ppm. These should minimize potential stress
corrosion cracking of the tubes from cleaning operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.2 Internal Cleaning—Heater Tubes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heater tubes may require periodic cleaning to remove internal fouling and coking deposits. These deposits can be
detrimental to heater performance and reliability. Tubes and fittings usually require cleaning when deposits cause an<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_51>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
43<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>increase in coil pressure drop, an increase in firing rate to maintain the desired coil outlet temperature, a decrease in
coil outlet temperature, or tube hot spots.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal cleaning of heater tubes may be accomplished by several methods (i.e. gas oil circulation, chemical cleaning,
steam-air decoking, thermal spalling, mechanical pigging, hydroblasting, and abrasive grit). These methods are
typically performed off-line, although some heater arrangements can allow on-line thermal or steam spalling. The
effectiveness of each method to remove deposits varies with the deposit type. For instance, circulating gas oil prior to
steaming and water wash can be an effective cleaner for soft deposits dissolved by gas oil. However, it may not be
effective in removing heavy coke deposits. Therefore, when selecting a cleaning method, the nature of the deposit in
addition to safety, potential risk of damage, allotted time, and cost should be considered. In addition to potential
damage from the particular technique, cleaning can cause leaks in the tube rolls or header plugs of removable
headers from thermal forces or the removal of coke. Chemical cleaning consists of circulating an inhibited acid or
other proprietary chemical cleaner through the coil until all deposits have been softened and removed. Water washing
to flush all deposits from the coil usually follows this method. When the tubes are made of austenitic stainless steel,
the chloride content of the water used for flushing should be maintained at less than 50 ppm. Consider using a soda
ash solution as detailed in 6.1.9 for cleaning stainless steel tubes. Care should be used in chemical cleaning to avoid
corrosion damage to the tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>High-pressure water jet blasting is another option for cleaning tubing with plug-type fittings. Other cleaning options for
welded coils include mechanical decoking pigs (see Figure 19), and abrasive blasting (shot blasting or sand jet
blasting) with metal shot or an abrasive medium.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 19—Mechanical Decoking Pig<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steam-air decoking consists of the use of steam, air, and heat to burn the coke out of the tube. Only trained,
experienced personnel should use this cleaning method, because improper procedures or control could result in
overheating the tubes and supports causing serious, costly damage to the heater. Steam-air decoking may not
always remove the coke from a heater fitting. If this is the case, it may be necessary to use mechanical cutters on the
U-bends and remove them for cleaning; however, this is an expensive and destructive method of cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermal spalling is a technique that uses alternating heating and cooling to spall coke off the tube wall. Steam is often
used as the process medium to control heating and cooling. Care should be exercised with this technique for the coke
particles removed from the wall have caused localized erosion damage of return bends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_52>>

API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Abrasive pigs can be used to clean tubes mechanically. The technique involves propelling a pig equipped with metal
appendices through the tubes with water. The pig is sent back and forth through the tubes and deposits are removed
much like using a wire brush to clean a surface. This technique often involves some modifications to heater piping to
create a location to launch and receive the pigs. An advantage of abrasive pigs is that they are less likely to damage
the tubes than other techniques (i.e. steam-air decoke and acid cleaning). Care should be taken to assure the
abrasive pig does not gouge tube walls. The presence of plug fitting style tube return bends (e.g. “mule-ears” or “plug
headers”) have historically challenged the cleaning effectiveness of abrasive pigs. Also, pigs are generally unable to
navigate without damage through most plug header style return bends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Various types of tube knockers and cutters are available for the mechanical cleaning of tubes. Selection of the type of
cleaning head is a matter of preference. An air motor usually drives the cutting head. In cold weather, steam is often
used for motive power to warm the tube and reduce the effect of shock on the tube. Mechanical cleaning cannot be
used to clean the U-bends of sectional fittings. When mechanical cleaners are used, care has to be exercised to
avoid damage to the tubes or fittings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.4.3 Internal Cleaning-—Boilers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steam-drum internals and the ID surface of the drum should be inspected before washing to determine any problems,
including poor circulation, poor water quality, and low steam purity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inside of shells, drums, and tubes should then be washed down thoroughly to remove mud, loose scale, or
similar deposits before they dry and become more difficult to remove. The washing operation should be carried out
from above if possible to carry the material downward to the blowoff or handholes. A hose with sufficient water
pressure or hand tools should be used to remove soft scale and sludge. The blow-off line should be disconnected
prior to the washing procedure to keep mud and scale out of the blowdown drum. The tubes of horizontal-return-tube
boilers should be washed from below and above. It is especially important to ensure that all tubes and headers are
clear of sludge after the wash is completed. Water should be passed down each individual tube and observed to exit
from below. Each header should be opened sufficiently to give clear view so that it can be ascertained that all sludge
has been removed. Precautions should be taken to ensure that the water does not come into contact with the
brickwork of the combustion chamber. If contact cannot be avoided, the brickwork should be dried out carefully when
the boiler is fired up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of an inhibited acid solution on the inside of the boiler is a common method of cleaning the interior surfaces.
Prior to cleaning, samples of sludge and deposits should be analyzed to ensure the cleaning solution can adequately
remove the material. During the cleaning operation, corrosion probes and coupons are often used to monitor the
corrosivity of the circulating solution. After acid cleaning, the interior of the boiler has to be neutralized, washed down,
and refilled with water. If a nitrogen purge is used after acid cleaning, drums should be checked for oxygen content
before entry. Acid cleaning should not be used on superheaters or other equipment that contains pockets that cannot
be thoroughly flushed out. Precautions should be taken to make sure that all sludge is removed after an acid wash.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is normal practice to fill pendent-type superheaters with condensate or demineralized water and to keep the
superheater full of this water while the remainder of the boiler is acid cleaned. During chemical cleaning, all phases of
the operation should be closely supervised by experienced, responsible individuals. During chemical cleaning, all
electric power and other ignition sources in the near boiler have to be turned off to prevent explosion of the hydrogen
and other hazardous gases that are normally given off during the cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another common method of cleaning uses chelates. The chelates are added to the boiler water, and the boiler is fired
to create circulation that facilitates cleaning of the internal surfaces. Insufficient removal of chelates after cleaning is a
common cause of boiler tube cracking and subsequent failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of boilers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

criteria and considerations to mitigate deterioration mechanisms. In preparation for maintenance outages, on-stream
inspections should be considered in advance to facilitate defining the appropriate outage worklist (see 11.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.2 Visual Inspection of Heater Coils<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The entire heating coil should be given a thorough visual inspection. Visual inspection is a fundamental technique to
help identify the effects of deterioration, actual defects, and an indication of potential defects or weaknesses in the
tubes, crossovers, fittings, and connections, including blowdown, steam, pressure gauge, vents, and thermowell
connections. Conditions found by visual examination are typically followed by a more detailed inspection to assess
the degree of deterioration. It provides means to focus inspection efforts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 20—Bulged Tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 21—Bulged and Split Tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All tubes rolled into fittings should be examined for leakage in the rolled joint. Leaks in tube rolls and around plugs can
often be found by observing the location of coke or oily deposits around headers when the heater is removed from
service. An examination should also be made when the coil is under test pressure. The inspection should be visual
and should in some cases be supplemented by feeling the tube at the rear face of the fitting for indications of leakage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Visual inspection can sometimes be facilitated by holding a small mirror between the tube sheet and the fitting to
obtain a view of the juncture between the tube and the fitting. Roll leaks may not become detectable until a coil has
been under pressure for 10 min to 15 min. Leakage in the tube rolls can be either a nuisance or a serious problem,
depending on the process and the operating conditions of the heater. Where there is no formation of coke, the leak
may be stopped by rerolling the tube. Roll leakage is serious; however, in the case of a heater that is subject to coking
and that operates at high pressure-temperature conditions or in poisonous or highly explosive vapor service,
including phenol or hydrogen service. Oil leaking between the fitting and the outside surface of the tube can result in
the formation of coke. This coke formation continues with service and the force of the coke buildup can be sufficient to
cause partial collapse of the tube end and to allow the tube to slip in the fitting. Under these conditions, leakage
cannot be corrected by rerolling because the serration in the fitting’s tube seat is full of coke and the mechanical
strength of the rolled joint is not improved by the rerolling operation. Figure 26 shows an example of a fitting and a
tube that have leaked in the roll.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of rolled-on fittings, the internal surface should be inspected visually for signs of deterioration and to
ascertain the fittings’ general physical condition. With sectional, streamlined fittings, the housing section (the part the
tube is rolled in) should be examined for undercutting, the width and condition of the U-bend seats, and excessive
erosion and thinning of the housing in the annular space (the section of the housing between the end of the tube and
the inside edge of the U-bend seat). The inside surfaces of the U-bend should be examined for thinning and to
ascertain their general condition. With solid fittings, the body section should be examined for undercutting, the width
and condition of the plug seat, and erosion and thinning of the barrel section of the body (the cylindrical section with
the plug seat at one end and the tube seat at the other end) and the cross port (the connecting section between the
two barrel sections).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 26—Fitting and Tube that Have Leaked in the Roll<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 27 is a sectional view of a streamlined fitting. It shows the severe corrosion/erosion that can occur in the
annular space and at the inside edge of the U-bend seat. The seating face on U-bends and plugs should be
examined for corrosion, and the width of the seat should be checked against the width of the seat in the housing or
body sections. If there is not a tight fit between the U-bends and the housing for the entire width of the seating surface
or if the width of the seating surface is longer on one member, member erosion can be severe. This same condition
should be checked on solid fittings at the closure area between the fitting body and the plug. Fittings should be
examined to determine the fit and depth of seating between the U-bend or plug and the main body of the fitting. If the
fitting seat has become enlarged through service, the U-bend or plug can protrude so deeply into the fitting that it is
not possible to head up and get a tight joint when the fitting is under pressure. In the case of a sectional fitting, the end
of the U-bend has to contact the end of the tube or the tube stop, depending on the type of tube seat used. In the case
of a solid fitting, the ears on the plug have to contact the outside face of the fitting. Figure 28 shows an example of the
type of corrosion experienced in U-bends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some cases, a rolled-in tube may also be welded to the fitting. The two basic reasons for welding a tube to the
fitting are to stop leakage by means of a seal weld and to improve the efficiency of the rolled joint by means of a
strength weld. The use of a strength weld warrants careful consideration and justification. The types of defects that
are commonly found are cracking, slag, and porosity in the weld. Any welding between the tube and the fitting,
regardless of its basic purpose, should be examined carefully. Review by a materials or welding engineer is
recommended before any welding to the tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The exterior surfaces of the fitting body and the holding members should be inspected visually. The types of
deterioration commonly found on the external surface of fittings are cracking, distortion, and mechanical wear.
Cracking is usually confined to the fitting body or, in the case of welded fittings, to the welded joint. Locations in the
fitting body that should be examined for cracking include the area around the plug or U-bend seat, the juncture of an
ear or horseshoe holding section and the main body, and the ear or horseshoe section itself. If conditions warrant, a
visual inspection of cracks can be supplemented by a range of applicable surface, near surface or volumetric NDT
techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Visual inspection of the ears, the holding members, and the dogs and caps of the holding members is performed
primarily to detect distortion and wear to determine whether there is a proper fit or contact and to ascertain whether
the strength of the fitting has been affected. Figure 29 shows an example of poor fit between the holding section and
the cap on a solid fitting. The threaded portion of the holding screw and the dog or cap should be examined for
excessive wear. Distortion that is not apparent to the eye may prevent proper assembly. The plug or U-bend seat in
the fitting should be examined for enlargement, deviations from roundness, change in the width of the seat, and
damage to the seating surfaces. The tightness of this joint depends on these four conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For welded fittings, visual inspection is limited to the external surfaces and to the weld attaching the fitting to the tube.
The accessible external surfaces of the fitting should be examined closely for any indications of defects, particularly
cracks in welds. The inspection of welds should cover a band of 1 in. to 2 in. (2.5 cm to 5 cm) on each side of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>weld. Cracks may develop and remain entirely within the weld, or they may start in the weld and run out into the tube
or fitting. The inspection of the heat-affected zone and adjacent parent metal is important, especially in the case of
alloy welding. The visual inspection of a weld may be supplemented by a range of applicable surface, near surface or
volumetric NDT techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cross-over sections of tubing used to connect sections of coil may be located outside of the firebox or enclosure but
should not be overlooked during inspection of the heater. Movement of the several parts of the coil and changes in
temperature can cause stress and fatigue. The surfaces of the tubing, especially bend section surfaces, should be
examined for cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3 Wall Thickness Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The determination of the wall thickness of the tubes and fittings in a heater is an essential part of inspection. Thinning
deterioration mechanisms can be identified and monitored through wall thickness measurements. The two basic
approaches used to determine the wall thickness of piping and tubes are the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Nondestructive methods. These include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>2) measurement of inside and outside diameter, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) measurement by means of radiation-type instruments or radiography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Destructive methods. One destructive method is removal of a tube or tube section deep in convection banks and
inaccessible for direct measurement of the tube wall. However, with the availability of internal ultrasonic-based
intelligent pigs to measure wall thickness, the need for destructive examination is lessened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Condition monitoring locations (CMLs) should be selected to provide a means to determine the deterioration extent
and to determine the deterioration rate. This usually involves, as a minimum, placing CMLs on all tube passes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_62>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>54
API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>throughout the firebox. Particular attention should be made to tubes where phase changes occur and where the
highest tube metal temperatures are expected. In addition, CMLs should be located on return bends to assess their
deterioration. Note that the required thickness for a fitting may be different than that for the tube. For example, the
inside radius of a short-radius return bend can have a higher required thickness. Typically, the number of tube
thickness points is determined by criteria like a minimum of three points per tube or readings every 5 ft to 6 ft (1.5 m to
1.8 m). Often clean, corrosion-free services require fewer measurements, while high-corrosion services require more
measurement points. Although spot thickness readings can identify general thinning, obtaining thickness in a
circumferential band is a better approach to identify any localized conditions like corrosion grooving. Thickness
measurements should be documented and monitored where bulging, sagging and bowing is observed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Thickness measurements should be recorded and compared to historical readings in the same locations. These wall
thicknesses provide a record of the amount of thickness lost, the rate of loss, the remaining corrosion allowance, the
adequacy of the remaining thickness for the operating conditions, and the expected rate of loss during the next
operating period.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measuring and recording the thickness of tubes and fittings when they are newly installed is considered important. If
this is not done, the first inspection period may not accurately reflect actual corrosion rates. If the installed thickness of
the tubes is not available at the time of the first inspection, corrosion loss is usually determined on the assumption that
the wall thickness of the new tubes was exactly as specified on the purchase order. If this assumption is incorrect, an
error in the calculation of corrosion rate may result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ultrasonic method for obtaining tube-wall thickness is the most commonly used method. For most corrosion
inspections, straight-beam ultrasonic techniques are used. The sound is introduced perpendicular to the entrance
surface and reflects from the back surface, which is usually parallel to the entrance surface. Proper cleaning of the
external oxidation or compensating for the thickness of the oxide layer is essential to properly assess metal loss rates.
In many cases, cleaning the oxide may be the only viable way to acquire ultrasonic thickness measurements from the
tube’s exterior surface. Application of internal ultrasonic based intelligent pigs do not require removal of external oxide
layers when measuring base metal wall thickness. These systems are described in 9.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other methods to assess thinning of tubes include local area scanning with electromagnetic acoustic transducer
(EMAT) devices and global-tube length inspection using ultrasonic guided ultrasonic wave devices. These methods
are quick screening methods that highlight thinning that might be missed with spot thickness readings. In the first of
these methods, the transducer compares a sample area of known thickness with the same material properties as the
tube being examined and then either a hand-held or an automated crawler head is used to scan the tube areas from
the OD. If a thin area is detected, follow-up inspection using spot ultrasonic or radiographic inspection is necessary. In
the second method known as guided wave, an acoustic wave is introduced into the pipe that travels along the length
of the tube. Defective areas as well as welds send back signals to a receiver that are analyzed to determine if flaws
exist and at what length along the tube based on time and velocity. Then follow-up inspection using spot ultrasonic or
radiographic methods is necessary to confirm whether or not flaws truly exist at the identified locations. Although
guided wave ultrasonic’s do not give thickness measurements of flaws detected, it is valuable in evaluating lengths of
tubes where spot examination for localized corrosion may be prohibitive based on the amount of measurements that
may otherwise be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each of the methods to determine wall thickness including measuring the inside and outside diameters of tubes,
measuring by means of ultrasonic, laser or electromagnetic instruments, and measuring by means of radiation-type
instruments or radiography can be used to check the thickness of heater tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Electromagnetic techniques cover a broad range of applications including eddy currents, remote field eddy currents
and magnetic flux leakage. Each technique has its own benefits and limitations. Remote field eddy current is
commonly used on ferromagnetic tubes. It has benefits in that it can measure wall thickness and provides indications
of other defect mechanisms (i.e. cracking). Most of these techniques are applied using an electromagnetic sensor
device that is drawn through the ID of the tube that may require cutting the tube U-bends at the ends to gain access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.4 Tube Diameter, Circumference, Sag, and Bow Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubes sustaining creep and stress rupture damage can exhibit diametral growth or sagging. Shining a flashlight along
the tube length can be a quick way to identify major bulges, sags and bows. Use of ultrasonic-based intelligent pigs
can also provide diametral growth measurements throughout the full coil length. The systems are described in 9.6.
Frequently, the diametral growth can be localized to a small section of the tube and appear as a bulge. The bulge may
be limited to the hot face of the tube and, therefore, may not be a uniform circumferential growth. Diametral growth
occurs from the operating hoop stresses. Localized bulging can result from internal coke deposits causing the wall
temperature to become excessive. Another potential cause is flame impingement that can elevate temperatures. It is
not uncommon to find evidence of both occurrences since the elevated temperatures can promote coking in some
hydrocarbon services. The amount of bulging provides an indication of the extent of damage up to the point of failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tube diameter or circumferential measurements provide an indication of the amount of damage. These
measurements can be compared to original measurements to determine the amount of bulging and is often
presented as a percentage growth/bulge. Measurements of the circumference can be made with a narrow tape
measure often referred to as external “strapping”. This method is limited only to sections of coil that are readily
accessible. Other techniques include tube gauges calibrated to specified diameters to determine growth or are set to
specific percentage growth and used as “pass-fail” gauges. Tube gauges can be fabricated from thin stainless steel
plate (0.10 in. to 0.125 in. [0.25 cm to 0.32 cm]). The cutout dimension is the sum of tube OD, mill out of round
tolerance per ASTM-530 (approximately 0.0625 in. [0.16 cm]), and creep/stress rupture growth. Typical gauges are
made for 2 %, 5 %, and 10 % diametral growth. These measurement techniques may not be precise if the tube is
heavily scaled. In these instances, the growth may appear more severe if the scale is not removed. One may increase
the tolerance of the tube gauge to account for some scale thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At plugged headers where access to the tube ID is available, many types of calipers are available for measuring the
inside diameters of heater tubes, including the simple 36 in. (91.4 cm) mechanical scissors and the 2-point pistol type,
the cone or piston type, and the 4-12-point electric type. A caliper equipped to measure several diameters around the
circumference of a tube is most likely to find the actual maximum inside diameter. Ultrasonic-based intelligent pigging
that operates with the ultrasonic transducers off of the surface (immersion method) can also be utilized to acquire
inside diameter of heater tubes. A large amount of data is acquired over the full coil length with this method, enabling
the entire coil to be modeled in a 3-dimensional color format, illustrating any damage patterns that may be present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is general practice to caliper the inside diameter of a tube at two locations: in the roll and in back of the roll. Since an
increase in internal diameter may not be uniform throughout the length of the tube because of erosion, erratic
corrosion, bulging, or mechanical damage while cleaning, it is advisable to take several measurements to determine
the worst section of each tube. On heaters where the pattern of corrosion is uniform and well established and
mechanical damage is known not to exist, measurements for approximately 36 in. (91.4 cm) into the tube may suffice.
The roll section of a tube in service should be calipered to locate the maximum inside diameter at any point between
the back edge of the tube flare or the end of the tube if there is no tube flare, and the rear face of the fitting or edge of
shoulder left in the tube by the rolling tool.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are also laser-based profilometry systems that can measure tube inside diameter along the tube length. These
devices offer high accuracy but require clean and dry conditions to provide consistent results. These systems are
described in 9.6. Thinning at the ends of rolled-in tubes is usually caused by erosion or turbulence that results from
change in the flow direction. This type of thinning may also result from frequent rerolling of tubes to stop leakage.
Figure 30 shows an example of a tube damaged by a cleaning head. In some cases, the outside diameter of the tube
may be increased and will have the same general appearance as a tube with a slight bulge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 31 shows an example of eccentric corrosion of a tube. The loss of wall thickness is not uniform around the
circumference. In this type of deterioration, the most thinning usually occurs on the fireside of the tube. This type of
corrosion is generally accelerated on the fireside because of the high metal temperature there. Eccentric corrosion
may also be caused by external scaling. It is often difficult to determine whether tubes have become eccentric as a
result of service, because the condition is not readily detectable by visual inspection of the tube ends. An indication of
eccentric corrosion can sometimes be found by measuring the diameter in several directions at one location. A<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 30—Tube Damage Caused by Mechanical Cleaning Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>reliable means of detection is to measure thickness with ultrasonic-type, laser-type, or radiographic-type instruments,
but these tools can only be used on accessible tubes, usually the radiant tubes. Ultrasonic-based intelligent pigging
can be applied to quickly detect and quantify eccentric corrosion damage throughout the convection, cross-over and
radiant tubes. Although this type of corrosion is more common on radiant tubes, it has occurred on convection tubes,
usually on those tubes adjacent to the refractory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 31—Eccentric Corrosion of a Tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specialized ultrasonic and eddy current liftoff devices on crawlers can measure the circumference and diameter of
tubes. These specialized external tube crawlers are commonly used when inspecting steam methane reformer tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tube sagging is another indication of creep damage or short-term overload. Except in this case, the stresses are
longitudinal and usually result from inadequate support or excessive temperature. Excessive sagging is often caused
by short term overheating because of runaway decoking or loss of flow. In such cases, the tubes should be hardness
checked to insure adequate strength remains and the thickness should be measured. If sagging is caused by long-
term creep, a criterion (i.e. 1 % to 5 % elongation) should be used depending on the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
57<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tube sags are estimated as the distance offset from straight. In reality, the tube is flexible and can have some natural
amount of sag and so the measurement may not be precise. Sag measurements can be used similar to diameter
measurements to estimate the extent of creep. A significant amount of sag can be tolerated before rupture is a
concern and so this condition is not considered serious unless it prevents cleaning or causes headers to jam and
wedge against other headers or against the sides of the header compartment. In convection sections, sagging of the
tubes in upper rows to a point between those in lower rows can prevent the free passage of flue gas around the tubes.
This condition (called nesting) may cause overheating of adjacent tubes and draft loss. If this condition is found, the
offending tubes should be replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.5 Pit Depth Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>General pitting of the external tube surface should be evaluated with a pit depth gauge to assess the depth and to
estimate a pitting rate. The gauge should be used in conjunction with an ultrasonic thickness gauge to more
accurately determine remaining wall thickness. Scale on the tubes can mask pits and so it is prudent to remove scale
in selected areas to find the deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6 Intelligent Pigs and In-line Inspection Devices<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recent technological advances have produced “intelligent pigs” that can perform multiple inspection functions from
inside of the tube. These devices utilize immersion-based ultrasonics to measure tube inside diameters in both ferritic
and austenitic heater tube coils. Simultaneously, the same ultrasonic transducers measure the tube wall thickness.
The instruments are outfitted with multiple ultrasonic transducers or a rotating mirror to permit high density sampling.
These inspection tools are useful in addressing creep, corrosion, erosion or pitting-type damage mechanisms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These devices are suitable for welded carbon and stainless steel convection section, radiant section, and cross-over
piping coils. Radiant section coils with radial insert plug headers can also be inspected using these devices. These
devices are not suitable for cast materials or radiant section coils with flat insert plug headers. Though no scaffolding
is required to utilize these devices, intelligent pigs operate in a bidirectional mode and require only a single point of
entry to the coil’s ID to launch and receive the intelligent pig.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some intelligent pig designs are capable of inspecting heater coils with changing diameters. Prior to inspection of
multi-diameter coils, it should be verified that the working diameter range of the intelligent pig covers the range of
diameters for the heater coil. It may be possible to inspect the heater coil utilizing multiple intelligent pigs when the
diameter range of the coil exceeds the working range of the intelligent pig. In addition to verifying the working
diameter range, the owner-user should confirm with the service provider or equipment manufacturer that the
intelligent pig is capable of measuring the thickness range that exists in the heater coil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Intelligent pigs are self-contained units and are capable of navigating the short radius 180 °  x 1D U-bends (see
Fig. 32). This is a significant advantage for inspection of convective section tubes that cannot be accessed. Generally,
convective tubes only receive a rudimentary visual inspection and their condition is estimated from inspections
performed on other components of the heater like the convective tube U-bends and radiant tubes. The pigs are
propelled through the tubes using a liquid medium (i.e. water, soda ash solution, diesel, glycol) to act as both couplant
and hydraulic vehicle and allow a thorough, complete inspection of a tube pass. The pig also contains axial
positioning capabilities that enables precise location of the damage mechanism to be identified. Users are cautioned
to understand the capability of the intelligent pig to accurately measure the wall thickness and tube inside diameter of
U-bends and other fittings. The complex geometry of these locations can make conventional inspection practices
difficult.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other technological advances for in-line devices have produced various other pig or crawler technologies. One
method is an internal ultrasonic pig that uses an internal rotary inspection system. The pig is designed to maneuver
around bends being pushed along by motive water force. The device has a spinning ultrasonic immersion transducer
(i.e. a transducer aimed at an angled-spinning tungsten mirror used for reflection or a specially designed membrane
that allows transmission and protects an angled spinning centrally located transducer head). This method is accurate
if there is no debris or scale on the tube ID and should accurately determine the extent of ID and OD corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.7 Radiographic Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiographic examination is often employed to measure tube wall thickness and identify the presence and thickness
of internal coke deposits. Radiography can show a variation in thickness of a minimum of 2 % of total thickness.
Thickness is determined by directing the rays tangentially to the tube wall and recording the radiation on a film behind
the tube. By comparing with some geometric standard projected on the film, the wall thickness can be determined.
Performing radiography at various angles to the tube allows wall thickness measurements in other planes.
Additionally, localized thin areas can often be identified by radiography that could be missed by other techniques
(i.e. spot ultrasonic readings). For example, radiography is often employed to identify wall loss on return bends in
erosive service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.8 Borescope and Videoprobe<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The internal visual inspection of heater tubes is limited to heaters with fittings of the removable U-bend or plug type.
On tubes up to about 30 ft (9 m) in length, it is possible to view the entire interior reasonably well if a light is inserted at
the end opposite the one at which the tube is being examined and the examination is made from both ends of the
tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inside surface of a tube can be examined with optical instruments. Considerable time is required to inspect the
full length of tube. Consequently, optical instruments are generally used for the more thorough inspection of
questionable areas revealed by visual inspection or to assess internal fouling/deposits and measure pit depth using
stereoscopic measuring lenses. Most optical equipment today allows videotaping of the images. The videotape can
serve as a record of the internal inspection and allows better comparison of conditions in the future.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The internal visual inspection of tubes can be made to locate and determine the extent of the following types of
deterioration commonly experienced in heater tubes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) selective, spot-type, or pit-type corrosion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) thinning of tube ends;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) cutting or other cleaning damage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

fouling and coke deposits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 33 shows examples of the spot-type or pit-type corrosion often found in heater tubes. This type of corrosion is
one of the most difficult to detect. Visual inspection can be hindered if the internal surfaces of the tubes are not free
from coke and any other foreign matter. Mechanical cleaning does not always reveal spot-type or pit-type corrosion. If
this type of corrosion is apparent or suspected, the inside surfaces of the tube at the tube ends might be cleaned
using an acetylene torch to burn coke or grit blasting material out of the pits. Grit blasting is also preferred and least
likely to damage the tubes as may happen with an acetylene torch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.9 Hardness Measurements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardness testing of ferritic heater tubes can indicate that the tubes experienced a severe overheat or identify some
forms of embrittlement or carburization. A severe temperature excursion exceeding the lower critical transformation
temperature of the metal can cause a hard microstructure to result if the cooling rate is fast enough. If the cooling rate
is slow, softening may actually occur. The hard tubes can be susceptible to brittle fracture if they are mishandled or
impacted. They can also be susceptible to some forms of stress cracking like sulfide stress cracking during downtime.
Refer to API 530 for a listing of material transformation temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardness testing of ferritic heater tubes can also be used to qualitatively determine how evenly fired are the tubes. In
Cr-Mo tubes, thermal softening can occur at elevated temperatures. Tubes in the firebox that are softest may
represent the hottest tubes. Softening can indicate a reduction in tensile strength for a ferritic material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External carburization and 885 °F embrittlement can be identified through hardness changes. With each mechanism,
there shall be a noticeable increase in hardness. However, if the depth of carburization is not significant, the field test
instruments may not identify a change and measure the base metal hardness below the hardened layer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hardness measurements can be made using available sonic and impact field testing instruments. Caution should be
taken when obtaining hardness measurements to assure adequate surface preparation. Surface roughness and
oxide scale can dramatically affect the hardness value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>60
API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, tubes with hardness outside the normal range (either excessive hardness or excessive softening) should
be evaluated for continued service and appropriate repairs made if necessary. This evaluation may require the review
of someone with knowledge of the service and potential deterioration mechanisms that may result.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.10 Dye Penetrant and Magnetic Particle Examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dye penetrant and magnetic particle examination often supplement a visual examination for cracking. If cracks are
suspected or expected based on experience, one or more of these techniques are employed. Austenitic stainless
steel components are often dye penetrant inspected while ferritic metallurgies receive a magnetic particle inspection
for cracks. Austenitic stainless steel tube welds are often penetrant tested when external PASCC is a concern. Other
common locations where either dye penetrant or magnetic particle examination is used depending on the metallurgy
include inspecting attachment welds of tube skin thermocouple, tube hangers, and tube supports. Dye penetrant can
be used on ferritic steels as well; however, it is more common to magnetic particle test those components since
magnetic particle is quicker.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.11 In-situ Metallography and Replication<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As indicated previously, certain types of deterioration experienced in heater tubes result from some change in
metallurgical structure. The more common types of deterioration are carburization, decarburization, the initial stages
of external stress corrosion cracking, creep, fatigue cracking, and some forms of hydrogen attack.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is possible to detect most of these types of deterioration in the field by visual inspection, nondestructive testing, in-
situ metallography or replication. Carburization and decarburization can be determined accurately by a chemical or
physical test. Most of the testing should be done by specially trained personnel. Damage that results from some
metallurgical changes can be determined by a wide range of NDT techniques designed for the characterization of
material degradation (e.g. ultrasonic, magnetic-particle, and liquid penetrant examination). In-situ metallography and
replication are rarely used alone for evaluation of these deterioration mechanisms. It is best used in combination with
other NDE techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.12 Detailed Examination and Destructive Testing Of Tube Samples<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When deterioration cannot be effectively identified or monitored in service, obtaining tube samples for destructive
examination may be appropriate. Metallographic examination can be performed for identification of deformation
mechanisms such as decarburization, carburization, hydrogen attack, and stress cracking. Physical testing of creep
life can be appropriate for severe services and for affirming any calculated remaining life. Oftentimes, calculated
remaining tube life includes several assumptions of tube operating history that can lead to inaccurate results. The
density of scale samples can be measured and may provide information on the tube operating history. Furthermore,
physical properties of the tubes can be measured that can assist in damage assessments. Additional information is
available through other technical documents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to removal of a tube section, consideration should be given to the ability to make the repair weld between the
new tube section and the existing tube sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In many heaters, tubes are not accessible for an internal visual inspection. Some companies make a practice of
thoroughly inspecting all tubes that are condemned and removed from a heater, regardless of the reason for the
tubes’ removal. This inspection is made by cutting a tube into short sections of 2 ft to 3 ft (60 cm to 90 cm) so that the
inside surface can be examined. Measurements for metal-wall thicknesses are made at the ends of each section. In
some cases, the sections are split longitudinally, thus exposing the entire inside surface for examination. The ends of
the tube rolled into the fitting should be removed for examination. They may then be inspected to determine the
general condition and effectiveness of the rolled joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When external deterioration, including that due to oxidation, scaling, cracking, and external corrosion is suspected,
especially in the case of convection tubes, representative tubes may be removed from the heater and then cleaned<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_69>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
61<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>and examined thoroughly. The selection of the tubes to be removed may be guided by the tube locations in the
heater, the length of time the tubes have been in service, and the general appearance of the tubes in the area. If the
tubes chosen for inspection are found to be defective or unfit for further service, other tubes in the same area and of
the same or similar age and general appearance should also be inspected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.13 Testing of Tubeskin Thermocouples<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During outages, tube skin thermocouples should be tested for accuracy and potential failure. Tube skin
thermocouples may be inaccurate or fail prematurely. Inspection and testing during outages is an important step to
improve reliability. Thermocouple leads are often the root failure by being exposed to flame and radiation or lifting off
the tube surface. Attachment welds should be inspected with dye penetrant for cracks that can cause the
thermocouple to read firebox temperature. The sheathing protecting the thermocouple leads should be inspected for
any breaches and kinks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some thermocouples can have a temperature drift due to long term exposure or temperature cycling. Procedures can
be developed to determine if the tube temperature is accurately measured by heating an area adjacent to the tube
and monitoring the temperature rise. A calibrated contact pyrometer can measure temperature at that point and be
used for comparison to the thermocouple.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.14 Magnetic Test For Carburization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Austenitic tubes are essentially nonmagnetic. Carburized areas of the tubes become magnetic, and if these areas are
large, they can be detected with a magnet. A magnet on a string dropped down a tube can indicate areas that are
magnetic but cannot indicate the depth of carburization. There are several commercially available devices that are
used for measuring the ferrite content of austenitic welds that may be suitable for identifying localized areas of
magnetism in heater tubes (see Figure 34). Some instruments and field services can relate the degree of magnetism
to the depth of carburization. Most of the instruments are proprietary and the field services are limited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A rule of thumb states that up to 50 % carburization can be tolerated on-stream before loss of strength materially
affects tube life. Although this rule of thumb indicates that a tube with 50 % carburization should be replaced, it does
not mean that a tube with less than 50 % carburization cannot remain in service until the next shutdown. Factors
including the rate of carburization, the expected service time until the next shutdown, the amount of excess metal,
and changes in pressure and temperature should be taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.15 Hammer Testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A hammer test has been an accepted method of exploring the surface of metal objects to locate areas of substantially
reduced wall thickness; however, other NDE techniques, particularly UT thickness testing, have made this technique
outdated. When a hammer test is made, the variations in metal-wall thickness are indicated by the feel and rebound
of the hammer and by the sound produced. One value of hammer testing is that it is a good way to determine whether
the scale on the outside surface of a tube is an oxide due to overheating or a product of fuel combustion. Although
combustion deposits vary in texture depending on the fuel used, the scale that results from oxidation is generally
harder, requires a stronger blow to be knocked loose from the tube and is of a flakier texture than scale from the
products of combustion. A magnetic check of the material offers the most conclusive test; oxide scale is magnetic,
and scale from the products of combustion is non-magnetic.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heater tubes that have been in service may become temper embrittled and have low ductility at ambient temperature.
To avoid any possible damage, carbon and alloy steel heater tubes should have a minimum metal temperature of
about 60 °F (15 °C) during hammer tests. In certain cases, the hammer testing of tubes can lead to damage.
Austenitic stainless steel tubes may suffer stress corrosion cracking at areas that are cold worked by hammering.
Cast austenitic stainless steel tubes and Cr-Mo ferritic tubes should not be hammer tested when tubes are heavily
carburized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.16.1 Laser Profilometry<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Creep strain within steam methane reforming and pyrolysis heaters typically develops in the form of bulging or
swelling. Laser profilometry has been successfully applied to inspect spun-cast high alloy tubes. The technique can
measure the diametrical dimensions of the tubes from either the tube interior (if the catalyst is removed) or the tube
exterior. The laser profilometry method enables modeling the tube in a color 3-dimensional format, revealing both
localized and general areas of concentrated creep strain. Data is presented in a quantitative format that can then be
applied to generate tube remaining life assessments on the full tube length or within localized regions. By combining
the produced images of each individual tube, overall damage patterns within the heater can be identified (see Fig.
35).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.16.2 Ultrasonic Refracted Longitudinal Wave and TOFD<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Creep cracking of cast tubing used in steam methane reforming and pyrolysis heaters usually starts near the mid-wall
of the heater tube and is normally longitudinal, resulting from hoop and thermal stresses in the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic equipment that implements through-transmission (i.e. pitch catch) has been used to inspect tubes. With
this attenuation method, a grading of percent transmission is made to draw some conclusions about the degree of
fissuring that attenuates transmission of the ultrasound. Since tubes vary in the amount of equiaxed and columnar
grains, the calibration standard used should reflect the tubes being inspected. Without an adequate standard, the
judgment of percent transmission may be in error.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic time-of-flight diffraction (TOFD) has also been used to compliment through-transmission tube inspection.
TOFD is a method that detects diffracted waves coming from the tips of flaws and is best used to detect severe flaws
(i.e. fissures in steam methane reformer tubes).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assessment of degradation using these ultrasonic techniques may be accomplished by performing a baseline
examination and recording trends over a period of time. A “snapshot” inspection may not adequately assess damage
because of the many variables involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Evaluations of tubes have indicated that the initiation of internal fissuring can eventually cause the tube to fail. Major
fissuring, which is easily detected, indicates that failure may occur in up to 10,000 hours. Since such a wide range of
tube life is available for evaluation, a risk analysis should be made. Tubes that are expected to fail in less than one
year should be replaced. Tubes that may be good for several years may be allowed to remain in service until the next
scheduled shutdown when they can be re-inspected or replaced. Replacement tubes can be ordered so that they are
on hand when needed. All these evaluations have to be based on the assumptions that the original design and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

design limits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.16.3 Radiographic Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiographic methods have been used to inspect reforming tubes. However, tight cracks cannot readily be seen
unless they are normal to the film. When catalyst is in the tubes, the tight cracks may be harder to find because of the
varied film densities and the catalyst edges that are present. It is desirable to remove the catalyst from the tubes, but
this is not normally practical or economical when the catalyst is not scheduled for replacement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Radiographs can show cracks regardless of whether there is catalyst in the tubes. However, radiography may not be
as sensitive to initial fissuring and tight cracks as is ultrasonic inspection. If radiographs do show cracks, the cracks
can be judged on the basis of how many there are and how wide they appear to be on the radiograph. Normally, dark,
wide cracks on a radiograph indicate that the cracks are open to the inside diameter of the tube and that the tube
should be replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.16.4 Eddy Current<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Eddy current inspection of stainless steel steam methane reformer tubes is employed to identify crack-like defects.
The principal behind eddy current inspection is that a defect changes the energy flux induced in the material through
a magnetic field. Caution should be taken when applying eddy current as variations in material permeability can result
in false positives. For austenitic stainless steels, the energy field penetrates up to 1 in. (25 mm) deep which is greater
than the wall thickness of most tubes. This technique can be performed externally without removal of the catalyst.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some operators have found it useful to assess data from a combination of technologies (i.e. diametral, laser
profilometry, eddy current, and ultrasonic). The advantage of using multiple technologies is a cross-comparison of
results, particularly for the case where a damage mechanism may be sensitive to multiple methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Most commercial equipment can grade each tube in terms of relative creep damage based on characteristic signals
within a particular type of material. In addition, some equipment can also measure wall thickness ultrasonically and
tube diameter as it travels along the tube. Diametric changes in tubes can also be determined through laser profiling
from the tube ID. These additional measurements combined with eddy current and ultrasonic test results can allow an
assessment of relative creep damage. Grading of individual tubes combined with subsequent repeat examinations
may enhance tube damage trending and ultimate tube replacement planning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.16.5 On-stream Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heaters with external pigtails have been operated to tube rupture. In such cases, pigtail nipping has been used to
crimp the inlet and outlet pigtails to cut off the inlet and outlet gases. Designs for pigtail nippers are available but
should be checked to ensure that the hydraulic-system pressure is enough to cut off all flow (usually over 5000 lbf/in. 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>[34.4 kPa] gauge) that stops are on the anvils to prevent the pigtail from being cut off (the design should be based on
wall thickness), and that some locking device is available to keep the crimp closed when the pigtail nipper pressure is
released for removal of the hydraulic cylinders.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.17 Inspection of Pigtails<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Pigtail failures typically occur due to the combination of intergranular creep crack growth from repeated loading and
high temperature oxidation. During outages, liquid penetrant inspection can be used to identify areas of cracking
along the length of the pigtail. Creep strain damage can be assessed by using digital calipers to measure the creep
strain on the OD of the pigtail.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10 Boiler Outage Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before the boiler is cleaned, it is a good practice to perform a preliminary inspection of the inside of all equipment to
the extent practicable. The location, amount, physical appearance, and analysis of mud, sludge, or scale deposited
on the inside of shells and drums can provide information about the effectiveness of the feedwater treatment,
blowdown operation, and methods of cleaning needed. The preliminary inspection may also be helpful in determining
which parts of shells or drums require the closest inspection. Heavy internal or external scale found either on drums
or tubes is an indication to inspect the area closely for metal overheating. Flow marks in fly ash or soot deposited on
the baffling can help locate gas leaks in it. Any conditions that indicate that close inspection is required after cleaning
should be noted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The detailed inspection may proceed after the preliminary internal inspection and general cleanout. Inspection
personnel should be familiar with the operation and design of the type boiler and inspect the components ability to
operate properly for the next run length. To perform an appropriate inspection, access is necessary to all major
components. All manhole covers and a sufficient number of handhole plates should be removed for inspection.
Representative tubes should be made accessible for much of this length as possible from inside the firebox. Steam
drum internals may also need removal to allow access to tubes. Ordinarily, it is not necessary to remove insulation
material, masonry, or fixed parts of the boiler, unless defects or deterioration peculiar to certain types of boilers are
suspected. Where moisture or vapor shows through the covering, the covering should be removed and a complete
investigation made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In preparation for maintenance outages, on-stream inspections should be performed in advance to facilitate defining
the appropriate outage worklist (see 11.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2 Piping<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A visual inspection should be made for evidence of leakage in pipe and threaded or flanged pipe joints. Water leaks
may be detected by the presence of moisture or deposits at the point of leakage and steam leaks by the appearance
of the adjacent metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Leaks may sometimes be a result of strains caused by deformation or misalignment of the piping system.
Deformations may be caused by lack of provision for expansion or by improper supports. If not eliminated,
pronounced deformation may place strains of sufficient magnitude to cause failure in small connections. A careful
inspection should determine if such defects are present.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When flanged connections are opened, gaskets and gasket seats should be inspected carefully. Gaskets may be
damaged by leakage or by improper centering of the gasket when the joint is made up. Gasket seats may be scored
by a steam leak at the joint, improper handling, or careless use of tools. Seating surfaces should be inspected for tool
marks, other mechanical abuses, and evidence of the type of erosion commonly called steam cutting or wire drawing.
Mechanical damage may lead to erosion if not corrected. Either a scored seat should be machined to provide a
proper gasket face or the flange should be replaced; otherwise, leaks can reoccur. Before joints are re-made, ring
gaskets should be examined to determine their fitness for reuse. Other types of gaskets should be replaced with new
ones.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3 Drums<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All internal surfaces and the connections to all outside attachments, including water-column connections and safety
valve nozzles, should be examined for deformation, corrosion, pitting, grooving, cracking, scale deposits, and sludge
accumulation. Special attention should be paid to all seams, whether welded or riveted, and to the areas adjacent to
them. If seams are heavily coated, they may have to be grit blasted or wire-brushed before a visual examination is
possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_74>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>66
API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welded seams and connections should be examined for cracks. Riveted joints should be checked for loose or broken
rivets, cracking, or other evidence of distress. Rivets should be hammer-tested for soundness. If there is any
evidence of leakage or other distress in lap joints, it should be investigated thoroughly, and if necessary, rivets should
be removed or the plate should be slotted to determine whether cracks exist in the seam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion along or immediately adjacent to a seam may be more critical than a similar amount of corrosion away from
the seams. Such points should receive a close visual examination and ultrasonic wall thickness measurements.
Grooving and cracks along longitudinal seams are especially significant, as they are likely to occur when the material
is highly stressed. Severe corrosion is likely to occur where the water circulation is poor. Both the internal and external
surfaces of the drum need examination. The top external surface of drums should be cleaned of all deposits, and the
surface should be examined for corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a more thorough examination for cracks and other defects in plate and weld metal is desired than can be
obtained by a visual inspection, a radiographic, magnetic-particle, ultrasonic, or dye-penetrant test may be used as
follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) radiography can identify cracks below at or near the metal surface if they are of sufficient size and oriented
properly to make a discernible change in the film density;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) dry powder magnetic particle examination can determine cracks at or near the surface;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) wet fluorescent magnetic particle examination uses either a black or blue light for finding discontinuities and is
more sensitive to tight cracks than dry powder;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) ultrasonic straight beam and shear wave tests can indicate discontinuities in the metal at any depth;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) dye-penetrant test is used to locate surface cracks in large or small areas; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
electromagnetic inspection techniques may be used for surface and sub-surface crack detection instead of
magnetic particle and dye penetrant examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection of the steam drum should also include observations of the normal water level. Any bulges or uneven areas
that may indicate excessive heat input from leaking fireside baffles should be noted. Evidence of poor circulation may
be indicated by waterline gouging along the top half of the top one or two rows of downcomers. This is sometimes
accompanied by flash marks on the drum surface at the tube openings. If a sample of the boiler drum is needed for
chemical analysis or microscopic examination, a section may be trepanned from the wall. The resulting cavity should
need to be evaluated for repair by a suitable method (i.e. welding). Normally the wall thickness is measured
ultrasonically and recorded to establish corrosion rates and remaining life estimates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Safety-valve nozzles and gauge-glass connections, especially the lower connections, should be examined for
accumulations of sludge or debris. A flashlight should be used to visually inspect the nozzle or connection. If the
inside cannot be observed directly, a small hand mirror may be used for indirect observation. Special forms of
illuminating equipment, mirrors, and magnifying devices are useful for this type of inspection. When the boiler
contains more than one drum, usually only one of the drums has safety valves on it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any manhole davits should be tested for freedom of movement and for excessive deformation. Manhole and
handhole cover plates and nozzle seats should be examined for scoring in the manner described in preceding text for
pipe flanges. Cover plates should be inspected for cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Drum internals and connections to the drum should be inspected when the drum is inspected. Drum internals,
including internal feed header, distribution piping, steam separators, dry pipes, blowdown piping, deflector plates, and
baffle plates, should be inspected for tightness, soundness, and structural stability. The vigorous turbulence of the
steam and water mixture present in the drum may vibrate such parts loose from their fasteners, attachments, or
settings. When these parts are welded in place, it is not uncommon for the welds to crack from vibration. Welds or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_75>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
67<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>rivets attaching internals or connections to the drums should be inspected in the same manner as welds or rivets in
the drum proper. Steam separators and baffles should be carefully inspected for tightness, corrosion, and
deterioration, and associated welds should be checked for cracks. Any bypassing of the steam separator can allow
carryover into the superheater, causing salt deposition, resultant overheating, and possible tube failure. Steam
separators should be free from deposits that might impair their operation. Some boilers do not have steam separators
and depend entirely on dry pipes for water separation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The holes in dry pipes should be free from any deposits that might restrict flow. Since dry pipe holes are in the top of
the pipe near the top of the drum, it may be necessary to inspect the holes indirectly with a hand mirror. Any drain
holes in the pipe should also be inspected for freedom from deposits and scale. Not all drums contain dry pipes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ultrasonic examination, laser profilometry testing, and radiography are some of the methods that may be used to
inspect for tube wall loss caused by corrosion. Tube ligaments should be examined for cracks. If tubes are covered by
baffle or deflector plates, a few of these plates should be removed to permit a spot check of the condition of the tubes
behind them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection methods and limitations described in API 572 are applicable to all drums forming any part of a steam
boiler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4 Water Headers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each handhole and handhole plate seat should be examined for erosion, steam cutting, tool marks, and other
damage that might permit leakage. If the plate has leaked previously, it should be checked for trueness and possible
deformation. Seating surfaces and faces of handholes should be examined for cracks. It may be necessary to use a
hand mirror to inspect the handhole seats.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inside surface of the headers should be inspected for corrosion and erosion. The location and amount of scale
buildup should be noted, and the tube ends should be checked for pits, scale, cutting or other damage from tube
cleaners and deposit buildup. If there is considerable scale or deposit buildup, the flow may be restricted to the point
that tubes become overheated because of insufficient circulation. Deposits and scale should be removed with a
scraper and the depth of coating determined. Lower waterwall headers are particularly susceptible to heavy deposit
buildup.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Downcomers and risers should also be inspected for this type of deposit. Thickness readings of headers should be
obtained periodically by ultrasonic technique. The headers should be calipered whenever tubes are removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>External surfaces of headers should be examined either directly or indirectly with mirrors, and particular attention
should be paid to the points where tubes enter the header for indications of leakage from the tube roll. The header
surfaces adjacent to tube rolls and handholes should be inspected for cracks. If external inspection of headers
reveals pitting, thickness measurements should be made using ultrasonic techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5 Superheater Header<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspections of superheater headers should be conducted in a manner similar to that for waterwall headers. Typically
not all superheater handholes are opened at every boiler shutdown or cleanout unless tubes are to be replaced or
other repairs are to be made. However, a few should be removed at every shutdown as a spot check. If the unit cycles
frequently, some of the ligaments between tubes should be examined for cracking with either UT or WFMT,
depending on access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since only dry steam passes through the superheater, there should be few or no deposits present in the headers or
tubes. If deposits or scale are present in any degree, immediate steps should be taken to determine why they are
present. In addition, the extent of the deposits or scale should be investigated. Superheater tubes with a moderate
deposit of scale can rupture readily from the effects of overheating. Indications of scale or deposits should lead to an<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>68
API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>investigation of the steam separators, dry box, operating drum level and fluctuations, blowdown rates, and water
quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6 Tubes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All tubes should be inspected for signs of overheating, corrosion, and erosion. Waterwall tubes and generating tubes
nearest the burner are particularly susceptible to overheating and should be closely examined for bulging, blistering,
quench cracking, sagging, and bowing. Inspection for blisters and local bulging is easily accomplished by shining a
flashlight parallel to the length of the tube so that bulges, blisters, and other deformities cast shadows. Cleaning of a
slagged tube may be necessary to find minor blisters. The tube’s circumference should be measured at the blister or
bulge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Boiler tubes should be inspected at the steam-drum connection for gouging and caustic corrosion due to steam
blanketing. Roof tubes are generally designed for heat pickup on one side only. Therefore, a sagging roof tube due to
burned out hangers is especially susceptible to overheating. These tubes should be straightened and the hangers
should be replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Waterside corrosion, generally caused by faulty water treatment can usually be detected by ultrasonic thickness
measurements of representative tubes. Measurements can also be made from inside the steam drum for a distance
of 8 in. to 10 in. (20 cm to 25 cm) into the tubes. The locations measured and thicknesses found should be recorded
to establish a tube corrosion rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fireside corrosion is generally caused by moisture that accumulates in fly-ash deposits. Although fireside corrosion
may occur anywhere in the tube nest, it usually occurs where the tubes enter the lower drums or headers. Moisture-
causing fireside corrosion can come from leaks in tubes, drums, headers, and faulty steam soot blower shutoff
valves. Other sources can come from rain water through stacks and roofs, and from condensation from the
atmosphere during downtime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specific attention should be given to tubes near any openings (i.e. viewports) as air in-leakage can cause increased
external corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steam tubes should be examined for the type and thickness of internal scale. Ultrasonic techniques exist to
nondestructively measure steam-side scale thickness from the outside surface. An assessment of tube remaining life
can be made from the measured scale thickness of the tube if operating in the creep range as mentioned in 12.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a tube rupture occurs, the tube should be visually inspected. Its appearance may indicate the cause of failure.
If the cause is not evident, samples of the tube in the original condition with deposits and scale intact should be taken
and analyzed chemically and microscopically. The tube sample should be cut at least 1 ft (30 cm) on either side of the
failure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inside of straight tubes should be examined as far as they are accessible with strong illumination. Straight tubes
should be examined by illuminating the end away from the observer. Ultrasonic and laser profilometry test methods
can provide inspection over the tube’s full length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Internal cleanliness is required to conduct a satisfactory tube inspection. When tube cleanliness is in doubt, a turbine-
type cleaner should be used to remove internal deposits. The loosened deposits should be trapped at the discharge
ends. The weight of trapped deposit and the internal surface area can indicate the average thickness of the deposit
removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fiber optics or borescopes are of limited use on bent tubes, but are satisfactory for viewing straight tubes and may
also be used to inspect tube internals. Tube ends should be checked for proper projection and flaring. Calipers,
micrometers, laser profilometry, and ultrasonic instruments can be used to measure tube diameters, dimensions of
bulges on tubes, depth of corrosion pits, and tube-wall thickness. These measurements are of great value in
determining the effects of corrosion and erosion and in estimating the future lives of the parts measured. Tubes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_77>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
69<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>should also be checked for any cutting due to cleaning. Figure 36 is a photograph of the interior surface of a tube that
has been damaged by operating a tube cleaner too long in one place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Erosion of exterior surfaces is caused by the impingement of fly ash or raw fuel solids at excessive velocity or by soot
blowers. Fly-ash tube erosion can be arrested by installing shields or by reducing the gas velocity. If erosion is due to
soot blower medium impingement, the soot blowers should be checked for alignment, warpage, and operating wear.
Wastage of exterior tube surfaces can be caused by flame impingement, which should be corrected by adjustments
to the firing equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Some types of waterwalls have tubes widely spaced and the area between the tubes covered by steel fins attached to
the tubes. The fins may become overheated and burn or crack. The fins should be inspected for cracks that may
extend into the tubes. The tubes should be inspected for signs of leakage that may result from the cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Waterwall tubes should also be checked for alignment. All gas passages should be inspected for slagging or bridging
from fly ash or slag buildup. The first gas pass is particularly susceptible to this condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11 On-stream Inspection Programs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On-stream inspection programs are a vital component to maintaining reliability. Often inspection efforts focus on the
next maintenance outage since it involves significant planning and resources. However, on-stream inspection is the
key to monitoring the health of the equipment between major outages and allows proactive response to operating
conditions that may cause premature failure. On-stream inspection programs monitor the operation of the heater and
boiler to ensure variables are operating within a satisfactory window selected for the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ideally, this activity is a collaboration with Operations and Engineering to detect “change” in operating or physical
conditions, enabling early detection and response to impending damage or failures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_78>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>70
API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2 Typical Inspection Activities<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Typical on-stream inspection programs incorporate visual examination of the firebox, external visual examination of
casing and components, infrared examination of tubes and heater casing and stack, and monitoring of tubeskin
thermocouples. Although in limited use, tell-tale holes are another practice for identifying unexpected or accelerated
corrosion of tubes on-stream. Other analyzers and instrumentation monitor heater and boiler operation and these are
important parts of an overall reliability program; however, but these are typically monitored for heater and boiler
performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.1 Tubeskin Thermocouples<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubeskin thermocouples can be an important component in a reliability program, especially for on-stream inspection.
Thermocouples measure the temperature of tube walls in-service and they serve a couple purposes. First, the
thermocouples can alert to abnormal operation if temperatures dramatically change. Second, they provide a means to
calculate and monitor remaining tube creep life. Strategic placement of the thermocouples is necessary so that the
entire firebox can be reasonably monitored. Malfunctioning burners or unbalanced firing of burners can create local
hot zones in the firebox and lead to premature failures. In addition, tubes that historically operate hot due to their
placement in the coil may need a thermocouple, especially if it represents the most severe service of the tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tube skin thermocouples have some limitations in reading temperatures accurately. The particular type of
thermocouple should have a mid-range rating for the expected tube metal temperature for improved accuracy.
Thermocouple wires can have the potential to drift with time at temperature; therefore, they require recalibration or
periodic replacement. Another significant problem is the attachment of the thermocouple to the tube. If it is poorly
attached, the thermocouple can separate from the tube and begin reading firebox temperatures. Hence, special
attention should be taken on thermocouple attachment type and quality, and numbers and placement on heater tubes
to prevent attachment failure during the scheduled process run to assure users that they still have adequate
monitoring and control at end-of-run conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.2 Infrared Scanning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Infrared scanning provides a means to determine the surface temperature of a tube’s outermost layer of scale, ash
deposits or metal. When the heat flux, scale/ash thickness and scale/ash thermal conductivity may be reasonably
estimated, or when the tube surface may be reasonably assumed to be clean, the temperature provided by infrared
scanning provides a means to determine the tube metal temperature for estimating tube remaining creep life,
calculating corrosion rates, and checking the accuracy of tube skin thermocouples. In addition, infrared thermal
scanning of tubes helps identify localized hot spot temperatures and identifies tube operating temperatures in
locations where there are no thermocouples. A periodic scan of heaters should be a common practice. The inspection
intervals should be shorter for furnaces with coking tendencies (i.e. crude, vacuum, heavy oil hydroprocessing and
coker units) furnaces susceptible to fouling (i.e. dry point fouling in naphtha hydrotreating units) and steam methane
reforming furnaces. Longer intervals may be used for furnaces in non-coking and non-fouling susceptible services.
For furnaces that have frequent decoking activities (i.e. ethylene and olefin cracking units), a case-by-case evaluation
is needed to determine how often infrared scanning should be performed to complement routine monitoring that
typically uses a handheld pyrometer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Personnel performing Infrared (IR) surveillance of heaters should be knowledgeable and appropriately trained and
qualified per the owner-user’s requirements for IR scanning (e.g. ASNT SNT-TC-1A, PCN Condition Monitoring or
owner-user standard or practice). In addition, scanning personnel should be aware of the factors that may impact IR
survey results. These factors include flame environment, distance to target, tube emissivity, stray infrared radiation,
surface characteristics of different materials, infrared camera functions, and the limitations and accuracy of the
method. When performing IR scanning, inspection personnel should review prior IR survey results, records for current
heater operating status, temperature limits and any new operations or maintenance issues to ensure that all areas of
concern are inspected. Data analyses should include a review of previous IR survey results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_79>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
71<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An external IR scan of the heater should include an assessment of heater casing and stack for refractory damage.
Internal IR scans of the firebox through each sight port should include an assessment of:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) viewable (i.e. radiant or convection) heater tubes for overall temperatures and hot spots,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) tube skin thermocouples,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) tube supports and refractory for spalled refractory or broken tube supports, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) burner tiles and fuel gas tips for damage or plugging.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IR surveys should be conducted on a scheduled interval based on Integrity Operating Windows, API Standard 530,
Omega design metal temperature (DMT) limits, unusual or poor operation or control, steam air decoking or when
deemed necessary. External and internal IR scan results that indicate significant temperature differences from
previous or anticipate IR survey results should be evaluated. The owner-user should specify guidelines for acceptable
temperature limits for each heater. Results outside of owner-user guidelines should be reported immediately.
Inspection reports should include documentation of IR camera settings used for the survey, drawings of heater tube
locations and results, and images of all significant findings. Any exceedance of prevailing operating limits should be
immediately reported.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Accuracy of infrared scanning can be influenced by the skill of the operator, the angle of incidence, the nature of the
combustion products, flame patterns, and scale on the tubes. The infrared operator ideally should be certified in
infrared technology and have experience scanning heaters and boilers. The presence of flames can mask the tubes if
the operator scans through the flames. Another significant limitation is scale on the tubes. The temperature of scale
on the tubes tends to be hotter than the tube since it may not be tightly bonded to the tube. During outages, it can be
beneficial to remove scale in areas to allow the operator to scan a “scale-free” area and compare to other scaled
areas that may allow better interpretation of results. Grit blasting stainless steel tubes has also been shown to
improve the accuracy of infrared by mottling the surface enough to reduce reflectivity that artificially causes a higher
temperature measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The external casing can be inspected on-stream both visually and using infrared. Visual examination can identify
areas of distortion and holes. These inspections can indicate hot areas of lost refractory and promote continued
deterioration. A periodic infrared scan of the case is more effective than visual examination in identifying “hot spots”,
holes, and cracks. Regular inspection of the firebox is critical for reliability. Inspection can identify poor flame pattern
of improperly firing burners, fuel rich operation as evidenced by afterburning, and changes in appearance of tubes,
supports, refractory, etc. These inspections help identify changes early. Any changes or problems can be addressed
or analyzed to prevent further damage and deterioration from occurring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Header boxes should be visually examined for evidence of process leaks. These could indicate a leaking plug header
for those heaters with fittings or a leaking instrument connection like a thermowell. If there is evidence of process
leakage, understanding the cause should be investigated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figures 37 and Figure 38 are infrared thermographs of an on-stream inspection that can help identify abnormal
operating tube metal temperatures. In Figure 37, a section of the tube is operating at 1400 °F (760 °C) while in
Figure 38 an entire coil is operating 300 °F (149 °C) above the adjacent coil. Identifying these “hot” areas early allows
corrective action to reduce metal temperatures without incident. These conditions may not be identified by tubeskin
thermocouples depending upon their placement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.3 Tell-Tale Holes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of tell-tale holes acts as an early detection and safeguard for accelerated or unpredicted thinning of tubes.
The tell-tale holes minimize the effect of leaks associated with a heater tube failure. The tell-tale drilling practice is
regarded as a safeguarding measure in loss prevention and should not be considered a substitute for or a relaxation
of good inspection and quality control practices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

corrosion, and random areas on straight run lengths.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.3 External Tube Cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On-stream cleaning of tubes to remove scale may be beneficial to improve the accuracy of infrared scan or to
improve the heat transfer (i.e. heater efficiency). Some techniques used include blasting with walnut hulls, crushed
dry ice and water. Course walnut hulls have proven effective in removing loose scale; however, the user should
recognize that refractory damage can occur where the hulls affect the wall. One benefit of the hulls is that they burn
up in the firebox and most of the ash leaves the heater through the stack. Another technique is to water blast the
tubes, which removes scale by thermal contraction and shock. Consideration needs to be given to the water type and
the spray type so that tube damage need not result. In this instance as well, refractory damage can result where the
water impacts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.4 Pre-shutdown Inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On-stream inspection is also important to identify problems that cannot be seen while the equipment is out-of-service.
A discussion with operations and maintenance personnel is highly recommended to identify problem areas. At this
time, a review of the operating conditions may also help to indicate problems such as O 2  percentage (i.e. inability to
maintain target O 2  could indicate leaks or burner problems), draft (i.e. unsteady/pulsating draft can damage heater/
boiler components), drum levels, pressures, and temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An infrared scan of the casing and radiant tubes can allow a hot spot map to be created so that these areas can be
investigated during the maintenance outage. Flame locations and appearance can help identify problems with burner
tiles, refractory, and floors. Flames emanating from a portion of floor or wall indicate a problem that needs follow-up
inspection. Complete an external inspection to determine condition of the structure such as buckstays to look for
signs of expansion and buckling. Also, inspect external equipment such as blowdown valves, soot blowers, level
gauges, external hangers, rods, insulation, etc. for damage that may need to be addressed at the outage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12 Tube Reliability Assessment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tube reliability can only be assessed by understanding the amount of deterioration that can be tolerated without
compromising the integrity of the tube until the next outage. The assessment is often referred to as the remaining life
of the tube. Determining remaining life for all deterioration mechanisms may not be possible; therefore, it may be
necessary to consult with one knowledgeable in heater design, operation, and deterioration mechanisms. In addition,
consulting API Recommended Practice 579, Appendix F, Section F.7 and Table F-12 on creep modeling, parameters
and Omega properties, and other fitness-for-service documents may provide additional guidance on assessing
deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>12.2 Minimum Thickness and Stress Rupture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stress rupture is dependent on the stress the metal is exposed to and the temperature of the metal. The common
approach to prevent stress rupture failures is to establish a minimum allowable thickness for the tube operating
conditions (e.g. pressure, mechanical stresses, and metal temperature).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.1 Tubes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods of establishing minimum allowable thickness range from the highly complex to the simple. With the average
heater, the operating pressure and temperature are known only for the heater inlet and outlet. The pressure and
temperature at intermediate points is typically estimated by calculations or measured with pressure gauges and
thermocouples installed at appropriate locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The metal temperature governs the allowable working stress for tube materials. Therefore, for a given tube size and a
given operating pressure, the minimum allowable thickness varies with the tube temperature. Tube temperature is an
important parameter to know, especially at the highest levels of the normal operating condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API Standard 530 gives extensive information on the calculation of required wall thickness of new tubes (carbon steel
and alloy tubes) for petroleum refinery heaters. The procedures given are appropriate for designing tubes or checking
existing tubes in both corrosive and non-corrosive services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many methods, including those involving tube skin thermocouples, infrared cameras, infrared pyrometers, and optical
pyrometers are available to determine the metal temperature of a tube. A simple method is to estimate the metal
temperature from the operating fluid temperature is to adjust the temperature estimate based on the location of the
tube in the heater—the skin temperatures on a tube closer to the flame or nearer the heater outlet should be hotter
than one at the heater inlet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under certain conditions, the methods described in the preceding text may result in a thickness that is too small for
practical purposes. The minimum allowable thickness has to be great enough to give the tube sufficient structural
strength to prevent sagging between supports and to withstand upset operating conditions. For this reason, it may be
appropriate to add some amount based on experience to the calculated minimum allowable thickness and to use this
greater thickness as the limit at which a tube should be replaced. In these cases, it is typically about 0.125 in.
(0.32 cm).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.2 Fittings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar to establishing the minimum allowable thickness for tubes, the metal temperature of the fittings has to be
established so that the appropriate allowable design stress of the material can be used. Generally, if the fitting is
outside the firebox the fitting temperature is considered to be the same as the temperature of the fluid flowing through
it plus 55 °F (30 °C). The metal temperature of a fitting inside the firebox is considered to be the same as that of the
corresponding tubes. The allowable working stress value for fittings is determined in the same way as it is for tubes.
Minimum allowable thickness can be determined from applying calculations from the appropriate ASME piping codes.
Because of stresses that may be set up by closing and holding members and by thermal expansion, the calculated
allowable thickness may be too small to be practical. As with tubes, it may be advisable to add some thickness based
on judgment and experience when setting the minimum thickness at which a heater fitting should be replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When plugs are used in a heater fitting like plug-type or mule-ear fittings or when a sectional L is used in a sectional
fitting (see Figure 40), the width of the seating surface in the fitting has to be sufficient to prevent leakage. A width
large enough to prevent leakage generally provides adequate strength against blowout, but a lesser width should
never be used. The proper seating width required to prevent leakage is difficult to calculate and is often determined by
experience. When there is no previous experience to be used as a guide, one way to determine these limits is to wait
until evidence of slight leakage is found and then set a limit at a point that is a little greater than that at which the slight
leakage was evident. Annex B (Example B.7) shows several types of heater fittings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Because of the great number of variables affecting the limiting thickness and the variety of types, sizes, shapes,
operating methods, and constructions of boilers, it is not possible in this recommended practice to present a set of
pre-calculated minimum or retiring thickness. However, it may be quite feasible to prepare one for the boilers in a
given refinery. Formulas for the thickness of drums, headers, and tubes are given in the ASME Boiler and Pressure
Vessel Code, Sections I and IV. ASME B31.1 also provides calculations for wall thickness of power boiler piping.
These formulas can be used as guides when repairs and replacements are needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.3 Creep Rupture Life<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Remaining creep life for tubes in a heater is estimated or measured using various techniques ranging from the
approach outlined in API Standard 530 Annex A, API Recommended Practice 579 or destructive creep testing of tube
material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>API Standard 530 Annex A, “Estimation of Remaining Tube Life” in API Standard 530 is a common approach to
assess life of in-service tubes. The calculations are based on the Larson-Miller parameter curves found in the
document. API Standard 530 provides an average and a minimum Larson-Miller curve for each metallurgy. The most
conservative approach is to use the minimum curve since it represents the poorest material properties of those
tested. The average curve can also be used, although the specific heat of material can exhibit properties either above
or below this curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These life assessments usually require several assumptions about the tubes’ thermal and stress history. The history
needs to be established to effectively determine the amount of life expended during each operating run under
different conditions. One can simplify the analysis by assuming the tubes operated under the severe conditions for
their entire life. Once the life fraction has been determined, remaining life can be estimated for specific operating
conditions. One can establish an operating window of temperature and pressure for which the tubes can operate
where creep rupture is not expected during the next run length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>More accurate techniques to determine remaining life require destructive creep testing. One technique is the Omega
methodology that uses strain rate data generated in a creep rupture test to determine remaining creep life. The creep
rupture test can be performed at temperatures and stresses that closely approximate the actual operating conditions
of the tube. This is unique to creep testing, since they require tests at either higher temperature or higher stress to
shorten the tests to a reasonable amount of time. The results are then extrapolated back to operating conditions. This
extrapolation can lead to inaccuracies in estimates. Only a few samples are necessary for this testing and samples
can be prepared from only a small section of tube. The section of tube to be tested should optimally be taken from the
location operating under the most severe conditions. Additionally, the samples should be tested in the most highly
stressed direction in service. Typically, this is a sample oriented circumferentially in the hoop stress direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The remaining life determinations provide a means to manage tube life of a heater or boiler. The operator of the boiler
or heater can understand how the operation affects tube life. For instance, tube life can be monitored throughout the
run incorporating all types of operations including most importantly any high-temperature excursions. These
remaining life calculations can be used to predict and plan tube replacements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When inside the heater or boiler, tubes have historically been replaced if they exhibit an increase in tube diameter
beyond a specified threshold value. Company practices range from 1 % to 5 % of the tubes original diameter or
circumference for wrought tubes. Creep testing can be used to determine a better relationship between growth and
remaining life for particular tube metallurgy in a heater. Some metallurgies exhibit more growth than others do for a
similar remaining creep life. Therefore, 5 % may be conservative for some metallurgy and not enough for others.
Consider consulting with a materials engineer knowledgeable in heater tube metallurgy before establishing threshold
criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13 Method of Inspection for Foundations, Settings, and Other Appurtenances<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.1 Foundations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All foundations can be expected to settle to some extent. If the settlement is both evenly distributed and only small in
extent, then little or no trouble may be experienced. If the settlement is either uneven or large in extent, then serious
consequences may result. Whether even or uneven, any settlement in a foundation should be studied and, if the need
is indicated, checked at frequent intervals by level measurements, which should be continued and plotted until the
settlement practically ceases. When settlement is first noted, all pipe connections to the heater should be examined<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_85>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
77<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>carefully to determine whether they are subject to serious strain and consequent high stress. If conditions warrant
corrective measures, they should be taken immediately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the main causes of the deterioration of foundation concrete is high temperature. This causes calcining that is
caused by the concrete’s loss of water of hydration and leaves the concrete a weakened mass with very little
cohesion. Calcining can easily be detected by chipping at the suspected area with a hammer. If calcining is present,
the concrete can fall away as a powder with minor impact from the hammer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Spalling is another form of concrete deterioration caused by heat or an insufficient thickness of concrete over the
reinforcement. The concrete cracks and moisture can enter and attack the steel reinforcement. The products of
corrosion build up and exert sufficient pressure against the concrete covering to cause it to flake or spall, exposing the
reinforcement to further attack. Only a visual inspection is necessary to detect this form of deterioration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.2 Structural Supports<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A visual inspection should be made of all load-carrying structural steel members to see whether deflection is
observable. If bending is present in a column, it may be caused by overloading, overheating, or lateral forces applied
to the column by the expansion of elements in the heater. These potential causes should be sought and the cause of
the bending should be determined so that proper corrective measures can be taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the bending is due to overloading, either the column should be reinforced by welding the necessary reinforcement
to the column’s web to reduce the unit stresses to a permissible value or the column should be replaced with another
one of suitable size. If the bending is caused by overheating, the column should be protected by insulation or a shield.
If the bending is caused by expansion of elements in the heater, provisions should be made to accommodate the
expansion without stress on the column.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Beams and girders can deflect when loads are imposed on them. The deflection should be measured where it is
greatest. The amount of deflection should be checked against that calculated for the load on the beam or girder. If the
measured deflection is greater than the calculated deflection, overstressing is indicated. If the overstress is serious,
the design should be investigated and corrective measures should be taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If corrosion in structural steel members that bear loads directly is so great that the thickness lost is enough to weaken
the part, the minimum cross-sectional areas should be measured carefully after the corroded part is cleaned
thoroughly to permit the determination of the remaining sound metal. When the measurement has been obtained and
the remaining sectional area has been determined, the section modulus should be calculated, and the design should
be checked to determine the stress. If the stress is sufficiently higher than the allowable stress, the weaker part
should be reinforced or replaced. Useful design information, including information about allowable working stresses,
can be found in AISC M015L and M016.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The connections between the columns and the beams and girders should be inspected visually. These connections
may be made by riveting, bolting, or welding. For riveted or bolted construction, broken or loose rivets or bolts can be
detected by striking the side of the rivet or bolt and by striking the plate. A movement of the rivet or bolt can indicate
that it is loose or broken. Inspection of all connections is not warranted, but inspection should be made where
corrosion is severe. If the connections are welded, corroded sections should be carefully visually inspected after
proper cleaning and the effect of lost metal thickness should be determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.3 Setting, Exterior, and Casing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The exposed parts of the setting should be inspected for signs of deterioration. All metal parts can be adequately
inspected with a hammer and visual examination. If the exposed parts are painted, a visual inspection should be
made to see whether the coating adheres tightly to all surfaces. Areas exposed by flaking or otherwise damaged
should be cleaned and repainted. The casing should be inspected for thinning or perforation due to acidic flue-gas
corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_86>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>78
API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stairways, walkways, and platforms should be checked to ensure that they have not been materially weakened as a
result of corrosion. Heater header boxes should be inspected for warpage and improper functioning. Warpage or
improper functioning of doors may allow rain or other moisture to enter. Header box warpage also allows excess air
into the heater, spending additional fuel. In some operations, particularly those with heaters that process light
hydrocarbons, a sudden change in temperature due to leakage of header boxes can cause enough movement in
fitting closures or rolls to loosen them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Peepholes, access doors, and the like should be inspected visually to see that the fit is satisfactory and minimizes
excess air ingress.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Explosion doors, if provided, should be inspected visually for corrosion of the hinges and the door itself and for
warpage. Explosion doors should also be visually inspected to see whether there is proper seating contact between
the door and the door frame, ensuring a reasonably tight joint. The doors should be manually lifted to check
operability. To serve effectively, the doors should open with minimum resistance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.4 Refractory Linings and Insulation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Most modern settings consist of structural steel framing with refractory lining or lightweight ceramic or blanket
insulation on the walls and roof of the heater. The refractory may be backed up with brick or supported on steel
members with heat-resistant hangers. The supporting brickwork and reinforced concrete and the clearance in the
expansion joints should be examined for deterioration due to heat, open joints, excessive distortion, or debris. The
inspection of refractory should consist of a visual examination for breakage, slagging, crumbling, and open joints.
Leakage of the hot heater gases through joints when the edges have crumbled or when the tile or insulating concrete
has fallen out exposes the supporting steel to high metal temperatures, rapid oxidation, and corrosion. Leakage of hot
heater gases outward instead of air leakage inward may indicate improper draft conditions in the firebox. The
supporting steelwork should be inspected thoroughly. Beams, hangers, and supports of any type that have been
damaged by heat or show excessive distortion should be replaced. Any accessible insulation used on the exterior
should be inspected. Overheating of the casing can cause the casing to warp leading to further damage to the lining.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Refractory linings should be inspected for excessive cracks, erosion, fluxing (melting of the refractory), bulging, and
fallout. Cracks in the refractory are common and expected. Only the degree of cracking is important. No rules are
established indicating what can or cannot be tolerated and so decisions are based on good practice, experience and
if available, consultation with one knowledgeable in refractories. If the refractory is determined to be severely cracked,
repairs should be made. Metal parts and insulation behind the refractory can become overheated and damaged if
these conditions persist.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The presence and extent of refractory erosion or fluxing should be determined. Erosion is caused by flame
impingement, high ash velocities, and inferior materials. Erosion may occur around burner throats, heater sidewalls,
and heater back walls. In boilers with waterwalls, erosion tends to occur in the refractory material between the tubes,
especially on back walls opposite burners. Fluxing is caused by inferior or improper materials, ash containing metal
oxides, or flame impingement. Fluxing may occur at almost any point, but locations in the direct path of the hot gases
may be most susceptible to fluxing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The depth of erosion or fluxing and the remaining thickness of the refractory should be measured. The depth of local
erosion or fluxing may be measured with a straight edge and rule. In areas around burner throats, the extent of
erosion or fluxing may be difficult to determine because of the circular or conical shape. Photographs or blueprints of
the original installation are helpful references in establishing the extent of erosion in these areas. The thickness of the
remaining refractory may be measured by drilling or cutting out a small piece in the suspected area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Castable refractory that has fallen out or bulged to a point that it is in danger of falling out should be replaced. The
area replaced should be in the form of a square or rectangle, and should be mechanically attached by replacing or
incorporating a minimum of two refractory anchors in the original pitch of anchor spacing in the repair and
“dovetailing” the patch. Edges of old refractory should be cut as rough a possible while maintaining a general
perpendicular line to the hot face side with a slight taper 10 °  to 15 °  making the hot face opening smaller than the back
to form a key. An area about 144 in. 2  (900 mm 2 ) should be the minimum area cut out and replaced. Prior to
installation of the patch, the substrate should be suitably “wetted” in accordance with material manufacturers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_87>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
79<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>direction. Bulging and fallout may be due to settlement of the anchor bolts, anchor brackets, or castings or of the
heater setting supports themselves. When bulging or fallout is encountered, the causes should be ascertained so that
corrective measures may be taken to prevent a recurrence. This often requires replacement or repair of refractory
anchors as well as castable for such repairs. Bulging or fallout in waterwalls may be due to failure of the tubes to
transfer the severe heat. In rare cases, this may be caused by too large a tube spacing, but it is generally caused by
blocked or clogged tubes. When excessive erosion or fluxing occurs in the lower section of a wall, the upper sections
may have insufficient support to the point that they can fall out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Infrared cameras can provide an indication of damaged refractory prior to shutdown. Damaged areas of insulation are
observed as higher surface metal temperatures on the casing of the heater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The condition of refractory linings in the combustion chamber, stacks, flue-gas ducts, observation and access doors,
and around burner ports should be inspected. Special attention should be given to the lining sections intended to
protect pressure parts and supports from overheating. If any of the refractory in the combustion chamber has fallen
out, the supporting steel will be exposed to excessive temperatures that will damage the steel. Linings in stacks and
ducts may also have areas where the refractory has fallen out. When this occurs, the outer structure is exposed to
temperatures that are greater, in most cases, than the material is capable of withstanding. Outer structures composed
of brick will develop cracks; outer structures composed of steel will buckle. Eventually, failures can occur unless
corrective measures are taken to replace the refractory. Entrance of air into a boiler, heater or stack, other than
through the burners or related openings, may cause inefficient and potentially dangerous boiler operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A visual survey of the heater should be made for air leakage into a balanced draft unit and for leakage out of a
positive pressure unit. Cracks and loose access and fire doors, peepholes, and joints permit air leakage. An artificial
smoke source—titanium tetrachloride, hydrated zinc chloride, or another source of smoke—placed close to the
cracks may be useful for the inspection. Use of smoke for the inspection should be done with due consideration of the
hazards associated with the materials and the appropriate personnel safety equipment. The material safety data
sheet for the type of smoke used should be consulted. Leakage into the heater, when such leaks are adjacent to the
structural steel supports, may result in temperature gradients of sufficient intensity to cause failure of the supports.
This is particularly likely to occur in areas where combustion is not complete and the concentration of carbon
monoxide is high.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.5 Tube Supports<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tube sheets and tube supports should be examined to determine their physical condition and fitness for further
service. Supports should be examined carefully for cracks, oxidation, corrosion, distortion, and sagging. If the tube
sheet and tube supports are found to be unsound or weak, they should be reinforced or replaced. Figure 41 shows a
tube support with evidence of creep and yielding. Table 5 is a listing of common tube support material and their
suggested maximum use temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.5.2 Steam Methane Reforming Heaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tube support methods vary in steam methane reforming heaters. Some designs require full support from the top. In
these designs the pigtail may be below the tube and unable to take any load from the catalyst-filled tube.
Counterweights are often used and may support two or more tubes. The lever or pulley system has to work as
designed. Interference from tube flange bolts, slipping of supports off tube flanges, and other similar problems have
led to pigtail failures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inadequate support also allows tube bending that puts a bending moment on a pigtail that exits the tube from the side,
thus causing localized high stress at the fitting on the tube or the outlet headers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Outlet headers grow usually from a center anchor point. Bottom tube supports on short pigtailed tubes have to allow
movement of the tube bottom to minimize stress on the pigtail. If the tube is designed for bottom movement, the upper<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If support springs are used, those that have been stretched should be replaced. A stretched spring cannot support a
tube as designed, especially when the tube is heated up after shutdown.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>13.6 Visual Inspection of Auxiliary Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to any external inspection of auxiliary equipment while the heater is in operation, a close inspection should
be made of each piece of equipment while the unit is out of operation. Indications of malfunctions noted during
external inspections should be investigated and any indicated repairs should be made. Since some parts wear out
and fail without warning, manufacturers’ catalogs and instructions should be reviewed so that all critical operating
parts may be investigated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.2 Dampers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Power-operated or manual dampers are provided on some but not all boilers for superheater, economizer, and boiler
outlet-gas control. Damper blades constructed of thin metal are susceptible to oxidation and warpage due to
overheating and should be inspected for such damage. Supporting brackets, driving rods, pins, and other devices
should also be examined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The dampers should be operated and checked for binding closure and freedom from obstructions should be ensured.
Damper position should be confirmed with both control board and exterior indication devices. Personnel, other than
those working on damper operation, should not be permitted in the damper section while the dampers are in
operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.3 Forced- and Induced-draft Fans<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bearing clearance and the condition of the babbit-bearing surfaces and of the antifriction bearings should be
checked and the shaft diameter should be measured at the bearing surface. The condition of the oil or grease should
be checked and the lubricant should be changed as required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The general condition of the rotor and rotor blades should be checked and loose blades should be fixed. Couplings
should be examined and the alignment of all parts should be inspected. If any parts are out of alignment, the cause
should be determined and corrective action should be taken. Any dampers should be tested for ease of operation and
freedom from obstruction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Induced-draft fans are subject to erosion and corrosive attacks from ash particles and flue gas. In addition to the
inspections discussed in preceding text, inspections of the rotor blades and casings should be made for corrosion,
excessive thinning, and holes in the blades and casing. The shaft should be examined for corrosion from dew-point
condensation near the casing. Missing or faulty gasket seals around the shaft allows the entry of cold air and lead to
condensation and subsequent corrosion. Rotor blade surfaces should be checked for cracks with magnetic particle
examination or penetrant examination focusing on stress riser locations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.4 Soot Blowers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Soot blowers can be a root cause for deterioration if they are not operating properly. Therefore, soot blower parts
should be inspected for proper alignment, position, and operability. If soot blowers are out of position or misaligned,
the blower blast may impinge on tubes and can eventually cause tube failure due to erosion. Soot blowers can also
be a source of liquid water that can promote dewpoint corrosion of tubes, casing and the blowers themselves. The
shut-off valve to the blowers should be checked to ensure it does not leak while in service. Condensate can form in
the system when the blower is out of service and can cause dewpoint corrosion if it leaks into the firebox.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The blower, supporting hangers, and brackets should be examined visually for soundness and for excessive thinning
from oxidation. Soot blowers for the high-temperature part of the boiler are sometimes composed of high-chromium
alloys that embrittle in service and so they should be handled and inspected appropriately to avoid fracture.
Connection welds of supporting elements should be inspected for cracks. If the welds look cracked, a magnetic
particle inspection should be made. Packing glands and all operating parts of the rotating and retracting types of soot<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_90>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>82
API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>blowers should be examined for good working condition. Because of the potential difficulty of repacking soot blowers
in service, repacking should be performed during down periods if there is any evidence that repacking might be
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.5 Air Preheaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Air preheaters are subject to corrosion due to condensation during extended periods of downtime or in operation if
dew point is reached. There are various conditions that can hinder an air preheaters ability to recover heat from
intended source. Specific to mechanical attributes, these are primarily associated with surface fouling and corrosion
of the transfer medium. When this occurs, system efficiency and unit capacity is adversely affected. The most
common conditions are fouling and corrosion. Fouling is caused by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) dust and debris pulled from the environment and resting on air side surface;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) sulfur deposits gathering on flue gas side surface due to reaching at or below dew point temperatures of the sulfur
(SOx) containing flue gas; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) ammonium salt build up on flue gas surface when cold block section within a Selective Catalytic Reduction system
reaches at or below dew point temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recuperative preheaters, both the tubular type and the plate type (see Figure 7) are subject to corrosion when the
element temperature is at or near the dew point. The corrosion is particularly prevalent at the cold air end. As much as
possible, the recuperative-type preheaters should be inspected for corrosion. Typically the conditions at the inlet and
outlet ends provide a good indication of what can be expected in the remainder of the preheater. It is not unusual to
see extensive plugging of air preheaters when boilers are being fired with heavy oil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Poor ductwork design characteristics can be a contributing factor if cold end corrosion persists in recuperative air
preheaters after the implementation of continuous flue gas exit temperature control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Damaged tubes or plates within recuperative air preheaters can be replaced or plugged. It is sometimes necessary to
remove fairly good tubes or plates to get to the bad ones. Good judgment and consideration for future replacements
are important factors in selecting the most economical method for repairing tubes and plates. Some manufacturers
have available replacements parts that are provided with corrosion resistance coating or higher grade materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Frequently, air preheater efficiency can be calculated to determine if its surface area is fouled or damaged. A heat
balance can be performed around the air preheater to determine if it is leaking from the air-side into the flue gas-side.
The quantity of leakage can be determined by measuring the oxygen on both sides of the air preheater. Fouling or
other damage could be determined by measurement of the flue gas pressure differential across the air preheater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Regenerative preheaters (see Figure 8) require a more extensive inspection than do recuperative preheaters.
Typically rotating elements have to be removed to clean the preheater. This affords an opportunity for close inspection
of all parts. In most classes of regenerative preheaters, the incoming air enters at the same end that the flue gases
leave, thus cooling that layer of rotor segments first. Corrosion generally starts at this point because of condensation
and proceed toward the other end of the unit. Most preheaters have two sections, and if corrosion at the flue-gas exit
ends is not too severe, the sections can be reversed; otherwise, new sections should be provided. Figure 42 shows
examples of acidic dew point corrosion of an air preheater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Rotor seals should be examined for corrosion. They can also be mechanically damaged by falling material, by high-
pressure steam or water from soot blowers, or by being stepped on by maintenance personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Soot blowers for regenerative preheaters are quite different from those used in other parts of the boiler.
Manufacturers’ catalogs and drawings should be examined for points that require close inspection. Soot blowers
should be inspected for deposits and leaky valves. Leaky valves and buildup of ash cause corrosion of nozzle tips,
and subsequent malfunction of the blowers damages rotor seals and segments. Therefore, steam inlet valves should
be inspected for tight shutoff and drain valves should be inspected for correct operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.6 Boiler Blowdown Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Valves should be inspected for tight shutoff. Piping should be checked for corrosion and leakage at all joints.
Ultrasonic examination and hammer sounding are good methods of pipe inspection. Elbows and sharp bends are
susceptible to erosion and should be examined for indications of thin walls and holes. Coolers should be inspected in
the same manner as that described for heat exchangers in API Recommended Practice 572.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.7 Fuel-handling Equipment and Piping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Manufacturers’ instructions, sketches, and drawings should be consulted before inspecting fuel-handling equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_92>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>84
API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.7.2 Gas<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Gas system equipment is not generally subjected to severe corrosion or wear and, therefore, does not require
extensive inspection. This might not be true for heaters and boilers firing refinery fuel gas. The seats and packing of
control valves, block valves, and bypass valves should be examined, and the valves should be checked for ease of
operation and tight shutoff. Burner inspection depends on the type of burner to be inspected. Typically operating
conditions indicate the condition of burners. Malfunctioning may be due to fouled or cracked burners or burned burner
tips. When the system contains a dry or knockout drum, planning is advisable so that the drum can be removed from
service for inspection as required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.7.3 Fuel-oil Pumps<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fuel-oil pumps should be inspected to ensure that they meet the standards called for when originally purchased (refer
to applicable API standards). Fuel-oil heaters should be inspected as indicated in API Recommended Practice 572.
Valves and burners should be inspected as indicated in the preceding text for gas equipment valves and burners.
When the fuel contains corrosive products, all items should be examined for evidence of corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.6.8 Burners<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Burners should be visually inspected to ensure proper operation once per shift. Conditions that need to be corrected
include flame impingement on tubes and supports, abnormal flame dimensions and pattern, oil drippage, and smokey
combustion. In addition, the burners should provide an even heat distribution. Poor firing from unbalanced burners
can cause serious deterioration of the heating elements and setting. Defective burners that cannot be repaired in
service should be replaced so that they do not lead to premature failure of other components. Prior to undertaking a
repair, burner drawings from the burner vendor should be reviewed for the installation tolerances, tile diameter and tip
drilling information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Burner plugging problems sometimes can be solved by proper sizing of the fuel drum and demister pad, heat tracing
the fuel gas delivery lines, and providing filters or coalescing systems. Regardless, deposits should be analyzed to
determine if the source of the plugging can be identified and eliminated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following guidelines are general recommendations for maintenance outage inspection. Always consult the
guidelines from the burner vendor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) The burner tile is an air orifice. It controls the amount of air flow. Since it is extremely desirable to have even air
flow to each burner, the tile dimensions are critical. Typical installation tolerance is ± 1 / 8  in. (0.32 cm) on the
diameter as shown on the burner drawing. Measure the diameter in three to four locations. Most round tiles are
installed as a slight oval shape. This can result in poor fuel-air mixing and a bad flame shape. Burner tiles should
not be cracked or spalled. The use of a plywood template helps set the tiles in the proper diameter and
concentricity. The burner tile has to be centered on the gas tip to obtain uniform fuel air mixing. Typical installation
tolerance is ± 1 / 8  in. (0.32 cm). Poor installations result in bad flames as shown in Figure 43.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Check the burner drawing for the number of tip drillings and the drill bit size of the port. Use drill bits to check the
proper hole size and the proper included angle of the drillings. Do not mix parts from other burners. Be sure to
install tips with high-temperature anti-seize compound.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The installation tolerance on gas risers is typically ± 1 / 8  in. (0.32 cm) on horizontal spacing and ± 1 / 8  in. (0.32 cm)
on vertical spacing. Bent gas risers can cause these dimensions to be wrong. A common problem is different
lengths on the gas risers. Many burners are designed such that the gas jets intersect in the center of the burner.
The tips usually have arrows or cutouts to aid in tip orientation. Welding rods can be a valuable check for
alignment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Air dampers and registers should be checked for operability. Sticking air registers and dampers are a problem.
Sometimes, dry graphite lubricant can improve air register operability. Penetrating oil, grease fittings and the
addition of bearings to damper shafts can improve operability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Burners should be visually inspected to determine tip condition and leakage, tile condition, and proper tip
alignment. This should assist in preplanning prior to shutdown.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
If maintenance is deemed necessary and the burner is shut in, the offline inspection should include checking
dimensions to match manufacturer drawings and documentation. This should include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) riser height,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) tip position, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) tip drilling size. If port holes are greater than one drilling sizes from the original, then the tip should be replaced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) While servicing the burner, overall material integrity should be inspected. This should include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) checking tips for blockage or erosion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) tile damage and repair;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) check that internal consumables are in good order including any fiber gaskets or washer materials; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) confirm registers have full range of motion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>86
API P UBLICATION  R ECOMMENDED  P RACTICE  573<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h) Prior to returning to service, tip and riser connections in heat exposed areas should be checked to verify that high
temperature anti-seize compound is used to make-up connections. Silicon tape should not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
If burner tiles are replaced, new base grouting should be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.7 Stacks<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An external visual inspection should be made of brick, concrete, and steel stacks for conditions that may weaken
these structures. Field glasses should be helpful in making inspections of high stacks because they can permit any
defects to be observed fairly well from the ground. Brick stacks should be inspected for cracks and for the condition of
mortar joints to determine the effect of weathering. Concrete stacks should be inspected for cracks and spalling that
may expose the steel reinforcement. Steel stacks should be inspected externally for the condition of painted surfaces,
signs of oxidation, and thinning or perforation due to corrosion by acidic flue gases. A crane and man basket may be
used for inspection of the stack. The use of a crane and man basket should be reviewed by appropriate site Safety
personnel prior to inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In many cases, cracks in brick and concrete stacks are a result of insufficient thickness of the internal insulation or to
internal secondary combustion. These potential causes of cracks should be kept in mind when inspecting the interior
of stacks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The linings of all stacks should be inspected for cracks, wear, and structural soundness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While stacks are in service, an external, infrared thermographic examination can be made that shows hot spots that
indicate failure of the internal liner.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When liquid fuels are burned, soot accumulates in the base of the stack and should be removed occasionally. During
the internal inspection, the amount of soot and ash should be noted, and whether they need to be removed should be
decided. The inside of steel stacks should be inspected for corrosion or cracking due to condensation of acidic flue
gases. Areas at or adjacent to welds are most susceptible to stress corrosion cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steel stacks in heater and boiler services should be inspected and checked for wall thickness at time intervals that are
warranted by experience. In addition to the thickness determination, a thorough hammer inspection should be made
of the entire stack with particular attention paid to the seams, adjacent areas, and areas adjoining any stiffening rings,
lugs, nozzles, and the like, which may act as cooling fins to cause condensation of gases and localized corrosion. The
minimum allowable thickness at which repairs can be made should be definitely established for such structures. One
practice is to establish these thicknesses on the same basis as was used in the original design for the structure (see
Figure 44).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bolts at the base flange and at elevated sections should be checked periodically for loosening and breakage.
Elevated flanged connections that are installed for the purposes of field erection should be seal welded internally to
prevent the escape of corrosive flue gases that accelerate bolt failure. In the case of derrick-type flare stacks, the
structure itself should be completely inspected. Careful attention should be given to the foundations and anchor bolts.
Most derricks are assembled by welding or bolting. Bolts should be checked for looseness and corrosion. If looseness
is found, the shank of the bolt should be checked for abrasion from the movement of structural members. The flare-
stack roller guides and guide arms should be checked for alignment and operability and should be realigned or freed
if necessary. Ladders, platforms, and all structural members should be checked for atmospheric corrosion to
determine whether any section is approaching the minimum allowable thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The guy lines to guyed steel stacks should be inspected visually for corrosion. The wire rope should be inspected for:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) reduced diameter due to internal or external corrosion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) corroded or broken wires at end connections, especially at the deadman and the top of the stack, where moisture
can be retained;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Electromagnetic inspection techniques based upon flux leakage principles are available for inspecting wire rope as
well. These technologies involve a crawler capable of inspecting the length of wire for localized strand defects and
general thinning of the wire cross-section. This allows for a quantitative assessment of the wire integrity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lightning rods on stacks and their grounding cables should be inspected visually to see that they are secured and
unbroken. The ground rod should be inspected visually to see that it is firmly attached to the cable and that it extends
to a ground depth sufficient to provide an electrical resistance not to exceed 25 ohms. This should be checked
periodically, particularly in dry weather.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ladders on steel, concrete, and brick stacks should be inspected visually for corrosion and should be tested
physically by applying test weights in excess of those that may be imposed by the personnel using them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The caps on radial brick and concrete stacks sometimes become damaged, causing loose brick to fall or the
reinforcing steel to be exposed. Stack caps should be inspected visually so that any necessary repairs can be made,
thereby eliminating a hazard from falling bricks and preventing damage to steel reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14 Repairs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.1 Heaters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repairs necessary to restore mechanical integrity to pressure retaining components and modifications made to
pressure retaining components in heaters should follow the principles of the design and fabrication codes most
applicable to the work. The following issues need to be considered when developing repair and modification plans
and implementing them. This is not all-inclusive as other factors may need to be considered for specific situations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) repairs and modifications are engineered to meet the requirements of the service including material selection;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) weld procedures qualified to ASME Section IX for the material and technique appropriate for the welding that
needs to be performed;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) welders certified and qualified per ASME Section IX for the procedures to be used;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) weld details are defined including any surface preparation, joint preparation, weld joint design, and preheat
temperature;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) NDE techniques to be used and the acceptance criteria, and any immediate inspection hold points need to be
defined;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
heat treatment requirements for repair welds; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g) any required pressure testing and the acceptance criteria of the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.2 Boilers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Repairs and alterations made to boilers should be performed to the applicable codes and jurisdictional requirements
appropriate for the locality. As indicated earlier, jurisdictions typically define which types of boilers are legislated and
the appropriate repair and alteration requirements. Most often, NB-23 should be the code to which repairs and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_97>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>I NSPECTION   OF  F IRED  B OILERS   AND  H EATERS
89<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>alterations are performed for legislated boilers. Where there are not any governing codes or jurisdictional
requirements, the repairs and alterations should follow the principles of the design and fabrication codes most
applicable to the work. Any repairs and alterations need to be considered factors similar to those defined in 14.1 for
heaters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14.3
Materials Verification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials used in repairs should be verified that they meet the materials specified for the repair (e.g. tube materials
and welding consumables). Alloy verification is critical to ensure the appropriate material is actually used and
installed. Inadvertent substitution with another material can result in premature failure from corrosion, cracking, and
stress rupture. Verifying materials often involves testing to show and indicate the proper chemistry. Testing can be
accomplished with the use of suitable portable methods (i.e. chemical spot testing, optical spectrographic analyzers
or x-ray fluorescent analyzers). Refer to API Recommended Practice 578 for additional information on material
verification programs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15
Records and Reports<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Boiler and heater owners and users should maintain permanent and progressive records for their equipment.
Permanent records should be maintained throughout the service life of the equipment and progressive records should
be regularly updated to include new information pertinent to the operation, inspection and maintenance history of the
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Records should contain at least the following types of information regarding mechanical integrity:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Construction and design information. This may include equipment serial number, manufacturers’ data sheet,
design specification data, design calculations, and construction drawings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Operating and inspection history. Operating conditions, including abnormal operations, that may affect equipment
reliability, inspection data reports, analysis of data, and inspection recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Repairs, design and mechanical changes. Repairs should be documented as to the reason for the repair and the
specific details of the repair. Similarly, any changes made to the design or mechanical components should be
recorded detailing the nature of the changes. Standard report forms are often required to be filled out when any
repair or design change is made. In addition, any supporting data and calculations to support the repair or design
changes should be included in the record.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The importance of maintaining complete records to mechanical reliability cannot be overemphasized. Inspection
records form the basis for determining reliability and establishing a preventive maintenance program. With detailed,
complete records, repairs and replacements can be predicted and planned avoiding emergency shutdowns. Planned
work saves time and cost by allowing personnel and materials to be scheduled prior to a shutdown. These records
also provide a means to identify repetitive problems or issues that can be addressed in preparing company
specifications for new equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection reports should be clear and complete. All unusual conditions observed should be reported fully, as what
seem to be insignificant details may prove to be of importance in the future. When necessary, sketches, diagrams,
and photographs should be incorporated in the report. There should be no unnecessary delay between the inspection
and the submission of the report. Sample reports are shown in Annex B and Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>These checklists are examples of the areas and type of information the inspector
should focus on during an inspection. They are not intended to be all inclusive since
there are a variety of heater and boiler designs that may have particular issues that
need to be addressed in an inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Sample Heater Inspection Records<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex B reproduces samples of the records maintained by a company on the tubes and fittings of its heater. All of
these records are used as field records, office records, and completed forms included in the report covering the
inspection of the heater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  tube layout drawing  shows the actual arrangement of tubes and fittings in the heater. The flow through the heater
is also noted. Tubes removed from the heater during the inspection and tubes approaching the minimum allowable
thickness for service can be noted by a special color scheme.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  tube inspection record  shows the history of all tubes in a heater on the date the current inspection is completed
and the heater is ready to return to operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  tube inspection record (record of tubes calipered)  is used to record the tube-calipering measurements taken
during the current inspection. The figures set in roman type on the top half of each block are the measurements taken
during the previous inspection. The figures set in italic type on the bottom half are the measurements taken during the
current inspection. The two-digit figures to the right of the inside diameter measurements denote the change in inside
diameter from the previous inspection and equal twice the corrosion rate for the interval between the two inspections.
Once the report has been prepared, an extra copy should be made of this record and used as a field work sheet
during the next inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  tube inspection record (instrument caliperings)  is used to record tube thickness measurements taken by
radiography or with ultrasonic or radiation-type instruments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  tube renewal record  is used to record information on all of the tubes renewed during the interval between the
completion of the previous inspection and the completion of the current inspection. It quickly shows the location of the
tubes renewed, why the tubes were renewed and how long the tubes had been in service. This record is especially
valuable when tube life and what tube material is best suited for the particular service are considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  field work and record sheet (tube rolling data)  is used to record data necessary for the tube rolling operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The  record of heater fitting inspection and replacement  is primarily a reference record for heater fittings and shows
where the various types of fittings should be checked for thickness. It contains a table for recording the actual outside
diameters of a fitting at the various sections. Each point number on a sketch corresponds to a section of a fitting and
not to a particular point on the fitting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
