<<HEADING level=3>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard covers the requirements and method for evaluating the performance of valves when they are
exposed to defined fire conditions. The performance requirements establish limits of acceptability of a valve,
regardless of size or pressure rating. The burn period has been established to represent the maximum time
required to extinguish most fires. Fires of longer duration are considered to be of major magnitude with
consequences greater than those anticipated in the test. The test pressure during the burn is set at 0.2 MPa (30
psig) for nonmetallic seated valves rated Class 150 and Class 300 to better simulate the conditions that would be
expected in a process plant when a fire is detected and pumps are shut down. In this case, the source of pressure
in the system is the hydrostatic head resulting from liquid levels in towers and vessels. This situation is
approximated by this lower test pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In production facilities, valves are typically of a higher rating and the pressure source is not easily reduced when a
fire is detected. Therefore, for all other valves, the test pressure during the burn is set at a higher value to better
simulate the expected service conditions in these facilities. Use of this standard assumes that the execution of its
provisions is entrusted to appropriately qualified and experienced personnel because it calls for procedures that
may be injurious to health if adequate precautions are not taken. This standard refers only to technical suitability
and does not absolve the user from legal obligations relating to health and safety at any stage of the procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Fire Test for Quarter-turn Valves and Valves Equipped with Nonmetallic Seats<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1  Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard specifies fire type-testing requirements and a fire type-test method for confirming the
pressure-containing capability of quarter-turn valves and other valves with nonmetallic seating under pressure
during and after the fire test. It does not cover the testing requirements for valve actuators other than manually
operated gear boxes or similar mechanisms when these form part of the normal valve assembly. Other types of
valve actuators (e.g. electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic) may need special protection to operate in the
environment considered in this valve test, and the fire testing of such actuators is outside the scope of this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For the purposes of this standard, the terms “fire type-test” and “fire test” are synonymous.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3 Terms and Definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1
asymmetric seated valve
Valve with an internal construction that has no plane of symmetry perpendicular to the axis of the body ends.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This is a valve with a single seat offset from the shaft centerline.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2
Class
An alphanumeric designation that is used for reference purposes related to valve pressure-temperature
capability, taking into account valve material mechanical properties and valve dimensional characteristics. It
comprises the letters Class followed by a dimensionless whole number. The number following the letters Class
does not represent a measurable value and is not used for calculation purposes except where specified in this
standard. The allowable pressure for a valve having a Class number depends on the valve material and its
application temperature and is to be found in tables of pressure-temperature ratings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
DN
An alphanumeric designation of size that is common for components used in a piping system, used for reference
purposes, comprising the letters DN followed by a dimensionless number indirectly related to the physical size of
the bore or outside diameter of the end connection, as appropriate. The dimensionless number following DN does
not represent a measurable value and is not used for calculation purposes except where specified in this
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.4
NPS
An alphanumeric designation of size that is common for components used in a piping system, used for reference
purposes, comprising the letters NPS followed by a dimensionless number indirectly related to the physical size<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>of the bore or outside diameter of the end connection, as appropriate. The dimensionless number may be used as
a valve size identifier without the prefix NPS. The dimensionless size identification number does not represent a
measurable value and is not used for calculation purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5
symmetric seated valve
Valve with an internal construction that has a plane of symmetry perpendicular to the axis of the body ends.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This is a valve where both seat sealing elements are identical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4  Test Conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Direction and Conditions for Valves to Be Tested<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1  Symmetric seated valves intended by the manufacturer for bidirectional installation shall be tested in one
direction only.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2  Asymmetric seated valves intended by the manufacturer for bidirectional installation shall be tested by
carrying out the burn test procedure twice, once in each direction of the potential installation. The same valve may
be refurbished and re-tested, or another, identical, valve may be tested in the other direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.3  Valves intended solely for unidirectional installation shall be clearly and permanently marked as such and
shall be tested in the stated direction of installation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.4  If the valve being tested is fitted with a gearbox or other such manual device, then only that particular
assembly shall qualify. If a valve can be supplied with or without a gearbox, testing with a gearbox fitted shall
qualify valves without a gearbox but not the converse. Grease may be removed from a gearbox prior to testing for
safety purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.5  Valves (and gearboxes) shall not be protected with insulation material of any form during testing, except
where such protection is part of the design of the component(s).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.6
Prior to initiating the test, inspection requirements and testing by the valve manufacturer shall have been
completed on the valve in accordance with API Standard 598 or applicable production testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Pressure Relief Provision<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the valve under test incorporates a pressure relief device as part of its standard design and if this device
activates during the fire test, then the test shall be continued and any leakage to atmosphere from the device shall
be measured and counted as external leakage. If the design is such that the device vents to the downstream side
of the valve, then any leakage shall be counted as through-seat leakage (see 5.6.12 and 5.6.14). However, the
test shall be stopped if the system pressure relief device described in 5.3.2.8 activates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5  Fire Test Method<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General Warning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fire testing of valves is potentially hazardous, and it is essential that the safety of personnel be given prime
consideration. Given the nature of the fire test and the possibility of weaknesses in the design of the test valve
and test equipment, hazardous rupture of the pressure boundary could occur. Adequate shields in the area of the
test enclosure and other appropriate means for the protection of personnel are necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A closed valve completely filled with water under pressure is completely enveloped in flames with an
environmental temperature in the region of the valve of 750 °C to 1000 °C (1400 °F to 1800 °F) for a period of 30<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_9>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>F IRE  T EST FOR  Q UARTER - TURN  V ALVES AND  V ALVES  E QUIPPED WITH  N ONMETALLIC  S EATS

<<PARAGRAPH>>minutes. The objective is to completely envelop the valve in flames to ensure that the seat and sealing areas are
exposed to the high burn temperature. The intensity of the heat input shall be monitored using thermocouples and
calorimeter cubes as specified in 5.6.9 and 5.6.10. During this period, the internal and external leakage is
recorded. After cooldown from the fire test, the valve is tested to assess the pressure-containing capability of the
valve shell, seats, and seals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test equipment shall not subject the valve to externally applied stress affecting the results of the test.
Schematic diagrams of recommended systems for fire type-testing of valves are given in Figure 1. Potential
pipework-to-valve end connection joint leakage is not evaluated as part of the test and is not included in the
allowable external leakage (see 6.3 and 6.6). For the purposes of this test, it may be necessary to modify these
joints to eliminate leakage. The test equipment shall be designed so that if the nominal diameter of the pipework
situated immediately upstream of the test valve is larger than DN 25 or one-half the DN of the test valve, the
pipework shall be enveloped in flames for a minimum distance of 150 mm (6 in.) from the test valve. The diameter
of the upstream pipework shall be sufficient to deliver a flow rate in excess of the maximum allowable leak rate for
the size of the valve being tested. The pipework downstream of the test valve shall be at least DN 15 and shall be
inclined so that the downstream side is fully drained. The flame source shall be at least 150 mm (6 in.) minimum
away from the valve or any calorimeters and should have sufficient capacity to completely envelop the valve in
flames. The enclosure containing the valve shall provide a horizontal clearance of a minimum of 150 mm (6 in.)
between any part of the test valve and the enclosure, and the height of the enclosure above the top of the test
valve shall be a minimum of 150 mm (6 in.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2 Specific Apparatus<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2.1 Vapor trap  to minimize the cooling effect of the upstream liquid. See Figure 1, (8).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2.2 Industrial pressure measurement devices  having a full-scale reading of between 1.5 and 4 times the
pressure being measured. The accuracy of each test device used at any point on the scale shall be within 3 % of
its maximum scale value for readings taken both up and down the scale with either increasing or decreasing
pressure. See Figure 1, (7) (14).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2.3 Calorimeter cubes  made of carbon steel in accordance with the design and dimensions shown in
Figure 2, with a thermocouple of the accuracy specified in 5.3.2.4, located in the center of each cube. Calorimeter
cubes shall be scale free before exposure to the fire environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2.4 Flame environment and valve body thermocouples  of an accuracy at least equal to tolerance class 2
for type B or tolerance class 3 for other types as specified in IEC 60584-2. See Figure 1, (13).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2.5 Containers  of a size suitable for collecting the water leaked from the valve under test. See Figure 1, (18).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2.6 Calibrated sight gauge  or device for measuring the water used during the test. See Figure 1, (4).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2.7 Calibrated device for measuring the leakage water  collected during the test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2.8 Pressure relief provision , incorporated in the system, consisting of a pressure relief valve to relieve the
test valve center cavity pressure to the atmosphere, to protect against potential rupture of the valve if it is
designed such that liquid can be trapped in the cavity. See Figure 1, (14). The pressure relief valve setting shall be
either a) that determined by the valve manufacturer from data obtained by hydrostatic pressure testing of valves
of the same size and type as the fire-tested valve or b) when pressure test data are not available, a setting not
greater than 1.5 times the maximum allowable working pressure at 20 °C (70 °F). The maximum allowable
working pressure depends on materials, design, and working temperatures and is to be selected from the tables
of pressure-temperature ratings given in the appropriate standards such as ASME B16.34.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.1  Mount the test valve in the test apparatus so that the stem and bore of the valve are in the horizontal
position. Mount a valve that operates in only one direction (unidirectional) in their normal operating position.
Locate the flame environment, body thermocouples, and calorimeter cubes in the positions shown in Figures 3
and 4, as appropriate. For nonmetallic seated valves up to DN 100 or NPS 4 and pressure ratings up to Class
300, use two flame environment thermocouples and two body thermocouples and calorimeter cubes as shown in
Figure 3. For all other valves, use two flame environment thermocouples and two calorimeter cubes as shown in
Figure 4. For valves DN 200 or NPS 8 and larger, use the third calorimeter cubes as shown in Figure 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.2  With the test valve in the partially open position, open the water supply valve (5), the shut-off valve (6), the
vent valves (16), and the shut-off valve (15) to flood the system and purge the air. When the system is completely
filled with water, close the shut-off valve (15), the vent valves (16), and the water supply valve (5). Pressurize the
system with water to a test pressure of 1.4 times the maximum allowable working pressure at 20 °C (70 °F)—the
actual test pressure may be rounded up to the next highest bar 1 . Check for leaks in the test apparatus and
eliminate as necessary. Release the pressure, close the test valve, and open the shut-off valve (15).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.3  If the valve under test is of the upstream sealing type, determine the volume of water that is trapped
between the upstream seat seal and the downstream seat seal when the valve is closed. Record this volume. It is
assumed that, during the fire type-test, this volume of water will flow through the valve and pass the downstream
seat seal to be collected in the container (18). Since this volume has not actually leaked through the upstream
seat seal, it is deducted from the total volume collected in the downstream container when determining the
through-seat leakage (see 5.6.11).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.4  Pressurize the system to one or the other of the following pressures, as appropriate:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  for nonmetallic seated valves rated Class 150 and Class 300, the low test pressure at 0.2 MPa (30 psig);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  for all other valves, the high test pressure at 75 % of the maximum permissible seat working pressure at 20 °C<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>(70 °F). Maintain this test pressure during the burn and cool-down periods, momentary pressure losses of up
to 50 % of the test pressure being permitted provided that the pressure recovers within 2 minutes and the
cumulative duration is less than 2 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.5  Record the reading on the calibrated sight gauge or device (4). Empty the container (18).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.6  Adjust the test system, excluding the test valve, during the test period to maintain the temperatures and
pressures required.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.7  Open the fuel supply, establish a fire, and monitor the flame environment temperature throughout the burn
period of 30 minutes, +5, −0 minutes. Check that the average temperature of the two flame environment
thermocouples (13) reaches 750 °C (1400 °F) within 2 minutes from the start of the burn period, i.e. from ignition
of the burners. Maintain the average temperature between 750 °C and 1000 °C (1400 °F to 1800 °F), with no
reading less than 700 °C (1300 °F) for the remainder of the burn period of 30 minutes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.8
If cavity pressure exceeds the stated manufacturer’s allowable pressure, the test shall end and be
reported as an invalid test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.9
The average temperature of the calorimeter cubes shall be 650 °C (1200 °F) within 15 minutes of starting
the burn period. For the remainder of the burn period, maintain the minimum average temperature of 650 °C
(1200 °F), with no temperature falling to less than 560 °C (1000 °F). For valves subjected to the low-pressure test
(see 5.6.4), the body thermocouple shall maintain 590 °C (1100 °F) for at least 5 minutes and the bonnet
thermocouple shall maintain 650 °C (1200 °F) for at least 15 minutes of the burn period. The burn period may be
extended by up to 5 minutes in order to achieve this requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.10  Record instrument readings (7), (12), (13), (14) every 30 seconds during the burn period. Thermocouples
should be numbered, and individual records of temperature shall be recorded.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.11  At the end of the burn period (30 minutes, +5, −0 minutes), shut off the fuel supply.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.12  Immediately determine the amount of water collected in the container (18) and establish the total
through-seat leakage during the burn period. If the test valve is an upstream sealing type (see 5.6.3), deduct the
volume of water trapped between the upstream seat seal and the downstream seat seal. Continue collecting
water in the container (18) for use in establishing the external leakage rate of the test valve during the burn and
cool-down periods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.13  Within 5 minutes of extinguishing the fire, force-cool the test valve with water so that its external surface
temperature remains below 100 °C (212 °F); the time for cooling shall not exceed 10 minutes. Record the time
taken to force-cool the external surface of the valve below 100 °C (212 °F).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Warning—The internal parts of the valve could remain at significantly higher temperatures than the
external surface of the valve.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6.14  Check and adjust the test pressure in accordance with 5.6.4. Record the readings on the sight gauge (4)
and determine the quantity of water in the container (18). Record any leakage through the external pressure relief
device if fitted as part of the standard design. The figures are used to calculate the total external leakage
throughout the burn and cool-down periods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.5 Operability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the completion of fire testing, the operability of the valve shall be checked. While the valve is in the closed
position, the full test pressure (5.6.4) shall be applied against the closure member. The valve shall be cycled from
the fully closed to the fully open position using the operator fitted to the test valve. Due to the temperature of the
test, high pressures within the valve may be at a level that may compromise the pressure boundary integrity.
Extension handles are allowed to protect the operating personnel from risks associated with potential loss of
containment during the valve operation. The use of extension handles shall not result in an applied torque that is
higher than that available from the fitted operator.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7 Qualification of Other Valves by Representative Size, Pressure Rating, and<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Materials of Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instead of testing each nominal size and nominal pressure rating of a given valve design, all valves of the same
basic design (type, model, and/or configuration), as the test valve, may be deemed to have been fire-tested,
subject to the following limitations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)  A test valve may be used to qualify valves larger than the test valve but not exceeding twice the nominal size<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of the test valve (see 7.3). A size DN 200 or NPS 8 test valve qualifies all larger sizes. If the minimum size of
a given range of valves is greater than DN 200 or NPS 8, then the minimum size of the range shall be tested to
qualify all sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)  A DN 50 (NPS 2) valve may be used to qualify all smaller sizes of valve of the same types. If the maximum size<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>of a given range of valves is smaller than DN 50 or NPS 2, then the maximum size of the range shall be tested
to qualify all sizes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)  A test valve may be used to qualify valves with higher Class ratings but not exceeding twice the Class rating of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the test valve, except as shown in Tables 3 and 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)  A reduced bore (or Venturi pattern) test valve may be used to qualify a smaller nominal size full bore (or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>regular pattern) valve when the components associated with the obturator, seat seals, and stem are identical
in design and size. In such a case, the permissible average leakage rates are those applicable to the full bore
(or regular pattern) valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)  The type of valve body ends is not considered by this standard. However, the mass of the valve is determined<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>in part by the body end type. For qualification to the present standard, and providing that all other qualification
criteria have been met, valves with ends different to those of the test valve may also qualify provided that their
mass is greater than that of the test valve or their mass is not less than 75 % of that of the test valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Materials of Construction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1  For the purposes of product compliance certification or type testing systems, the materials of construction
of the pressure-retaining envelope of the valve shall be deemed to qualify other materials of construction within
the generic classifications below:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ferritic,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— austenitic,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— duplex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.3  If a range of valves is covered by testing of ferritic test valves then the type-testing coverage may be
extended to cover austenitic or duplex materials by carrying out a further test on  a single valve of each material.
For product lines NPS 2 and below, the valve shall be of the maximum size of the product range. For those where
the product line extends to larger sizes, the valve shall be equal to or greater than the median size in the ferritic
testing. Other materials of construction of the pressure-retaining envelope of the valve require full testing of
representative size and pressure ratings as specified in 7.3 and 7.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.4  Alloy steel bolting (e.g. B7, L7) used as part of the valve’s pressure-retaining envelope may be used to
qualify austenitic steel bolting but not vice versa.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.5  Any change in nonmetallic materials with respect to the seat-to-closure member seal, seat-to-body seal,
stem seal, and body joint seal require a re-qualification. Filled PTFE, however, may qualify non-filled PTFE and
vice versa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Qualification of Valves by Nominal Size<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The valves of other nominal sizes that may be deemed to have been fire type-tested relative to the actual valve
tested are given in Tables 2 and 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
