<<HEADING level=3>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO
member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical
committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the
right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison
with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by
the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard
requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights.
ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard was developed jointly with API 614 5th edition. ISO 10438 is divided into four parts
corresponding to the four chapters of API 614.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Users of ISO 10438 should be aware that further or differing requirements can be needed for individual applications.
ISO 10438 is not intended to inhibit a vendor from offering, or the purchaser from accepting, alternative equipment or
engineering solutions for the individual application. This may be particularly appropriate where there is innovative or
developing technology. Where an alternative is offered, the vendor should identify any variations from ISO 10438 and
provide details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 10438 requires the purchaser to specify certain details and features.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>•<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A bullet (
) at the beginning of a clause or subclause indicates that either a decision is required or further
information is to be provided by the purchaser. This information should be indicated on the datasheet(s); otherwise it
should be stated in the quotation request or in the order.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this International Standard, United States customary (USC) units are included in brackets for information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

pressure-limiting valve
PLV
automatic pressure-limiting device, which opens in proportion to the increase in pressure over the opening set
pressure and automatically closes when the upstream pressure is reduced below the set pressure, and which is
actuated by the static pressure upstream of the valve<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
These devices are not necessarily tight shutoff when closed, i.e. they may have a small leakage flow when closed.
These devices are designed for liquid service only and are normally used for limiting the discharge pressure of positive-
displacement-type oil pumps and the downstream pressure of fail-open oil-pressure regulating valves when necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
PLVs require a flowing test system in order to test. Normally, these valves are, therefore, tested in the system on
which they are installed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3.2.1
Shutdown functions shall be initiated by local, direct-acting switches connected in a normally
de-energized circuit.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3.2.2
Alarm functions shall be comprised of locally mounted transmitters (electronic or pneumatic, as

Each transmitter shall be independently connected to one of three independent, multi-point, electronic,
scanning-type monitors for each transmitter input.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3.3.3
The shutdown and alarm function outputs from the three instruments shall be connected through
“two-out-of-three” voting logic and shall allow the operation of any one alarm or shutdown function to initiate an
alarm. Operation of two shutdown functions monitoring the same parameter initiates a separate alarm and shall
cause the served equipment to shutdown. If any one transmitter is faulty, then the remaining two transmitters vote
“one-out-of-two” for shutdown. If a second transmitter becomes faulty, then the system shuts down the served
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.3.3.4
Alarm functions not associated with a shutdown function shall be provided with one single transmitter.
The detailed arrangement should be jointly developed by the purchaser and the vendor or vendors of the system
and the served equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This arrangement (Arrangement 3) has the following advantages.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Any shutdown or alarm function can be tested at any time with the equipment in service without the need to disarm any
part of the system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The test liquid shall be at a higher temperature than the nil-ductility transition temperature of the material being
tested. See ASTM E1003.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
The nil-ductility temperature is the highest temperature at which a material experiences complete brittle fracture
without appreciable plastic deformation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Alternately, by prior agreement, the piping spools may be tested individually instead of an assembled hydro test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Removal of spools, screens or the loosening of flanges does not void the original hydro test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2.3
If the part tested is to operate at a temperature at which the strength of a material is below the
strength of that material at the testing temperature, the hydrostatic test pressure shall be multiplied by a factor
obtained by dividing the allowable working stress for the material at the testing temperature by that at the rated
operating temperature. The stress values used shall conform to those given in the piping system design code for

<<HEADING level=2>>Annex D
(informative)
Oil or gas filter performance and oil-system cleanliness testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.1 General considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex is intended to provide users of ISO 10438 (all parts) with information relative to oil or gas filter
performance and oil-system cleanliness testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2 Filter specifications<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.1 General characteristics<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The primary requirement of filtration is to reliably remove contaminates in a different phase from a liquid or gas
stream. ISO 10438-2 describes filters necessary to remove from the oil particles that can be detrimental to
special-purpose machine bearings, gears or oil seals over an extended operating period. ISO 10438-3 describes
filters that are intended to remove sufficient solid particles from lubricating oil to provide an economical measure
of protection for general-purpose equipment bearings and gears. ISO 10438-4 describes filters necessary to
remove from the seal gas liquid-phase contaminants and particles that can be detrimental to a dry gas seal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.2 Filter element reliability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The filters shall be reliable, not fail or plug off during normal operation of the system and be able to retain
contaminates during extreme upsets and even pulsating pressures. For this reason, it is necessary that filter
elements for ISO 10438 systems be able to withstand high differentials without collapse or release of trapped
particles. (See the other parts of ISO 10438 for specific allowable collapse pressures.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.3 Water contamination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A requirement has been added to ISO 10438-2 and ISO 10438-3 that the filters be water resistant up to a water
content of 5 % at elevated temperatures to further assure filter element integrity. Water contamination of the oil
can initiate the deterioration of some elements due to the incompatibility of the filter media with water at operating
temperatures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Elements can also absorb water and experience high differential pressures caused by the swelling of the filter
medium. An optional requirement has been added for non-hydroscopic media that, over an extended exposure
period, clean elements do not double their pressure drop. Users of oil systems for which water contamination can
be a problem should consider non-hydroscopic filters. The user should keep in mind that water contamination
should not persist on a routine basis. If water contamination is experienced, the source of the water should be
determined and corrected. When correction is not feasible, a separate water-removal system or a slip stream
filter/coalescer should be considered to keep the water contamination under control.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Water contamination can be a problem for an oil system serving a steam turbine. Other systems commonly
exposed to water contamination include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  oil systems where make-up oil is provided from bulk storage or storage drums that are inadequately
protected;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  oil systems where the water pressure in the cooler(s) can exceed the oil pressure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>API   S TANDARD  614   /   IS O   10438- 1
1-53<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  oil systems located at humid sites, especially if the equipment served is in intermittent service and can also
experience problems with water contamination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.4 Beta ratio<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Of primary importance in the selection of filters for ISO 10438 (all parts) systems is the filter element micron size
rating. In earlier standards, the requirement was 10 µm  nominal  rating. In a clarification note (see the third edition
of API 614),  nominal  was implied to be 90 % efficient for 10 µm spherical particles and  absolute  was presumed for
15 µm particles for a 10 µm  nominal  rated element. The words “nominal” and “absolute” are not applied uniformly
by vendors and there can be significant performance differences from one filter to another with 10 µm  nominal
filters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is more precise to rate filter elements by the beta ratio of the element for a given size particle and larger. The
beta ratio expressed as  β x   ≥   y , where  x  is the filter element rating, expressed in micrometres, and  y  is the ratio of
particles  x  µm or larger entering a filter; divided by the number of particles  x  µm or larger exiting a filter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EXAMPLE 1
Display a beta ratio of equal to or greater than 10 for a 10 µm rated filter:  x  = 10 µm;  y   ≥  10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For every type of filter element, a curve of the beta ratio plotted against the micron size can be developed. The
position and shape of this curve is significantly affected by the construction features of the filter element. Some
filter elements can have a very wide band of performance and others can have a narrow band. An example of a
filter element, A, with a wide performance band can have a series of ratios  β 2   ≥  2,  β 10   ≥  10;  β 15   ≥  200 and a
β 25   ≥  1 000. Another filter element, B, with a narrower band can have a series of ratios  β 5   ≥  2;  β 10   ≥  10; and a
β 15   ≥  1 000.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In both examples A and B, the filter element is acceptable for special-purpose systems. The main issue is that the
manufacturer of both A and B may give a different nominal rating. It is not until the beta ratio for a given micron
size is greater than or equal to the specified beta ratio that the filter is acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>There are many factors in determining the performance of a filter on a range of particles. Factors such as
pressure, flow differential pressure, particle size, particle shape, fluid and degree of loading can result in different
beta ratios for the same type of element. There is a widely used standard hydraulic filter test that is relatively
similar to the conditions encountered in API STD 614 lube and seal systems. For the purpose of ISO 10438-2 and
ISO 10438-3, ISO 16889 or equal multi-pass-method type testing is required for passing the filter rating. A more
detailed description of ISO 16889 testing is outlined in D.2.8.2. Filter vendors who supply type-tested elements
have and can make available the test data for the elements being considered by ISO 10438-2 and ISO 10438-3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.5 Relative size of particles<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to provide protection for equipment, it is necessary that the filter be able to remove particles that are in
the range of the clearance of the component. For some insight into film thickness and particle sizes, see
Tables D.1 and D.2. For the majority of systems covered by ISO 10438-2, ISO 10438-3 and ISO 10438-4, the
filter ratings provide sufficient removal of the particles of concern as well as a reasonable installed life.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Based on the data presented in Tables D.1 and D.2, it can be tempting to use a finer filtration specification; but
this can be inappropriate in many cases. Over-specification of the filter requirements can result in costly filter
systems and frequent and expensive element changes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Users of ISO 10438 filter specifications should be aware that filters remove particles smaller than the specified
size. The filtration efficiency,  E PR , or beta ratio, for 1 µm to 10 µm particles can be low, but some are captured by
the element. It only takes more passes through the filter before the levels reach an equilibrium state where the
filter removes the same number as ingress into the system. How small a particle below the specified size that be
captured effectively is a function of the filter construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are some exceptions where fine filtration can be necessary. These include, but are not limited to, control-oil
systems with electrical-hydraulic pilot valves that have very close internal clearances and the oil-supply systems
for high-speed gear-type couplings. In these applications, it can be appropriate to install separate duplex filter(s)
in the branch stream(s) just ahead of the sensitive component(s). The  E PR  for these filters should be mutually
agreed based on the requirements of the component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.6 Dry gas seal filtration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most cases, it is necessary that the seal gas filtration system for a compressor dry gas seal performs two
functions. The first is to remove debris and small particles that can cause excessive wear of the seal faces and silt
up the seal cartridge. The second is to prevent liquids from entering the seal and causing sudden failure of the
seal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The gas filtration for dry gas seals cannot be effective unless the characteristics of the gas supply are provided to
the vendor for all conditions. Seal-gas supplies can vary from dry, inert gas with dew points below 100 °C (212 °F)
to a complex hydrocarbon mixture at the dew point with droplets or aerosols of hydrocarbon liquid in equilibrium.
The characteristics of the seal gas can vary considerably with the operating conditions of the compressor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the vendor to supply appropriate seal-gas filters/separators, it is necessary for the vendor to have a complete
description of the characteristics and gas composition of the supply at all operating conditions from start-up to
settle-out. When the seal-gas supply is taken from the compressor discharge, the gas composition may be
identified from the API 617 compressor datasheet number 2 of 6. It is necessary that the purchaser, vendor, dry
gas seal supplier and dry gas seal console supplier work together to identify the applicable condition, such as
testing, off-design operation, start-up and settle-out, where the presence of liquids is possible. For all possible
conditions, special attention should be paid to the gas-supply dew point, pressure, supply temperature and
ambient temperature. Special attention is also required to assure that the seal gas is compatible with the filters,
filter elements and elastomers over the range of possible operating conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On most dry gas seal systems, there are two sets of gas filters; one for the separation gas and one for the seal
gas. The separation gas is generally an inert, dry gas, such as nitrogen. Unless there are special circumstances
identified to the vendor, the filters for separation gas do not require coalescing capability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the seal gas has a dew point too close to operating temperature (including any Joules/Thompson effect at the
control valve) downstream of the controlling device, a seal gas filter/separator should be supplied with elements
that are a combined filter/coalescer or with two separate elements, one for filtering and one for coalescing (see
ISO 10438-4:2007, 4.2.7).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Because the seal-gas and separation-gas filters are not part of a recycling system, the filter beta ratings or
particle-removal efficiency should be identified on a one-time-through basis at conditions similar to the seal
support operating conditions. The multi-pass test method, ISO 16889, is not applicable to gas filters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The two factors for dry gas seal systems that it is necessary to address are the coalescing capacity and the dirt-
holding capacity of the filter/separator. Dry gas seals require fine filtration ( β 4   ≥  85) along with the ability to
remove liquid aerosols with droplets as fine as 1 µm. This, combined with the single-pass nature of the service
filter/separator elements in the presence of significant liquid, can quickly overload a filter. If the liquid rate to the
filter/separator can exceed 50 % of the vendor's published capacity for a filter, a mechanical centrifugal separator<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>ahead of the filter/separator is necessary to handle the liquid. The vendor's published separator capacity is based
on steady-state liquid flow and new, clean elements. Excess capacity is necessary both to prevent overload of the
separator as the element's time in service increases and to handle small, intermittent liquid slugs that can develop
in horizontal pipe runs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is critical in services where the seal-gas dew points are close to the seal-gas flowing temperatures to trap any
low points or slope all piping to a location where the liquids can be removed. This applies to both on- and off-skid
seal gas piping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fine filter/separator elements can quickly plug off if the gas stream is contaminated with solid particles or
sediment. If dirty gas is a problem, a guard filter with a large holding capacity can be necessary to obtain an
acceptable filter/separator element life. Where practical, the element's dirt-holding capacity for a dry gas seal filter
or filter/separator should be on the order of six months. For some “dirty” systems, the vendor and purchaser
should review and agree on an acceptable filter-holding-capacity requirement based on what change-out
frequency is possible and cost effective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.7 Filter-holding capacity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most systems covered by ISO 10438-2 and ISO 10438-3, the ingress of contamination is not significant after
the system is initially flushed. In general, filters that have sufficient flow capability to meet the requirements of
ISO 10438-2:2007, 4.6.7, or ISO 10438-3:2007, 4.7.7 o), have an acceptable service life. The service life of filter
elements in a system after flushing should be more than six months unless there is some problem external to the
filters that is causing a significant degree of contamination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A brief description of applicable filtration standards is outlined in D.2.8.2 to D.2.8.5 to provide the users of this part
of ISO 10438 with some background on the basis for use of these standards. For more information, the actual
standard should be reviewed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.8.2
ISO 16889<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 16889 specifies a rigorous method of type testing of filter elements in a recirculating loop with the injection of
a standard test dust into the upstream side of the loop. Reporting of the results of the tests is in a standard format
and the beta ratio for each of several micron sizes is averaged over the range from clean to maximum element
differential pressure. This averaging is done over ten equal time increments. Typically, test data are taken for five
particle-size ranges. The test is valid for 4 µm to at least 30 µm ratings and at flow rates in the test loop from
4 l/min to 600 l/min (1 gal/min to 160 gal/min). In addition to the filter-element average beta rating for five or more
particle sizes, a contaminant loading capability for a filter element is established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following items are controlled during the test of a filter to assure consistent results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The type of oil shall meet a given specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The injection system is validated to assure constant rates of contaminate injection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ISO 16889 test procedure provides a method to type test filter elements for lube-oil, control-oil and seal-oil
systems in a loop that simulates as closely as possible conditions the element encounters in service. Filters used
in ISO 10438-2 and ISO 10438-3 should have elements that have been type-tested to ISO 16889 or equivalent.
The ISO 16889 test differential pressure should also be within the range of the expected operational differential
pressure, since some types of elements can have significantly different beta ratios depending on the differential
pressure range selected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2.8.3
ISO 4406<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 4406 provides a means of defining the quantity of solid particle contaminates in oil or hydraulic fluid. The
code is comprised of two scale numbers or grades based on the number of particles greater than or equal to 5 µm
and 15 µm per millilitre of fluid. In recent years, many groups have expanded on the standard system to cover a
third range for counts of particles 2 µm or larger. Particle counts are made using a microscope or by means of
automatic particle counters. The results are reported as two or three grade numbers (see Table D.3 for a partial
list of grade numbers) separated by a slash, “/”. The number for the smallest size range is presented first.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

SAE AS 4059E<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SAE Aerospace Standard 4059E (which replaces NAS 1638) is another frequently used standard for assigning
cleanliness. SAE AS 4059E defines 14 different cleanliness classes. The particle count basis is 100 ml of fluid.
Each class specifies a given number of particles in each of five size groups: 5 µm to 15 µm, 15 µm to 25 µm,
25 µm to 50 µm, 50 µm to 100 µm and  >  100 µm. Table D.4 is provided for reference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Of the SAE AS 4059E and ISO 4406 standards, ISO 4406 is more frequently used. The reason the SAE class is
referenced is that it can be estimated by filtering a measured sample of fluid through filter disc in a standard
apparatus and making a comparison to standard comparator discs. This can be much more applicable in a field
situation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The intent of the 100 mesh screen test for special-purpose lube and seal system consoles is to confirm that, when
shipped, there is no debris remaining in the console or vendor-supplied piping or components that can
contaminate the remainder of the system and extend system flushing time at the site. When applied by other
standards to vendor testing of equipment or by users at machinery installation, it is intended to confirm there is no
debris remaining in the system downstream of the filters that can be immediately detrimental to the machinery
components served by the system(s).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.3.2 Special-purpose systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method for determining when a special-purpose oil or seal-oil system is clean enough to deliver or when a
vendor oil system is clean enough for factory-run testing of special-purpose machinery is covered by ISO 10438-
2:2007, 7.3.3.9. This requirement may also be extended to a site evaluation of installed oil and seal-oil systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of test screens has been a reliable indicator of when an oil system with an adequate filter system can
support start-up and/or testing of special-purpose machinery. The advantage of this testing is that a large
representative volume of fluid is circulated through the test screens and the harmful debris that is introduced
during fabrication and assembly of a special-purpose system is removed. When this test is done to an appropriate
procedure and the test screens are located where there is downward flow through the screens in supply lines, the
system will be free of damaging debris downstream of the screens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is some concern that 100 mesh screens do not pick up the small particles that can have undesirable long-
term effects on the equipment serviced by the lube- and seal-oil system. The test specified in ISO 10438-2:2007,
7.3.3.9, is not intended to define how well a system performs in the long term. Long-term reliability of components
served by a special-purpose system is more a function of the system design than filter specification. Other factors,
such as control of the ingress of damaging size particles and the type of particle contamination, are important
factors contributing to long-term reliability of machinery.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some users of ISO 10438 have started to add a criterion from ISO 4406 or SAE AS 4059E to make sure the
system is clean enough for long-term operation. The ISO 4406 grade specification often used is 20/15/12, (15/12
when only 5 µm and larger particles are counted). The approximate equivalent SAE requirement is Class 6. For
some very critical or sensitive special-purpose machines, the ISO criterion may be as stringent as 18/14/11 (14/11
when particles smaller than 5 µm are not counted) downstream of the filters. This is approximately equivalent to
SAE class 5. (See Table D.5.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the context of factory testing large consoles with a large residence capacity, the use of a low particle count
requirement, such as ISO grade 14/11, can result in extensive circulation through the filters before a sufficient<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>number of passes through the filters have been completed to remove enough particles in the 5 µm to 10 µm range.
This testing can be valid only after the screens have shown that the system is free of damaging debris at the
equipment-supply connections. It is highly likely that the act of inspection of a console for debris of the console in
accordance with ISO 10438-2:2007, 7.3.3.9, introduces enough dust to exceed the particle-count criteria. If not,
the particle-count criteria will almost certainly be exceeded, due to even minor contamination that is inevitable in
the course of special-purpose console and system preservation, shipping, storage and construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Caution should be used if only a particle-count criterion is specified for special-purpose systems/consoles in any
context (console vendor, machinery test floor, at site operation). Because small volumes are sampled, the use of
only particle-count criteria can easily miss damaging debris that can be released intermittently from piping and
components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Particle-count criteria can be useful in the course of flushing an entire system at the installation site when used in
conjunction with testing the supply lines with 100 mesh screens. An ISO grade 15/12 criteria (SAE class 6) is
acceptable for the start-up of most special-purpose equipment and even an ISO grade 16/13 criterion should not
be a problem for start-up so long as particle counts are trending downward. In general, unless there is an
equipment malfunction or a deficiency in the system filters, the system should be able to reach an
ISO grade 14/11 (SAE class 5) level or better within a week or two of continuous service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, users of special-purpose lube-oil and seal-oil systems who have tracked their systems by means of
qualitative testing (e.g. using ISO 4406 or SAE AS 4059E) from installation through operation have noted at least
one grade or class improvement from start-up of the system until a steady state particle level is reached.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

justified for relatively large general-purpose systems. The percent of the cost added for 100 mesh screen testing
of large general-purpose systems is not large.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The alternate test specifies an ISO 4406 grade 17/14 or SAE class 8 be obtained as a method to verify whether
the oil console is clean enough. It is necessary to select a circulation time to assure that there is mixing to
suspend any sediments. Prior to taking a sample, it is suggested that the minimum circulation time be five times
the reservoir capacity divided by the pump normal flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some larger debris in the general-purpose oil console can be missed by checking only the particle count. If the oil
is clean enough to pass ISO 4406 17/14 grade, then the quantity of debris left in the system should not require
additional flushing effort at the site. At the site, prior to placing the system in service, it is still recommended that
the entire system be flushed. A 100 mesh screen evaluation based on Table D.5 at the equipment oil-supply
header should be done prior to commissioning the general-purpose equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.3.4 Dry gas seal console testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dry gas seal console cleanliness testing is covered by ISO 10438-4:2007, 7.3.3.3. This test is also based on
inspection of a 100 mesh screen after the console is blown for a set period of time with 680 kPa (6,8 bar;
100 psig) dry and filtered air. The particle counting methods of SAE AS 4059E and ISO 4406 are not applicable to
seal gas module testing because they are hydraulic tests. The use of a particle-count criterion is very difficult to
set up in the context of a 10 min flow or blow test and is not normally required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cleanliness test procedure should be reviewed with the console fabricator. Whenever possible, the test
screen should be located so that the gas flows down through the screen. The flow path through the console of the
gas should be reviewed and it can be necessary to remove flow restrictions, such as orifice plates and control
valve trim, for the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The console filter/separator elements shall be removed if there is any possibility of reaching the collapse
differential for the element or if the element can present a significant restriction to the flow of air. Removal of the
console filter/separator elements should be done only after the upstream console piping and components are
confirmed as being clean.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The location of the air source pressure gauge [680 kPa (6,8 bar; 100 psig) minimum] should be reviewed and it
should always be downstream of the air supply filter. An agreement should be made with the vendor concerning
whether or not the pressure can drop under flowing conditions and, if so, how large a drop is acceptable. It is also
suggested that only one supply connection be checked at a time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the context of ISO 10438-4, this test is applicable to factory tests of consoles. With agreement of all parties, the
use of this test can be expanded to include vendor test stand dry gas seal support consoles and the testing of the
assembled dry gas seal support system in the field to determine if the system is clean enough to allow factory
testing or field start-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

General requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1
The equipment (including auxiliaries) covered by this part of ISO 10438 shall be designed and
constructed for a minimum service life of 20 years and at least 5 years of uninterrupted operation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
It is recognized that this is a design criterion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.2
The oil system shall be suitable for special-purpose applications as defined in ISO 10438-1. The system
shall be designed as a separate console, or, if approved by the purchaser, it may be designed to be integral with
the baseplate of the equipment it serves. The design shall allow for transfer between and shutdown of the main
and spare components of the system for maintenance without interrupting the operation of the system or the
equipment the system serves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.3
Unless otherwise specified, one oil system per equipment train shall be supplied.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
If equipment trains share a common oil system, damage due to cross-contamination can affect all equipment
served. Block valves can be needed in supply lines that, for maintenance reasons, have the potential to be accidentally closed.
Equipment location can require unacceptably long runs of piping, equipment transients and other potentially detrimental factors
that it is necessary to consider.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>z
4.1.4
The purchaser shall specify the equipment's normal operating point and alternate operating points
including transients.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Data sheets that can be used for specifying are included in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>z
4.1.5
Control of the sound pressure level (SPL) of all equipment furnished shall be a joint effort of the purchaser
and the vendor having unit responsibility. The equipment furnished by the vendor shall conform to the maximum
allowable sound pressure level specified. In order to determine compliance, the vendor shall provide both
maximum sound pressure and sound power level data per octave band for the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>z
4.1.6
The purchaser shall specify whether the seal-oil and lube-oil systems are to be separate or combined.<<HEADING_END>>

Rotary pumps shall be capable of passing the total flow, as established in 4.4.11 a) and 4.4.11 b), at the
relief-valve set pressure while not exceeding 90 % of the pump manufacturer's maximum differential pressure
rating at the minimum operating viscosity. The pump shall also be capable of operating continuously at the
normal flow, pressure-relief-valve or pressure-limiting-valve set pressure and minimum operating viscosity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

standby or idling pump.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.15  Shaft-driven pumps, if provided, shall have check valves and bypasses arranged such that the shaft-
driven pump continues to supply pressurized oil during periods of reverse rotation. The supplied pump shall be
capable of supplying pressure while running backwards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.16  For rotary pump systems, the vendor shall furnish external oil-pressure limiting valves that shall be
installed on the components or in the piping supplied by the vendor. Oil-pressure limiting valve settings, including
an allowance for accumulation, shall be determined after all of the possible equipment and component failures are
considered. The settings shall protect the oil system components and piping. Fully accumulated pressure shall not
exceed 110 % of the system design pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.17  Oil-pressure limiting valves (PLV) shall be pressure-modulating devices (as opposed to snap-acting or
pop-type safety relief valves) with a pressure increase proportional to flow above the valve cracking pressure (that
is, the pressure at which the valve begins to open). These devices shall be mounted external to the reservoir and
shall operate smoothly, without chattering and without causing a drop in supply pressure to the equipment.
Pressure-limiting valve piping shall be sized for the full flow of each pump; the valves shall not chatter and the
piping shall not vibrate. The minimum pressure-limiting valve cracking pressure shall be 10 % or 170 kPa (1,7 bar;
25 psi) higher than the highest required operating pressure, including operation at 10 °C (50 °F), whichever is
greater. To avoid unnecessary delay in opening, pressure-limiting valve takeoff points shall be located as close to
the oil pump discharge as possible and below the reservoir oil level. Pressure-limiting valves shall not be used for
continuous pressure regulation. For high-pressure applications (typically above 5,5 MPa (55 bar; 800 psig), where
pressure-modulating valves cannot be provided, provisions for venting or otherwise relieving the pumps is
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.18  The oil system shall be provided with pressure-regulating devices that prevent fluctuation of the oil
pressure to the equipment when both the main and the standby pump are in operation or when either the main or
the standby pump is in operation while the other pump is being started, brought up to operating speed or stopped.
Each device shall have an adequate response time and shall operate smoothly in a stable manner, without
chattering or producing pressure or flow transients that can cause the equipment to shut-down (see 7.3.3.8).
These pressure-regulating devices shall be located so that an excessive rise in oil temperature resulting from a
recirculation of uncooled oil is avoided (see, for example, Figure B.12, Footnote g).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.19  Bypass pressure-regulating valves shall be sized to cover a range from the minimum usage of one pump
to the maximum usage of two pumps.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.20  All pumps (except shaft-driven and booster pumps) shall be installed with flooded suctions to ensure self-
priming and shall be installed with suction-block valves and with discharge-block and check valves. Vertically
mounted pumps shall be arranged to assure that the entire pump remains flooded. Suction piping shall be
continuously vented or arranged to avoid pockets in which air can accumulate or become trapped. Each pump
shall have a separate suction line from the reservoir. The pump suction lines shall be designed to avoid excessive
piping loads on the pump casing flanges (see API RP 686-96, Chapter 6). Designs for suction piping, suction-
block valves, pump casings and all other components (particularly those for booster-pump arrangements) shall
avoid the possibility of overpressure caused by leaking discharge check valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

pump suction flange and the block valve. The temporary strainer shall be identified by a protruding tab and shall
have a mesh size adequate to stop all objects that can damage the pump. The piping arrangement shall permit
the removal of the strainer without disturbing the alignment of the pump. The maximum strainer hole size shall be
3 mm ( 1/8  in). Cone strainers shall be installed in spool pieces to minimize piping removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

manufacturer's recommendation. A blowdown/drain valve shall be provided on strainers. Strainers can require the
use of a bushing for blowdown connections due to space limitations. These bushings shall be rated at the
pressure rating of the pipe as a minimum.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
Strainer bodies can require removal from the system for basket access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4.25  In order to maintain satisfactory system operation when the main pump fails to meet system requirements,
the vendor shall furnish the primary element for the purchaser's start-up control for the standby oil pump. The
start-up control of the standby pump shall be actuated by devices that sense low supply pressure to the
equipment or low oil levels in the overhead seal-oil tanks. Motor-control centres shall be provided by the
purchaser. The control system shall have a manual reset. (See ISO 10438-1:2007, 6.2.1.1, for instrumentation
that allows the operation of the standby-oil-pump controls to be checked while the main pump is in operation.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Each multipoint instrument shall provide both alarm and shutdown settings, separately and independently
adjustable, for each transmitted input.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.4
The shutdown and alarm function outputs from the three multipoint instruments shall be connected
through “two-out-of-three” voting logic. The arrangement shall allow operation of any one alarm or shut-down
function that initiates an alarm; operation of two shutdown functions monitoring the same parameter shall initiate a
separate alarm and shall cause the served equipment to shut down.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.4.5
Alarm functions not associated with a shutdown function shall be provided with one single transmitter.
These alarm transmitters may be connected to one of the three alarm/shutdown multipoint instruments or to a
separate multipoint instrument. The detailed arrangement should be jointly developed between the purchaser and
the vendor or vendors of the oil system and the served equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
A filter-cooler changeover shall be accomplished without the system delivery pressure dropping to the
automatic-start setting of the standby pump.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
If applicable, it shall be demonstrated that the control valve or valves can handle a simulated governor-
transient step change on the main equipment drive turbine without the pressure-limiting valves lifting and
without the delivery pressure dropping to the automatic-start setting of the standby pump.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
It shall be demonstrated that, after a failure or trip of the main oil pump, the standby pump starts
automatically and returns the system to normal operating pressure without the delivery pressure dropping as
follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
in a single-level oil-pressure system, below the midpoint between the standby pump's automatic-start
setting and the equipment's shutdown pressure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
in a multilevel oil pressure system, below the midpoint between the equipment's normal operating and
shutdown pressures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Verification of this criteria requires test instrumentation, such as a switch or other device, with a
response time adequate to record the transient pressures during pump switchover. (The response time
of switches is typically under 25 ms.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
It shall be demonstrated that the control valve(s) is/are capable of controlling the oil pressure when only one
pump (either the main or the standby pump) is operating at minimum oil requirements and when both pumps
are operating at minimum oil requirements, defined as the sum of the normal bearing and seal-oil
requirements and the steady-state control-oil requirements. The test shall be considered satisfactory when no
abnormal conditions occur during the operational test (see 4.4.18).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Some typical abnormal conditions encountered are system instability, an excessive drop in delivery pressure,
alarm or shutdown signals or other conditions that require operator attention.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

packages and at other strategic points mutually agreed on by the purchaser and the vendor shall be within
the particle-count limits listed in ISO 10438-1:2007, Table D.6. The screen mesh shall be No. 100 plain-
weave, stainless steel wire with a diameter of 0,1 mm (0,004 in) and a 0,15 mm (0,006 in) opening. The
greatest dimension of the particles shall not exceed 0,25 mm (0,010 in), and the particles shall be randomly
distributed on the screen. Piping, coolers and valves shall be hammered frequently during the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Typically, screens are mounted such that the flow entering the screen is in a vertical downward direction to
prevent debris from escaping the screen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
To further verify cleanliness, the system shall be visually inspected at two to six points selected by the
inspector. The system shall be considered clean when foreign matter, such as scale, rust, metal shavings

4.1.1
This part of ISO 10438 covers general-purpose oil systems. Typical datasheets for general-purpose oil
systems are in Annex A. Typical piping and instrument diagrams for general-purpose oil systems are in Annex B.
Typical inspector checklists for general-purpose oil systems are in Annex C. General-purpose (GP) oil systems
are divided into classes and are defined by a coding system that defines the major components supplied (see
Table 1). The user shall choose the applicable class and code based upon the required minimum reliability targets
for the equipment train. Various API standards have supplied minimum recommended systems as indicated in
Table 2 for their equipment. Annex D is supplied as a reference to provide guidance on the selection of a system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The minimum criteria given in a) through c) shall be used when sizing pumps.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
In all cases, pumps shall be sized to deliver the required capacity when pumping lube oil at the highest
temperature and the corresponding minimum viscosity (see 4.5.8).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Each pump (main or standby) shall be capable of supplying the normal oil flow required by the equipment
plus 20 % of the normal oil flow.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Rotary pumps shall be capable of passing the total flow, as established in b), at the pressure-limiting valve
set pressure while not exceeding 90 % of the pump manufacturer's maximum differential pressure rating at
the minimum operating viscosity. The pump shall also be capable of operating continuously at the normal
flow, pressure-limiting valve set pressure and minimum operating viscosity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This selection criterion is required to avoid pump rotor contact during operation under extreme conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.7
The normal operating capacity of the centrifugal pumps shall be within 50 % to 110 % of their best
efficiency point. From their normal operating point to shutoff, centrifugal pumps shall have a continuous rise in
head of at least 5 % and, with the installation of a new impeller, shall be capable of a future increase in head of at
least 10 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

temperature of the pumped oil is 10 °C (50 °F).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Rotary pumps shall be capable of operating at the specified pump pressure-limiting valve setting (including
accumulation) when the temperature of the pumped oil is 10 °C (50 °F).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5.9
Check valves shall be provided on each pump discharge to prevent the flow of oil backwards through a
standby or idling pump.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shaft-driven pumps may use a drilled check valve or an orificed line to prime the pump (see ISO 10438-1:2007,
4.5.6).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.10  For rotary-pump systems, the vendor shall furnish external pressure-limiting valves that shall be installed
on the pump or in the piping supplied by the vendor. This valve shall not be used for pressure control. Pressure-
limiting valve settings, including an allowance for accumulation, shall be determined after all of the possible
equipment and component failures are considered. The settings shall protect the oil-system components and
piping. Fully accumulated pressure cannot exceed 110 % of the system design pressure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.11  Oil-pressure limiting valves (PLV) shall be pressure-modulating devices (as opposed to snap-acting or
pop-type safety relief valves) with a pressure increase proportional to flow above the valve cracking pressure (that
is, the pressure at which the valve begins to open). These devices shall be mounted external to the reservoir and
shall operate smoothly, without chattering and without causing a drop in supply pressure to the equipment.
Pressure-limiting valve piping shall be sized for the full flow of each pump; the valves shall not chatter and the
piping shall not vibrate. The minimum pressure-limiting valve cracking pressure shall be 10 % or 170 kPa (1,7 bar;
25 psi) higher than the highest required operating pressure, including operation at 10 °C (50 °F), whichever is
greater. To avoid unnecessary delay in opening, pressure-limiting valve takeoff points shall be located as close to
the oil pump discharge as possible. Pressure-limiting valves shall not be used for continuous pressure regulation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.12  The oil system shall be provided with pressure-regulating devices that prevent fluctuation of the oil
pressure to the equipment serviced by the lube-oil console when both the main and the standby pump are in
operation or when either the main or the standby pump is in operation and the other pump is started, brought up
to operating speed or stopped. Each device shall have an adequate response time and shall operate smoothly
without hunting, chattering or producing pressure or flow transients that can cause a mechanical problem or
shutdown of the equipment [see 7.3.3.7 e)]. These pressure-regulating devices shall be located so that an
excessive rise in oil temperature resulting from a recirculation of uncooled oil is avoided (see, for example,
ISO 10438-2:2007, Figure B.11). Where non-pressure-regulating PLV's are used, the pressure-regulating valve
shall be selected such that the PLVs do not lift during two-pump operation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.13  All pumps (except shaft-driven pumps) shall be installed with flooded suctions to ensure self-priming and
shall be installed with suction-block valves (unless the pumps are inside the reservoir) and with discharge-block
and check valves. Vertically mounted pumps shall be continuously vented to assure the entire pump remains
flooded. Shaft-driven pumps shall have adequate provision for priming and be of positive displacement design.
Suction piping shall be continuously vented or arranged to avoid pockets in which air can accumulate or become
trapped. Each pump shall have a separate suction line from the reservoir. The pump-suction lines shall be
designed to avoid excessive piping loads on the pump casing flanges. Designs for suction piping, suction-block
valves, pump casings and all other components shall avoid the possibility of overpressure caused by leaking
discharge check valves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

4.5.14  If specified, for the protection of externally mounted centrifugal pumps during flushing and for the initial
operation of new oil systems, a removable strainer made from austenitic stainless steel and having an open flow
area equal to 150 % of the cross-sectional area of the suction pipe shall be installed in the suction piping of each
pump between the pump-suction flange and the block valve. The temporary strainer shall be identified by a
protruding tab and shall have a mesh size adequate to stop all objects that can be injurious to the pump. The
piping arrangement shall permit the removal of the strainer without disturbing the alignment of the pump. The
maximum strainer hole size shall be 3 mm ( 1/8  in).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Strainer can be cone-, basket- or Y-type.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.15  Unless otherwise specified, for rotary pumps, a permanent Y-type strainer with an austenitic stainless
steel basket having a minimum open flow area equal to 150 % of the cross-sectional area of the suction pipe shall
be installed in the suction piping of each pump. The strainer shall have a mesh size in accordance with the pump
manufacturer's recommendation. A blowdown/drain valve shall be provided on strainers. Strainers can require
use of a bushing for blowdown connections if required by space limitations. These bushings shall be rated for the
pressure rating of the pipe as a minimum. The maximum strainer hole size shall be 3 mm ( 1/8  in).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
Strainer bodies can require removal from the system for basket access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
Elimination of these bushings can raise pump-suction connections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5.16  If a standby pump is furnished (4.5.4), in order to maintain satisfactory system operation when the main
pump fails to meet system requirements, the vendor shall furnish an automatic start-up control for the standby oil
pump. The start-up control of the standby pump shall be actuated by low oil-supply pressure. Motor control
centres shall be provided by the purchaser. The control system shall have a manual reset.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Scope of supply for controls and reset should be mutually determined by the purchaser and the vendor. The lube-
console manufacturer normally provides only a pressure-sensing device.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Reference can be made to 4.5.5, second paragraph.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>z
a)
If specified, mounting pads shall be provided for each pump and its driver. Pads shall be at least 25 mm (1 in)
larger than the feet of the mounted equipment to allow for leveling of the console or package baseplate
without removal of the equipment. The pads shall be fully machined, flat and parallel. Corresponding surfaces
shall be in the same plane within 125 μm/m (0,002 in/ft) of distance between the pads. To prevent distortion,
machining of mounting pads shall be deferred until welding on the baseplate in close proximity to the
mounting pads has been completed. This tolerance shall be met at the time of assembly at the vendor's shop
between coupled rotating pieces of equipment. The coupled pieces shall be capable of being re-aligned in the
field when the console is properly installed in accordance with API RP 686.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Pumps and drivers shall be mounted on a machined surface. All pads for oil pumps and drivers shall be
machined to allow for the installation of stainless steel shims; shim packs, at least 3 mm ( 1/8  in) thick, shall be
placed under the feet of each component.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Due to mounting surface tolerances on purchased pumps and drivers, it can be necessary to install shims of
different thicknesses under each foot. Additionally, shims under the pump are required to allow future shimming of a
replacement pump to the inlet pipe. (The small-PD pump tolerance equals 130 μm (0,005 in) from foot to foot, and the
NEMA motor and large-PD pump tolerance equals 260   μm (0,010 in) from foot to foot.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) To minimize misalignment of the pump and driver shafts due to piping-load effects, the pump and its
baseplate shall be constructed with sufficient structural stiffness to limit total misalignment to the values
specified in 4.5.18 b).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) When the pump and driver are mounted on the console without a separate sub-base, the pump and driver
shall be affixed to a structural member of the console base rather than merely being attached to deckplate or
other non-structural components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

case, however, shall oil bypass the filter. The control valve shall be in accordance with the following provisions a)
to d).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
When fouling or freezing of the water side of a cooler is a factor, and oil temperature is regulated by adjusting
water flow through the cooler, it is possible for the cooler water-side to silt up or freeze and break at low water-flow rates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

b)
If specified, the oil bypass valve shall be a flanged and pneumatically operated (air-to-open fail-close), two-
port or three-port, temperature control valve. Failure of the control valve shall cause all the oil to pass through
the cooler.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Three-port valves can direct the oil more advantageously due to system pressure drops and allows all of the oil

(informative)
Guidance to system reliability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prior to the first edition of ISO 10438 (all parts) in 2003, the predecessor standard, API 614, was directed at
systems where only the most critical reliability demands were required. ISO 10438-2 and ISO 10438-4 still require
these high-reliability levels for critical non-spared equipment with long mission times. With the introduction of
coverage for general-purpose systems in this, the second edition of this part of ISO 10438, a broad new class of
systems was introduced for which it is necessary to better balance the initial cost and system reliability to
maximize the effectiveness in meeting business requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>System design for less-than-critical systems is a trade-off between initial cost associated with taking too much risk
vs. taking too little risk of meeting the reliability goal. This relates to the concept of under-investing vs. over-
investing. (i.e. the trade-off between system reliability and initial cost) The real issues to determine are: What is
the cost of unreliability and how much availability (or unavailability) can you afford?<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods exist utilizing sophisticated software to aid in the determination of the probability that a particular system
can meet the required mission time specified by the business. These methods require reliability data on individual
components for input into the system analysis and require a level of sophistication and analysis that is not usually
conducted on non-critical systems due to the level of complexity involved in the analysis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While some sophisticated users take this approach to optimize design for a general-purpose system, the more
commonly used approach taken is to provide guidance based on the past experiences of the user to aid in
considering the deviations that can be taken from the base systems. (These deviations can either increase or
decrease the system reliability and, inversely, the system cost depending upon the mission time and the business
need.) These types of deviation decisions have historically been made based on experience, but require an
individual or individuals with sufficient operating experience to recognize the potential risks involved in order to
make an informed judgment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One approach to help determine what additional options should be considered (or base requirements deleted) on
a given system is to consider possible failure modes of the components and the actions that can be taken to
mitigate the risk associated with a particular failure mode. A failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) has been
included in this annex to assist the user in this regard. The probability of a particular failure occurring within the
mission time has not been provided due to a lack of industry data and effects of site variations on failure rate;
however, the example given explains how a user can utilize the FMEA table to make design decisions based on
his perception of the probability of a particular failure mode within the mission time considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The FMEA included as Table D.1 is a first attempt to document failure modes on type of equipment covered by
ISO 10438 (all parts). The system used in the example has the following characteristics:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  equipment description:
lubrication system;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  classification:
general-purpose;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  design life of equipment:
20 years;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  mission of equipment:
24 months (provided as an example).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
It is necessary that this be determined by the user (see 4.2.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While efforts have been made to make it as complete as possible, the user may wish to add failure modes and
risk-reduction activities based on his own experiences.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EXAMPLE
A user has an application for a lubrication system for an API 610 pump. The business has defined a required
mission time of 21 months. In this particular plant, the cooling-water quality is poor and tube fouling has historically been a<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>problem. The user feels that this failure mode reduces the probability of the system reaching the 21 month mission time
required for a single cooler. The API 610 base standard system has a single cooler; however, from the FMEA, under failure
modes for a cooler, tube fouling is listed along with some possible risk-reduction activities that can be considered. These
include purchasing dual coolers with a transfer valve for on-line switching, keeping the water-velocity high and purchasing
coolers that have tubes that can be easily rodded out. In this case, due to the poor cooling-water properties, the user specifies
that all of the options be taken into consideration in his specification. The use of dual coolers in this instance allows a run-to-
failure for this failure mode without affecting the system availability by allowing the standby cooler to be used while the other
cooler is repaired.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.5
The dry gas seal system shall be designed to serve the full range of equipment operating conditions
specified. These conditions may include but are not limited to the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
settle-out pressures;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
process relief-valve settings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
shop test and field run-ins;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
start-up conditions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
gas composition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This requires a detailed system review with the equipment suppliers, purchaser and owner, and is normally
finalized at the coordination meeting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.6
Control systems shall provide adequate gas velocity across the labyrinths at all clearances, including
minimum labyrinth clearance to twice the maximum design labyrinth clearance to prevent migration of
contaminents from the process gas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
In a flow-control system, velocity across the labyrinths decreases as clearances increase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.7
All gas streams (including alternate, backup, start-up sources) into the seal shall be provided at a
temperature of at least 20 K (35 °R) above their dew point in order to preclude the possibility of liquid entering the

reliability of a single block valve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>z
4.2.12  Filters, drain traps and other pressure vessels shall be in accordance with the specified pressure design
code. The purchaser shall specify if it is necessary that the vessels be code stamped.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
Most vessels for the gas seal module are smaller than the size required for the ASME code stamp.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
Code stamping might not be applicable for pressure design codes other than ASME.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3
Reference can be made to ISO 10438-1:2007, 4.5.7. Local jurisdictions can require a code stamp.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.13  The module and components shall perform on test and on its permanent foundation within the specified
acceptance criteria. After installation, the performance of the module shall be the joint responsibility of the
purchaser and the vendor who has unit responsibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>z
4.2.14  The vendor shall advise the purchaser of, and both parties shall mutually agree upon, any special
provisions that are necessary to ensure that an adequate backup supply of seal gas and seal buffer gas or seal
separation gas is maintained in the event of complete loss of the main seal-gas supply source. These provisions
may include alternate seal-gas supply sources, backup gas bottles and special arrangements for start-up, purge
gas and settle-out conditions. Provisions shall be adequate for block-in vent or purge situations as applicable. The
purchaser shall specify the required block-in time. The purchaser and the vendor shall mutually agree upon the
backup system and its component requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2.15  Block valves that interrupt the gas flow to the equipment shall not be installed in gas supply lines
downstream of the filters unless the block valves are part of a component block and bypass arrangement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.16  The support structure shall be stainless steel or carbon steel and painted.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.17  Dry-gas-seal system piping size and vents shall be sized to prevent over-pressurization of the bearing
housings in the event of a failure of the seal.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is a system requirement, which should be coordinated between the equipment supplier (seal housing
connection sizes), dry-gas-seal system module designer (vent-piping sizes) and the installation designer (vent
sizes and piping lengths).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
