<<PARAGRAPH>>This British Standard is the UK implementation of BS EN 1090-2:2008.
It supersedes DD ENV 1090-1:1998  DD ENV 1090-4:2001,
DD ENV 1090-6:2001 which are withdrawn, and BS 5400- 6:1999,
BS 5950-2:2001 which will be withdrawn on March 2010.
The UK participation in its preparation was entrusted to Technical
Committee B/521 Execution of steel structures, with the assistance of
B/525/10 Bridges.
A list of organizations represented on this committee can be obtained on
request to its secretary.
Additional information
BSI, as a member of CEN, is obliged to publish EN 1090-2:2008 as a
British Standard. However, attention is drawn to the fact that during
the development of this European Standard, the UK committee voted
against its approval as a European Standard.
The reason for the UK committee vote was because of concerns about
possible misspecification in terms of execution classes and weld quality
levels in particular. If realized, these concerns about the range and the
basis of some of the choices could lead either to under-specification and
inadequate safety or to over-specification and possible barriers to trade.
These issues are described more fully below, together with suggestions
that should avoid these risks.
This standard gives the technical requirements for the execution
(fabrication and erection) of steel structures and is a supporting
standard for the harmonized standard BS EN 1090-1,  Execution of steel
structures and aluminium structures – Part 1: Requirements for
conformity assessment of structural components . Conformity assessment
to BS EN 1090-1 requires that the manufacturer operates a certified
factory production control system. The quality management
requirements for factory production control include, for instance, levels
of traceability and welding quality management which are defined by
reference to BS EN 1090-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard supersedes several existing standards and hence has a very wide scope.
Therefore, it requires specifiers to make a series of project- or application-specific
decisions before execution commences on each part of the works. Annex A itemizes the
additional and optional information required.
Execution classes
This standard introduces the concept of execution class (EXC) as a classified set of
requirements specified for the execution of the works as a whole, of an individual
component, or of a detail of a component. Annex A.3 itemizes those requirements in the
standard which depend on the choice of execution class.
It is a design decision for the specifier to select the execution class required for the works
as a whole, an individual component, or a particular detail of a component. Annex B of
BS EN 1090-2 provides some informative guidance on the factors that might be relevant
to that decision. The primary reason to differentiate is to provide a level of reliability
against failure or malfunction of the structure/component/detail that is matched to the
consequences (see BS EN 1990,  Eurocode – Basis of structural design , for further
information). Hence, execution class is widely used in this standard as a reliability
differentiator for providing choice of quality, testing and qualification requirements,
although the relationship between this new differentiator and those recommended by BS
EN 1990 is not fully defined.
Annex B of BS EN 1090-2 recommends that the choice of execution class should also
depend on the ‘service category’ (SC) that characterizes a component in terms of the
circumstances of its designed use, and the ‘production category’ (PC) that characterizes a
component in terms of the methods used for its execution. These latter two types of
category imply that, for a given structure/component/detail, the execution class specified
should be increased in line with more onerous demands in service and/or if it is more
difficult to produce.
From Annex B it appears likely that most steel structures in the UK will include
components in both PC1 and PC2, but most will be SC1 unless they are designed for
fatigue actions (in which case they will be SC2). Thus, as a default basis, EXC2 could be
specified for structures/components/details used in buildings, and EXC3 could be
specified for structures/components/details used in bridges.
Weld quality levels
For structures/components/details designed for fatigue additional requirements should
be adopted because the simple choice between design for quasi-static (SC1) and fatigue
(SC2) applications does not sufficiently discriminate the required weld quality levels in
terms of fatigue classes.
In these circumstances, as the choice of appropriate requirements requires a level of
design and construction knowledge that many potential users of this standard may not
possess, reference should be made to the advice given in PD 6695-1-9,  Recommendations
for the design of structures to BS EN 1993-1-9 , which explains the relationship between
design and execution with respect to fatigue classes (FAT classes), and PD 6705-2,
Recommendations for the execution of steel bridges to BS EN 1090-2 , which gives
acceptance criteria for welds designed for fatigue. These acceptance criteria have been
developed for structural welds on a fitness-for-purpose basis and are consistent with
those used in the British Standards that are superseded by BS EN 1090-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>BS EN 1090-2:2008<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>BS EN 1090-2 relates the execution classes to weld quality levels in BS EN ISO 5817,
Welding – Fusion-welded joints in steel, nickel, titanium and their alloys (beam welding
excluded) – Quality levels for imperfections , as follows:
•
EXC1: Quality level D;
•
EXC2: Quality level C generally;
•
EXC3: Quality level B (i.e. as required for welder qualification tests and welding
procedure qualification records);
•
EXC4: Quality level B+.
These levels may generally be appropriate to establish, prequalify and certificate the
routine quality level of the manufacturer’s welding operations. However, although EXC4
can be used to specify the extent of supplementary non-destructive testing, the
associated quality level B+ is not practically achievable in routine production as it
requires the manufacturer to demonstrate a capability of meeting a quality level which
is more stringent than that for which the manufacturer’s welders and welding
procedures are qualified. Thus, if a quality level of B or higher is required, it is more
practical to specify this for each relevant joint detail and not for routine production,
using the acceptance criteria given in PD 6705-2 for evaluating imperfections on an
individual basis, as permitted by BS EN 1090-2.
Tolerances
BS EN 1090-2 is more complicated than the British Standards that it supersedes in its
approach to specifying permitted geometrical deviations as systems of tolerances. Three
types of geometrical tolerance are defined:
1.
essential tolerances that are essential for the mechanical resistance and stability
of the completed structure and which are used to support conformity assessment
to BS EN 1090-1;
2.
functional tolerances required to fulfil other criteria such as fit-up and
appearance;
3.
special tolerances that may be specified for project-specific reasons, and which
would need to be clearly defined in the execution specification.
Functional tolerances are defined for two classes, of which the less onerous tolerance
class 1 is the default specification for routine execution. Tolerance class 2 is likely to
require special and more expensive measures in fabrication and erection.
As an alternative, the standard allows BS EN ISO 13920,  Welding – General tolerances
for welded constructions – Dimensions for lengths and angles – Shape and position , to be
used as the basis for specifying functional tolerances. BS EN ISO 13920 is suitable for
those weldments and more heavily welded structural components where potential
distortion from welding is the dominant factor in determining the dimensions and shape
of the completed component and its fit-up to other components. BS EN 1090-2 selects the
class relevant to the function of structural components from the four tolerance classes
defined in BS EN ISO 13920.

Compliance with a British Standard cannot confer immunity from legal

Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard specifies requirements for execution of structural steelwork as structures or as
manufactured components, produced from:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  hot rolled, structural steel products up to and including grade S690;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  cold formed components and sheeting up to and including grades S700 for stainless steels and including
S690 for carbon steels;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  hot finished and cold formed austenitic, austenitic-ferritic and ferritic stainless steel products;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  hot finished and cold formed structural hollow sections, including standard range and custom-made rolled
products and hollow sections manufactured by welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard may also be used for structural steel grades up to and including S960, provided that
conditions for execution are verified against reliability criteria and any necessary additional requirements are
specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard specifies requirements independent of the type and shape of the steel structure (e.g.
buildings, bridges, plated or latticed components) including structures subjected to fatigue or seismic actions.
The requirements are expressed in terms of execution classes<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard applies to structures designed according to the relevant part of EN 1993.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard applies to structural components and sheeting as defined in EN 1993-1-3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard applies to steel components in composite steel and concrete structures designed
according to the relevant part of EN 1994.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard may be used for structures designed according to other design rules provided that
conditions for execution comply with them and any necessary additional requirements are specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard does not cover requirements for watertightness or air permeability resistance of
sheeting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cutting shall be carried out in such a way that the requirements for geometrical tolerances, maximum
hardness and smoothness of free edges as specified in this European Standard are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Known and recognised cutting methods are sawing, shearing, disc cutting, water jet techniques and thermal
cutting. Hand thermal cutting should be used only if it is not practical to use machine thermal cutting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a process does not conform, it shall not be used until corrected and checked again. It may be used on a
restricted range of constituent products that do produce conforming results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If coated materials are to be cut, the method of cutting shall be selected to minimize the damage on the
coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Burrs that could cause injury or prevent the proper alignment or bedding of sections or sheeting shall be
removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.2
Shearing and nibbling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The free edge surfaces shall be checked and smoothed as necessary in order to remove significant defects. If
grinding or machining is used after shearing or nibbling, the minimum depth of grinding or machining shall be
0,5 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.3
Thermal cutting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The capability of thermal cutting processes shall be periodically checked as set out below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Four samples shall be produced from the constituent product to be cut by the process:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) a straight cut from the thickest constituent product;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) a straight cut from the thinnest constituent product;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) a sharp corner from a representative thickness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4) a curved arc from a representative thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements shall be taken on the straight samples over at least a 200 mm length on each and checked
against the required quality class. The sharp corner and curved samples shall be inspected to establish that
they produce edges of equivalent standard to the straight cuts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality of cut surfaces defined in accordance with EN ISO 9013 shall be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
for EXC1 cut edges that are free from significant irregularities are acceptable provided that any dross is
removed. For perpendicularity or angularity tolerance, u, range 5 may be used;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

EN 10025-3, the hot forming process shall take place in the temperature range 960 °C to 750 °C with
subsequent cooling at air temperature. The cooling rate should be such as to prevent hardening as well as
excessive grain coarsening. If this is not practicable, a subsequent normalising treatment shall be carried out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hot forming is not allowed for S450 according to EN 10025-2 if no delivery condition is indicated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Cold forming<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shaping by cold forming, produced either by roll forming, pressing or folding shall conform to the requirements
for cold formability given in the relevant product standard. Hammering shall not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Cold forming leads to reduction in the ductility. Furthermore attention is drawn to the risk of hydrogen
embrittlement associated with subsequent processes such as acid treatment during coating or hot dip galvanization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For steel grades higher than S355, if a stress relief treatment is carried out after cold forming, the
following two conditions shall be satisfied:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) temperature range: 530 °C to 580 °C;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) holding time: 2 min/mm of material thickness, but with a minimum time of 30 min.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For stainless steels, unless otherwise specified, the minimum inside bend radii to be formed shall be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) 2 t  for austenitic grades 1.4301, 1.4401, 1.4404, 1.4541 and 1.4571;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) 2,5 t  for austenitic-ferritic grade 1.4462.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where t is the thickness of the material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
For other grades of stainless steels, the minimum inside bend radii shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Smaller inside bend radii may be permitted if due consideration is given to issues such as steel
specification, condition and thickness and the direction of bending in relation to the rolling direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to counteract the effects of spring-back, stainless steel needs to be over-bent to a slightly higher
degree than carbon steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The power requirement for bending stainless steel are higher than for bending geometrically similar
carbon steel components, due to work hardening (by about 50% in the case of the austenitic steels or even more
in the case of 1.4462 austenitic-ferritic steel).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Cold formed sections and sheeting may be shaped by cranking, smooth curving or crimping as
appropriate to the materials to be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For cold formed components and sheeting used as structural components, shaping by cold forming shall
comply with the following two conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) the surface coatings and the accuracy of profile shall not be impaired;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) It shall be specified if constituent products require protective membranes to be applied before forming.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 Some coatings and finishes are particularly prone to abrasive damage, both during forming and
subsequently during erection. For further information, see EN 508-1 and EN 508-3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bending by cold forming of hollow section components may be used provided that hardness and
geometry of the as-bent constituent product are checked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 Bending by cold forming may cause alteration of section properties (e.g. concavity, ovality and wall
thinning) and increased hardness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
For circular tubes bending by cold forming shall comply with the following three conditions, unless
otherwise specified:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) the ratio of the overall diameter of the tube to the wall thickness shall not exceed 15;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) the bend radius (at the centreline of the tube) shall not be less than 1,5d or d+100 mm, whichever is
the larger, in which d is the overall diameter of the tube;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)  welded joint in the cross-section shall be positioned close to the neutral axis, in order to reduce the
bending stresses at the weld .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Dimensions of holes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This clause applies to the making of holes for connections with mechanical fasteners and pins.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The definition of the nominal hole diameter combined with the nominal diameter of the bolt to be used in the
hole determines whether the hole is "normal" or "oversize". The terms "short" and "long" applied to slotted
holes refer to two types of holes used for the structural design of preloaded bolts. These terms may be used
also to designate clearances for non-preloaded bolts. Special dimensions should be specified for movement
joints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nominal clearances for bolts and for pins not intended to act in fitted conditions shall be as specified in
Table 11. The nominal clearance is defined as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  the difference between the nominal hole diameter and the nominal bolt diameter for round holes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  the difference between respectively the length or the width of the hole and the nominal bolt diameter for

Qualification of welding procedures<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.1.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding shall be carried out with qualified procedures using a welding procedure specification (WPS) in
accordance with the relevant part of EN ISO 15609 or EN ISO 14555 or EN ISO 15620, as relevant. If
specified, special deposition conditions for tack welds shall be included in the WPS. For joints in hollow
section lattice structures the WPS shall define the start and stop zones and the method to be used in order to
cope with locations where the welds change from a fillet weld to butt around a joint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4.1.2
Qualification of welding procedures for processes 111, 114, 12, 13 and 14<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The qualification of the welding procedure depends on the execution class, the parent metal and the
degree of mechanization in accordance with Table 12.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
If EN ISO 15613 or EN ISO 15614-1 qualification procedures are used, the following conditions apply:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) If impact tests are specified, they shall be carried out at the lowest temperature for which the standard
of the steel grade requires impact properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) For steels according to EN 10025-6, one specimen for micro-examination is necessary. Photographs
of weld metal, fusion line zone and HAZ shall be recorded. Microcracks are not permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3) If welding on shop primers, tests shall be carried out on the maximum (nominal + tolerance) accepted
layer thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
If a qualification procedure is to apply to transverse stressed fillet welds on steel grades higher than
S275, test shall be completed by a cruciform tensile test performed in accordance with
EN ISO 9018. Only specimens with  a   ≤  0,5  t  shall be evaluated. Three cross tensile specimen shall be
tested. If the fracture happens in the parent metal, the minimum nominal tensile strength of the parent
metal shall be reached. If the fracture happens in the weld metal, the fracture strength of the cross
section of the actual weld shall be determined. By processes with deep penetration the actual root
penetration shall be considered. The determined average fracture strength shall be  ≥  0,8  R m  (with  R m  =
nominal tensile strength of the used parent metal).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Joint preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.1.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Joint preparation shall be appropriate for the welding process. If qualification of welding procedures is
performed in accordance with EN ISO 15614-1, EN ISO 15612 or EN ISO 15613 joint preparation shall
comply with the type of preparation used in the welding procedure test. Tolerances for joints preparations and
fit-up shall be given in the WPSs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
EN ISO 9692-1 and EN ISO 9692-2 give some recommended weld preparation details. For weld preparation
details of bridge decks, see EN 1993-2:2006, Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Joint preparation shall be free from visible cracks. For steel grades higher than S460, cut areas shall be
descaled by grinding, and verified to be free from cracks by visual inspection, dye penetrant or magnetic
particle testing. Visible cracks shall be removed by grinding and the joint geometry corrected as necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If large notches or other errors in joint geometry are corrected by welding a qualified procedure shall be used,
and the area shall be subsequently ground smooth and feathered into the adjacent surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All surfaces to be welded shall be dry and free from material that would adversely affect the quality of the
welds or impede the process of welding (rust, organic material or galvanizing).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prefabrication primers (shop primers) may be left on the fusion faces only if they do not adversely affect the
welding process. For EXC3 and EXC4, prefabrication primers shall not be left on the fusion faces, unless
welding procedure tests in accordance with EN ISO 15614-1 or EN ISO 15613 have been completed using
such prefabrication primers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
EN ISO 17652-2 describes tests for assessing the influence of shop primers on the weldability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Use of bolting assemblies<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This clause refers to bolting assemblies specified in 5.6, consisting of matching bolts, nuts and washers (as
necessary).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>It shall be specified if, in addition to tightening, other measures or means are to be used to secure the nuts.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bolted connections with small clamp lengths in thin gauge components subject to significant vibrations, such
as storage racks, shall use a locking method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Preloaded assemblies do not need additional locking devices.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bolts and nuts shall not be welded, unless otherwise specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This does not apply to special weld nuts according to e.g. EN ISO 21670 or weld studs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.2
Bolts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nominal fastener diameter used for structural bolting shall be at least M 12, unless otherwise specified
together with the associated requirements. For thin gauge components and sheeting the minimum diameter
shall be specified for each type of fastener.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bolt length shall be chosen such that after tightening the following requirements are met for bolt end
protrusion beyond the nut face and the thread length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The length of protrusion shall be at least the length of one thread pitch measured from the outer face of the
nut to the end of the bolt.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If it is intended that a connection utilises the shear capacity of the unthreaded shank of bolts, then the
dimensions of the bolts shall be specified to allow for the tolerances on the length of the unthreaded portion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The length of the unthreaded bolt shaft of full cross section is shorter than the nominal unthreaded length (e.g. by
up to 12mm for an M20 bolt).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For non-preloaded bolts, at least one full thread (in addition to the thread run out) shall remain clear between
the bearing surface of the nut and the unthreaded part of the shank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For preloaded bolts according to EN 14399-3 and EN 14399-7, at least four full threads (in addition to the
thread run out) shall remain clear between the bearing surface of the nut and the unthreaded part of the
shank.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For preloaded bolts according to EN 14399-4 and EN 14399-8, clamp lengths shall be in accordance with
those specified in Table A.1 of EN 14399-4:2005.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.3
Nuts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nuts shall run freely on their partnering bolt, which is easily checked during hand assembly. Any nut and bolt
assembly where the nut does not run freely shall be discarded. If a power tool is used, either of the following
two checks may be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
for each new batch of nuts or bolts their compatibility may be checked by hand assembly before
installation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
for mounted bolt assemblies but prior to tightening, sample nuts may be checked for free-running by
hand after initial loosening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nuts shall be assembled so that their designation markings are visible for inspection after assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.4
Washers<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally washers are not required for use with non-preloaded bolts in normal round holes. If required, it shall
be specified whether washers are to be placed under the nut or the bolt head, whichever is rotated, or both.
For single lap connections with only one bolt row, washers are required under both bolt head and the nut.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The use of washers can reduce local damage to metal coatings particularly where these are thick coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Washers used under heads of preloaded bolts shall be chamfered according to EN 14399-6 and positioned
with the chamfer towards the bolt head. Washers according to EN 14399-5 shall only be used under nuts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Plain washers (or if necessary hardened taper washers) shall be used for preloaded bolts as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
for 8.8 bolts a washer shall be used under the bolt head or the nut, whichever is to be rotated;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
for 10.9 bolts washers shall be used under both the bolt head and the nut.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Plate washers shall be used for connections with long slotted and oversized holes. One additional plate
washer or up to three washers with a maximum combined thickness of 12 mm may be used in order to adjust
the grip length of bolt assemblies. They shall be placed on the side that is not turned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dimensions and steel grades of plate washers shall be specified. They shall not be thinner than 4 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Taper washers shall be used if the surface of the constituent product is at an angle to a plane perpendicular to
the bolt axis of more than:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) 1/20 (3°) for bolts with  d   ≤  20 mm;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) 1/30 (2°) for bolts with  d  > 20 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

and
t   ≥  8 mm for sections, unless full contact bearing is specified, residual gaps of up to 4 mm may be left at the
edges on condition that contact bearing is achieved at the central part of a connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each bolt assembly shall be brought at least to a snug-tight condition, with special care being given to avoid
over-tightening especially short bolts and M12. The tightening process shall be carried out from bolt to bolt of
the group, starting from the most rigid part of the connection and moving progressively towards the least rigid
part. To achieve a uniform snug-tight condition, more than one cycle of tightening may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
The most rigid part of a cover plate connection of an  I  section is commonly in the middle of the connection bolt
group. The most rigid parts of end plate connections of  I  sections are usually beside the flanges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
The term "snug-tight" can generally be taken as that achievable by the effort of one man using a normal sized
spanner without an extension arm, and can be set as the point at which a percussion wrench starts hammering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bolt shall protrude from the face of the nut after tightening not less than one full thread pitch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

manufacturer otherwise in accordance with EN 14399-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Burrs, loose material and excessive thickness of paint that would prevent solid seating of the connecting parts
shall be removed before assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before commencement of preloading, the connected components shall be fitted together and the bolts in a
bolt group shall be tightened in accordance with 8.3 but the residual gap shall be limited to 2 mm with the
necessary corrective action on steel components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tightening shall be performed by rotation of the nut except where the access to the nut side of the assembly is
inadequate.   Special precautions, depending on the tightening method adopted, may have to be taken when
bolts are tightened by rotation of the bolt head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tightening shall be carried out progressively from the most rigid part of the joint to the least rigid part. To
achieve uniform preloading, more than one cycle of tightening may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Torque wrenches used in all steps of the torque method shall be capable of an accuracy of ± 4 % according to
EN ISO 6789. Each wrench shall be checked for accuracy at least weekly, and in case of pneumatic
wrenches, every time the hose length is changed. For torque wrenches used in the first step of the combined
method these requirements are modified to ± 10 % for the accuracy and yearly for the periodicity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Checking shall be carried out after any incident occurring during use (significant impact, fall, overloading etc.)
and affecting the wrench.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

preload or un-tightened, and would therefore still be usable in location in the final bolting up process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
If the tightening process is delayed under uncontrolled exposure conditions the performance of the lubrication
may be altered and should be checked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The potential loss of preloading force from its initial value due to several factors, e.g. relaxation, creep of
surface coatings (see Annex F.4 and Table 18), is considered in the tightening methods specified below. In
case of thick surface coatings, it shall be specified if measures shall be taken to offset possible subsequent
loss of preloading force.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Torque reference values<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The torque reference values M r,i  to be used for a nominal minimum preloading force Fp,C are determined for
each type of bolt and nut combination used by one of the following options:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
values based on  k -class declared by the fastener manufacturer in accordance with the relevant parts of
EN 14399:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)  M r,2  =  k m   d   F p,C
with  k m  for  k -class K2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)  M r,1  =  k m   d   F p,C
with  k m  for  k -class K1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
values determined according to Annex H:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)  M r,test   = M m
with  M m  determined according to the procedure relevant to the tightening
method to be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.3
Torque method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bolts shall be tightened using a torque wrench offering a suitable operating range. Hand or power
operated wrenches may be used. Impact wrenches may be used for the first step of tightening for each bolt.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tightening torque shall be applied continuously and smoothly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tightening by the torque method comprises at least the two following steps:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
a first tightening step: the wrench shall be set to a torque value of about 0,75  M r,i  with  M r,i  =  M r,2  or  M r,test .
This first step shall be completed for all bolts in one connection prior to commencement of the second
step;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
a second tightening step: the wrench shall be set to a torque value of 1,10  M r,i  with  M r,i  =  M r,2  or  M r,test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The use of the 1,10 coefficient with M r,2  is equivalent to (1 + 1,65 Vk) with Vk=0,06 for kclass K2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.4
Combined method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tightening by the combined method comprises two steps:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) a first tightening step, using a torque wrench offering a suitable operating range. The wrench shall be set
to a torque value of about 0,75  M r,i  with  M r,i  =  M r,2  or  M r,1  or  M r,test . This first step shall be completed for all
bolts in one connection prior to commencement of the second step;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using  M r,1 , for simplification  M r,1  = 0,13 d Fp,C may be used unless otherwise specified<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) a second tightening step in which a specified part turn is applied to the turned part of the assembly. The
position of the nut relative to the bolt threads shall be marked after the first step, using a marking crayon
or marking paint, so that the final rotation of the nut relative to the thread in this second step can be easily
determined.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The second step shall be in accordance with the values given Table 21 unless otherwise specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.5
HRC method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The HRC bolts shall be tightened using a specific shear wrench equipped with two co-axial sockets which
react by torque one against the other. The outer socket which engages the nut rotates clockwise. The inner
socket which engages the spline end of the bolt rotates anticlockwise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 The shear wrench operates as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>- during the tightening operation of an assembly, the socket in rotation is the one that finds the least resistance to it;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>- from the outset and right up to the last tightening stage, the outer socket on the nut rotates clockwise while the inner
socket holds the spline end without rotating, the result being that the bolt assembly is progressively tightened by the
increasing torque applied to the nut;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>- at the last tightening stage, i.e. when the torsional resistance plateau of the break-neck section is attained, the inner
socket rotates anticlockwise while the outer socket on nut provides the reaction without rotating;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>- the bolt assembly installation is complete when the spline end shears off at the break-neck section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specified preload requirement is controlled by the HRC bolt itself by means of the geometrical and torsion
mechanical characteristics together with the lubrication conditions. The equipment does not need calibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to ensure that the preloads in fully installed bolts in connections meet the specified minimum preload
requirement, the bolt installation process generally comprises two tightening steps; both using the shear
wrench.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The first tightening step is achieved at the latest when the shear wrench outer socket stops turning. If
specified this first step is repeated as often as required. This first step shall be completed for all bolts in one
connection prior to commencement of the second step.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
Guidance of the equipment manufacturer may give additional information on how to identify if pretightening
has occurred, e.g. sound of shear wrench changing, or if other methods of pretightening are suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The second tightening step is achieved when the spline end of the bolt shears off at the break-neck.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the assembly conditions are such that it is not possible to use the shear wrench on the HRC bolt assembly,
e.g. for lack of space, tightening shall be carried out using the torque control method, see 8.5.3, with the aid of
the k-class K2 information or using a direct tension indicator, see 8.5.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.5.6

strength not less than that of the surrounding concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In pocket bases, the embedded length of the column shall be initially surrounded with concrete to a sufficient
length to provide stability in the temporary state and then remain undisturbed for a period sufficient to gain at
least half of its characteristic compressive strength, before removal of any temporary props and wedges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If treatment of steelwork, bearings and concrete surfaces is required before grouting, it shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care shall be taken that the external profile of grouting allows water to be drained away from structural steel
components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If there is a danger of water or corrosive liquid becoming entrapped during service, the grout around base
plates shall not be surcharged such that it rises above the lowest surface of the base plate and the geometry
of the concrete grout shall form an angle from the base plate according to Figure 6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.5
Erection methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.5.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The erection of the steelwork shall be carried out in conformity with the erection method statement and in such
a way as to ensure stability at all times.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Foundation bolts shall not be used to secure unguyed columns against overturning unless they have been
checked for this mode of use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Throughout the erection of the structure, the steelwork shall be made safe against temporary erection loads,
including those due to erection equipment or its operation and against the effects of wind loads on the
unfinished structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For buildings, at least one third of the permanent bolts in each connection should be installed before that
connection can be considered to contribute to stability of the part completed structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.5.2
Temporary works<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All temporary bracing and temporary restraints shall be left in position until erection is sufficiently advanced to
allow its safe removal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If it is required that bracings in tall buildings are to be de-stressed as erection progresses, to release the
forces induced in them by vertical loads, this shall be carried out progressively one panel at a time. During
such de-stressing sufficient alternative bracing shall be in place to ensure stability.  If necessary, additional
bracing shall be added temporarily for this purpose.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All connections for temporary components provided for erection purposes shall be made in accordance with
the requirements of this European Standard and in such a way that they do not weaken the permanent
structure or impair its serviceability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If backing bars and draw cleats are used to support the structure during welding, it shall be ensured that they
are sufficiently strong and that their retaining welds are appropriate for the erection load conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the erection procedure involves rolling or otherwise moving the structure, or part of the structure, into its final
position after assembly, provision shall be made for controlled braking of the moving mass. Provision for
reversing the direction of movement may need to be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All temporary anchoring devices shall be made secure against unintentional release.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Only jacks that can be locked in any position under load shall be used unless other safety provisions are
made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.6.5.3
Fit-up and alignment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care shall be taken that no part of the structure is permanently distorted or over-stressed by stacking of
steelwork components or by erection loads during the erection process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each part of the structure shall be aligned as soon as practicable after it has been erected and final assembly
completed as soon as possible thereafter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EN 1090-2:2008 (E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Permanent connections shall not be made between components until sufficient of the structure has been
aligned, levelled, plumbed and temporarily connected to ensure that components will not be displaced during
subsequent erection or alignment of the remainder of the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alignment of the structure and lack of fit in connections may be adjusted by the use of shims. Shims shall be
secured where they are in danger of coming loose. For EXC3 and EXC4 securing of shims by welding is
subjected to the requirements of Clause 7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Shims shall be made of flat steel unless otherwise specified. Shims shall have similar durability to that of the
structure. For stainless steel structures they shall be made of stainless steel and have a minimum thickness of
2 mm if used externally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If shims are used to align structures composed of coated material, the shims shall be protected in a similar
manner to provide the specified durability unless the shims are required to meet a specified friction
classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Residual gaps for non-preloaded bolts and preloaded bolts before preloading shall be in accordance with 8.3
and 8.5.1 respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If lack-of-fit between erected components cannot be corrected by the use of shims, components of the
structure shall be locally modified in accordance with the methods specified in this European Standard. The
modifications shall not compromise the performance of the structure in the temporary or permanent state. This
work may be executed on site. Care shall be taken with structures built of welded latticed components and
space structures to ensure that they are not subjected to excessive forces in an attempt to force a fit against
their inherent rigidity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise prohibited, drifts may be used to align connections. Elongation of holes for bolts used for
transmission of loads shall not be more than the values given in 6.9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of misalignment of holes for bolts, the method of correction shall be checked for consistency with the
requirements of Clause 12.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Realigned holes may be proven to comply with the oversize or slotted hole requirements specified in 8.1
provided the load path has been checked.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Correction of misalignment by reaming or using a hollow milling cutter is preferred, but if the use of other
cutting methods is unavoidable the internal finish of all holes formed by these other methods shall be

<<HEADING level=3>>10 Surface treatment<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This clause specifies requirements for making steel surfaces with imperfections, including welded and
fabricated surfaces, suitable for the application of paints and related products. The requirements to take
account of the particular coating system to be applied shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This clause does not deal with the detailed requirements for corrosion protection systems, which are specified
in the following references that shall be applied as relevant:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) surfaces to be painted: EN ISO 12944 series and Annex F;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) surfaces to be metal coated by thermal spraying: EN 14616, EN 15311, EN ISO 14713 and

<<PARAGRAPH>>c) surfaces to be metal coated by galvanizing: EN ISO 1461, EN ISO 14713 and Annex F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For mechanical resistance and stability reasons there is no need for corrosion protection if the structure is to
be used for a short service lifetime, or in an environment with negligible corrosivity (e.g. category C1 or
painting for aesthetic purposes only), or has been dimensioned to allow for corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
A year may be considered as a short service lifetime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If painting is specified for aesthetic reasons Table 22 together with Annex F are applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If both a fire protection and corrosion protection systems are specified, they shall be proven to be compatible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
Fire protection is not generally considered to be a part of the corrosion protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2 Preparation of steel substrates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These requirements do not apply to stainless steels. If there are requirements for surface cleanliness of
stainless steels, they shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All surfaces to which paints and related products are to be applied shall be prepared to meet the criteria of
EN ISO 8501. The preparation grade according to EN ISO 8501-3 shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the expected life of the corrosion protection and corrosivity category are specified, the preparation grade
shall be in accordance with Table 22.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Thermally cut surfaces, edges and welds shall be suitably smooth and able to achieve the specified
roughness after subsequent surface preparation (see Annex F).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Thermally cut surfaces are sometimes too hard for the abrasive material to achieve the suitable surface
roughness. The procedure test specified in 6.4.4 may be used to establish surface hardness and determine whether
grinding is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3 Weather resistant steels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If necessary, procedures to ensure that the surface of uncoated weather resistant steels is acceptable visually
after weathering shall be specified together with procedures to prevent contamination (e.g. from oil, grease,
paint, concrete or asphalt).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
As an example, exposed areas may need to be blast cleaned to ensure uniform weathering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The treatment necessary for surfaces of non-weather resistant steels if these are in contact with uncoated
weather resistant steels shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4 Galvanic coupling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unintended contact between different metallic constituent products, e.g. stainless steels to aluminium or
structural steel shall be avoided. If stainless steel is to be welded to structural steel, corrosion protection for
the steel structure shall continue from the weld on to the stainless steel by 20 mm as a minimum. See also
6.3, 6.9 and 7.7.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5 Galvanizing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If pickling is to be used prior to galvanizing, all weld gaps should be sealed prior to pickling to prevent the
ingress of acid, unless this conflicts with considerations set out in 10.6 below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the fabricated component contains enclosed spaces, vent and drain holes shall be provided. The enclosed
space shall generally be galvanized internally and if not it shall be specified whether these enclosed spaces
shall be sealed after galvanizing and, if so, with what.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.6 Sealing of spaces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If enclosed spaces are to be sealed by welding or provided with internal protective treatment, the internal
treatment system shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If spaces are to be fully enclosed by welds, it shall be specified if weld imperfections permitted under the
welding specification require sealing by application of suitable filler material to prevent the ingress of moisture.
If welds are for sealing purposes only, those welds shall be visually inspected. If required, further inspection
shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Attention is drawn that cracks in welds, which are not detectable by visual inspection, can allow water to
penetrate the sealed space.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If closed sections are to be galvanized, they shall not be sealed before galvanizing. In the case of overlapping
surfaces with continuous welds, adequate venting shall be provided, unless the area of overlap is so small
that the risk of explosive egress of entrapped gases during the galvanizing operation is assessed as not
significant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If mechanical fasteners penetrate the wall of sealed enclosed spaces, the method to be used for sealing the
interface shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.7 Surfaces in contact with concrete<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surfaces that are to be in contact with concrete including the undersides of baseplates shall be coated with
the protective treatment applied to the steelwork, excluding any cosmetic finishing coat, for a minimum of the
first 50 mm of the embedded length unless otherwise specified and the remaining surfaces need not be
coated unless specified. If uncoated, such surfaces shall be blast cleaned or wire-brushed to remove loose
mill scale and cleaned to remove dust, oil and grease. Immediately before concreting, any loose rust, dust and
other loose debris shall be removed by cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.8 Inaccessible surfaces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Areas and surfaces that are difficult to access after assembly should be treated before assembly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In slip resistant connections, faying surfaces shall meet the requirements necessary to develop the friction for
the specified surface treatment (see 8.4). Other connections shall not be made with excess paint on the faying
surfaces. As a maximum, faying surfaces and surfaces beneath washers shall be treated with a primer and
undercoat unless specified otherwise (see F.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless specified otherwise, bolted connections including the perimeter around such connections shall be
treated with the full corrosion protection system specified for the remainder of the steelwork.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.9 Repairs after cutting or welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It shall be specified if repair, or additional protective treatment, is required to cut edges and adjacent surfaces
after cutting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If precoated constituent products are to be welded, the methods and extent of repair necessary to the coating
shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If galvanizing to surfaces has been removed or damaged by welding, the surfaces shall be cleaned, prepared
and treated with a zinc rich primer and paint system offering a similar level of corrosion protection as the
galvanizing for the given corrosivity category (see EN ISO 1461 for additional guidance).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>10.10.1 Cleaning of thin gauge components<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The structure shall be cleaned daily from stems of blind rivets, drill-shavings etc., to prevent damage by
corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.10.2 Cleaning of stainless steels components<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cleaning procedures shall be appropriate for the grade of constituent product, surface finish, function of the
component and corrosion risk. The method, level and extent of cleaning shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Strong acid solutions sometimes used to clean the masonry and tiling of buildings shall not be permitted to
come into contact with structural steel, including stainless steel. If such contamination does happen, acid
solutions shall be washed off immediately with large amounts of clean water.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11 Geometrical tolerances<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1 Tolerance types<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This clause defines the types of geometrical deviations and gives quantitative values for two types of
permitted deviations:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) those applicable for a range of criteria that are essential for the mechanical resistance and stability of the
completed structure, called essential tolerances;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) those required to fulfil other criteria such as fit-up and appearance, called functional tolerances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Essential tolerances and functional tolerances are both normative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For structural steel components, prEN 1090-1 refers to the essential tolerances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The permitted deviations given do not include elastic deformations induced by the self-weight of the
components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition, special tolerances may be specified either for geometrical deviations already defined with
quantitative values or for other types of geometrical deviations. If special tolerances are required the following
information shall be given as appropriate:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  amended values for functional tolerances already defined;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  defined parameters and permitted values for the geometrical deviations to be controlled;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  whether these special tolerances apply to all relevant components or only to particular components that
are specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In each case, the requirements are for final acceptance testing. If fabricated components are to form parts of a
structure that is to be erected on site, the tolerances specified for the final checking of the erected structure
shall be met in addition to those for the fabricated components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Essential tolerances shall be in accordance with D.1. The values specified are permitted deviations. If the
actual deviation exceeds the permitted value, the measured value shall be dealt with as a nonconformity
according to Clause 12.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some cases there is a possibility that the uncorrected deviation of an essential tolerance can be justified in
accordance with the structural design when the excess deviation is included explicitly in a recalculation. If not,
the nonconformity shall be corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

from such products, unless superseded by more stringent criteria specified in D.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2.2.2
Welded sections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welded components manufactured from plates shall conform to the permitted deviations in

Cold formed sections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Components cold formed by pressing shall conform to the permitted deviations in Table D.1.2. For
components fabricated from rolled cold formed sections, see 11.2.2.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
As examples, cross-sectional tolerances for welded sections manufactured from split rolled sections would be
in accordance with the relevant product standard except for overall depth and web geometry which should be in
accordance with Table D.1.1; and cross sectional tolerances from EN 10162 apply to cold rolled sections whereas Table

<<PARAGRAPH>>For bolted splices shims may be used where the gap exceeds the specified limits after initial bolting-up, to
reduce the gaps to within the permitted deviation, unless otherwise specified in the execution specification.
The shims may be made of flat mild steel. No more than three shims shall be used at any point. If necessary,
the shims may be held in place by means of either fillet welds or a partial penetration butt weld extending over

<<PARAGRAPH>>Functional tolerances in terms of accepted geometrical deviations shall be in accordance with one of the
following two options:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the tabulated values described in 11.3.2, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the alternative criteria defined in 11.3.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If no option is specified the tabulated values shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3.2 Tabulated values<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tabulated values for functional tolerances are given in D.2. Generally values for two classes are shown. The
choice of tolerance class may be applied to individual components or selected parts of an erected structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
How D.2 can be applied would be to invoke tolerance class 2 for part of a structure to which a glazed facade
was to be fitted, in order to reduce the amount of clearance and adjustability required at the interface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If D.2 is used, and the choice of class is not specified, tolerance class 1 applies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In applying Table D.2.19, the protruding length of a vertical foundation bolt (in its best-fit position if adjustable)
should be vertical to within 1 mm in 20 mm. A similar requirement would apply to the line of bolts set
horizontally or at other angles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3.3 Alternative criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If specified the following alternative criteria may be applied:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
for welded structures, the following classes according to EN ISO 13920 apply:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1) class C for length and angular dimensions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2) class G for straightness, flatness and parallelism;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>12.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This clause specifies the requirements for inspection and testing with respect to the quality requirements
included in quality documentation (see 4.2.1) or quality plan (see 4.2.2) as relevant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Inspection, testing and corrections shall be undertaken on the works against the specification and within the
quality requirements set out in this European Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All inspection and testing shall be undertaken to a predetermined plan with documented procedures. Specific
inspection testing and associated corrections shall be documented.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2 Constituent products and components<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.1 Constituent products<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Documents supplied with constituent products in accordance with the requirements of Clause 5 shall be
checked to verify that the information on the products supplied matches those ordered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
These documents include inspection certificates, test reports, declaration of compliance as relevant for plates,
sections, hollow sections, welding consumables, mechanical fasteners, studs etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
This documentation check is intended to obviate the need for testing products generally.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection of the surface of product for defects revealed during surface preparation shall be included in
the inspection and test plans.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If surface defects in steel products revealed during surface preparation are repaired using methods that are in
accordance with this European Standard, the repaired product may be used provided that it complies with the
nominal properties specified for the original product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are no requirements for specific testing of products unless otherwise specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.2 Components<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Documents supplied with components shall be checked to verify that the information on the components
supplied matches those ordered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This applies to all delivered and part-fabricated products received into a constructor's works for further
processing (e.g. welded  I -sections for incorporation into plate girders), and to products received on site for erection by the
constructor if these are not manufactured by the constructor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.2.3 Non conforming products<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the documentation supplied does not include a declaration from the supplier that the products conform to the
specifications, they shall be treated as non conforming products until it can be demonstrated that they meet
the requirements of the inspection and test plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If products are first designated as nonconforming and are subsequently proved to be in conformity by test or
retest, the testing shall be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>12.3 Manufacturing: geometrical dimensions of manufactured components<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection plan shall consider the requirements and the checks necessary on prepared constituent steel
products and manufactured components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dimensional measurements of components shall always be taken. Methods and instruments used shall be
selected, as appropriate, from those listed in ISO 7976-1 and ISO 7976-2. Accuracy shall be assessed in
accordance with the relevant part of ISO 17123.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The location and frequency of measurements shall be specified in the inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with 11.2. The deviations shall be measured with respect to
any specified camber or preset.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If acceptance inspection results in the identification of nonconformity, the action on such nonconformity shall
be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) if practicable, the nonconformity shall be corrected using methods that are in accordance with this
European Standard and checked again;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) if correction is not practicable, modifications to the steel structure may be made to compensate for the
nonconformity provided that this is in accordance with a procedure for handling nonconformities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Damage resulting in local dents in the surface of hollow sections shall be assessed. The method shown in

subgroup concerned;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1 If the bolt assemblies to be inspected are from different assembly lots, with inspection torque values that
are different the locations of each lot should be established.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2 If the contact surfaces are protection-coated, in particular if painted, the loss of preload can be such that
the satisfying of the criteria specified is not possible. Special inspection procedures, such as continuous
supervision of tightening, can be necessary in these circumstances.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   For assembly bolt lot definition, see EN 14399-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A bolting assembly for which the nut turns by more than 15° by the application of the inspecting torque is
considered to be under-tightened (< 100 %) and shall be retightened up to 100 % of the required torque.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.5.2.5
Combined method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For EXC3 and EXC4 the first step shall be controlled before marking using the same torque conditions as
used to reach the 75 % condition. A bolt which turns by more than 15° by the application of the inspecting
torque is considered defective and shall be retightened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the connections are not fully packed according to 8.3 and 8.5.1, the calibrations of the torque wrenches in
combination with the applied loads shall be controlled by supplementary tests to achieve the correct initial
pretightening load. If necessary, the first step has to be repeated with the corrected torque values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If still unpacked, the thickness and out of plane of the assembled connections shall be inspected and
adjusted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Before the second step starts, the markings of all the nuts relative to the bolt threads shall be visually
inspected. Any mark missing shall be corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the second step, the marks shall be inspected with the following requirements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
if the rotation angle is more than 15° below the specified value, this angle shall be corrected;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
if the rotation angle is more than 30° over the specified angle, or the bolt or the nut has failed, the bolt
assembly shall be replaced by new one.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.5.2.6
HRC method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The inspection shall be carried out on 100 % of the bolting assemblies by visual inspection. Fully tightened
bolt assemblies are identified as those with the spline end sheared off. A bolt assembly for which the spline
end remains is considered to be under-tightened.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Requirements for inspection of any trial erection to 9.6.4 shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.2 Inspection of the erected structure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The condition of the erected structure shall be inspected for any indication that components have been
distorted or overstressed, and to ensure that any temporary attachments have either been removed
satisfactorily or are in accordance with the specified requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.3 Survey of geometrical position of connection nodes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.3.1
Survey methods and accuracy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A survey of the completed structure shall be made. This survey shall be related to the secondary net. For
EXC3 and EXC4 this survey shall be recorded; if there is a requirement to record dimensional checks at
acceptance of the structure, this shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Methods and instruments used shall be selected from those listed in ISO 7976-1 and ISO 7976-2. The
selection shall take into account the capability of the survey process in terms of accuracy relative to the
acceptance criteria. If appropriate, the survey shall be corrected for the effects of temperature and the
accuracy of the measurements relative to that in 9.4.1 shall be estimated according to the relevant parts of
ISO 17123.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
In most cases where surveys take place in ambient temperatures between 5 °C and 15 °C no correction is
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.3.2
System of measurement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The system of permitted deviations is built up from position points at base level, an envelope for column
verticality and a series of intermediate and roof levels referred to as-built floor levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Position points mark the location of individual components for instance columns (see ISO 4463-1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each individual value shall be in accordance with the values from the figures and tables. The algebraic sum of
the discrete values shall not be greater than the permitted deviations for the total structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The system shall set out requirements for connection positions. Between these positions the manufacturing
tolerances define permitted deviations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The system does not set out explicit requirements for secondary structural components such as side posts
and purlins.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Special attention will need to be given to establishing lines and levels when fitting to existing construction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.3.3
Reference points and levels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Erection tolerances shall generally be specified relative to the following reference points on each component:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) for components within 10° of the vertical: the centre of the component at each end;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) for components within 45° of the horizontal (including the tops of lattice trusses): the centre of the top
surface at each end;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) for internal components in built-up lattice girders and trusses: the centre of the component at each end;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>d) for other components: the erection drawings shall indicate the reference points which shall generally be
the top or outside surfaces of components mainly subject to bending and centre lines of components
mainly subject to direct compression or tension.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternative reference points may be substituted for ease of reference, provided that they have similar effect to
those specified above.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.3.4
Location and frequency<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements will only be taken of the position of components adjacent to site interconnection nodes as set
out below, unless otherwise specified. The location and frequency of measurements shall be specified in the
inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Critical dimensional checks of the as-built structure necessary in relation to special tolerances should be
identified and these should be incorporated into the inspection plan.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The positional accuracy of the erected steelwork should be measured under self weight of steelwork only
unless otherwise specified. The conditions under which the measurements shall take place shall then be
specified as well as the deviations and movements due to imposed loads, other than those due to self weight
of steelwork, if these can affect dimensional checks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.3.5
Acceptance criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance criteria are given in 11.2 and 11.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.3.6
Definition of nonconformity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assessment of whether a non conformity exists shall take into account the inevitable variability in methods of
measurement calculated in accordance with 12.7.3.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
ISO 3443-1 to -3 give guidance on tolerances for buildings and the implications of variabilities (including
manufacturing, setting-out and erection deviations) on the fit between components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Accuracy of construction shall be interpreted in relation to the expected deflections, cambers, presets, elastic
movements and thermal expansion of components.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
EN 1993-1-4 gives values for the coefficient of thermal expansion for common stainless steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If significant movement of a structure is anticipated that could affect dimensional checking (e.g. for tension
structures) an envelope of permissible positions shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.3.7
Action on nonconformity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Action on nonconformity shall be in accordance with 12.3. Corrections shall be carried out using methods that
are in accordance with this European Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a steel structure is handed over with uncorrected nonconformities awaiting action these shall be listed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12.7.4 Other acceptance tests<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If components of a structure are to be erected to a specific load rather than position, detailed requirements,
including tolerance range on the load shall be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Annex B
(informative)
Guidance for the determination of execution classes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex provides guidance for the choice of execution classes with respect to those execution factors that
affect the overall reliability of the completed works and which is a prerequisite for the application of the various
clauses in this European Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The recommended procedure for determination and the use of execution class according to
EN 1090-2 takes into account the fact that the design will be carried out in accordance with EN 1993 for steel structures or
EN 1994 for the steel parts of composite structures to achieve consistency between the assumptions made in the
structural design and the requirements for execution of the work. The determination of execution class is done in the
design phase where specifics for design and execution of the structure are evaluated, and the information on execution
requirements are given in the execution specification. The guidelines in this annex may be wholly or partially superseded
by future guidelines added to EN 1993.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2 Governing factors for choice of execution class<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.1 Consequence classes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EN 1990:2002 gives in its Annex B guidelines for the choice of consequence class for the purpose of reliability
differentiation. Consequence classes for structural components are divided in three levels denoted CCi (i = 1,
2 or 3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Annex B in EN 1990:2002 is informative. Consequently the national annex to EN 1990 may give provisions for
the application of this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EN 1991-1-7 gives examples of categorisation of building type and occupancy according to consequence
classes that assist with the implementation of Annex B of EN 1990:2002.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A structure, or a part of it, can contain components with different consequence classes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.2 Hazards connected with execution and use of the structure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2.2.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Such hazards may arise from the complexity of the work execution and from uncertainty in the exposure and
actions on the structure that can expose flaws in the structure during use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Potential hazards are in particular connected with:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  service factors arising from the actions to which the structure and its parts are likely to be exposed to
during erection and use and the stress levels in the components in relation to their resistance;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  production factors arising from the complexity of the execution of the structure and its components, e.g.
application of particular techniques, procedures or controls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To account for this differentiation in hazards service categories and production categories are introduced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>E.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex gives guidance for execution of welded joints in hollow sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2 Guidance for start and stop positions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following guidance may be used for in-line joints:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
stop and start positions of welds for in-line splice joints in chords should be chosen to avoid these
positions coming directly under the location of a subsequent weld between a brace and the chord;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
stop and start positions for welds between two in-line square or rectangular hollow sections should not
be located at or close to the corner positions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following guidance may be used for other joints:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
stop and start positions should not be located at or close to the toe position or lateral flank positions of a
joint between two circular hollow sections in accordance with Figure E.1;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
stop and start positions should not be located at or close to the corner positions of a joint between a
square or rectangular hollow section bracing and a hollow chord component;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
recommended welding sequence for welding brace to chord joints are given in Figure E.1;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
welding between hollow sections should be completed all round, even if this total length of weld is not
necessary for strength reasons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>E.3 Preparation of joint faces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With reference to 7.5.1.2, examples of application of EN ISO 9692-1 to brace to chord joints between hollow
sections are given in Figures E.2 to E.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommendations for the weld preparation and fit-up for mitre butt joints are locally the same as for butt
welds between two components in-line, which requires the bevel angle to be increased on the inside of the
mitre and reduced on the outside as shown in Figure E.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In accordance with 7.5.4 assembly of hollow section components to be welded shall be in accordance with the
following requirements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
assembly using non-overlapping welding of the separate components is preferred (Case A in Figure E.7);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
assembly of overlapping components should be avoided; if necessary Case B in Figure E.7 is
acceptable;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
if components overlap (as Case B), the welding details shall specified which components are to be cut to
fit around other components;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For joints not significantly subjected to dynamic loading, the following deviations may be permitted for the
alignment between the root edges or root faces of in-line butt joints between hollow section components:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
3 mm for material over 12 mm thick.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This alignment may be achieved using machining of ends to correct wall thickness variations and ovality or
out-of-squareness of hollow sections, provided that the remaining material thickness complies with the

<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
if the difference in thickness does not exceed 1,5 mm, no special measures are necessary;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
if the difference in thickness does not exceed 3 mm, the backing material may be shaped to
accommodate the difference (local hot forming of the backing material may be used);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Test to determine slip factor<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of this test is to determine the slip factor for a particular surface treatment, often involving a
surface coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test procedure is intended to ensure that account is taken of the possibility of creep deformation of the
connection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The validity of the test results for coated surfaces is limited to cases where all significant variables are similar
to those of the test specimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.2 Significant variables<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following variables shall be taken as significant on the test results:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the composition of the coating;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the surface treatment and treatment of primary layers in case of multi-layer systems, see G.3;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the maximum thickness of the coating, see G.3;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
the curing procedure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
the minimum time interval between application of the coating and application of load to the connection;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The specified surface treatment and coating shall be applied to the contact surfaces of the test specimens in a
manner consistent with the intended structural application. The mean coating thickness on the contact surface
of the test specimens shall be at least 25 % thicker than the nominal thickness specified for use in the
structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The curing procedure shall be documented, either by reference to published recommendations or by
description of the actual procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specimens shall be assembled such that the bolts are bearing in the opposite direction to the applied
tension.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The time interval (in hours) between coating and testing shall be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bolts shall be tightened to within ± 5 % of the specified preload,  F p,C , for the size and property class of the
bolt used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preload in the bolts shall be directly measured with equipment that is accurate to ± 5 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
If it is required to estimate bolt preload losses over time, the test specimens may be left for a specified period
at the end of which the preloads may be again measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bolt preloads in each test specimen shall be measured just prior to testing and, if necessary, the bolts
shall be retightened to the required ± 5 % accuracy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.4  Slip test procedure and evaluation of results<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Initially, five test specimens shall be tested. Four tests shall be loaded at normal speed (duration of test
approximately 10 min to 15 min). The fifth test specimen shall be used for the creep test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specimens shall be tested in a tension loading machine. The load-slip relationship shall be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EN 1090-2:2008 (E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The slip shall be taken as the relative displacement between adjacent points on an inner plate and a cover
plate, in the direction of the applied load. It shall be measured for each end of the specimen separately. For
each end, the slip shall be taken as the mean of the displacements on both sides of the specimen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The individual slip load for a connection,  F Si , is defined as the load at which a slip of 0,15 mm occurs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The fifth test specimen shall be loaded with a specific load of 90 % of the mean slip load  F Sm  from the first four
specimens (i.e. the mean of eight values).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If for the fifth specimen the delayed slip, i.e. difference between the recorded slip at five minutes and at three
hours after the application of the full load does not exceed 0,002 mm the slip loads for the fifth test specimen
shall be determined as for the first four. If the delayed slip exceeds 0,002 mm extended creep tests shall be
carried out in accordance with G.5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the standard deviation  s Fs  of the ten values (obtained from the five test specimens) for the slip load exceeds
8 % of the mean value, additional specimens shall be tested. The total number of test specimens (including
the first five) shall be determined from:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n  > ( s /3,5) 2<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>n   is the number of test specimens;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>s   is the standard deviation  s Fs  for the slip load from the first five specimens (ten values) expressed as a
percentage of the mean slip load value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>G.5  Extended creep test procedure and evaluation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If it is necessary to carry out extended creep tests, following G.4 at least three test specimens (six
connections) shall be tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A specific load shall be applied to the test specimen whose value shall be determined so as to account both
for the result of the creep test carried out in G.4 and for the results of all preceding extended creep tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
A load corresponding to the slip factor proposed for use in the structural application may be adopted. If the
surface treatment is to belong to a specified class, a load corresponding to the slip factor for that class may be taken in
accordance with Table 18.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A “displacement - log time” curve shall be plotted (see Figure G.2) to demonstrate that the load determined
using the proposed slip factor will not cause displacements greater than 0,3 mm during the design life of the
structure, taken as 50 years unless otherwise specified. The “displacement - log time curve” may be
extrapolated linearly as soon as the tangent can be determined with sufficient accuracy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For site tests the method used for tightening during the test shall be the same as that used on the site. For site
tests the basis of calibration is to record the torque values M i  needed to achieve the target preload tension in
the bolt.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tests may be carried out either in a laboratory or elsewhere under suitable conditions. The method used for
tightening shall be the same as that to be used on the site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
In certain cases it may be more convenient to have the product manufacturer check whether fastener
assemblies still meet the declared as-delivered properties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The nuts may be assumed to be sufficiently secured by the resin.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>K.6 Resin<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A two component resin should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the mixing of the two components, the mass should have such a viscosity, at the ambient temperature
during installation, that the narrow spaces in the bolted connection will be filled easily. However, the flowing of
the mass should stop after the injection pressure has been removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The potlife of the resin should be at least 15 min at the ambient temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If there are no data available, procedure tests should be carried out to determine the appropriate temperature
and curing time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design bearing strength of the resin should be determined similar to the procedure for the determination
of the slip factor as specified in Annex G.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>K.7 Tightening<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tightening of the bolts in accordance with Clause 8 should be carried out before starting the injection
procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>K.8 Installation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The installation should be carried out in accordance with the recommendations given by the product
manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The temperature of the resin should be between 15 °C and 25 °C. In very cold weather the resin and if
necessary the steel components should be preheated. If the temperature is too high, modelling clay may be
used to close the hole in the head and the groove in the washer immediately after injection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The connection should be free from water at the time of injection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
To get rid of the water one day of dry weather is generally necessary before starting the injection procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The curing time should be such that the resin is cured before the structure is loaded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heating after injection is permitted in order to reduce the curing time, if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
In some cases e.g. the repair of railway bridges, this time can be rather short. To reduce the curing time (to
about 5 h) the connection may be heated to a maximum of 50 °C after the potlife has passed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Sequential method for fasteners inspection<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>M.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sequential method for fasteners inspection shall be carried out according to the principles in
ISO 2859-5, the purpose of which being to give rules based on progressive determination of inspection
results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 2859-5 gives two methods for establishing sequential sampling plans: numerical method and graphic
method. The graphic method is applied for fasteners inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the graphic method (see Figure M.1) the horizontal axis is the number of fasteners inspected and the
vertical axis the number of defective fasteners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lines on the graph define three zones: the acceptance zone, the rejection zone and the indecision zone.
As long as the inspection result is in the indecision zone the inspection is continued until the cumulative plot
emerges into either the acceptance zone or the rejection zone. Acceptance means that no further sample
inspection is required. Two examples are given below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
