_Non-destructive testing of welds — Ultrasonic testing —
Acceptance levels
1 Scope . :
This International Standard specifies ultrasonic acceptance levels 2 and 3 for full penetration welded joints In
ferritic which correspond to [50 58717 quality levels B and C. An accéptarice level ta
[SO 5817 quatity level D is not inclu In this [nternational Standard as ultrasonic testing is generally not
requested for this weld quality.
These acceptance levels are to testing cartied out in accordance with ISO 77640.
This Intemational Standard applies to the examination of full penetration ferritic welds, with thicknesses
fram & mr to 100 mm. It can also be used fer other types of welds, materials and thicknesses above 100 mm,
Provided the examinations have been performed with necessary consideration af the geometry and acoustic
properties of the component, and an adequaie sensitivity can bs employed to enable the acceptance levets of
this Intemational Standard to be applied. The nominal frequency of probes used in this International Standard
is between unless attenuation ‘or-raquirements for higher resolution call jor other
The use acceptance in conjunction with outside this range needs ito
be considered careatully,

= Measurement of length
The length of an indication shail be determined by measuring the distance along the length over which the
echo amplitude is above the evaluation level, using the fixed amplitude level technique specified in Annex B.
Aftemative techniques for measuring indication langth may be used when specified.

Fixed amplitude level technique
The technique measures the lateral dimensions of an indication over. which the echea Is equal to or greater
than the evaluation
To make a measurement, the beam is scanned over the Indications, and the probe position and beam path
range, at which the echo has fallen to the evaluation level, are noted (positions 7 and 2 in Figure 6.1}. -
The lateral 7, is then determined by the distance between the positions 1 and 2.
