Below the two principle approaches are\ndescribed; i.e. the purchaser provides the component specification or the manufacturer provides it. In many\ncases the purchaser and manufacturer are both contributing to its preparation. For such cases the split of\nwork is a contractual issue that should be specified at the time of enquiry and order.\nA.2 Purchaser provided component specification (PPCS)\nIn a purchaser provided component specification the purchaser provides the necessary technical information\nto manufacture the component. The information needs to include specification of all constituent products to be\nused for all parts of the component. The specification needs also to include all geometrical information needed\nand the relevant requirements for execution of the work. Any particular requirements for execution need to be\ngiven.\nThe manufacturer's task in this case is to provide a component that complies with the PPCS and to perform\nmanufacturing in accordance with EN 1090-2 for steel components and EN 1090-3 for aluminium components,\nand to deliver documentation thereof.\nNOTE 1 __ it is presupposed that the structural design in this case has been performed by the purchaser, and that the\nstructural design is carried out according to provisions in the country where the component shall be used.\nNOTE 2 This approach complies with the manufacturer's declaration of performance characteristics according to\nMethod 3a in Guidance Paper L, see ZA.3.\nA.3 Manufacturer provided component specification (MPCS)\nIn a manufacturer provided component specification the manufacturer develops the necessary technical\ninformation to manufacture the component and all its parts. In this case there are two options for the content\nof a declaration of\nOption 1 The manufacturer declares the geometry and the material properties of the component, and any\nother information needed to enable others to perform a structural design.\nNOTE This complies with a declaration of performance characteristics according to Method 1 in Guidance Paper L,\nsee ZA.3.\nOption 2 The manufacturer declares the geometry and the maternal properties of the component and the\nstructural characteristics resulting from design of the component.\nNOTE 2 This complies with a declaration of performance characteristics according to Method 2 if the design is carried\nout according to Eurocode and Method 3b if the design is carried out according to other design provisions specified by the\npurchaser, see Guidance Paper L and 2A.3\nIn option 2, it is the manufacturer's task to provide a component where design and manufacturing are carried\nout by the manufacturer according to the specified requirements given in a design brief for the component.\n23\nUNI EN 1090-1:2012",
