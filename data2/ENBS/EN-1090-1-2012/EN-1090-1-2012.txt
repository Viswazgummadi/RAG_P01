EN 1090-1:2009+A1:2011(E)
Introduction
This harmonised European Standard is a part of a group of European standards dealing with design and
manufacturing of load bearing components and structures made of steel or aluminium.
This harmonised European Standard deals with provisions for conformity assessment of components which
imply conformity to performance characteristics declared by the manufacturer of the components.
The components have structural characteristics which make them fit for their particular use and function.
The structural characteristics are governed by the design and the manufacture of the components.
This harmonised European Standard does not contain rules for structural design and manufacture. Such rules
are called up from the relevant parts of Eurocode for design requirements and from EN 1090-2 (steel) and EN
1090-3 (aluminium) for execution requirements.
To use this harmonised European Standard for assessment and declaration of conformity of structural steel or
aluminium components all relevant design and execution standards within the group need to be available.
This harmonised European Standard has been prepared to satisfy Mandate M 120 — Structural metallic
products and ancillaries (2/4) — issued by the European Commission.

This European Standard covers also the conformity assessment of steel components used in composite steel
and concrete structures.
The components can be used directly or in construction works or as structural components in the form of kits.
This European Standard applies to series and non-series structural components including kits.
The components can be made of hot rolled or cold formed constituent products or constituent products
produced with other technologies. They may be produced of sections/profiles with various shapes, flat
products (plates, sheet, strip), bars, castings, forgings made of steel and aluminium materials, unprotected or
protected against corrosion by coating or other surface treatment, e.g. anodising of aluminium.
This European Standard covers structural cold formed members and sheeting as defined in EN 1993-1-3 and
EN 1999-1-4.
This European Standard does not cover conformity assessment of components for suspended ceilings, rails
or sleepers for use in railway systems.
NOTE For certain steel and aluminium components, particular specifications for performance and other requirements
have been developed. The particular specifications may be issued as an EN or as Clauses within an EN. An example is
given in EN 13084-7 for single wall steel chimneys and steel liners. Such particular specifications will take precedence in
case of non-compliance with the requirements of this European Standard.

6 Evaluation of conformity
6.1 General
The conformity of a component or kit with the requirements of this European Standard and with the stated
values (including classes) shall be demonstrated by:
a) initial type testing, see 6.2; and
b) factory production control by the manufacturer, including inspection and testing of products sampled from
production in accordance with a prescribed plan by the manufacturer, see 6.3.
For the purposes of testing, components or kits may be grouped into families if the selected
property/properties is/are common to all components within that family.
A family of welded steel components may be characterized by the parent material and the welding process
used. Materials of lower strength and materials which are more weldable may be included in the same family.
A family of welded aluminium components may be characterized by the material group and the welding
process applied whereby /xxx alloys cover all other alloys, 6xxx alloys cover 5xxx alloys and 3xxx alloys, 5xxx
alloys and 3xxx alloys may be regarded as one group.
Non-welded componenis in the same execution class may be treated as a family.
6.2 Initial type testing
6.2.1 General
Initial type testing is the complete set of tests or other procedures, determining the performance of samples of
products representative of the product type. The intention is to demonstrate and assess that the manufacturer
has the capabilities to provide structural components and kits according to this European Standard. The
assessment is related to two possible tasks performed by the manufacturer:
a) Initial type calculation (ITC) to assess the structural design capabilities, where the manufacturer shall
declare structural characteristics governed by design of the component:
b) Initial type testing (ITT) to assess the manufacturing capabilities.
Initial type testing shall be performed:
1) at the commencement of the production of a new component or the use of new constituent products
(unless a component of the same family);
2) at the commencement of a new or modified method of production if this would affect a characteristic
subject to evaluation;
3) if production is changed to a higher execution class.
In case of type testing of components or kits for which initial type evaluation in accordance with this standard
has already been performed, type evaluation may be reduced:
— if it has been established that the performance characteristics compared with the already evaluated
components or kits have not been affected; or
— inaccordance with the rules for grouping into families or direct extended application of test results.
If components are used whose characteristics have already been determined by the component manufacturer
on the basis of conformity with other product standards (e.g. manufacturing using constituent products
declared as conforming to a European Technical Specification), these characteristics need not be re-

evaluated, provided the characteristics of constituent products and components used in the manufacturing
process maintain their declared characteristics. Constituent products and components CE marked in
accordance with appropriate harmonised European specifications may be presumed to have the
performances stated with the CE marking.
6.2.2 Characteristics
All characteristics for which the manufacturer provides a declaration shall be determined using initial type
testing, with the following exceptions:
a) reaction to fire of a component which may be assessed indirectly by controlling the component's
constituent products;
b) release of dangerous substances which may be assessed indirectly by controlling the content of the
component's constituent
c) durability of all characteristics, which is ensured by correct specification to avoid corrosion or to limit its
effect by a prescriptive requirement for corrosion protection of the components.
6.2.3. Use of historical data
Evaluations previously performed in accordance with the provisions of this European Standard (same
component type, same characteristic{(s), same test method, same sampling procedure, same system of
attestation of conformity etc.) may be taken into account.
6.2.4 Use of structural calculations for conformity assessment
lf structural calculations are used to determine characteristic or design values to be declared, the confonnity
evaluation of these characteristics (ITC) shall be based on the manufacturer's personnel resources (employed
directly or by a sub-contractor), equipment and procedures used to perform structural calculations for the
range of components to be manufactured.
Procedures for the structural design process shall be documented and shall encompass handling of design
assumptions, design methods, design calculations including any use of computer programs and results of the
calculations with demonstration of procedures for corrective actions to be taken in case of non conformnity.
In cases where the manufacturer produces in accordance with calculations and component
specifications provided by the purchaser, the conformity evaluation shall check that the components or kits
comply with the component specification.
6.2.5 Initial type calculation
An initial type calculation carried out for a component can be used for documentation of subsequent
manufactured components with the same performance characteristics. A new or revised type calculation shall
be carried out if there is a change in one or more of the structural performance characteristics that are
affected by a change in the design brief of the component.
6.2.6 Sampling, evaluation and conformity criteria
The number of samples to be evaluated representing a component or family of components shall be in
accordance with Table 1.
6.2.7 Declaration of performance characteristics
All performance charactenstics given in Table 1 shall be declared by the manufacturer of the component. NPD
may be declared if this complies with the method for declaration, or if there are no requirements for the
performance charactenstic where the component shall be used.

Annex A
(informative)
Guidelines for preparation of the component specification
A.1 General
This Annex gives guidelines for the preparation of the component specification with regards to who has the
task of preparing it and what form the specification may take. Below the two principle approaches are
described; i.e. the purchaser provides the component specification or the manufacturer provides it. In many
cases the purchaser and manufacturer are both contributing to its preparation. For such cases the split of
work is a contractual issue that should be specified at the time of enquiry and order.
A.2 Purchaser provided component specification (PPCS)
In a purchaser provided component specification the purchaser provides the necessary technical information
to manufacture the component. The information needs to include specification of all constituent products to be
used for all parts of the component. The specification needs also to include all geometrical information needed
and the relevant requirements for execution of the work. Any particular requirements for execution need to be
given.
The manufacturer's task in this case is to provide a component that complies with the PPCS and to perform
manufacturing in accordance with EN 1090-2 for steel components and EN 1090-3 for aluminium components,
and to deliver documentation thereof.
NOTE 1 __ it is presupposed that the structural design in this case has been performed by the purchaser, and that the
structural design is carried out according to provisions in the country where the component shall be used.
NOTE 2 This approach complies with the manufacturer's declaration of performance characteristics according to
Method 3a in Guidance Paper L, see ZA.3.
A.3 Manufacturer provided component specification (MPCS)
In a manufacturer provided component specification the manufacturer develops the necessary technical
information to manufacture the component and all its parts. In this case there are two options for the content
of a declaration of
Option 1 The manufacturer declares the geometry and the material properties of the component, and any
other information needed to enable others to perform a structural design.
NOTE This complies with a declaration of performance characteristics according to Method 1 in Guidance Paper L,
see ZA.3.
Option 2 The manufacturer declares the geometry and the maternal properties of the component and the
structural characteristics resulting from design of the component.
NOTE 2 This complies with a declaration of performance characteristics according to Method 2 if the design is carried
out according to Eurocode and Method 3b if the design is carried out according to other design provisions specified by the
purchaser, see Guidance Paper L and 2A.3
In option 2, it is the manufacturer's task to provide a component where design and manufacturing are carried
out by the manufacturer according to the specified requirements given in a design brief for the component.

EN 1090-1:2009+A1:2011 (E)
The manufacturer needs to be provided with complete information from the purchaser of the parameters
required to determine the structural characteristics and any other information needed to be considered for the
use of the component. This information is needed for preparation of the design brief which is part of the
manufacturer's delivery unless otherwise agreed between the parties. A part of the information is whether
characteristic or design values of structural are to be declared.
For a PPCS as well as a MPCS the manufacturer declares that the manufacturing of the component(s) is in
accordance with EN 1090-2 for steel components and EN 1090-3 for aluminium components.
Table A.1 gives a summary of the manufacturer's tasks and delivery for the various methods for declaration of

Annex B
(normative)
Assessment of factory production control
B.1 General
This Annex gives the tasks to be performed to assess the FPC system in order to ensure that the FPC is
suitable for manufacturing of steel and/or aluminium components in accordance with the requirements of this
European Standard.
The tasks are dependant on whether the manufacturer performs a) manufacturing only or b) design and
manufacturing. The tasks for both options are related to two assessment activities:
— _ Initial inspection of both the factory and the factory production control system;
— Continuous surveillance and assessment of the FPC system.
