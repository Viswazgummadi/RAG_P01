<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Part 1:
General principles of design and corrosion resistance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 14713 provides guidelines and recommendations regarding the general principles of design
which are appropriate for articles to be zinc coated for corrosion protection and the level of corrosion
resistance provided by zinc coatings applied to iron or steel articles, exposed to a variety of environments.
Initial protection is covered in relation to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  available standard processes,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  design considerations, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  environments for use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 14713 applies to zinc coatings applied by the following processes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
hot dip galvanized coatings (applied after fabrication);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
hot dip galvanized coatings (applied onto continuous sheet);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
sherardized coatings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
thermal sprayed coatings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
mechanically plated coatings;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
electrodeposited coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These guidelines and recommendations do not deal with the maintenance of corrosion protection in service
for steel with zinc coatings. Guidance on this subject can be found in ISO 12944-5 and ISO 12944-8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
There are a variety of product-related standards (e.g. for nails, fasteners, ductile iron pipes, etc.) which
provide specific requirements for the applied zinc coating systems which go beyond any general guidance presented in
this part of ISO 14713. These specific product-related requirements will take precedence over these general
recommendations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4
Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 Iron and steel substrates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In hot dip galvanizing, the reactivity of the steel is modified by its chemical composition, particularly by the
silicon plus phosphorus contents (see ISO 14713-2). The metallurgical and chemical nature of the steel is
irrelevant to protection by thermally sprayed or sherardized coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The broad range of steels likely to be subject to zinc coating will commonly fall into the following categories:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90 % of steel production [e.g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EN 10025-2 and EN 10080 (steel reinforcement)];<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  high strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steels have small additions (usually  <  2 % by weight) of other elements,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>typically 1,5 % manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase (e.g. EN 10025-6);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  low-alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>amounts of up to 10 % by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections (e.g. EN 10083-1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steel can be hot rolled or cold formed. Hot rolling is used to produce angle, “I”, “H” and other structural
sections. Some structural sections, e.g. safety barriers, cladding rails, and cladding panels, are cold formed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Cast and wrought irons are of various metallurgical and chemical compositions. This is irrelevant to protection
by thermally sprayed or sherardized coatings but special consideration is needed regarding the cast irons
most suitable for hot dip galvanizing (see ISO 14713-2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Zinc coatings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The application of zinc coatings provides an effective method of retarding or preventing corrosion of ferrous
materials (see Clause 1 for the range of zinc coatings/processes covered by this part of ISO 14713). Zinc
coatings are used in this regard because they protect iron and steel both by barrier action and by galvanic
action.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Selection of zinc coating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The zinc coating system to be used should be selected by taking the following items into account:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the general environment (macro-climate) in which it is to be applied;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
local variations in the environment (micro-climate), including anticipated future changes and any
exceptional exposure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 14713-1:2009(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the required life to first maintenance of the zinc coating system;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
the need for ancillary components;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
the need for post-treatment for temporary protection;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
the need for painting, either initially (duplex system) or when the zinc coating is approaching the end of its
life to first maintenance to achieve minimal maintenance cost;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
the availability and cost;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
if the life to first maintenance of the system is less than that required for the structure, its ease of
maintenance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The life for a zinc coating in any particular atmospheric exposure condition is approximately proportional to the
thickness of the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The operational sequence for applying the selected system should be determined in consultation with the
steel fabricator and the applier of the zinc coating system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6
Design requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General principles of design to avoid corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Design of structures and products should influence the choice of protective system. It may be appropriate and
economic to modify the design to suit the preferred protective system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The items in a) to j) should be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Safe and easy access for cleaning and maintenance should be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Pockets and recesses in which water and dirt can collect should be avoided; a design with smooth
contours facilitates application of a protective coating and helps to improve corrosion resistance.
Corrosive chemicals should be directed away from structural components, e.g. drainage tubes should be
used to control de-icing salts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Areas which are inaccessible after erection should be given a coating system designed to last the
required life of the structure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
If bimetallic corrosion (corrosion due to contact between dissimilar materials: metals and/or alloys) is
possible, additional protective measures should be considered (see ISO 14713-2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Where the coated iron and steel are likely to be in contact with other building materials, special
consideration should be given to the contact area; e.g. the use of paint, tapes or plastic foils should be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Hot dip galvanizing, sherardizing, mechanical coating, zinc flake coating or electroplating can be provided
only in works; thermal spraying can be applied in works or on site. When paint is to be applied to a zinc
coating, the application is more readily controlled in works but, where there is a likelihood of substantial
damage occurring during transportation and erection, specifiers may prefer to apply the final paint coat on
site. The application of a powder coating on metal coated steel can only be done in works.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the total system is applied offsite, the specification has to cover the need for care at all stages to
prevent damage to the finished iron and steel and set out repair procedures to the coating once the
steelwork is erected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
Hot dip galvanizing (in accordance with ISO 1461), sherardizing (in accordance with EN 13811) or
thermal spraying (in accordance with ISO 2063) should take place after bending and other forms of
fabrication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
Methods of marking parts shall not have an influence on the quality of the pre-treatment operations prior
to coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
Precautions may be required to minimize the likelihood of deformation during processing or subsequently.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
The conditions experienced by the articles during coating application may also need to be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Design for application of different zinc coating processes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design practice for hot dip coating differs from that for other zinc coating systems. ISO 14713-2 provides
guidance on the design for hot dip coatings. This supplements the general principles of good design for steel
structures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design practice for sherardized coatings can be found in ISO 14713-3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design for zinc thermal spraying should be discussed with the thermal sprayer at an early stage so that
adequate provision is made for access to all areas of the article (see EN 15520).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The design for electroplating with zinc follows the general design principles for electroplating and these are
not given here. The design for mechanical coating is best discussed with specialist applicators; in general,
these processes are most suitable for small parts which can be tumbled in a barrel but specialist plants may
be available for other shapes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Tubes and hollow sections<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If they are dry and hermetically sealed, the internal surfaces of tubes and hollow sections will not need
protection. Where hollow sections are fully exposed to the weather, or interior environments that might give
rise to condensation, and are not hermetically sealed, consideration should be given to the need for both
internal and external protection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.2
Corrosion protection of internal and external surfaces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hot dip galvanizing gives equal thickness internally and externally. There are some special products where
the thickness of the coating is different on internal and external surfaces, e.g. tubes for water distribution
systems (see EN 10240). When tubes and hollow sections are hot dip galvanized after assembly into
structures, drainage/venting holes should be provided for processing purposes (see ISO 14713-2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Fastenings to be used with hot dip galvanized, sherardized or thermal sprayed coatings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The protective treatment of bolts, nuts and other parts of the structural connections should be given careful
consideration. Ideally, their protective treatment should provide a similar performance to that specified for the
general surfaces. Specific requirements are given in the appropriate product International Standards (e.g.
ISO 10684) and in a series of International Standards for coatings on fasteners which are in the course of
preparation/publication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Hot dip galvanized (see, for example, ISO 1461 which covers specified minimum coating thicknesses up to
55 µm), sherardized, or other coatings on steel fasteners should be considered. Alternatively, stainless steel
fasteners can be used; for precautions to take in order to minimize the potential for bimetallic corrosion,
see 7.9.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mating surfaces of connections made with high-strength friction-grip bolts should be given special
treatment. It is not necessary to remove thermally sprayed, sheradized or hot dip coatings from such areas to
obtain an adequate coefficient of friction. However, consideration has to be given to any long-term slip or
creep-avoidance requirements and to any necessary adjustments to the assembly dimensions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.2
Welding considerations related to coatings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recommended to weld prior to hot dip galvanizing, sherardizing or thermal spraying. The use of welding
anti-spatter sprays that cannot be removed in the pretreatment process at the galvanizers' works should be
avoided. For this reason, where welding sprays are used, low silicone, water-soluble sprays are
recommended. After welding, the surface should be prepared to the standard specified for preparing the
steelwork overall before applying the protective coating process. Welding should be balanced (i.e. equal
amounts on each side of the main axis) to avoid introducing unbalanced stresses in a structure. Welding
residues have to be removed before coating. The normal pretreatments for thermal spraying are usually
sufficient for this purpose but extra pretreatment may be needed for hot dip galvanizing; in particular, weld
slag should be removed separately. Some forms of welding leave alkaline deposits behind. These have to be
removed by blast-cleaning followed by washing with clean water before applying thermally-sprayed coatings.
(This does not apply to hot dip galvanizing and sherardizing where the pretreatment process removes alkaline
deposits.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is desirable that fabrication takes place without the use of a blast primer, as this has to be removed before
hot dipping, sherardizing or thermal spraying.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where welding takes place after hot dip galvanizing, sherardizing or thermal spraying, it is preferable, before
welding, to remove the coating locally in the area of the weld to ensure the highest quality weld. After welding,
protection should be appropriately restored locally by thermal spraying, “solder sticks” and/or zinc dust paints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is not recommended to weld sherardized articles, but spot-welding may be possible in certain applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After welding of coated steels, the surface should be prepared to the standard specified for preparing the
steelwork overall before applying paint or fusion-bonded powder coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assemblies comprising different metals needing different pretreatments should be discussed with the
processor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding of zinc coated parts must be done with appropriate local air ventilation in accordance with health and
safety regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4.3
Brazing or soldering<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Soft soldered assemblies cannot be hot dip galvanized or sherardized and brazing should be avoided if
possible — many types of brazing are unsuitable for hot dip galvanizing or sherardizing. The galvanizer or
sherardizer should be consulted if brazing is being considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since corrosive fluxes may be used in these processes, removal of flux residues after the coating process is
essential to avoid corrosion of the coated parts; the design of these parts should facilitate this.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5 Duplex systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 12944-5 and EN 13438 give information on organic coatings which are applied to hot dip galvanized or
sherardized coatings. When such an organic coating has been applied, the term “duplex system” is used to
describe the combination of coatings — historically, this term was most commonly used to describe organic
coatings on hot dip galvanized articles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The life of a zinc coated steel structure is longer than the life of the zinc coating system that is initially applied
to it, as some steel can be lost by corrosion before a structure becomes unserviceable. If it is necessary to
prolong the life of the zinc coating, maintenance has to take place before any steel rusting occurs and
preferably while at least 20 µm to 30 µm of zinc coating remains. This gives a maintained zinc coating plus
organic coating system a longer total life than a simple organic coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total life of a zinc coating plus organic coating system is usually significantly greater than the sum of the
lives of the zinc coating and protective organic coating. There is a synergistic effect, i.e. the presence of zinc
coatings reduces under-rusting of the paint film; the paint preserves the zinc coating from early corrosion.
Where it is desired to retain a reasonably intact layer of paint as a basis for maintenance, the initially applied
paint system should have extra thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Maintenance usually takes place when the zinc coating loses its appearance or becomes degraded. Zinc
coatings usually take longer to degrade than paint. Hence a zinc coating may be recommended for 20 years
or more up to first maintenance, whereas the same coating when covered by paint is, for reasons of
appearance of the paint, recommended for only 10 years up to first maintenance. It should also be noted that
an area of degraded paint can retain moisture and hence hasten the corrosion of metal, particularly on a
surface not washed by rain.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If maintenance is delayed until the zinc coating has been consumed and rusting has started, the iron and steel
have to be maintained in the same way as rusted painted steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6 Maintenance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Zinc coatings may be left unmaintained if the corrosion rate of the coating is insufficient to affect the
performance of the structure in its designed period of use. If a longer life span is required, maintenance of the
coating should be carried out by stripping and re-galvanizing (part of) the structure or by painting while some
original coating remains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7
Corrosion in different environments<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Atmospheric exposure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The corrosion rate of a zinc coating is affected by the time for which it is exposed to wetness, air pollution and
contamination of the surface, but the corrosion rates are much slower than for steel and often decrease with
time. General information on the atmospheric corrosion rate for zinc is given in ISO 9224.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 1 gives basic groups of environments (related to ISO 9223). Where the relative humidity is below
60 %, the corrosion rate of iron and steel is negligible and they may not require zinc coating, e.g. inside
many buildings. Zinc coating with or without painting may, however, be required for appearance or for
reasons of hygiene, e.g. in a food factory. When the relative humidity is higher than 60 % or where they
are exposed to wet or immersed conditions or prolonged condensation then, like most metals, iron and
steel are subject to more serious corrosion. Contaminants deposited on the surface, notably chlorides
and sulfates, accelerate attack. Substances that deposit on the surface of the iron and steel increase
corrosion if they absorb moisture or go into solution on the surface of the iron and steel. The temperature
also influences the corrosion rate of unprotected iron and steel and temperature fluctuations have a
stronger effect than the average temperature value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The micro-environment, i.e. the conditions prevailing around the structure, is also important because it allows
a more precise assessment of the likely conditions than study of the basic climate alone. It is not always
known at the planning stage of a project. Every effort should be made to identify it accurately, however,
because it is an important factor in the total environment against which corrosion protection is required. An
example of a micro-climate is the underside of a bridge (particularly over water).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The corrosion of steelwork inside buildings is dependent upon the internal environment but in “normal”
atmospheres, e.g. dry and heated, it is insignificant. Steelwork in the perimeter walls of buildings is influenced
by the configuration within the perimeter wall, e.g. steelwork without direct contact with the outer leaf of a wall
comprising two parts separated by an air space is at less risk of corrosion than steelwork in contact with or
embedded in the outer leaf. Buildings containing industrial processes, chemical environments, wet or
contaminated environments should be given special consideration. Steelwork which is partially sheltered, e.g.
farm barns and aircraft hangars, should be considered as being subject to the exterior environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table 1 also sets out an indication of the likely range of corrosion rates which are applicable to zinc coatings
exposed to the different types of corrosivity category dealt with in ISO 9223.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Corrosion rates exceeding the upper limits in category C5 are considered as extreme. Corrosivity category CX refers to specific marine and
marine/industrial environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 12
To a first approximation, the corrosion of all metallic zinc surfaces is at the same rate in a particular environment. Iron and steel will normally
corrode 10 to 40 times faster than zinc, the higher ratios usually being in high-chloride environments. The data is related to data on flat sheet given in
ISO 9223 and ISO 9224.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 13
Change in atmospheric environments occurs with time. For many regions, the concentrations of pollutants (particularly SO 2 ) in the atmosphere
have reduced with time. This has lead to a lowering of the corrosivity category for these regions. This has, in turn, lead to the zinc coatings experiencing
lower corrosion rates compared to historical corrosion performance data. Other regions have experienced increasing pollution and industrial activity and
therefore would be expected to develop environments more accurately described by higher corrosivity categories.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 14
The corrosion rate for zinc and for zinc-iron alloy layers are approximately the same.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Exposure to soils<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The wide range in physical and chemical properties of soils (e.g. the pH variation from 2,6 to 12 and resistivity
from tens of ohms to approximately 100 k Ω ) and the gross inhomogeniety of soils means that corrosion of zinc
coatings in soils is rarely uniform in nature. Corrosion in soil is dependent on the mineral content, on the
nature of these minerals and on the organic components, water content and oxygen content (aerobic and
anaerobic corrosion). Corrosion rates in disturbed soil conditions are usually higher than in undisturbed soil.
General guidance on the corrosion likelihood in soil can also be found in EN 12501-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lime-containing soils and sandy soils (provided that they are chloride-free) are, in general, least corrosive,
whilst clay soils and clay marl soils are corrosive to a limited extent. In bog and peat soils, the corrosiveness
depends on the total acid content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where major iron and steel structures such as pipelines, tunnels, and tank installations, pass through different
types of soil, increased corrosion (localized) can occur at isolated points (anodic areas) by the formation of
differential aeration cells. For some uses, e.g. earth reinforcement, a controlled backfill is used in conjunction
with a zinc coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Corrosion cells can also form at the soil/air and soil/ground-water level interfaces, leading possibly to
increased corrosion, and these areas should be given special consideration. Conversely, the application of
cathodic protection for structures in soil (or in water) can both modify the protective coating requirements and
lengthen their life. Specialist advice should be sought for full guidance on all conditions involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While the average annual corrosion rates for zinc coatings in most soils are less than 10 µm per annum, the
factors influencing corrosion in specific soil environments are complex and detailed expert advice should be
sought regarding individual exposure conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
The figures for life have been rounded to whole numbers. The allocation of the durability designation is based upon the average of the
minimum and maximum of the calculated life to first maintenance, e.g. 85 µm zinc coating in corrosivity category C4 (corrosion rate for zinc between 2,1 µm
per annum and 4,2 µm per annum), gives expected durability of 85/2,1 = 40,746 years (rounded to 40 years) and 85/4,2 = 20,238 years (rounded to
20 years). Average durability of (20 + 40)/2 = 30 years – designated “VH”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
Life to first maintenance of protective coating systems: The list of systems given in this table, classified by environment and typical time to first
maintenance, indicates the options open to the specifier. The recommended treatments listed for longer lives will always protect for shorter periods and are
often also economical for these shorter periods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3
This table can be applied to any zinc coating to determine the life to first maintenance. The corrosion rate for any given environment is
indicated by the corrosivity classification category, C3 to CX. The minimum and maximum life to first maintenance for the selected system is set out in the
body of this table.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 4
It is impossible to achieve an exactly uniform thickness of any type of coating. The third column of this table indicates the minimum average
coating thickness for each system. In practice, the overall mean is likely to be substantially in excess of this minimum, which is important as the zinc
coatings are able to provide protection to adjacent areas which can lose their coating prematurely.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 5
It should be noted that thickness requirements in EN 10240 are minimum local thickness requirements. Furthermore, the thickness quoted for
coatings in these tables may not match specified coating thicknesses in some standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 6
In this table, guidance is given for coatings applied to structural and cold-forming grades of hot dip galvanized sheet and cold-rolled sections,
on zinc electroplated sheet, on coatings thermally sprayed with zinc, on mechanically plated coatings, on sherardized coatings and for articles hot dip
galvanized after manufacture. Hot dip galvanized fabricated and semi-fabricated products made from thin material and fasteners and other centrifuged work
usually have intermediate thicknesses of coating (see also relevant product standards). As the life of all zinc coatings is approximately proportional to the
thickness or mass of zinc coating present, the relative performance of such intermediate thicknesses can readily be assessed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 7
Zinc/aluminium alloy coatings (with 5 % to 55 % aluminium) usually last longer than pure zinc; pending wider use, they are not included in this
table. There is widespread technical literature available on these classes of materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 8
Thickness of hot dip galvanizing on products: ISO 1461 specifies the standard hot dip galvanized coating at the equivalent of 85 µm minimum
for steel  >  6 mm thick. Thinner steel, automatically hot dip galvanized tubes and centrifugal work (usually threaded work and fittings) have thinner coatings,
but these are usually greater than 45 µm. Where it is desired to use coatings of different thicknesses to those stated, their lives can be ascertained by
calculation; the life of a zinc coating is (to a first approximation) proportional to its thickness. For tubes, EN 10240 includes an option for the purchaser to
specify a thicker coating requirement which will give an extended service life. Hot dip galvanized coatings thicker than 85 µm are not specified in ISO 1461
but the general provisions of that International Standard apply and, together with specific thickness figures, may form a specification capable of third-party
verification. It is essential to know the composition of the steel to be used and the galvanizer should be consulted before specifying, as these thicker
coatings may not be available for all types of steel. Where the steel is suitable, thick coatings may be specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 9
Thickness of sherardizing on products: EN 13811 specifies coating thickness of 3 classes up to 45 µm, but for special applications a higher
thickness may be appropriate. Thicker coatings up to 75 µm can be considered. The sherardizer should be consulted where thicker coatings are required,
as a thicker coating may not be available for all types of steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 10
Thermal spray coatings. These coatings are normally used as part of a corrosion protection system after receiving a sealing coat. The
performance of the coating system is highly dependent upon this being carried out effectively. No data is provided for performance in this part of
ISO 14713. Further guidance can be found in EN 15520.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Exposure to water<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The type of water — soft or hard fresh water/brackish water/salt water — has a major influence on the
corrosion of iron and steel in water and the selection of protective zinc coatings. With zinc coatings, corrosion
is affected primarily by the chemical composition of the water but temperature, pressure, flow rate, agitation
and oxygen availability are all important. For example, zinc should not be used in hot non-scale-forming
waters; heavy corrosion of zinc can also occur in condensate, especially between about 55 °C and 80 °C (e.g.
in saunas). Otherwise, barrier protection can occur at all temperatures; below about 60 °C, zinc can also
provide cathodic protection. The duration of life of zinc surfaces in cold scale-forming waters is usually higher
than in non-scale-forming waters (Ryznar's or Langelier’s index should be used to calculate whether the water
is scale-forming). Since the composition of non-saline waters can vary greatly, previous experience or expert
advice should be sought.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For hot water, specialist advice should always be sought (see also for example EN 12502-3). Coatings used
for all structures (including pipes, fittings, tanks and tank covers) in contact with potable water should be
non-toxic and should not impart any taste or odour, colour or turbidity to the water, nor foster microbial attack.
With tanks, if additional protection to hot dip galvanizing is necessary, sufficient coats of high-build bitumen
paint should be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Zones of fluctuating water level (i.e., the area in which the water level changes as a result of natural
fluctuations — e.g. tidal movements, or artificial alteration of the water level in lock chambers or reservoirs) or
splash zones should be given special consideration as, in addition to water attack, there can also be
atmospheric attack and abrasion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The many factors affecting corrosion in fresh water make it impracticable to present simple guidance. Some
guidelines for seawater are set out below but it is emphasized that, for all water exposures, specialist advice
should be sought for full guidance on all conditions involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In temperate sea water, the average zinc corrosion rate will usually lie between 10 µm per annum and 20 µm
per annum. Hot dip galvanized tube, hot dip galvanized/Zn electrodeposited sheet and fittings with galvanized,
sherardized, electrodeposited or mechanically plated coatings normally have additional protection when used
in sea water (see ISO 12944-5 and ISO 12944-8 and EN 13438). Brackish water may be more or less
corrosive than sea water and no general estimates of durability can be given.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guidance on the corrosion likelihood for hot dip galvanized coatings used in water storage and distribution
systems can be found in EN 12502-3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Abrasion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Natural mechanical exposure can occur in waters by shifting of boulders, abrasion by sand, wave splashing,
etc. Particles entrained by the wind (for example sand) can also cause increased attack. Zinc coatings have
much higher abrasion resistance (a factor of 10 or more) than most conventional paint coatings. The zinc-iron
alloys are particularly hard. Areas walked on or driven on, or which rub together, can be subject to severe
abrasion. Areas under coarse gravel are subjected to severe erosion by impact and abrasion. The good bond
between zinc coatings and steel (particularly in hot dip galvanizing and sherardizing where there is an alloying
reaction) helps to limit such effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 Exposure to chemicals<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A primary factor governing corrosion behaviour of zinc coatings in liquid chemical environments is the pH of
the chemical solution. Zinc coatings, such as galvanizing, perform well in solutions of pH above 5,5 and below
12,5. Factors such as agitation, aeration, temperature, polarization, and the presence of inhibitors may affect
the specific rate of corrosion experienced by the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Within the pH range of 5,5 to 12,5, a protective film forms on the zinc surface and the corrosion rate is very
slow. The precise chemical composition of the protective film is somewhat dependent upon the specific
chemical environment. Since many liquids fall within the pH range of 5,5 to 12,5, galvanized steel containers
are widely used in storing and transporting many chemical solutions. Prolonged or frequent direct contact with
acids or strong alkalis is not recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Many organic solvents have little effect on non-ferrous metals but specific advice should be sought for each
chemical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Elevated temperatures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All the zinc coatings described are usually suitable for elevated temperatures. Separate advice has to be
sought regarding any organic materials/coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temperatures above 200 °C are not considered in this part of ISO 14713.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Temperatures between + 200 °C and + 500 °C occur only under special conditions of construction and
operation, e.g. in steel chimneys, flue gas ducts and gas take-off mains in coking plants. Specialist advice
should be sought for the coating of surfaces so exposed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sherardized coatings have a temperature resistance up to 600 °C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7 Contact with concrete<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unprotected steel articles in contact with concrete can corrode as moisture penetrates into the concrete
through cracks and pores. The oxidation products from the reaction between the steel and the
oxygen/moisture present can create sufficient pressure to cause damage to the concrete (spalling). Zinc
coatings (usually applied in the form of a hot dip galvanized coating to reinforcement — see ISO 14657), can
be used to prevent this type of deterioration for long periods of time, dependent upon the specific exposure
environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The corrosion protection afforded by galvanized rebar in concrete is due to a combination of beneficial effects.
Of primary importance is the substantially higher chloride threshold (2 to 4 times) for zinc coatings to start
corroding compared to uncoated steel. In addition, zinc has a much greater pH passivation range than steel,
making galvanized rebar resistant to the pH lowering effects of carbonation as the concrete ages. Even when
the zinc coating does start to corrode, its corrosion rate is considerably less than that of uncoated steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Zinc remains passive at significantly lower pH levels than for black steel (9,5 versus 11,5) making galvanized
rebar far less susceptible to corrosion due to carbonation of the concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Zinc reacts with wet concrete to form calcium hydroxyzincate accompanied by the evolution of hydrogen. This
corrosion product is insoluble and protects the underlying zinc (provided that the surrounding concrete mixture
is below a pH of about 13,3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Research has shown that during this initial reaction period until coating passivation and concrete hardening
occurs, some of the pure zinc layer of the coating is dissolved. However, this initial reaction ceases once the
concrete hardens and the hydroxyzincate coating has formed. Studies of galvanized rebar recovered from
field structures indicate that the coating remains in this passive state for extended periods of time, even when
exposed to high chloride levels in the surrounding concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For concretes of high pH, or where some background chlorides are expected, the zinc surface can be
passivated, using a range of proprietary post-treatments, as a safeguard against excessive hydrogen
evolution that may, in serious cases, reduce the pullout strength of the bar. For normal concrete conditions,
research has shown no statistical difference in bond strength between galvanized rebar that was passivated
or not passivated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sherardized coatings in accordance with EN 13811 are passivated and therefore will be prepared for either
low or high levels of chloride added to concrete. In all other respects sherardizing will act in the same way as
hot dip galvanizing in contact with concrete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.8 Contact with wood<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Zinc coated products are used very successfully in many applications which bring them into contact with a
variety of woods. Care should be taken, however, to avoid direct contact between zinc coatings and timbers
which have been freshly treated with acidic preservatives. Once the wood has dried and the preservatives
have been fixed, contact is acceptable, even when the wood once more becomes wet. Very acidic woods,
such as oak, sweet chestnut, western red cedar and Douglas fir can be used in conjunction with zinc coated
articles, although some initial corrosion would be expected. In these cases, isolation techniques may be
considered, e.g. application of an organic coating over the area of contact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sherardizing coatings consist of zinc-iron alloys, which, because of the thermal diffusion technique, produce a
surface which has a high coefficient of friction similar to all-alloy layer coatings developed on many hot dip
galvanized articles. These coatings would tend to require high withdrawal loads to break the bond with the
wood where used on nails, for instance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9 Bimetallic contact<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When two dissimilar metals come into direct contact and an electrolyte such as moisture is present there is a
potential for bimetallic corrosion to take place with the more electronegative or anodic metal, as determined
from the electro-chemical series, corroding preferentially to prevent corrosion of the other metal (see Table 3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Stainless steel<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Cathodic — less prone to corrosion<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The bimetallic effect is the basis for the sacrificial protection that a zinc coating (e.g. hot dip galvanizing) offers
to small areas of exposed steel if the coating becomes damaged. Zinc coatings will corrode preferentially to
protect any metal below it in the electro-chemical series.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The level of bimetallic corrosion that will take place will depend upon a number of factors, including: the
specific metals in contact, the ratio of the surface area of the two metals and the exposure conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally the level of bimetallic corrosion will increase with a greater difference in electrode potential between
the two metals, e.g. the further apart the two metals are in the electro-chemical series. However, the electrode
potential may vary due to oxide layer formation and cannot be used alone to determine if and at what level of
severity bimetallic corrosion will take place, as other factors such as those described below are also important.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The ratio of the surface area of the two metals is essential and ideally the ratio of anodic-to-cathodic metals
should be high. Where the ratio is reduced problems may occur due to the greater level of oxygen reduction
which may take place, leading to increased corrosion of the anodic metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The exposure conditions are critical, as for bimetallic corrosion to take place an electrolyte must bridge the
two metals present. As a result, in dry internal environments the potential for bimetallic corrosion is very low,
while in external atmospheric environments the potential increases due to the presence of water in the form of
rain and condensation. The worst exposure conditions, however, are those of immersion in a solution where
an electrolyte is permanently bridging the two metals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally any potential for bimetallic corrosion may be alleviated by electrically insulating the two metals from
one another. For bolted connections, this might be done by using neoprene or plastic washers, while for
overlapping surfaces, it might be achieved by using plastic spacers or painting one of the surfaces with a
suitable paint system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally hot dip galvanized steel performs well in contact with most common engineering metals when in an
atmospheric environment as illustrated in the Table 4, provided the ratio of hot dip galvanized steel to other
metal is high. Conversely in immersed conditions, the effect of bimetallic corrosion is significantly increased
and some form of isolation will normally be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The following guidance relates to specific applications concerning zinc coated steelwork in contact with the
designated metal or alloy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Aluminium – The severity of increase in bimetallic corrosion due to atmospheric contact with aluminium is
relatively low. However, it should be remembered that one application where galvanized steel and
aluminium are used in conjunction with one another is aluminium cladding. In this instance, isolation is
advised due to the large surface area of the aluminium panels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Copper – Due to the large potential set up by contact between zinc coated steel and copper and
copper-containing alloys, electrical isolation is always advised, even in an atmospheric environment.
Where possible, design should also avoid run-off of water from copper onto zinc coated articles, as small
amounts of copper dissolved in the water may be deposited, leading to bimetallic corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Lead – Potential for bimetallic corrosion with lead is low in an atmospheric environment and no problems
have been reported concerning, for example, the use of lead flashing with zinc or zinc coated products
and the use of lead in fixing galvanized posts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Stainless steel – The most common use of stainless steel with zinc coated steel is in the form of nuts and
bolts in an atmospheric environment. Given the low potential for bimetallic corrosion and the small
surface area of stainless steel fasteners, bimetallic corrosion would not normally be an issue although, as
always, best practice remains isolation using insulating washers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Practical experience suggests that, where the surface area ratio of zinc to other metal is high and a rating of
“a” or “a – b” is indicated, little or no additional corrosion will take place as a result of the contact. However,
where the ratio of surface areas is reduced or the rating is higher, some form of insulation may be required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8
Accelerated test methods applied to zinc coatings<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Salt spray tests cannot be used to accurately test zinc-coated steel because they accelerate the wrong failure
mechanism. Without a proper wet/dry cycle, the zinc coating cannot form patina layers. The absence of a
patina layer allows constant attack of the zinc metal and gives a very low prediction of the zinc coating lifetime.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Efforts have been made in many zinc coated steel applications to develop the correct test method to
determine a proper “accelerated” lifetime. One test for corrosion prevention systems in the United States is ASTM B117.
ASTM Committee G-1 on Corrosion of Metals has jurisdiction over the salt spray standards ASTM B117 and ASTM G85.
The Committee passed the following resolution regarding the use of ASTM B117: “ASTM Committee G-1 on the Corrosion
of Metals confirms that results of salt spray (fog) tests, run according to ASTM standard designation B117, seldom
correlate with performance in natural environments. Therefore, the Committee recommends that the test not be used or
referenced in other standards for that purpose, unless appropriate corroborating long-term atmospheric exposures have
been conducted”. Guidance on the use of accelerated tests as applied to metallic coated systems is under preparation in
ISO/TC 107 SC 7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
