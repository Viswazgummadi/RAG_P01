<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Magnetizing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.1
Magnetizing equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified, e.g., in an application standard, the following types of alternating current-
magnetizing equipment shall be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
electromagnetic yokes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of direct current-magnetization or permanent magnets shall be specified prior to testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The magnetizing equipment shall conform to ISO 9934-3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where prods are used, precautions shall be taken to minimize overheating, burning or arcing at the contact
tips. Removal of arc burns shall be carried out where necessary. The affected area shall be tested by a
suitable method to ensure the integrity of the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.2
Verification of magnetization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A tangential magnetic field strength of 2 kA/m to 6 kA/m (r.m.s.) is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Verification of the magnetic field strength shall be carried out using one of the following methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
a component containing fine, natural or artificial imperfections in the least favourable locations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
measurement of the tangential field strength as close as possible to the surface using a Hall effect probe.
The appropriate tangential field strength can be difficult to measure close to abrupt changes in the shape
of a component, or where flux leaves the surface of a component;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
calculation of the approximate current value in order to achieve the recommended tangential field
strength; the calculation can be based on the current values specified in Figures 5 and 6;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
other methods based on established principles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Flux indicators, placed in contact with the surface being tested, can provide a guide to the magnitude and
direction of the tangential field, but should not be used to verify that the field strength is acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.6.1
Field directions and testing area<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The detectability of an imperfection depends on the angle of its major axis with respect to the direction of the
magnetic field. This is explained for one direction of magnetization in Figure 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 1 — Directions of detectable imperfections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To ensure detection of imperfections in all orientations, the welds shall be magnetized in two directions
approximately perpendicular to each other with a maximum deviation of 30 ° . This can be achieved using one
or more magnetization methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Testing in only one field direction is not recommended but may be carried out if specified, e.g., in an
application standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using yokes or prods, there will be an area of the component in the vicinity of each pole piece or tip that
will be impossible to test due to excessive magnetic field strength. This is usually seen as furring of particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care shall be taken to ensure adequate overlap of the testing areas as shown in Figures 2 and 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The verification shall be carried out on components having known or artificial surface imperfections, or on pre-
magnetized reference pieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indications obtained with the medium to be verified shall be compared against those obtained from a medium
having a known and acceptable performance. For this purpose the reference indications may be:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
real imperfections;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
photograph(s);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
replica(s).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8 V i ewing conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The viewing conditions shall be in accordance with ISO 3059.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9 Application of detection media<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After the object has been prepared for testing, the detection medium shall be applied by spraying, flooding or
dusting immediately prior to and during the magnetization. Following this, time shall be allowed for indications
to form before removal of the magnetic field.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When magnetic suspensions are used, the magnetic field shall be maintained within the object until the
majority of the suspension carrier liquid has drained away from the test surface. This will prevent any
indications being washed away.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Depending on the material being tested, its surface condition and magnetic permeability, indications will
normally remain on the surface even after removal of the magnetic field due to residual magnetism within the
part. However, the presence of residual magnetism shall not be presumed and post evaluation techniques
after removal of the prime magnetic field source are only permitted when a component has been proven by an
overall performance test to retain magnetic indications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.10 Overall performance test<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When specified, an overall performance test of the system sensitivity for each procedure shall be carried out
on site. The performance test shall be designed to ensure a proper functioning of the entire chain of
parameters including the equipment, the magnetic field strength and direction, surface characteristics,
detection media and illumination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most reliable test is to use representative test pieces containing real imperfections of known type, location,
size and size-distribution. Where these are not available, fabricated test pieces with artificial imperfections, or
flux shunting indicators of the cross or shim-type may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test pieces shall be demagnetized and free from indications resulting from previous tests.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
It may be necessary to perform an overall performance test of the system sensitivity for each specific
procedure on site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.11 False indications<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>False indications which may mask relevant indications can arise for many reasons, such as undercut and
changes in magnetic permeability in, e.g., the heat affected zone. Where masking is suspected the test
surface shall be dressed or alternative test methods should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Annex A
(informative)
Variables affecting the sensitivity of magnetic particle testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 Surface conditions and preparation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The maximum test sensitivity that can be achieved by any magnetic testing method is dependent on many
variables but can be seriously affected by the surface roughness of the object and any irregularities present.
In some cases it can be necessary to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  dress undercut and surface irregularities by grinding;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  remove or reduce the weld reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surfaces covered with a thin non-magnetic paint e.g. a primer may also be tested, provided the paint surface
is unbroken and the thickness of the coating does not exceed 50 µm. Above this thickness the sensitivity of
the method decreases and may be demonstrated to be sufficiently sensitive before proceeding with the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2 Magnetizing equipment characteristics<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of alternating current gives the best sensitivity for detecting surface imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Yokes produce an adequate magnetic field in simple butt-welds but where the flux is reduced by gaps or the
path is excessive through the object, as in T-joints a reduction of sensitivity can occur.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For complex joint configurations, e.g. branch connections with an inclined angle of less than 90°, testing using
yokes might be inadequate. Prods or cable wrapping with current flow will, in these cases, prove more suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3 Magnetic field strength and permeability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The field strength required to produce an indication strong enough to be detected during magnetic particle
testing is dependent mainly, on the magnetic permeability of the object.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, magnetic permeability is high in softer magnetic materials, e.g., low alloy steels and low in harder
magnetic materials, e.g., martensitic steels. Because permeability is a function of the magnetizing current, low
permeability materials usually require application of a higher magnetization value than do softer alloys to
produce the same flux density. It is essential, therefore, to establish that flux density values are adequate
before beginning the magnetic particle testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4 Detection media<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Magnetic particle suspensions will usually give a higher sensitivity for detecting surface imperfections than dry
powders.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fluorescent magnetic detection media usually give a higher test sensitivity than colour contrast media,
because of the higher contrast between the darkened background and the fluorescent indication. The
sensitivity of the fluorescent method will, nevertheless, decrease in proportion to any increase in the
roughness of the surface to which magnetic particles adhere and can cause a disturbing background
fluorescence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the background illumination cannot be adequately lowered or where background fluorescence is
disturbing, coloured detection media in conjunction with the smoothing effect of a contrast aid will usually give
better sensitivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
