<<PARAGRAPH>>The UK participation in its preparation was entrusted to Technical Committee
WEE/17, Metal-arc welding of steel, which has the responsibility to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
aid enquirers to understand the text;
—
present to the responsible European committee any enquiries on the
interpretation, or proposals for change, and keep the UK interests
informed;
—
monitor related international and European developments and
promulgate them in the UK.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Users of BS 5135:1984 should note that the BS EN 1011 series of standards
use the concept of heat input to the weld (see BS EN 1011-1 Clause  19 )
whereas in BS 5135 arc energy is used (see BS 5135 Clause  21.2.6 ). These two
terms are not interchangeable and care should be taken when transposing data
from BS 5135 to the BS EN 1011 standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Furthermore, on publication of BS EN 1011-2, BS 5135 will be withdrawn and
superseded by BS EN 1011-1 and BS EN 1011-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard is being issued in several parts in order that it may be extended to cover the
different types of metallic materials which will be produced to all European Standards for weldable
metallic materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>! Text deleted " .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard gives general guidance for the satisfactory production and control of welding and details
some of the possible detrimental phenomena which may occur, with advice on methods by which they may
be avoided.  ! It is generally applicable to fusion welding of metallic materials and is appropriate
regardless of the type of fabrication involved, although the application standard or design specification can
have additional requirements. "  More information is contained in other parts of this standard.
Permissible design stresses in welds, methods of testing and acceptance levels are not included because
they depend on the service conditions of the fabrication. These details should be obtained from the relevant
application standard or  ! design specification " .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It has been assumed in the drafting of this standard that the execution of its provisions is entrusted to
appropriately qualified, trained and experienced personnel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>

operators involved. Jigs and manipulators shall be used, where practicable, so that the welding can be
carried out in the most suitable welding position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sequence of assembly and welding shall be such that all welds can be examined in accordance with the
relevant requirements, see Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To minimize distortion and/or residual stresses it may be necessary to pre-set joints or pre-bend parts of
the structure prior to welding and/or to specify the weld sequence to assist in the control of distortion and
shrinkage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13 Preheat and inter-pass temperature<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For measurement of temperature and further information, reference shall be made to EN ISO 13916.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>14 Tack welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When required tack welds shall be applied to retain the components in alignment during welding. The
length of the individual tack weld and the frequency of such welds should be specified in the relevant weld
procedure specification (WPS) or elsewhere. In joints welded by fully mechanized or automatic processes,
the condition for deposition of tack welds shall be included in the WPS. The tack welds shall be applied in
a balanced sequence to minimize the risk of distortion and maintain good fit-up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where a tack weld is incorporated in a welded joint, the shape of the tack weld shall be suitable for
incorporation into the finished weld and shall only be carried out by approved welders. The tack weld shall
be free from cracks and other unpermitted imperfections in the weld deposit and shall be cleaned
thoroughly before final welding. Tack welds which have cracked and other imperfections such as cold starts
and crater cracks shall be removed prior to welding. All tack welds not incorporated into the final weld shall
be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15 Temporary attachments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the assembly or erection procedure requires the use of temporary welded attachments, they shall
be such that they can be easily removed without damage to the structure. Consideration shall be given to
the location of temporary attachments. The material of attachment and consumables used shall be
compatible with the parent metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When written weld procedure specifications are required all welds for temporary attachment shall be made
in accordance with them. Care should be taken to ensure that such welding is carried out only if permitted
by the  ! design specification "  and that unintended detrimental effects are avoided, e.g. stress raisers
and/or shrinkage stresses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface of the parent metal shall be carefully ground smooth after removing the temporary
attachment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If necessary, surface inspection of the parent metal may be carried out to demonstrate that the material is
free from unpermitted imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16 Run-on and run-off plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Run-on and run-off plates, when required, shall be manufactured from a grade of metal compatible with
that used for the fabrication, and shall have a thickness and edge preparation similar to those used for the
joint. The length of the run-on and run-off plates depends on the thickness of the parent material and the
weld procedure. The run-on and run-off plates shall be of sufficient length to ensure that start/stop
imperfections are contained within them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>17 Arcing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All initial striking of the arc should be within the fusion faces or on run-on plates. Precautions shall be
taken to avoid unintentional arcing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unintentional arcing between the workpiece and the welding earth return lead or any part at earth
potential can be avoided by a firm earth connection located close to the weld joint. Good insulation of the
cable and cable joints is essential. In the event of an accidental arc, the surface of the metal shall be lightly
dressed and, if necessary, checked visually and/or by a crack detection method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18 Inter-run cleaning and treatment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where a process generates a slag protecting the weld metal, this slag shall be removed from each run of
weld metal before a further run is superimposed unless otherwise permitted by the WPS. Attention shall
also be paid to the junction between the weld metal and the fusion faces. Visible imperfections such as
cracks, cavities and other unpermitted imperfections shall be removed before the deposition of further weld
metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For welding processes using a shielding gas it may be necessary to remove adherent oxides before the
deposition of further runs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Appropriate tools shall be used for inter-run cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
