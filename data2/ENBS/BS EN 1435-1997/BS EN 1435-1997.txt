<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard specifies fundamental techniques of radiography with the object of enabling
satisfactory and repeatable results to be obtained economically. The techniques are based on generally
recognized practice and fundamental theory of the subject.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard applies to the radiographic testing of fusion welded joints in metallic materials.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It applies to the joints of plates or pipes. Besides its conventional meaning, “pipe” as used in this standard
should be understood to cover other cylindrical bodies such as tubes, penstocks, boiler drums and pressure
vessels. This standard complies with EN 444.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard does not specify acceptance levels of the indications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If lower test criteria  ! are permitted by specification " , the quality achieved may be significantly lower
than when this standard is strictly applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2 Normative references<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard incorporates by dated or undated reference, provisions from other publications.
These normative references are cited at the appropriate places in the text and the publications are listed
hereafter. For dated references, subsequent amendments to or revisions of any of these publications apply
to this European Standard only when incorporated in it by amendment or revision. For undated references

<<HEADING level=3>>4 Classification of radiographic techniques<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The radiographic techniques are divided into two classes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— class A: basic techniques;
— class B: improved techniques.
Class B techniques will be used when class A might be insufficiently sensitive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>www.bzfxw.com<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>! Better techniques compared to class B are possible and may be defined by specification of all appropriate
test parameters. "<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The choice of radiographic technique shall be  ! defined by specification. "<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If, for technical reasons, it is not possible to meet one of the conditions specified for class B, such as type of
radiation source or the source-to-object distance,  f , it may be  ! defined by specification "  that the
condition selected may be that specified for class A. The loss of sensitivity shall be compensated by an
increase of minimum density to 3,0 or by the choice of a higher contrast film system. Because of the better
sensitivity compared to class A, the test specimen may be regarded as tested within class B. This does not
apply if the special SFD reductions as described in  6.6  for test arrangements  6.1.4  and  6.1.5  are used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Protection against ionizing radiation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>WARNING NOTICE. Exposure of any part of the human body to X-rays or gamma-rays can be highly
injurious to health. Wherever X-ray equipment or radioactive sources are in use, appropriate legal
requirements must be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Local or national or international safety precautions when using ionizing radiation shall be strictly applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Surface preparation and stage of manufacture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, surface preparation is not necessary, but where surface imperfections or coatings might cause
difficulty in detecting defects, the surface shall be ground smooth or the coatings shall be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified, radiography shall be carried out after the final stage of manufacture, e.g. after
grinding or heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Location of the weld in the radiograph<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the radiograph does not show the weld, high-density markers shall be placed on either side of the
weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EN 1435:1997<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Identification of radiographs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Symbols shall be affixed to each section of the object being radiographed. The images of these symbols shall
appear in the radiograph outside the region of interest where possible and shall ensure unambiguous
identification of the section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Marking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Permanent markings on the object to be tested shall be made in order to accurately locate the position of
each radiograph.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the nature of the material and/or its service conditions do not permit permanent marking, the
location may be recorded by means of accurate sketches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6 Overlap of films<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When radiographing an area with two or more separate films, the films shall overlap sufficiently to ensure
that the complete region of interest is radiographed. This shall be verified by a high-density marker on the
surface of the object which will appear on each film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.7 Types and positions of image quality indicators (IQI)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality of image shall be verified by use of IQI in accordance with EN 462-1 or EN 462-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The IQI used shall be placed preferably on the source side of the test object at the centre of the area of
interest on the parent metal beside the weld. The IQI shall be in close contact with the surface of the object.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Its location shall be made in a section of uniform thickness characterized by a uniform optical density on
the film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>According to the IQI type used, two cases shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>www.bzfxw.com<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) When using a wire IQI, the wires shall be directed perpendicular to the weld and its location shall
ensure that at least 10 mm of the wire length will show in a section of uniform optical density, which is
normally in the parent metal adjacent to the weld. At exposures in accordance with  6.1.6  and  6.1.7 , the
IQI can be placed with the wires across to the pipe axis, and they should not be projected into the image
of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) When using a step/hole IQI, it shall be placed in such a way that the hole number required is placed
close to the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At exposures in accordance with  6.1.6  and  6.1.7 , the IQI type used can be placed either on the source or on
the film side. If the IQIs cannot be placed in accordance with the above conditions, the IQIs will be placed
on the film side and the image quality shall be determined at least once from comparison exposure with
one IQI placed at the source side and one at the film side under the same conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For double-wall exposures, when the IQI is placed on the film side, the above test is not necessary and in
this case reference should be made to the tables of correspondence given in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the IQIs are placed at the film side, the letter “F” shall be placed near the IQI and it shall be noted
in the test report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If steps have been taken to guarantee that radiographs or similar test objects and regions are produced
with identical exposure and processing techniques, and no differences in the image quality value are likely,
the image quality need not be verified for every radiograph, the extent of image quality verification being
subject to  ! specification " .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For exposures of pipes with diameter 200 mm and above with the source centrally located, at least three
IQIs should be placed equally spaced at the circumference. The film(s) showing IQI images are then
considered representative for the whole circumference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>EN 1435:1997<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8 Evaluation of image quality<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The films shall be viewed in accordance with EN 25580.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>From the testing of the image of the IQI on the radiograph, the number of the smallest wire or hole which
can be discerned is determined. The image of a wire is accepted if a continuous length of at least 10 mm is
clearly visible in a section of uniform optical density. In the case of the step/hole type IQI, if there are two
holes of the same diameter, both shall be discernible in order that the step be considered as visible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The image quality obtained shall be indicated on the test report of the radiographic test. In each case, the
type of indicator used shall be clearly stated, as shown on the IQI.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9 Minimum image quality values<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table B.1 to Table B.12 in Annex B show the minimum quality values for ferrous materials. For other
materials these requirements or corresponding requirements may be  ! defined by specification " . The
requirements shall be determined in accordance with EN 462-4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.10 Personnel qualification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Personnel performing non-destructive testing in accordance with this standard shall be qualified in
accordance with EN 473, or equivalent, to an appropriate level in the relevant industrial sector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 Recommended techniques for making radiographs<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Test arrangements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.1  General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Normally, radiographic techniques in accordance with  6.1.2 ,  6.1.3 ,  6.1.4 ,  6.1.5 ,  6.1.6 ,  6.1.7 ,  6.1.8  and  6.1.9
shall be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>www.bzfxw.com<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The elliptical technique (double wall/double image) in accordance with Figure 11 should not be used for
external diameter  D e  > 100 mm, wall thickness  t  > 8 mm and weld width  > D e /4. Two 90 °  displaced images
are sufficient if  t / D e  < 0,12. The distance between the two weld images shall be about one weld width.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When it is difficult to carry out an elliptic test at  D e   k  100 mm, the perpendicular technique in accordance
with  6.1.7  may be used (see Figure 12). In this case, three exposures 120 °  or 60 °  apart are required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For test arrangements in accordance with Figure 11, Figure 13 and Figure 14, the inclination of the beam
shall be kept as small as possible and be such as to prevent superimposition of the two images. The
source-to-object distance,  f , shall be kept as small as possible, in accordance with  6.6 . The IQI shall be
placed close to the film with a lead letter “F”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other radiographic techniques may be  ! specified, "  e.g. for reasons like geometry of the  ! test
object "  or differences in material thickness. In  6.1.9  an example of such a case is presented. Multi-film
techniques shall not be used to reduce exposure times on uniform sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
In Annex A the minimum number of radiographs necessary is given in order to obtain an acceptable radiographic coverage
of the total circumference of a butt weld in pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1  X-ray devices up to 500 kV<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To maintain a good flaw sensitivity, the X-ray tube voltage should be as low as possible. The maximum
values of tube voltage versus thickness are given in Figure 20.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For some applications where there is a thickness change across the area of object being radiographed, a
modification of technique with a slightly higher voltage may be used, but it should be noted that an
excessively high tube voltage will lead to a loss of defect detection sensitivity. For steel, the increment shall
be not more than 50 kV, for titanium not more than 40 kV, and for aluminium not more than 30 kV.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The permitted penetrated thickness ranges for gamma ray sources and X-ray equipment above 1 MeV are
given in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>! If permitted by specification " , the value for Ir 192 may further be reduced to 10 mm and for Se 75
to 5 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On thin steel specimens, gamma rays from Se 5, Ir 192 and Co 60 will not produce radiographs having as
good a defect detection sensitivity as X-rays used with appropriate technique parameters. However,
because of the advantages of gamma ray sources in handling and accessibility, Table 1 gives a range of
thicknesses for which each of these gamma ray sources may be used when the use of X-rays is difficult.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For certain applications, wider wall thickness ranges may be permitted, if sufficient image quality can be
achieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where radiographs are produced using gamma rays, the travel time to position the source shall not
exceed 10 % of the total exposure time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The beam of radiation shall be directed to the centre of the area being tested and should be perpendicular
to the object surface at that point, except when it can be demonstrated that certain imperfections are best
revealed by a different alignment of the beam. In this case, an appropriate alignment of the beam can be
permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.1  Filters and collimators<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to reduce the effect of back scattered radiation, direct radiation shall be collimated as much as
possible to the section under test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With Ir 192 and Co 60 radiation sources or in the case of edge scatter, a sheet of lead can be used as a filter
of low-energy scattered radiation between the object and the cassette. The thickness of this sheet is 0,5 mm
to 2 mm, in accordance with the penetrated thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5.2  Interception of back scattered radiation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If necessary, the film shall be shielded from back scattered radiation by an adequate thickness of lead, at
least 1 mm, or of tin, at least 1,5 mm, placed behind the film–screen combination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The presence of back scattered radiation shall be checked for each new test arrangement by a lead letter B
(with a minimum height of 10 mm and a minimum thickness of 1,5 mm) placed immediately behind each
cassette. If the image of this symbol records as a lighter image on the radiograph, it shall be rejected. If the
symbol is darker or invisible, the radiograph is acceptable and demonstrates good protection against
scattered radiation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6 Source-to-object distance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum source-to-object distance,  f min , depends on the source size  d  and on the object-to-film
distance,  b .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The distance,  f , shall, where practicable, be chosen so that the ratio of this distance to the source size,  d ,
i.e.  f/d , is not below the values given by the following equations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If the distance  b  < 1,2 t , the dimension  b  in equations (1) and (2) and Figure 21 shall be replaced by the
nominal thickness  t .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For determination of the source-to-object distance,  f min , the nomogram in Figure 21 may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The nomogram is based on equations (1) and (2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In class A, if planar imperfections have to be detected, the minimum distance  f min  shall be the same as for
class B in order to reduce the geometric unsharpness by a factor of 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In critical technical applications of crack-sensitive materials, more sensitive radiographic techniques than
class B shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using the elliptic technique described in  6.1.6  or the perpendicular technique described in  6.1.7 ,
b  shall be replaced by the external diameter,  D e , of the pipe in equations (1) and (2) and in Figure 21.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the source is outside the object and the film is on the other side (the technique described in  6.1.8  as
double-wall penetration/single image), the source-to-object distance is determined only by the wall
thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the radiation source can be placed inside the object to be radiographed (the techniques shown in  6.1.4
and  6.1.5 ) to achieve a more suitable direction of test, and when a double-wall technique (see  6.1.6 ,  6.1.7
and  6.1.8 ) is avoided, this method should be preferred. The reduction in minimum source-to-object distance
should not be greater than 20 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the source is located centrally inside the object and the film is outside (the technique shown in  6.1.4 ),
and provided that the IQI requirements are met, this percentage may be increased. However, the reduction
in minimum source-to-object distance shall not be greater than 50 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7 Maximum area for a single exposure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The number of radiographs for a complete testing of flat welds (see Figure 1 and Figure 15) and of curved
welds with the radiation source arranged off-centre (see Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4 and Figure 8 to
Figure 16) should be specified in accordance with technical requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ratio of the penetrated thickness at the outer edge of an evaluated area of uniform thickness to that at
the centre beam shall not be more than 1,1 for class B and 1,2 for class A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The densities resulting from any variation of penetrated thickness should not be lower than those indicated
in  6.8  and not higher than those allowed by the available illuminator, provided that suitable masking is
possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The size of the area to be tested includes the weld and the heat-affected zones. In general, about 10 mm of
parent metal shall be tested on each side of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A recommendation for the number of radiographs is indicated in Annex A, which gives an acceptable test
of a circumferential butt weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Recommended number of exposures which give an acceptable test of a
circumferential butt weld<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum number of exposures required is presented in Figure A.1, Figure A.2, Figure A.3 and
Figure A.4, which are valid for pipes with an outside diameter exceeding 100 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the deviation of the wall thickness of the joint to be tested when using a single exposure,  % t/t , does
not exceed 20 %, Figure A.3 and Figure A.4 are used. This technique is recommended only when the
possibility of having transverse cracks is small or when the weld is tested for such imperfections by other
non-destructive test methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When D t/t  is less than or equal to 10 %, Figure A.1 and Figure A.2 are used. In this case it is likely that
transverse cracks will also be detected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the object is examined for single transverse cracks, then the required minimum number of radiographs
will increase compared with the values in Figure A.1, Figure A.2, Figure A.3 and Figure A.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
