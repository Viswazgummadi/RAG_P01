National foreword
This British Standard has been prepared by Technical Committee WEE//1 and is the
English language version of EN ISO 13920 : 1996 Welding — General tolerances for
welded constructions — Dimensions for lengths and angles — Shape and position
published by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). It is identical with
ISO 13920 : 1996 published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
_ EN ISO 13920 was produced as the result of international discussion in which the UK
took an active part.
It has been assumed in the drafting of this British Standard that the execution of its
provisions is entrusted to appropriately qualified and experienced people.
Compliance with a British Standard does not of itself confer immunity
from legal obligations.

standard, either by publication of an identical text or by
: endorsement, at the latest by February 1997, and conflicting
national standards shall be withdrawn at the latest by
February 1997.

Tolerances for angular dimensions
The length of the shorter angle leg shall be used to determine in accordance
with table 2 which tolerances are to apply. The length of the Jeg may also be
assumed to extend to a specified reference point. In this case, the reference
point concerned shall be indicated on the drawing.

straightness, flatness and parallelism tolerances as specified in the follo-
wing table 3 apply both for the overall dimensions of a weldment, a welding assem-
bly, or a welded structure, and also for sections for which the dimensions are
indicated. |
_ Other tolerances of form and position, e.g. coaxiality and symmetry tolerances,
== have not been specified. If such tolerances are required for reasons of func-
tion, they shall be indicated on the drawings as specified in prEN ISO 1101.

table 2 (e.g. EN ISO 13920-B) or its combination with a tolerance class as spe-
cified in table 3 (e.g. EN ISO 13920-BE), shall be entered in the appropriate

‘6 Testing
6.1 General
Testing and measuring devices used shall be suitable and accurate for their intended
purpose.
- graduated steel straightedges;
tape measures; | | |
- Straightedges; )
- squares;
- vernier callipers (in accordance with IS0 1599 and Iso 63906) ;
_ > dial gauges (in accordance with ISO/DIS 463) .
Other testing and measuring devices may be used by agreement.
The results of measurement may be influenced if they are obtained under unusual
or atmospheric conditions, e.g. large constructions in strong sun-
light.
. The actual size of an angle shall be determined by applying suitable measuring
devices tangentially to the weldment, but away from the zone immediately
enced by the weld. The deviation shal] be derived from the difference between
the nominal size and the actual size. The angular deviation may be measured in
degrees and minutes, or in millimetres. |
| )
6.2 Straightness
The edge of the weldment and the straightedge shal) be aligned in such a way
that the greatest distance between the straightedge and the actual surface is at
its minimum. The distance between the edge and the straightedge shall be
measured (example see figure 6).

Flatness
The actual surface of the weldment and the measuring plane shall be aligned to
each other in such a way that the greatest distance between the measuring plane
and the actual surface is at its minimum. This may be effected, for example,
with the aid of optical devices, tubular water levels, span wires, floor plates,
surface plates, and machine beds.
The distances between the actual surface and the measuring plane shall be |
measured (example see figure 7).
