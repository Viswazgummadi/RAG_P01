<<PARAGRAPH>>This British Standard is the official English language version of
EN 1011-2:2001 including amendment A1:2003. Together with
BS EN 1011-1:1998 it supersedes BS 5135:1984 which is withdrawn.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important to that the BS EN 1011 series of standards uses the concept of
heat input to the weld where as BS 5135 used arc energy. These two terms are
not interchangeable and care should be taken when transposing data from
BS 5135 to the BS EN 1011 standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is also drawn to the fact that annex C of this standard details two
methods for predicting preheat temperatures to avoid hydrogen cracking. The
differences in origin and experience used to develop these two methods are
detailed in  C.1  and this can be used as a guide to their application.
Traditionally in the UK the method detailed in BS 5135 has been used in
conjunction with weld procedure approval in accordance with the BS EN 288
series. The method detailed in  C.2  is that given in BS 5135, in an updated form.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The UK participation in its preparation was entrusted to Technical Committee
WEE/17, Metal-arc welding of steel, which has the responsibility to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard supplements EN 1011-1. It is issued with several annexes in order that it can be
extended to cover the different types of steel which are produced to all the European steel standards for
ferritic steels (see clause 5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard gives general guidance for the satisfactory production and control of welds in ferritic steels.
Details concerning the possible detrimental phenomena which can occur are given with advice on methods
by which they can be avoided. This standard is generally applicable to all ferritic steels and is appropriate
regardless of the type of fabrication involved, although the application standard can have additional
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This European Standard gives guidance for manual, semi-mechanized, mechanized and automatic arc
welding of ferritic steels (see clause 5), excluding ferritic stainless steels, in all product forms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5
Parent metal<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard applies to ferritic steels excluding ferritic stainless steels. This includes steels referenced in
groups 1 to 7 of CR ISO 15608. When ordering steel it may be necessary to specify requirements concerning
weldability, which can involve specifying additional requirements to those given in the relevant steel
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6
Weldability factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The properties and the quality of welds are particularly influenced by the welding conditions. Thus, the
following factors should be taken into consideration:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  joint design;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  hydrogen induced cracking;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  toughness and hardness of the heat affected zone ( HAZ );<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  solidification cracking;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  lamellar tearing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The mechanical and technological properties, in particular the hardness and toughness of the heat affected
zone in a narrowly delineated area, can be influenced to a greater or lesser degree, compared with the
properties of the parent metal and depend on the welding conditions. Experience and tests indicate that not
only the properties of the narrow affected zone of lower strength and better flexibility, but also the load
distribution effect of the tougher adjacent zones should be taken into account when assessing the ductility
and safety against fracture of welded joints as this could affect the choice of steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7
Handling of welding consumables<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When special protection or other treatment during storage or immediately prior to use is recommended by
the consumable manufacturer, these consumables should be treated in accordance with the conditions
detailed by the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When drying or baking, consumables should be removed from their original containers. After removal from
the oven, the consumables should be protected from exposure to conditions conducive to moisture
absorption. In the case of welding consumables that have been specially packaged, e.g. vacuum or other
moisture resistance means, advice from the consumable manufacturer should be sought as to further steps
required for drying and baking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If controlled hydrogen levels are required, it is recommended that welders be issued with electrodes in
heated quivers or sealed containers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Drying ovens, e.g. for welding consumables, shall be provided with means of measuring the oven
temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8
Weld details<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 Butt welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Butt joints between parts of unequal cross-section should be made and subsequently shaped such that a
severe stress concentration at the junction is avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_9>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Page 7
EN 1011-2:2001<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some examples of joint preparations for use with metal arc welding with covered electrodes and gas-
shielded metal arc welding are given in EN 29692.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Partial penetration butt joints may be permitted dependant on the design specification. Consideration should
be given to the choice of weld preparation and welding consumables in order to achieve the specified throat
thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Under fatigue conditions, partial penetration joints or the use of permanent backing material may be
undesirable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Backing material may consist of another steel part of the structure when this is appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When it is not appropriate to use part of the structure as backing material, the material to be used shall be
such that detrimental effects on the structure are avoided and shall be agreed in the design specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care shall be taken when using copper as a backing material as there is a risk of copper pick-up in the weld
metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where temporary or permanent backing material is employed, the joint shall be arranged in such a way as to
ensure that complete fusion of the parts to be joined is readily achieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Wherever the fabrication sequence allows, tack welds attaching permanent backing should be positioned for
subsequent incorporation into the weld (see clause 14 of EN 1011-1:1998).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2 Fillet welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified, the edges and surfaces to be joined by fillet welding shall be in as close contact
as possible since any gap may increase the risk of cracking. Unless otherwise specified, the gap shall not
exceed 3 mm. Consideration shall be given to the need to increase the throat of the fillet weld to compensate
for a large gap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified, welding should not start/stop near corners, instead, it should be continued
around the corners.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9
Welds in holes or slots<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Due to the risk of cracking, holes or slots should not be filled with weld metal unless required by the design
specification. Holes or slots that are required to be filled with weld metal shall only be filled after the first run
has been found to be acceptable (see also B.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10 Preparation of joint face<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any large notches or any other errors in joint geometry which might occur shall be corrected by applying a
weld deposit according to an approved welding procedure. Subsequently, they shall be ground smooth and
flush with the adjacent surface to produce an acceptable finish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Prefabrication primers (shop primers) may be left on the joint faces provided that it is demonstrated they do
not adversely affect the welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2 Fusion faces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When shearing is used, the effect of work hardening should be taken into account and precautions shall be
taken to ensure that there is no cracking of the edges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Page 8
EN 1011-2:2001<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Single-U and double-U and single-J weld preparations usually have to be machined. In assessing the
methods of preparation and type of joint, the requirements of the chosen welding process should be taken
into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3 Un-welded faces<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where a cut edge is not a fusion face, the effect of embrittlement from shearing, thermal cutting or gouging
shall not be such as to adversely affect the workpiece.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Local hardening can be reduced by suitable thermal treatment or removed by mechanical treatment. The
removal of 1 mm to 2 mm from a cut face normally eliminates the hardened layer. When using thermal
cutting, local hardening can be lessened by a reduction in usual cutting speed or by preheating before
cutting. If necessary the steel supplier should be consulted for recommendations on achieving a reduction in
hardness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>U and J weld preparations as compared with V and bevel weld preparations serve to reduce distortion by
virtue of the smaller amount of weld metal required. Likewise, double preparations are better than single
preparations in that the weld metal can be deposited in alternate runs on each side of the joint. In the control
of distortion, accuracy of preparation and fit-up of parts are important considerations, as well as a carefully
planned and controlled welding procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11 Alignment of butt welds before welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless specified otherwise (e.g. in a welding procedure specification or an application standard), the root
edges or root faces of butt joints shall not be out of alignment by more than 25 % of the thickness of the
thinner material for material up to and including 12 mm thick, or by more than 3 mm for material thicker than
12 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For certain applications and welding processes, closer tolerances may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For the purposes of Directive 97/23/EC, an application standard means a relevant product standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>12 Preheating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The points of temperature measurement shall be in accordance with EN ISO 13916 except that for all
thicknesses the distance for measurement shall be at least 75 mm from the weld centre-line.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Particular attention should be paid to the need for preheating when making low heat input welds, e.g. tack
welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13 Tack welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recommended that the minimum length of a tack weld should be 50 mm, but for material thicknesses
less than 12 mm the minimum length of a tack weld shall be four times the thicker part. For materials of
thickness greater than 50 mm or of yield strength over 500 N/mm 2  consideration should be given to
increasing the length and size of tack welds, which may involve the use of a two run technique.
Consideration should also be given to the use of lower strength and/or higher ductility consumables when
welding higher alloy steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>14 Temporary attachments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a thermal process is used to remove a temporary attachment or run on/off pieces after welding, sufficient
attachment or run on/off piece shall be left to allow subsequent removal of the heat affected material by
careful grinding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_11>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Page 9
EN 1011-2:2001<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>15 Heat input<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Heat input is calculated from the weld travel speed (see clause 19 of EN 1011-1:1998). When weaving with
manual metal arc welding, the weave width should be restricted to three times the diameter of the core rod.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For multi-wire arc welding, the heat input is calculated as the sum of the heat input for each individual wire
using the individual current and voltage parameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>16 Welding procedure specification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The welding procedure specification shall comply with EN 288-2 and shall include the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
whether shop or site welding;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
maximum combined thickness (see C.2.4), if annex C.2 is applied; plate thickness, if annex C.3 is
applied;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
heat input (see clause 15);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
hydrogen scale (see C.2.3 and C.3.2);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
tack welds (see clause 13).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>17 Identification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the use of hard stamp marks is required by the contract, guidance on their location and size shall be
given. Indentations used for marking in radiographic examination require equal consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>18 Inspection and testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Due to the risk of delayed cracking, a period of at least 16 h is generally required before the final inspection
is made of as-welded fabrications. The minimum time may be reduced for thin materials below 500 N/mm 2
yield strength or increased for materials of thickness greater than 50 mm or of yield strength over
500 N/mm 2 . Whatever period is used it shall be stated in the inspection records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welds that have been heat-treated to reduce the hydrogen content or which have been stress relieved, need
no additional time interval following the heat treatment before final inspection is made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tungsten inert gas welding (TIG) and other re-melting processes, if required for post weld treatment, shall be
performed before final inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Welds which are to be inspected and approved shall not be painted or otherwise treated until they have been
accepted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>19 Correction of non-conforming welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All welds which do not conform to the design specification shall be corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Fracture mechanics or other assessment techniques may be used to determine whether a non-conforming
weld needs to be corrected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The temperature of heated areas, measured by appropriate methods, should be in accordance with the
recommendations of the material supplier or the design specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>21 Post weld heat treatment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When post weld heat treatment of welds is required but no application standard exists, the heat treatment
details shall be stated in the design specification taking account of the effect on the properties of the parent
metal,  HAZ  and weld metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(informative)
Guidance on joint detail design (when there is no application standard)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex may be used where no guidance from an application standard exists. Further information is given
in other documents, e.g. EN 1708-1:1999, EN 1708-2. Particular guidance on design to avoid lamellar
tearing is given by annex F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2 Butt joints<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Butt joints between parts of unequal cross-section, arranged in line, will result in a local increase in stress in
addition to the stress concentration caused by the profile of the weld itself. If the centre planes of the two
parts joined do not coincide, local bending also will be induced at the joint. If the stresses induced by these
effects are unacceptable, then the parts should be shaped before welding by a slope of not greater than
1 in 4 so as to reduce the stresses. Examples of plain and shaped parts are shown in Figure B.1, where a)
and b) are the more common types with c) being a special configuration to facilitate non-destructive testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A partial penetration butt weld which is welded from one side only should not be subjected to a bending
moment about the longitudinal axis of a weld. It would cause the root of the weld to be in tension. Therefore
it should be avoided and only used when permitted by the design. Under such circumstances it may be
allowed by an application standard or contract.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.3 Fillet welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effective length of an open ended fillet weld should be taken as the overall length less twice the leg
length. In any case, the effective length should be not less than 25 mm or four times the leg length whichever
is the greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Avoidance of hydrogen cracking (also known as cold cracking)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex gives recommendations for the avoidance of hydrogen cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In preparing this annex, full account was taken of the fact that many methods have been proposed for
predicting preheat temperatures to avoid hydrogen cracking in non-alloyed, fine grained and low alloy steel
weldments. Examples are given in IIW documents IX-1602-90 and IX-1631-91. Two methods are included in
this annex as C.2 and C.3. Method A given in C.2 is based on extensive experience and data which is
mainly, but not exclusively, for carbon manganese type steels. Method B given in C.3 is based on experience
and data which is mainly, but not exclusively, for low alloy high strength steels. The differences in origin and
experience used to develop these two methods can be used as a guide as to their application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method described under C.4 shall be used for creep resisting and low temperature steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The recommendations apply only to normal fabrication restraint conditions. Higher restraint situations may
need higher preheat temperature or other precautions to prevent hydrogen cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Clauses C.2 and C.3 refer to welding of parent metal at temperatures above 0 °C. When welding is carried
out below this temperature it is possible that special requirements will be needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternative procedures to those derived from this annex may be used, for example lower preheat
temperatures, provided they are supported by evidence of their effectiveness. The evidence should include
all the factors also considered for the welding procedures as given in this annex.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The determination of safe, but economic, preheating levels for the prevention of hydrogen cracking is
critically dependent on an accurate knowledge of parent metal composition and carbon equivalent,  CE , and
on the weld metal composition (see C.2.9).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Clause C.2  is applicable to steels with a carbon equivalent  ( CE )  in the range 0,30 to 0,70.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If, of the elements in this formula, only carbon and manganese are stated on the mill sheet for carbon and
carbon manganese steels, then 0,03 should be added to the calculated value to allow for residual elements.
Where steels of different carbon equivalent or grade are being joined, the higher carbon equivalent value
should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This carbon equivalent formula may not be suitable for boron-containing steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.2 Factors affecting cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The occurrence of hydrogen cracking depends on a number of factors: composition of the steel, the welding
procedure, welding consumables and the stress involved. If the  t 8/5  time (cooling time from 800 °C to 500 °C)
associated with welding is too short, excessive hardening can occur in the heat affected zone. When the
hydrogen in the weld is above a critical level the hardened zone can crack spontaneously under the
influence of residual stress after the weld has cooled to near ambient temperature. Welding conditions may
be selected to avoid cracking by ensuring that the heat affected zone cools sufficiently slowly, by control of
weld run dimensions in relation to metal thickness, and if necessary, by applying preheat and controlling
interpass temperature. Procedures for avoiding hydrogen cracking, as well as selecting cooling times
through the transformation temperature range to avoid hardened and susceptible microstructures, may
involve controlling cooling in the lower temperature part of the thermal cycle, typically from 300 °C to 100 °C,
thereby beneficially influencing the evolution of hydrogen from the welded joint. In particular, this can be
achieved by the application of a post-heat on completion of welding which is typically a maintenance of the
preheat temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hydrogen content of the weld can be controlled by using hydrogen controlled welding processes and
consumables, and also to some extent, by the application of post-heat as described previously.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Similar considerations apply to hydrogen cracking in the weld metal, where although hardening will be on a
reduced scale, actual hydrogen and stress levels are likely to be higher than in the heat affected zone. In
general, welding procedures selected to avoid heat affected zone hydrogen cracking will also avoid cracking
in the weld metal. However, under some conditions such as high restraint, low  CE  steels, thick sections, or
alloyed weld metal, weld metal hydrogen cracking can become the dominant mechanism.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The most effective assurance of avoiding hydrogen cracking is to reduce the hydrogen input to the weld
metal from the welding consumables. The benefits resulting from a growing number of possibilities where no
preheat temperature > 20 °C is required, can (as shown by examples in Table C.1) be increased by using
filler materials with lower hydrogen content.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Welding conditions for avoiding hydrogen cracking in carbon manganese steels have been drawn up in
graphical form in Figure C.2 for the normal range of compositions, expressed as carbon equivalent, covered
by this standard and these conditions should be followed for all types of joint whenever practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The conditions have been drawn up to take account of differences in behaviour between different steels of

ladle and product analysis. They are valid for the avoidance of both heat affected zone and weld metal

<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.3.3
Selection of hydrogen scales<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following gives general guidance on the selection of the appropriate hydrogen scale for various welding
processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Manual metal arc basic covered electrodes can be used with scales B to D depending on the electrode
manufacturer’s classification of the consumable. Manual metal arc rutile or cellulosic electrodes should be
used with scale A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Flux-cored or metal-cored consumables can be used with scales B to D depending on the manufacturer’s
classification of the wire. Submerged-arc wire and flux consumable combinations can have hydrogen levels
corresponding to scales B to D, although most typically these will be scale C but therefore need assessing in
the case of each named product combination and condition. Submerged-arc fluxes can be classified by the
manufacturer but this does not necessarily confirm that a practical flux/wire combination also meets the
same classification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Solid wires for gas-shielded arc welding and for TIG welding may be used with scale D unless specifically
assessed and shown to meet scale E. Scale E may also be found to be appropriate for some cored wires
and some manual metal arc basic covered electrodes, but only after specific assessment. On achieving
these low levels of hydrogen, consideration should be given to the contribution of hydrogen from the
shielding gas composition and atmospheric humidity from welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For plasma arc welding, specific assessment should be made.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.4 Combined thickness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Combined thickness should be determined as the sum of the parent metal thicknesses averaged over a
distance of 75 mm from the weld line (see Figure C.1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Combined thickness is used to assess the heat sink of a joint for the purpose of determining the cooling rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the thickness increases greatly just beyond 75 mm from the weld line, it may be necessary to use a higher
combined thickness value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the same metal thickness, the preheating temperature is higher in a fillet weld than in a butt weld
because the combined thickness, and therefore the heat sink, is greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

line immediately above or to the left of the co-ordinated point for heat input and combined thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.6 Interpass temperature<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum recommended interpass temperature is frequently used as the preheat temperature for
multi-run welds. However, multi-run welds may have a lower permitted interpass temperature than the
preheat temperature where subsequent runs are of higher heat input than the root run. In these cases the
interpass temperature should be determined from Figure C.2 a) to m) for the larger run. Recommendations
relating to maximum interpass temperature for creep resisting and low temperature steels are given in
Table C.5 and Table C.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.7 Heat input<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.8 Hydrogen reduction by post-heating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When there is a higher risk of cold cracking, hydrogen release should be accelerated by either maintaining
the minimum interpass temperature or raising the temperature to 200 °C to 300 °C immediately after welding
and before the weld region cools to below the minimum interpass temperature. The duration of post-heating
should be at least 2 h and is a function of the thickness. Large thicknesses require temperatures at the upper
end of the stated range as well as prolonged post-heating times.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Post-heating is also appropriate where a partially filled weld cross-section is to be cooled.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.9 Conditions which may require more stringent procedures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preheating conditions presented in Figure C.2 have been found from experience to provide a
satisfactory basis for deriving safe welding procedures for many welded fabrications. However, the risk of
hydrogen cracking is influenced by several parameters and these can sometimes exert an adverse influence
greater than accounted for in Figure C.2 a) to m). The following paragraphs cover some factors which can
increase the risk of cracking above that envisaged in drawing up the data in Figure C.2. Precise
quantification of the effects of these factors on the need for a more stringent procedure and on the change to
the welding procedure required to avoid cracking cannot be made at the present time. The following factors
should therefore be considered for guidance only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Joint restraint is a complex function of section thickness, weld preparation, joint geometry, and the stiffness
of the fabrication. Welds made in section thicknesses above approximately 50 mm and root runs in double
bevel butt joints may require more stringent procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certain welding procedures may not be adequate for avoiding weld metal hydrogen cracking when welding
steels of low carbon equivalent. This is more likely to be the case when welding thick sections (i.e. greater
than about 50 mm) and with higher heat inputs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of higher strength alloyed weld metal or carbon manganese weld metal with a manganese content
above approximately 1,5 % can lead to higher operative stresses. Whether or not this causes an increased
risk of heat affected zone cracking, the weld deposit would generally be harder and more susceptible to
cracking itself.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Experience and research has indicated that lowering the inclusion content of the steel, principally by lowering
the sulphur content (but also the oxygen content) can increase the hardenability of the steel. From a practical
point of view this effect can result in an increase in the hardness of the heat affected zone and possibly a
small increase in the risk of heat affected zone hydrogen cracking. Accurate quantification of the effect is
presently not practicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although modifications to the procedures to deal with welds involving the above factors can, in principle, be
obtained through a change in heat input, preheating or other influencing factors, the most effective
modification is to lower the weld hydrogen level. This can be done either directly, by lowering the weld
hydrogen input to the weld (use of lower hydrogen welding processes or consumables), or by increasing
hydrogen loss from the weld by diffusion through the use of higher post-heat for a period of time after
welding. The required post-heat time will depend on many factors, but a period of 2 h to 3 h has been found
to be beneficial in many instances. It is recommended that the required modifications to the procedures be
derived by the use of adequate joint simulation weld testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.10 Relaxations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Relaxations of the welding procedures may be permissible under the following conditions:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
General preheating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the whole component or a width more than twice that stated in clause 12 is preheated, it is generally

Limited heat sink.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the heat sink is limited in one or more directions (e.g. when the shortest heat path is less than 10
times the fillet leg length) especially in the thicker plate (e.g. in the case of a lap joint where the outstand
is only marginally greater than the fillet weld leg length), it is possible to reduce preheating levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Austenitic consumables.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In some circumstances where sufficient preheating to ensure crack-free welds is impracticable, an
advantage can be gained by using certain austenitic or high nickel alloy consumables. In such cases
preheat is not always necessary, especially if the condition of the consumable is such as to deposit weld
metal containing very low levels of hydrogen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Joint fit up.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Close fit fillet welds (where the gap is 0,5 mm or less) may justify relaxations in the welding procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.11 Simplified conditions for manual metal arc welding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where single run minimum leg length fillet welds are specified in the design, Table C.3 can be used to
determine the approximate heat input values for use in determining preheat temperatures from Figure C.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These values are appropriate for practical situations when a manufacturer is required to make single run fillet
welds of specified dimensions related to the minimum leg length of the fillet welds. In practice, one leg will be
longer than the minimum, as for example in a horizontal-vertical fillet weld and the data is therefore not
appropriate for direct conversion to welds of specified throat dimension.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In other cases heat input should be controlled by control of electrode run out length (see Table C.4) or
directly through welding parameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.2.12 Examples of use of C.2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 1: Decide which carbon equivalent value is to be used either by reference to the mill certificates or the
maximum carbon equivalent in the steel standard. A steel with a carbon equivalent of 0,45 will be
assumed for this example.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 2: Decide provisionally which welding process and consumables are to be used. Classify the
consumables using the hydrogen scale A, B, C, D or E according to C.2.3 and Table C.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assume that manual metal arc welding is to be used and that the weld hydrogen level corresponds
to scale B in Table C.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 3: Determine whether the joint is to be fillet or butt welded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assume that butt-welding is to be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 4: From Figure C.2, select the appropriate graph for hydrogen scale B and a carbon equivalent of
0,45, i.e. Figure C.2 e). When a graph for the selected hydrogen scale and carbon equivalent is not
available use the graph appropriate to the next highest carbon equivalent value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 5: Determine the minimum run dimension to be used in making the butt weld. This will most often be
the root run.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assume that this will be deposited with a 4 mm electrode with 120 % efficiency to be run out in
about 260 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Refer to Table C.4.3 which gives the minimum heat input for individual runs forming the butt weld of
at least 1,2 kJ/mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 6: Determine the combined thickness of the butt joint, referring to C.2.4. Assume that the calculated
combined thickness is 50 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 7: Using Figure C.2 e) plot the co-ordinates of 1,2 kJ/mm heat input and 50 mm combined thickness.
Read off the minimum preheating and interpass temperature required, which in this example is
75 °C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Variation at step 7. In the event that preheat is undesirable, proceed as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 8: Re-examine Figure C.2 e) to determine the minimum heat input for no preheat (20 °C line,
normally).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the butt-weld example this is 1,4 kJ/mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 9: If by reference to Table C.4.3 and consideration of the welding position this heat input is feasible,
proceed using the electrode diameter and run length chosen from Table C.4.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If this is not feasible, proceed to step 10.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Step 10: Using Figures C.2 a) and C.2 d) examine the feasibility of using lower hydrogen levels (by the use
of higher electrode drying temperatures or change of consumables or change of welding process)
to avoid the need for preheat at the acceptable heat input levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.3 Method B for the avoidance of hydrogen cracking in non-alloyed, fine grained
and low alloy steels<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.3.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method covers the arc welding of steels of the groups 1 to 4 as specified in CR ISO 15608. The
recommendations given in this annex should be considered in the relevant WPS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A very effective means to avoid cold cracking is preheating of the weld to higher temperatures to delay the
cooling of the weld region and thereby promote hydrogen effusion in a shorter time to a higher extent after
welding than without preheating. Preheating furthermore reduces the state of internal stresses. For multilayer
welds it is possible to start without preheating if a sufficiently high interpass temperature can be reached and
maintained by a suitable welding sequence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basis of this recommendation is extensive examinations of cold cracking behaviour of steels in welding,
performed on the weld itself or using special cold cracking tests. Fillet welds have also been examined. It
was found out that single layer fillet welds have a lower internal stress than butt welds. The preheat
temperatures determined for butt welds therefore can be about 60 °C too high for fillet welds. Depending on
his experience, it is up to the manufacturer to make use of this advantage. In terms of determining the
preheat temperatures for fillet and butt welds with different plate thicknesses, the preheat temperature shall
be calculated on the basis of the thicker plate. Multi-layer fillet welds and butt welds have similar stress
conditions. Therefore, the same preheat temperature as for butt welds shall be used to avoid cold cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The lowest temperature before starting the first run and below which the weld region shall not fall during
welding, in the interest of avoiding cold cracking, is designated the preheat temperature  T p . In case of
multipass welding, the term also used for this temperature in reference to the second and all ensuing runs is
the minimum interpass temperature  T i . Both temperatures are generally identical. For reasons of simplicity,
therefore, only the term “preheat temperature” is used in the following.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.3.2 Factors influencing the cold cracking behaviour of welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cold cracking behaviour of welded joints is influenced by the chemical composition of the parent metal
and weld metal, the plate thickness, the hydrogen content of weld metal, the heat input during the welding,
and the stress level. An increase of alloy content, plate thickness and hydrogen content increases the risk of
cold cracking. An increase of heat input, in contrast, reduces it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.3.2.1
Base material<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The influence of the chemical composition on the cold cracking behaviour of steels is charactarized by
means of carbon equivalents  ( CET ) . This formula provides information on the effect on the individual alloying
elements on these properties in relation to that of the carbon.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

carbon equivalent,  CET , leads to an increase of around 7,5 °C in the preheat temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>At present, the relationship between the internal stress level and the preheat temperature is known only to a
certain qualitative extent. An increase of the internal stresses and of the tri-axiality of the stress state results
in an increase of the preheat temperature. In deriving equation C.8 for calculating the preheat temperature, it
has been assumed that the internal stresses present in the weld region are equal to the yield strength of the
parent material and the weld metal respectively.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>According to experience, the preheat temperatures calculated with the aid of equation C.7 or C.8,
respectively, apply, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The carbon equivalent,  CET , of the parent metal exceeds that of the weld metal by at least 0,03 %.
Otherwise, the calculation of the preheat temperature has to be based on the  CET  of the weld metal
increased by 0,03 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Single-pass fillet, tack and root welds have a minimum length of 50 mm. If the plate thickness exceeds
25 mm, tack and root passes are deposited in two layers using a mild ductile weld metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In the case of filler pass welding, which also includes multipass fillet welds, no interpass cooling takes
place as long as the weld thickness has not yet attained one third of the plate thickness. Otherwise, it is
necessary to reduce the hydrogen content by means of a post-heating treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The welding sequence shall be selected in such a way that the strong plastic deformations of the only
partly filled welds are avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.3.4 Graphical determination of preheat temperatures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The relationship between preheat temperature,  T p ,   and plate thickness,  d , for selected combinations of the
carbon equivalent,  CET , and the heat input,  Q , can be seen in Figure C.7 based on equation C.8. The curves
displayed in the individual diagrams apply in each case to different hydrogen concentrations of the weld
metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the preheat temperature is to be determined for a certain steel or a weld metal, characterized by its carbon
equivalent,  CET , then the diagram with the nearest possible  CET  and heat input has to be selected. The
preheat temperature is obtained from this diagram for the plate thickness and hydrogen content in question.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the carbon equivalent and the heat input in the diagram do not agree with the actual values, the inferred
preheat temperature shall be corrected. A correction of 7,5 °C has to be made for every 0,01 % difference in
the  CET.  The correction regarding the heat input can be obtained from Figure C.6.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.3.5 Reduction of the hydrogen content by means of post-heating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When there is an increased risk of cold cracking, e.g. when steels with a yield strength of more than
460 N/mm 2  and in thicknesses greater than 30 mm are submerged-arc welded, it is advisable to reduce the
hydrogen content by means of soaking, e.g. 2 h/250 °C, immediately after the welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.3.6 Welding without preheating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If multipass welding is performed, preheating may be avoided by maintaining an adequately high interpass
temperature,  T i , through the use of a suitable welding sequence. The possibility of avoiding the use of
preheat by maintaining a high interpass temperature depends not only on the restraint conditions of
fabrication but also on the chemical composition of the steel to be welded, i.e. on the  CET  and the preheat
temperature. It should also be noticed that the evaluation of the elements compared to carbon is remarkably
different between the  CE  and  CET . Therefore it is not advisable to convert  CET  values into  CE  values or vice
versa.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure C.8 provides information about the plate thickness up to which it is possible, depending on the alloy
content of the steel and hydrogen content of the weld metal, normally to avoid preheating by maintaining an
interpass temperature of 50 °C or 100 °C by an appropriate weld sequence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where adequate preheating is impracticable, it is advisable to use austenitic or Ni-based
consumables. It is then possible to avoid the use of preheating because of the comparatively low internal
stress level of the welded joints and the better solubility of the hydrogen in austenitic weld metal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.4 Avoidance of hydrogen cracking for creep resisting and low temperature steels<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.4.1  Parent metal<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The parent metals covered by this annex are certain creep resisting and low temperature steels, in
groups 4, 5, 6 and 7 in CR ISO 15608.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.4.2  Preheating and interpass temperatures<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The limits for preheating and interpass temperatures, which are applicable for plates, strips, pipes and
forgings, are given in Table C.5 for creep resisting steels and in Table C.6 for low temperature steels.
Alterations might be necessary with respect to special requirements, experience or applications (e.g. fillet
welds, partially filled welds, nozzle weldments or site weldments). Welding procedure approval tests should
be carried out even if there is no requirement in the design specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>C.4.3  Choice of preheating and interpass temperature<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum preheating and interpass temperature is dependent on:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  chemical composition of parent metal and weld metal;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  thickness of the weldment and type of joint;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  welding process and parameters;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  weld hydrogen scale.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The maximum interpass temperature should be as given in Tables C.5 or C.6 as appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preheating and interpass temperatures of Tables C.5 and C.6 are valid for butt welds. Fillet welds due to
their increased heat sink or partially filled welds sometimes require higher minimum temperatures. Site
welding can require additional precautions. In order to avoid hydrogen cracking it is advisable:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  to hold the minimum temperature given in Tables C.5 or C.6 during the whole welding process;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  to cool down slowly;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  to perform a soaking treatment especially in cases where partially filled welds have to be cooled down;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  to consider whether to perform the post weld heat treatment immediately after welding (not in the case
of the 12 % Cr-steel).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(informative)
Heat affected zone toughness and hardness<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex describes the influence of welding conditions on the temperature/time cycles occurring during
welding and on the mechanical properties in the  HAZ .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.2 Fundamental behaviour of ferritic steels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The welding of ferritic steels produces a zone in which the original microstructure is changed by the heat
producing the weld. Depending on the microstructure, the toughness and hardness will also be changed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The change of the microstructure in the  HAZ  depends mainly on the chemical composition of the parent
metal and on the temperature/time cycles which occur during welding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.3 Influence of the steel type<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The relationship between the  HAZ  microstructure and toughness is considered to be as follows: the
toughness decreases with an increase of the grain size and an increase of the fraction of hard martensitic
and bainitic microstructure constituents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of C and C-Mn steels, which do not contain any element that limits the austenite grain growth
during welding, frequently only strict control of the cooling time is necessary to ensure adequate toughness
in the  HAZ .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For micro-alloyed C-Mn steels, a carefully selected combination of elements that are able to form carbide
and nitride precipitates, which are stable at elevated temperature, makes it possible to limit the austenite
grain growth and to promote an intragranular ferrite nucleation during the transformation of the austenite.
The control of the austenite grain growth depends on the type and amount of carbide and nitride forming
elements. Such steels are therefore less sensitive to deterioration of toughness in the  HAZ .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Low alloy ferritic steels, for example quenched and tempered, creep resisting and low temperature steels, as
well as Ni alloyed steels, will react according to their chemical composition, but no common behaviour can
be expected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.4 Influence of the welding conditions on the mechanical properties<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The temperature/time cycles during welding have a significant effect on the mechanical properties of a
welded joint. These are particularly influenced by the material thickness, the form of weld, the heat input
during welding (see EN 1011-1:1998) and the preheating temperature. Generally, the cooling time,  t 8/5 , is
chosen to characterize the temperature/time cycle of an individual weld run during welding and is the time
taken, during cooling, for a weld run and its heat affected zone to pass through the temperature range from
800 °C to 500 °C (see D.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Increasing values of cooling time,  t 8/5 , generally lead to a reduction of the impact energy and a rise in the
impact transition temperature of the  HAZ  (see Figure D.1). The extent of deterioration of the toughness
depends on the steel type and its chemical composition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hardness in the  HAZ  decreases with an increasing cooling time,  t 8/5 , (see Figure D.2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_45>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Page 43
EN 1011-2:2001<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.5 Cooling time concept<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the impact energy in the  HAZ  for a particular steel is not to fall below a prescribed minimum value, then the
welding conditions have to be selected in such a way that the cooling time,  t 8/5 , is not exceeded. If a
prescribed minimum hardness in the  HAZ  for a particular steel is not to be exceeded, then the welding
conditions have to be selected in such a way that the cooling time,  t 8/5 , does not fall below a certain value.
For this approach, the curves for impact energy, impact transition temperature and hardness as a function of
the  t 8/5  should be known for the relevant steel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For high strength unalloyed and low alloy ferritic steels, the appropriate cooling times,  t 8/5 , of the filler and
capping passes generally lie within the range 10 s to 25 s. There is nothing to prevent welds being made in
these steels with other cooling times,  t 8/5 , provided that for each individual case appropriate checks have
been made on the basis of a welding procedure test according to EN 288-3:1997 or pre-production tests
according to EN 288-8:1995 and provided that the structural requirements for the component are satisfied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If no curves for the relationship of impact energy, impact transition temperature and hardness as a function
of  t 8/5  are available, welding procedure tests in accordance with EN 288-3:1997 or EN 288-8:1995 are
recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.6 Calculation of cooling time<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The relationship between the welding conditions and the cooling time can be described by equations, but a
differentiation shall be made between two- and three-dimensional heat flow (see Figures D.3 and D.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure D.4 is a diagram which provides information regarding the relationship between the transition
thickness,  d t , heat input,  Q , and preheat temperature,  T p , for any type of weld and any welding process. This
diagram indicates whether the heat flow is two- or three-dimensional for a particular combination of material
thickness, heat input and preheat temperature.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the heat flow is three-dimensional and the cooling time is independent of the material thickness it is
calculated using equation D.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>D.7 Diagrams for determining the cooling time  t 8/5<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cooling time  t 8/5  for a prescribed heat input,  Q , or the heat input for a prescribed cooling time can also be
determined on the basis of Figures D.5 and D.6, having first established the type of heat flow using
Figure D.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For three-dimensional heat flow, the relationship between the cooling time,  t 8/5 , the heat input,  Q , and the
preheat temperature,  T p , is given, in the case of runs on a plate, in Figure D.5 of which equation D.1 forms
the basis. If this diagram is applied to other types of welds, consideration should be given to the
corresponding shape factor,  F 3.  If the cooling time is to be determined for a particular combination of heat
input and preheat temperature then the heat input should first be multiplied by  F 3 . If, however, the heat input
is conversely taken from the diagram for a prescribed cooling time and preheat temperature, then it should
be divided by  F 3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Information regarding the relationship between the cooling time and  Qt 0  at two-dimensional heat flow is given
for different material thicknesses in Figure D.6 of which equation D.2 forms the basis. If these diagrams are
to be applied to other types of weld, consideration should be given to the corresponding shape factor,  F 2 . For
example, if the cooling time is to be determined for a particular combination of heat input and preheat
temperature, then the heat input should first be multiplied by ( F 2 ) 1/2 . If, however, the heat input is conversely
taken from the diagram for a prescribed cooling time and preheat temperature, then it should be divided by
( F 2 ) 1/2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If in the case of two-dimensional heat flow, the plate thickness in question does not correspond exactly with
those shown in Figure D.6, the diagram closest to the actual plate thickness is used. The cooling time is then
corrected in accordance with the plate thickness ratio. To do this the cooling time taken from the diagram is
multiplied by the square of the plate thickness taken from the diagram and divided by the square of the plate
thickness in question.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>D.8 Measurement of cooling time<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To measure the cooling time of a weld, a thermocouple is normally immersed in the weld metal while it is still
molten and the temperature/time cycle is recorded. From the  T / t  curve the cooling time is derived.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Avoidance of solidification cracking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Solidification cracking of the weld metal is usually found as centreline cracking. It is more often found in root
runs and, although frequently open at the surface and visible after deslagging, can be just below the surface
and covered by up to 0,5 mm of sound metal. Solidification cracks can be deep and can seriously reduce the
efficiency of a joint. When welding carbon manganese steels, this type of cracking is most commonly found
in submerged-arc welds, rarely with manual metal arc welding but it can sometimes be a problem with
gas-shielded and self-shielded processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Solidification cracking is associated with impurities, particularly sulphur and phosphorus, and is promoted by
carbon picked up from the parent metal at high dilution levels while manganese reduces the risk of cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Impurity levels and crack susceptibilities are usually greatest in weld runs of high dilution, e.g. root runs of
butt welds. To minimize the risk of cracking, consumables are preferred with low carbon and impurity levels
and relatively high manganese contents. A reduction in welding speed can be helpful in overcoming
cracking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The solidification crack susceptibility of weld metal is affected by both its composition and weld run geometry
(depth/width ratio). The chemical composition of weld metal is determined by the composition of the filler
material and the parent metal and the degree of dilution. The degree of dilution, as well as weld run
geometry, both depend on the joint geometry (angle of bevel, root face and gap) and the welding parameters
(current and voltage).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For submerged-arc welds a formula has been developed for carbon and carbon manganese steels in which
the solidification crack susceptibility in arbitrary units known as units of crack susceptibility ( UCS ) has been
related to the composition of the weld metal [in % (m/m)]. Although developed for submerged-arc welding,
the use of the formula can be helpful in assessing the risk of solidification cracking for other welding
processes and other ferritic steels. The formula is as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>UCS  = 230 C + 190 S + 75 P + 45 Nb  −  12,3 Si  −  5,4 Mn  −  1<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This formula is valid for the weld metal compositions given in Table E.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alloying elements and impurities in the weld metal up to the limits given in Table E.2 do not exert a marked
effect on values of  UCS .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Values of less than 10  UCS  indicate a high resistance to cracking and above 30 a low resistance. Within
these approximate limits the risk of cracking is higher in weld runs with a high depth/width ratio, made at high
welding speeds or where fit-up is near the maximum allowable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(informative)
Avoidance of lamellar tearing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.1  General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In certain types of joint, where the welding contraction strains act in the through-thickness (transverse)
direction of a plate, lamellar tearing may occur. Lamellar tearing is a parent metal phenomenon which occurs
mainly in plate material. The risk of cracking is influenced by two factors: plate susceptibility and strain
across the joint. With very susceptible plate material, tearing can occur even if strains are low, i.e. in a joint of
low restraint. More resistant materials might not tear unless used in situations which impose very high
through-thickness strains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Lamellar tearing occurs mainly during production and not during service. In the latter case periodic loads or
impact loads are the main reasons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.2  Plate susceptibility<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since lamellar tearing occurs when the non-metallic inclusions in a plate link up under the influence of
welding strains, plate susceptibility is controlled by the quantity and distribution of the inclusions. At present
there is no reliable non-destructive technique for detecting these inclusions. The short transverse tensile test
can be used to assess susceptibility (see EN 10164) and the short transverse reduction of area (STRA) has
been correlated with the incidence of lamellar tearing in different types of fabrication (see Figure F.1). In the
case of low oxygen steels (aluminium treated or vacuum degassed types) sulphur content has been found to
be a useful guide to the inclusion content and thus to the STRA. Figure F.2 gives the likely lowest and
highest values of STRA to be expected in aluminium treated steel of a given sulphur content. The data is for
plates 12,5 mm to 50 mm thick but it should be noted that the relationship of STRA (in %) to sulphur content
(in %) is to some extent thickness dependent.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Steel giving STRA values of over 20 % are considered lamellar tearing resistant and materials with
guaranteed STRA values are available (see EN 10164). These are usually aluminium treated steels with low
sulphur content, although additions of rare earth or calcium compounds can also be made both to reduce the
inclusion content and to alter favourably the inclusion shapes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>F.3  Joint configuration, fabrication and through-thickness strains<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The risk of lamellar tearing for a given steel increases with through-thickness strain which is usually high in
joints of high tensile restraint. However, tearing can also occur if the bending restraint is low since angular
distortion can increase the strain in weld root or toe areas (see Figure F.3). In some cases, design changes
can be made which reduce the through-thickness strain. Examples of the types of detail and joint
configuration in which lamellar tearing is possible are shown in Figure F.4, typical locations of the cracks
being illustrated. If the plate susceptibility is considered to be high, susceptible joints and details should be
modified or avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following general statements should be noted:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) For a given weld strength, joints should be made such that the attachment area is enlarged (see
Figure F.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>b) The shrinkage stresses should be minimized:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  by reducing the volume of weld metal;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  by welding with the minimum number of runs;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  by using a buttering layer sequence (see Figure F.6);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  by a balanced layer sequence in symmetric welds.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) The weldment should be made such that as much of the through-thickness of the rolled plate as possible
is in contact with the weld metal (see Figures F.7 to F.9).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) The weldment should be made such that restraint in the through-thickness direction is minimized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) The weldment can be made less sensitive to lamellar tearing by buttering with a low strength material
(see Figure F.9).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
