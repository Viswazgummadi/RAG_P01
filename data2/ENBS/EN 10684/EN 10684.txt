<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 10684:2004(E) Foreword ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission on all matters of electrotechnica!l standardization. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Fasteners — Hot dip galvanized coatings
1 Scope
This Internationa! Standard specifies material, process, dimensional and some performance requirements for
hot dip spun galvanized coatings applied to coarse threaded steel fasteners from M8 up to and including M64
and for property classes up to and including 10.9 for bolts, screws and studs and 12 for nuts. It is not
recommended to hot dip galvanize threaded fasteners in diameters smaller than M8 and/or with pitches below
1,25 mm.
NOTE Attention is drawn to the fact that the proof loads and stresses under proof load of oversize tapped nuts with
threads M8 and M10 and the ultimate tensile loads and proof loads of undersize threaded bolts and screws with threads
M8 and M10 are reduced as compared to the values specified in ISO 898-2 and ISO 898-1 respectively and are specified
in Annex A.
It primarily concerns the spun hot dip galvanizing of threaded steel fasteners, but it may also be applied to
other threaded steel parts.
The specifications given in this International Standard may also be applied to non-threaded steel parts such
as washers.

6.3. Special requirements for marking when supplying fasteners in sealed containers
lf hot dip galvanized bolts or screws and mating nuts are packed together and supplied in the manufacturer's
sealed container, the additional marking of the bolts, screws or nuts as described in 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 is not
mandatory. The label on each sealed container shall indicate the additional marking as required in 6.2.2 and
6.2.3.
marking of products or labelling of containers as described in 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 is not mandatory for
fasteners with a special marking related to a product standard which specifies the thread tolerance for hot dip
galvanized bolts, screws, studs or nuts and, therefore, does not allow the manufacturer to choose the thread
tolerance.
7 Mechanical properties of nuts tapped oversize and undersize threaded bolts,
screws and studs
. For bolts, screws, studs and nuts > M12, the requirements of ISO 898-1 and ISO 898-2 shail be met after hot
dip galvanizing. For the sizes M8 and M10, proof loads and stresses under proof loads for nuts and ultimate
tensile loads and proof loads for bolts, screws and studs are specified in Annex A.
8 Coating requirements
8.1 Appearance of zinc coating
The hot dip galvanized parts shall be free from uncoated areas, blisters, flux deposits, black spots, dross
inclusions and other defects that would impair the intended use of the parts. Dull appearance shall not
constitute grounds for rejecting parts.
8.2 Considerations for hot dip galvanized washers
Hot dip galvanized washers tend to bond to each other and suitable acceptance criteria should be agreed
upon at the time of ordering.
8.3 Zinc coating thickness
ge, The local coating thickness shall be a minimum of 40 ym and the batch average coating thickness shall be a
minimum of 50 ym. The measurement of the local coating thickness shall be made on measuring areas as
shown in Figure 3.
Measurement of the local coating thickness shall be conducted by the magnetic method in accordance with
ISO 2178 on every production lot. To calculate the local coating thickness, a minimum of five readings shall be
taken and averaged. In case the geometry does not permit five readings, five samples shall be used to
establish the readings to be averaged. In case of dispute, the gravimetric method in accordance with
ISO 1460 shall be used. For the calculation of the batch average coating thickness, the surface area of the
fastener can be evaluated according to Annex D.
8.4 Adhesion of zinc coating
The zine coating shall adhere tenaciously to the surface of the base metal. The method for testing the
adherence is specified in Annex E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Annex A
(normative)
Special requirements for bolts, screws and nuts
with thread sizes M8 and M10
A.1 General
For M8 and M10 ultimate tensile loads and proof loads lower than those specified in ISO 898-1 and ISO 898-2
are specified in this annex taking into account the relatively large fundamental deviations according to 6.2.2
and 6.2.3.
Peon For nuts tapped oversize, the reduced overlap of thread M8 and M10 significantly reduces the proof load
he values as compared with those given in ISO 898-2.
For bolts and screws with undersized threads, the stress areas for M8 and M10 are significantly smaller than
the stress areas given in ISO 898-1.
A.2 Minimum proof loads for hexagon nuts tapped oversize to tolerance class 6AZ or
6AX after coating
According to 6.2.2 nuts may be tapped oversize to tolerance class 6AZ or 6AX in accordance with ISO 965-5
and Annex B. For thread sizes M8 and M10 tolerance class 6AZ gives the largest fundamental deviation.
Consequently, for thread sizes M8 and M10 the fundamental deviations for tolerance class GAZ are used to
establish the proof loads as given in Table A.1. Stresses under proof load are given in Table A.2.
All other mechanical property requirements as given in ISO 898-2 are valid.
For test methods, see ISO 898-2.

A.3 Minimum ultimate tensile loads and proof loads for bolts and screws with
threads undersized to tolerance class 6az before coating
According to 6.2.3 bolts, screws and extemal threads have to be threaded undersize to tolerance class 6az in
accordance with [SO 965-4 and Annex B. For thread sizes M8 and M10 tolerance class 6az gives large
fundamental deviations and this reduces the stress area. Consequently, for thread sizes M8 and M710, the
ultimate tensile loads and proof loads are reduced. For principles of calculation, see Annex C. The reduced
values are given in Tables A.3 and A.4.
All other mechanical property requirements as given in ISO 898-1 are valid.

Calculation of minimum ultimate tensile loads and proof loads for bolts
and screws M8 and M10 with threads undersized to tolerance class 6az
The minimum ultimate tensile loads given in Tabie A.3 and the minimum proof loads given in Table A.4 have
been calculated using the minimum tensile strength, R,,, and the stress under proof load, Sp: as specified in
ISO 898-1. These values are multiplied by the stress area, A,,,, derived from the thread diameters for M10 in
accordance with ISO 965-4 and for M8 in accordance with Annex B and the following formula:
A _ a do + d3 2
dy is the maximum pitch diameter of the thread;
d3 is the maximum minor diameter of the thread.

Surface areas of bolts, screws and nuts
D.1 General
This annex gives guidance for the evaluation of the surface areas of bolts, screws and nuts which are needed
for the determination of the batch average thickness according to 8.3.
NOTE The surface areas given in Tables D.1 and D.2 apply only if agreed upon between the parties concerned.
D.2 Bolts and screws
To obtain the total surface area of a bolt or screw, the following parameter values are necessary
(see Figure D.1):
— the surface area, A,, of a length of 1 mm of the threaded shank of the bolt or screw;
— the surface area, A», of a length of 1 mm of the unthreaded shank of the bolt or screw;
— the surface area, of the head (including surface of the end face).
The total surface areas, A, is then calculated as follows:
A=A, x thread length + 4, x shank length + 4

Annex E
(normative)
Adherence of hot-dip galvanized coating
To determine the adherence of the zinc coating to the surface of the base metal, use the point of a stout knife.
Cut or prise, with the application of considerable pressure, in a manner tending to remove a portion of the
coating.
The adherence shall be considered inadequate if the coating flakes off in the form of a layer or skin so as to
expose the base meta! in advance of the knife point.
Testing shall not be done ai edges or comers (points of lowest coating adherence) to determine adherence of
coating.
Likewise, the removal of small particles of the coating by paring or whittling shall not constitute failure and
therefore not be grounds for rejection.

Annex F
(informative)
Strength of hot dip galvanized bolt or screw and nut assemblies
Bolts, screws and nuts modified by either undersizing of the bolt or screw thread as required by ISO 965-4 or
oversize tapping of the nut thread in accordance with ISO 965-5, if manufactured to the full range of
dimensional and mechanical property tolerances, may not achieve the expected assembly strength when
combined with the specified mating component.
The reduction in assembly strength is due to the reduction in shear strength of the modified threads; refer to
the work of Alexander’) on the strength of screw threads.
The following proposals indicate methods by which the full assembly strength of a 6g/6H thread tolerance
combination may be achieved, when modified thread combinations are used.
a) Bolts and screws manufactured with thread tolerance class 6az in accordance with [SO 965-4
The bolts or screws should not be manufactured to the minimum tensile strength, R,,, specified in ISO 898-1.
Care should be taken with bolts and screws of property class 8.8 not to exceed the maximum hardness of
property class 8.8, because of the risk of hydrogen embrittlement.
b) Nuts manufactured with thread tolerance class 6AZ in accordance with ISO 965-5
To achieve fuil assembly strength with nuts tapped oversize to thread tolerance class 6AZ two options may be
considered:
1) Fit the bolts and screws with nuts of one property class higher, i.e. bolt or screw of property class 8.8
with nut of property class 10, etc.
2) Fit the bolts and screws with nuts of the same property class but of style 2 nut height instead of
style 1.
6) Nuts manufactured with thread tolerance class 6AX in accordance with ISO 965-5
~ For diameters greater than M10 in order to achieve the full assembly strength of nuts tapped oversize to
thread tolerance class GAX, nuts of an even higher property class than those used with thread tolerance
class 6AZ should be used. In some countries, where this thread tolerance class is generally used, the national
standards require the use of nuts of two property classes higher.
