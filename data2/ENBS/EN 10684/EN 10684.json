The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission on all matters of electrotechnica!l standardization. International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote. Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Standard specifies material, process, dimensional and some performance requirements for\nhot dip spun galvanized coatings applied to coarse threaded steel fasteners from M8 up to and including M64\nand for property classes up to and including 10.9 for bolts, screws and studs and 12 for nuts. It is not\nrecommended to hot dip galvanize threaded fasteners in diameters smaller than M8 and/or with pitches below\n1,25 mm.\nNOTE Attention is drawn to the fact that the proof loads and stresses under proof load of oversize tapped nuts with\nthreads M8 and M10 and the ultimate tensile loads and proof loads of undersize threaded bolts and screws with threads\nM8 and M10 are reduced as compared to the values specified in ISO 898-2 and ISO 898-1 respectively and are specified\nin Annex A.\nIt primarily concerns the spun hot dip galvanizing of threaded steel fasteners, but it may also be applied to\nother threaded steel parts.\nThe specifications given in this International Standard may also be applied to non-threaded steel parts such\nas washers.\n| 2 Normative references\nThe following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

The label on each sealed container shall indicate the additional marking as required in 6.2.2 and\n6.2.3.\nmarking of products or labelling of containers as described in 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 is not mandatory for\nfasteners with a special marking related to a product standard which specifies the thread tolerance for hot dip\ngalvanized bolts, screws, studs or nuts and, therefore, does not allow the manufacturer to choose the thread\ntolerance.\n7 Mechanical properties of nuts tapped oversize and undersize threaded bolts,\nscrews and studs\n. For bolts, screws, studs and nuts > M12, the requirements of ISO 898-1 and ISO 898-2 shail be met after hot\ndip galvanizing.

Dull appearance shall not\nconstitute grounds for rejecting parts.\n8.2 Considerations for hot dip galvanized washers\nHot dip galvanized washers tend to bond to each other and suitable acceptance criteria should be agreed\nupon at the time of ordering.\n8.3 Zinc coating thickness\nge, The local coating thickness shall be a minimum of 40 ym and the batch average coating thickness shall be a\nminimum of 50 ym. The measurement of the local coating thickness shall be made on measuring areas as\nshown in Figure 3.\nMeasurement of the local coating thickness shall be conducted by the magnetic method in accordance with\nISO 2178 on every production lot. To calculate the local coating thickness, a minimum of five readings shall be\ntaken and averaged. In case the geometry does not permit five readings, five samples shall be used to\nestablish the readings to be averaged. In case of dispute, the gravimetric method in accordance with\nISO 1460 shall be used. For the calculation of the batch average coating thickness, the surface area of the\nfastener can be evaluated according to Annex D.\n8.4 Adhesion of zinc coating\nThe zine coating shall adhere tenaciously to the surface of the base metal.

In some countries, where this thread tolerance class is generally used, the national\nstandards require the use of nuts of two property classes higher.\nan 1) E.M.
