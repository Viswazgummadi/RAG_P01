<<PARAGRAPH>>This British Standard was published by BSI. It is the official UK
implementation of OHSAS 18001:2007, which supersedes OHSAS 18001:1999.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>BS OHSAS 18001 will be maintained in line with any changes to
OHSAS 18001, subject to the approval of BSI Technical Committee HS/1,
Occupational health and safety management , which collated the UK comments
on the second Working Draft of OHSAS 18001 and put forward its preferred
position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A list of organizations represented on this committee can be obtained on
request to its secretary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Contractual and legal considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the UK, and Europe generally, there are various legal requirements for
occupational health and safety that apply to the potentially harmful effects of
work activities and which extend beyond the workplace to those affected by
workplace activities (see Note to  3.12  on the definition of occupational health
and safety). It is essential for the organization to take the matters addressed
by these legal requirements into account in establishing, implementing and
maintaining its OH&S management system – and in particular when
identifying hazards, assessing risks and determining controls (see  4.3.1
and  4.3.2 ). This standard ought therefore to be read in conjunction with
BS 8800 and HSG 65, 1)  which give good practice guidance on complying with
such legal requirements in the UK.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This publication does not purport to include all the necessary provisions of a
contract. Users are responsible for its correct application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Compliance with a British Standard cannot confer immunity from
legal obligations.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS)
Standard and the accompanying OHSAS 18002,  Guidelines for the
implementation of OHSAS 18001 , have been developed in response to
customer demand for a recognizable occupational health and safety
management system standard against which their management systems
can be assessed and certified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>OHSAS 18001 has been developed to be compatible with the
ISO 9001:2000 (Quality) and ISO 14001:2004 (Environmental)
management systems standards, in order to facilitate the integration of
quality, environmental and occupational health and safety management
systems by organizations, should they wish to do so.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This OHSAS Standard will be reviewed or amended when considered
appropriate. Reviews will be conducted when new editions of either
ISO 9001 or ISO 14001 are published, to ensure continuing
compatibility.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This OHSAS Standard will be withdrawn on publication of its contents
in, or as, an International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This OHSAS Standard has been drafted in accordance with the rules
given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
(OHSAS 18001:1999), which has been technically revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The principal changes with respect to the previous edition are as
follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
The importance of “health” has now been given greater emphasis.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
OHSAS 18001 now refers to itself as a standard, not a
specification, or document, as in the earlier edition. This reflects
the increasing adoption of OHSAS 18001 as the basis for national
standards on occupational health and safety management systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
The “Plan-Do-Check-Act” model diagram is only given in the
Introduction, in its entirety, and not also as sectional diagrams at
the start of each major clause.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
Reference publications in Clause  2  have been limited to purely
international documents.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
New definitions have been added, and existing definitions revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>•
Significant improvement in alignment with ISO 14001:2004
throughout the standard, and improved compatibility with
ISO 9001:2000.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
The term “tolerable risk” has been replaced by the term
“acceptable risk” (see  3.1 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
The term “accident” is now included in the term “incident”
(see  3.9 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
The definition of the term “hazard” no longer refers to “damage to
property or damage to the workplace environment” (see  3.6 ).<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>BS OHSAS 1 8 0 0 1:2007<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is now considered that such “damage” is not directly related to
occupational health and safety management, which is the purpose of
this OHSAS Standard, and that it is included in the field of asset
management. Instead, the risk of such “damage” having an effect on
occupational health and safety should be identified through the
organization’s risk assessment process, and be controlled through the
application of appropriate risk controls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
Sub-clauses  4.3.3  and  4.3.4  have been merged, in line with
ISO 14001:2004.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
A new requirement has been introduced for the consideration of
the hierarchy of controls as part of OH&S planning (see  4.3.1 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
Management of change is now more explicitly addressed
(see  4.3.1  and  4.4.6 ).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
A new clause on the “Evaluation of compliance” (see  4.5.2 ) has
been introduced.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
New requirements have been introduced for participation and
consultation (see  4.4.3.2 ).<<HEADING_END>>

New requirements have been introduced for the investigation of
incidents (see  4.5.3.1 ).<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organizations of all kinds are increasingly concerned with achieving
and demonstrating sound occupational health and safety (OH&S)
performance by controlling their OH&S risks, consistent with their
OH&S policy and objectives. They do so in the context of increasingly
stringent legislation, the development of economic policies and other
measures that foster good OH&S practices, and increased concern
expressed by interested parties about OH&S issues.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many organizations have undertaken OH&S “reviews” or “audits” to
assess their OH&S performance. On their own, however, these
“reviews” and “audits” may not be sufficient to provide an organization
with the assurance that its performance not only meets, but will
continue to meet, its legal and policy requirements. To be effective, they
need to be conducted within a structured management system that is
integrated within the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The OHSAS Standards covering OH&S management are intended to
provide organizations with the elements of an effective OH&S
management system that can be integrated with other management
requirements and help organizations achieve OH&S and economic
objectives. These standards, like other International Standards, are not
intended to be used to create non-tariff trade barriers or to increase or
change an organization’s legal obligations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This OHSAS Standard specifies requirements for an OH&S management
system to enable an organization to develop and implement a policy and
objectives which take into account legal requirements and information
about OH&S risks. It is intended to apply to all types and sizes of
organizations and to accommodate diverse geographical, cultural and
social conditions. The basis of the approach is shown in Figure 1. The
success of the system depends on commitment from all levels and
functions of the organization, and especially from top management. A
system of this kind enables an organization to develop an OH&S policy,
establish objectives and processes to achieve the policy commitments,
take action as needed to improve its performance and demonstrate the
conformity of the system to the requirements of this OHSAS Standard.
The overall aim of this OHSAS Standard is to support and promote good
OH&S practices, in balance with socio-economic needs. It should be
noted that many of the requirements can be addressed concurrently or
revisited at any time.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The second edition of this OHSAS Standard is focused on clarification
of the first edition, and has taken due consideration of the provisions of
ISO 9001, ISO14001, ILO-OSH, and other OH&S management system
standards or publications to enhance the compatibility of these
standards for the benefit of the user community.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>BS OHSAS 18001:2007<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is an important distinction between this OHSAS Standard, which
describes the requirements for an organization’s OH&S management
system and can be used for certification/registration and/or
self-declaration of an organization’s OH&S management system, and a
non-certifiable guideline intended to provide generic assistance to an
organization for establishing, implementing or improving an OH&S
management system. OH&S management encompasses a full range of
issues, including those with strategic and competitive implications.
Demonstration of successful implementation of this OHSAS Standard
can be used by an organization to assure interested parties that an
appropriate OH&S management system is in place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Those organizations requiring more general guidance on a broad range
of OH&S management system issues are referred to OHSAS 18002. Any
reference to other International Standards is for information only.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE   This OHSAS Standard is based on the methodology known as
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA). PDCA can be briefly described as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
Plan : establish the objectives and processes necessary to deliver
results in accordance with the organization’s OH&S policy.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
Do : implement the processes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
Check : monitor and measure processes against OH&S policy,
objectives, legal and other requirements, and report the results.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>•
Act : take actions to continually improve OH&S performance.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many organizations manage their operations via the application of a
system of processes and their interactions, which can be referred to as the
“process approach”. ISO 9001 promotes the use of the process approach.
Since PDCA can be applied to all processes, the two methodologies are
considered to be compatible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>BS OHSAS 18001:2007<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This OHSAS Standard contains requirements that can be objectively
audited; however it does not establish absolute requirements for OH&S
performance beyond the commitments, in the OH&S policy, to comply
with applicable legal requirements and with other requirements to
which the organization subscribes, to the prevention of injury and ill
health and to continual improvement. Thus, two organizations carrying
out similar operations but having different OH&S performance can both
conform to its requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This OH&S Standard does not include requirements specific to other
management systems, such as those for quality, environmental,
security, or financial management, though its elements can be aligned
or integrated with those of other management systems. It is possible for
an organization to adapt its existing management system(s) in order to
establish an OH&S management system that conforms to the
requirements of this OHSAS Standard. It is pointed out, however, that
the application of various elements of the management system might
differ depending on the intended purpose and the interested parties
involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The level of detail and complexity of the OH&S management system, the
extent of documentation and the resources devoted to it depend on a
number of factors, such as the scope of the system, the size of an
organization and the nature of its activities, products and services, and
the organizational culture. This may be the case in particular for small
and medium-sized enterprises.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS)
Standard specifies requirements for an occupational health and safety
(OH&S) management system, to enable an organization to control its
OH&S risks and improve its OH&S performance. It does not state
specific OH&S performance criteria, nor does it give detailed
specifications for the design of a management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This OHSAS Standard is applicable to any organization that wishes to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
establish an OH&S management system to eliminate or minimize
risks to personnel and other interested parties who could be
exposed to OH&S hazards associated with its activities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
implement, maintain and continually improve an OH&S
management system;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
assure itself of its conformity with its stated OH&S policy;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
demonstrate conformity with this OHSAS Standard by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
making a self-determination and self-declaration, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
seeking confirmation of its conformance by parties having an
interest in the organization, such as customers, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
seeking confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external
to the organization, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
seeking certification/registration of its OH&S management
system by an external organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All the requirements in this OHSAS Standard are intended to be
incorporated into any OH&S management system. The extent of the
application will depend on such factors as the OH&S policy of the
organization, the nature of its activities and the risks and complexity of
its operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This OHSAS Standard is intended to address occupational health and
safety, and is not intended to address other health and safety areas such
as employee wellbeing/wellness programmes, product safety, property
damage or environmental impacts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Annex B (informative)  Correspondence between
OHSAS 18001, OHSAS 18002, and
the ILO-OSH:2001  Guidelines on
occupational safety and health
management systems<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>B.1
Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex identifies the key differences between the International
Labour Organization’s ILO-OSH Guidelines and the OHSAS documents,
and provides a comparative assessment of their differing requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>It should be noted that  no areas of significant difference have been
identified .<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consequently, those organizations that have implemented an OH&S
management system that is compliant with OHSAS 18001 may be
reassured that their OH&S management system will also be compatible
with the recommendations of the ILO-OSH Guidelines.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A correspondence table between the individual clauses of the OHSAS
documents and those of the ILO-OSH Guidelines is given in  B.4 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>B.2
Overview<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The two prime objectives of the ILO-OSH Guidelines are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
to assist countries in the establishment of a national framework for
occupational health and safety management systems; and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
to provide guidance to individual organizations regarding the
integration of OH&S elements into their overall policy and
management arrangements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>OHSAS 18001 specifies requirements for OH&S management systems,
to enable organizations to control risks and to improve their OH&S
performance. OHSAS 18002 gives guidance on the implementation of
OHSAS 18001. The OHSAS documents are therefore comparable with
Section 3 of the ILO-OSH Guidelines “ The occupational safety and
health management system in the organization ”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=2>>B.3
Detailed analysis of Section 3 of the ILO-OSH
Guidelines against the OHSAS documents<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The focus of the ILO-OSH Guidelines is on workers. The focus of the
OHSAS Standards, towards persons under the control of the
organization and other interested parties, is broader.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.2
OH&S management system models<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The models picturing the main elements of an OH&S management
system are directly equivalent between the ILO-OSH Guidelines and the
OHSAS documents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.3
ILO-OSH Section 3.2, Worker participation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the ILO-OSH  Guidelines , subsection  3.2.4  recommends that:  “The
employer should ensure as appropriate, the establishment and
efficient functioning of a health and safety committee and the
recognition of workers health and safety representatives in
accordance with national laws and practice” .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>OHSAS 18001,  4.4.3 , requires the organization to establish a procedure
for communication, participation and consultation, and to involve a
wider spectrum of interested parties (due to the broader scope of
application of the document).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.4
ILO-OSH Section 3.3, Responsibility and
accountability<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The ILO-OSH  Guidelines  recommend in  3.3.1(h)  the establishment of
prevention and health promotion programmes. There is no requirement
in the OHSAS Standards for this.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.5
ILO-OSH Section 3.4, Competence and training<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The recommendation of the ILO-OSH  Guidelines  subsection  3.4.4 :
“Training should be provided to all participants at no cost and
should take place during working hours if possible” , is not a
requirement of the OHSAS documents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.6
ILO-OSH Section 3.10.4, Procurement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ILO-OSH Guidelines emphasize that safety and health requirements
of the organization should be incorporated into purchasing and leasing
specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The OHSAS Standards address procurement by their requirements for
risk assessment, identification of legal requirements and the
establishment of operational controls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.7
ILO-OSH Section 3.10.5, Contracting<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ILO-OSH Guidelines define the steps to be taken to ensure that the
organization’s safety and health requirements are applied to contractors
(they also provide a summary of the actions needed to ensure that they
are). This is implicit in OHSAS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.8
ILO-OSH Section 3.12, Investigation of work related
injuries, ill health, diseases and incidents, and their
impact on safety and health performance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>The ILO-OSH Guidelines do not require corrective actions or preventive
actions to be reviewed through the risk assessment process prior to
implementation, as they are in OHSAS 18001,  4.5.3.2 .<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.3.9
ILO-OSH Section 3.13, Audit<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ILO-OSH Guidelines recommend consultation on the selection of
auditors. In contrast, the OHSAS documents require audit personnel to
be impartial and objective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

ILO-OSH Section 3.16, Continual improvement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This is a separate subclause in the ILO-OSH Guidelines. It details
arrangements that should be taken into account for the achievement of
continual improvement. Similar arrangements are detailed throughout
the OHSAS documents, which consequently do not have a
corresponding clause.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
