<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of conformity
assessment, the ISO Committee on conformity assessment (CASCO) is responsible for the development of
International Standards and Guides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Draft International Standards are circulated to the national bodies for voting. Publication as an International
Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO/IEC 17050-1 was prepared by the ISO  Committee on conformity assessment  (CASCO).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It was circulated for voting to the national bodies of both ISO and IEC, and was approved by both
organizations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This first edition of ISO/IEC 17050-1, together with ISO/IEC 17050-2, cancels and replaces the second edition
of ISO/IEC Guide 22:1996,  General criteria for supplier's declaration of conformity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO/IEC 17050 has been developed with the objective of providing general requirements for a
supplier’s declaration of conformity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It addresses one of the three types of attestation of conformity, namely attestation undertaken by the first party
(e.g. the supplier of a product). Other types are second-party attestation (e.g. where a user issues an
attestation for the product the user is using) or third-party attestation. Each of these three types is used in the
market in order to increase confidence in the conformity of an object.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO/IEC 17050 specifies requirements applicable when the individual or organization responsible
for fulfilment of specified requirements (supplier) provides a declaration that a product (including service),
process, management system, person or body is in conformity with specified requirements, which can include
normative documents such as standards, guides, technical specifications, laws and regulations. Such a
declaration of conformity can also make reference to the results of assessments by one or more first, second
or third parties. Such references are not to be interpreted as reducing the responsibility of the supplier in any
way.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These general requirements are applicable to all sectors. However, these requirements might need to be
supplemented for specific purposes, for example for use in connection with regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A supplier's declaration of conformity of a product (including service), process, management system, person
or body to specified requirements can be substantiated by supporting documentation under the responsibility
of the supplier. In cases where this is desirable, or necessary, reference is made to ISO/IEC 17050-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Conformity assessment — Supplier's declaration
of conformity —<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>Part 1:
General requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO/IEC 17050 specifies general requirements for a supplier’s declaration of conformity in cases
where it is desirable, or necessary, that conformity of an object to the specified requirements be attested,
irrespective of the sector involved. For the purposes of this part of ISO/IEC 17050, the object of a declaration
of conformity can be a product, process, management system, person or body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO/IEC 17050 does not define any particular object for the declaration of conformity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instead of “supplier's declaration of conformity”, the term “declaration of conformity” can be used when
appropriate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2
Normative references<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document. For dated
references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced
document (including any amendments) applies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO/IEC 17000:2004,  Conformity assessment — Vocabulary and general principles<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3
Terms and definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in ISO/IEC 17000 apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
“Supplier's declaration of conformity” is a “declaration” as defined in ISO/IEC 17000, i.e. first-party attestation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,,`,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
To avoid any confusion with attestation by certification bodies, the term “self-certification” is deprecated and
should not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4
Purpose of the declaration of conformity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of the declaration is to give assurance of conformity of the identified object to specified
requirements to which the declaration refers, and to make clear who is responsible for that conformity and
declaration. A supplier’s declaration of conformity may be used alone or in conjunction with another conformity
assessment procedure for regulatory or non-regulatory purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

second or third parties. Conformity assessment bodies involved, where applicable, should consult relevant
International Standards, Guides and other normative documents.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where a declaration of conformity is for a group of products of a similar type, it shall cover each individual
product of the group. Where a declaration of conformity is for similar products delivered over a period of time,
it shall cover each product as delivered or accepted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

assessment results be different from the signatory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 Guidance to complete the form of declaration of conformity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Numbers 1) to 7) refer to the form shown in A.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)
Every declaration of conformity should be uniquely identified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
The responsible issuer should be unequivocally specified. For large organizations, it may be necessary to
specify operational groups or departments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
a)
The “object” should be unequivocally described so that the declaration of conformity may be related
to the object in question.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)
b)
For mass-produced products, it is not necessary to give individual serial numbers. In such cases it is
sufficient to give the name, type, model number, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4)
For products, an alternative conformity statement may be: “As delivered, the object of the declaration
described above is in conformity with the requirements of the following documents”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5)
Requirements documents should be listed with their identification numbers, titles and dates of issue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6)
Text should appear here only if any limitation on the validity of the declaration of conformity and/or any
additional information are given. The latter information may, for example, correspond to 6.2 or may make
reference to related product marking in accordance with Clause 9. Such product marking or other
indication (e.g. on the product) may be an attachment to the declaration of conformity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7)
Full name and function of the signing person(s) authorised by the issuer's management to sign on its
behalf should be given. The number of signatures, or equivalent, included will be the minimum
determined by the legal form of the issuer’s organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
