          "content": "Introduction list 4 od 25\nThe quality and consistency of a weld depends on the welder, the materials and the welding\nequipment. Variability in the output of the welding equipment will affect the quality of the weld.\nIn some arc welding processes, 6.g. MMA, the welder controls the process through his\nexperience and measurement of run out length is used to monitor the heat input. However, in\nother arc welding processes the quality of the weld depends upon accurate and repeatable\nsetting of parameters such as current, voltage, speed, gas flow, pulse characteristics, etc.\nThe relevant construction standard for arc welding equipment is EN 60974-1. This standard\nsets the reference level for the accuracy and consistency of the welding output. EN 60974-1\nderives its specification for performance accuracy from the requirements of manual welding.\nin manual welding the welder plays a key role in adapting and adjusting the output of the\nequipment to meet the requirements of the weld. This adaptability allows equipment to be\nconstructed with a relaxed specification for calibration of output.\nMechanised welding methods lack the skilled adaptability of the manual welder and require\nprecise control of all aspects of the welding process. The control of the output of the welding\nequipment is of particular importance. Manufacturers have responded to this need by\nproducing equipment with an accuracy of output control and calibration, which exceed the\nrequirements of EN 60974-1.\nIn addition to the demands of mechanized welding, manual welding methods have become\nmore refined and welding procedures often call for the precise control of power source\noutputs to limit the freedom of the manual welder In order to produce particular results.\nThe improvement In equipment. construction, the adoption of mechanized welding, the\nintroduction of quality assurance programmes and the increased understanding of the factors\nwhich control weld quality have led to the demand for more rigorous calibration and validation\nof welding equipment performance.\nThe term calibration has been used in the foregoing text to introduce the general subject of\nchecking that the welding equipment output meets the manufacturer's specification and is fit\nfor the purpose of making welds. This is a commonly accepted term for this checking\noperation but It does not meet the strict definition of the word calibration.\nClause 3 of this document gives the definition of calibration. The operation of calibration can\nbe applied only to determining and adjusting the errors of a measuring instrument. An item of\nwelding equipment is not a measuring instrument though the meters fitted to the welding\nequipment are and can be calibrated. The difficulty of terminology and the checking task is\nfurther compounded as many pieces of welding equipment do not have calibrated outputs but\nare scaled in arbitrary units. Again this is a function of the manual welding usage in which the\nskill of the manual welder is used to adjust and set the welding variables. It Is necessary to\nuse an alternative term to describe the operation of verifying that the welding equipment is fit\nfor the intended purpose. The term selected |s validation.\nValidation is the operation which verifies that the welding equipment conforms to the\noperating specification for that equipment. if the equipment fails to conform to the\nspecification then the correction of the errors within the equipment is outside the scope of this\nEuropean Standard. That operation is the province of the manufacturers or equipment\nspecialists.",

          "content": "It is implicit in the introduction of a more rigorous standard of accuracy of control of output for list 5 od 25\nwelding equipment that the scope of application of that standard should be defined. This\nEuropean Standard defines two levels of accuracy. One is derived directly from EN 60974-1\nand is called standard grade. A higher level of accuracy for more exacting welding\napplications is defined, called precision grade, and this is given in Annex A for information.\nThe use of precision grade is dependent upon the welding application.\nThe welding equipment covered by this European Standard will be fitted with controls\nintended to regulate the output of the welding equipment. The controls may be scaled in\nabsolute units (amperes, volts and metres per minute) or in arbitrary units (numbers, letters,\ngeometrical marks). Controls scaled in absolute units may be validated and the consistency of\nthose controls scaled in arbitrary units may be assessed.\nThe welding equipment may be fitted with meters that measure the output of the equipment\nand these meters should normally be validated against the appropriate standard, unless a\ndifferent method is used to control the welding process.\nThe use of meters and measuring instrument packages with welding equipment that is\nrequired to produce welds of integrity and reliability is strongly recommended.\nThis code of practice recommends the use of resistive loads to validate the power source and\nassociated meters. Alternatively, independent instrumentation may be used to monitor the\nwelding process, rather than validating the power source itself. The method of control and\ntype of instrumentation should be detailed on the welding procedure sheet.",

For example, in MIG welding the wire feed speed\nmay be adjusted to give a specific welding current with the speed control scale in arbitrary\nunits. It is not necessary to validate the speed control on such a wire feeder.\nin some cases the speed control may be scaled with arbitrary units and the wire feeder fitted\nwith a wire feed speed meter. In this case the meter should be validated.\nOn a few wire feeders the speed control may be calibrated in absolute units in which case the\ncontrol should be validated.\nSome MIG welding wire feeders may be interlocked with the power source preventing normal\nwire feed operation without an arc.

Equipment manufacturers should be\nconsulted about these devices.\nArc voltage control devices are feedback control systems. A control to set the desired arc\nvoltage is normally part of the system. This may be a scaled control or an unscaled control\nwith a digital or analogue meter showing the set arc voltage.\nThe simplest way to check the arc voltage control is to do so with an arc running. The\nset-up should be arranged so that the arc runs with the minimum of variation. Compare the\nset voltage with the actual arc voltage over the desired operating range. To measure the arc\nvoltage, use a meter with a calibrated accuracy of 0,5 or better conforming to EN 60051-1.\nCAUTION Do not start TIG arcs with high voltage high frequency initiators with the meter\nconnected across the output terminals (see Annex D).\nValidation of an arc voltage control device without an arc Is more difficult and specialist\nknowledge should be sought.\nThe most widely used gas flow control device is the bobbin flow meter. The easiest way to\ncheck the operation of these meters is by direct comparison with a similar meter of known\naccuracy. Such gauges can be obtained from the manufacturers with a traceable calibration.\nThis will rarely be better than 2 %.\nThe gauge to be checked should be connected In series with the standard gauge using short\nlengths of pipework of the largest practical diameter. The system should be connected to a\nsupply of the appropriate gas and the flow readings compared at the desired gauge readings.\nElectronic flow gauges are available and the validation of these devices should be entrusted\nto specialists. A calibrated electronic flow device can be used to validate production flow\ngauges.",

If long welding cables are used this should be taken into account. The following\nIllustration (Figure F.1) is shown using MIG/MAG equipment but the principles apply to all\nwelding processes.\nPower\nnm)\nFeeder\n7 4\nLed\nTorch\n5\n6 Ls\nFigure F.1\nit is important to note that the meters and control circuits used in arg welding equipment are\nat particular points in the welding circuit; these points may \u2018be different to those\nused to attach measuring equipment during procedure qualification. The meter reading will\ntherefore tend to be higher than the actual arc voltage due to voltage drops in other sections\nof the circuit.\nFor example, in this diagram, a voltage meter located on the power supply will normally\nindicate the potential measured across points 1-7. However this is not ideal for applying the\nspecified weld procedure variables because there are voltage drops in sections 1-2, 3-4, and\n6-7 which will vary with welding current, cable diameter, length and temperature.\nDuring procedure qualification it is desirable to measure the true arc voltage between points\n4-5 but this is usually impractical so connections are often made across 3-5. In practice this is\nrarely a problem because the welding torch is usually the same in production and can be\nconsidered a constant. However the difference may be significant when making a change from\nan air-cooled torch to a water-cooled version or vice-versa. The voltage drop between points\n5-6 is also normally insignificant provided that there is a good earth return connection.\nAssuming that the arc voltage has been measured across points 3-5 during qualification,\nproblems will arise if these values are used for production welding relying on a power supply\nvoltage meter measuring the potential across 1-7. This is mainly due to the voltage drops\nbetween 1-2 and 6-7.\nThe voltage drop in a welding cable is proportional to the amount of current flowing through it\nand can be estimated using Table F.1.\nlist 23 od 25",
