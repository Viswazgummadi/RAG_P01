<<PARAGRAPH>>Introduction list 4 od 25
The quality and consistency of a weld depends on the welder, the materials and the welding
equipment. Variability in the output of the welding equipment will affect the quality of the weld.
In some arc welding processes, 6.g. MMA, the welder controls the process through his
experience and measurement of run out length is used to monitor the heat input. However, in
other arc welding processes the quality of the weld depends upon accurate and repeatable
setting of parameters such as current, voltage, speed, gas flow, pulse characteristics, etc.
The relevant construction standard for arc welding equipment is EN 60974-1. This standard
sets the reference level for the accuracy and consistency of the welding output. EN 60974-1
derives its specification for performance accuracy from the requirements of manual welding.
in manual welding the welder plays a key role in adapting and adjusting the output of the
equipment to meet the requirements of the weld. This adaptability allows equipment to be
constructed with a relaxed specification for calibration of output.
Mechanised welding methods lack the skilled adaptability of the manual welder and require
precise control of all aspects of the welding process. The control of the output of the welding
equipment is of particular importance. Manufacturers have responded to this need by
producing equipment with an accuracy of output control and calibration, which exceed the
requirements of EN 60974-1.
In addition to the demands of mechanized welding, manual welding methods have become
more refined and welding procedures often call for the precise control of power source
outputs to limit the freedom of the manual welder In order to produce particular results.
The improvement In equipment. construction, the adoption of mechanized welding, the
introduction of quality assurance programmes and the increased understanding of the factors
which control weld quality have led to the demand for more rigorous calibration and validation
of welding equipment performance.
The term calibration has been used in the foregoing text to introduce the general subject of
checking that the welding equipment output meets the manufacturer's specification and is fit
for the purpose of making welds. This is a commonly accepted term for this checking
operation but It does not meet the strict definition of the word calibration.
Clause 3 of this document gives the definition of calibration. The operation of calibration can
be applied only to determining and adjusting the errors of a measuring instrument. An item of
welding equipment is not a measuring instrument though the meters fitted to the welding
equipment are and can be calibrated. The difficulty of terminology and the checking task is
further compounded as many pieces of welding equipment do not have calibrated outputs but
are scaled in arbitrary units. Again this is a function of the manual welding usage in which the
skill of the manual welder is used to adjust and set the welding variables. It Is necessary to
use an alternative term to describe the operation of verifying that the welding equipment is fit
for the intended purpose. The term selected |s validation.
Validation is the operation which verifies that the welding equipment conforms to the
operating specification for that equipment. if the equipment fails to conform to the
specification then the correction of the errors within the equipment is outside the scope of this
European Standard. That operation is the province of the manufacturers or equipment
specialists.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_5>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is implicit in the introduction of a more rigorous standard of accuracy of control of output for list 5 od 25
welding equipment that the scope of application of that standard should be defined. This
European Standard defines two levels of accuracy. One is derived directly from EN 60974-1
and is called standard grade. A higher level of accuracy for more exacting welding
applications is defined, called precision grade, and this is given in Annex A for information.
The use of precision grade is dependent upon the welding application.
The welding equipment covered by this European Standard will be fitted with controls
intended to regulate the output of the welding equipment. The controls may be scaled in
absolute units (amperes, volts and metres per minute) or in arbitrary units (numbers, letters,
geometrical marks). Controls scaled in absolute units may be validated and the consistency of
those controls scaled in arbitrary units may be assessed.
The welding equipment may be fitted with meters that measure the output of the equipment
and these meters should normally be validated against the appropriate standard, unless a
different method is used to control the welding process.
The use of meters and measuring instrument packages with welding equipment that is
required to produce welds of integrity and reliability is strongly recommended.
This code of practice recommends the use of resistive loads to validate the power source and
associated meters. Alternatively, independent instrumentation may be used to monitor the
welding process, rather than validating the power source itself. The method of control and
type of instrumentation should be detailed on the welding procedure sheet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

8.3 Tungsten inert gas
Tungsten inert gas (TIG) power sources have a constant current characteristic with a.c. or
d.c. output. The current control should be marked in absolute units and can be validated at
conventional load voltages. Generally, TIG power sources are fitted with ammeters and
possibly voltmeters, which can be calibrated. TIG power sources do not have voltage controls
TIG welding power sources are used in complex TIG welding systems and it may be required
to validate the system with load conditions, which closely duplicate the are load conditions.
The resistance of the load is calculated for a specific welding condition using the welding
current and the arc voltage at that current. The welding conditions could be taken from the
welding procedure. Alternatively, a stable arc may be used with a mechanically held torch with
or without arc voltage control.
CAUTION Care should be taken to ensure damage does not occur to instrumentation. See
Annex D for recommended precautions.
A validation method for pulsed TIG power sources is recommended In Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_10>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4 Metal inert/active gas and flux cored arc welding list 10 od 25
Metal inert/active gas (MIG/MAG) and flux cored arc welding (FCW) power sources usually
have a constant voltage characteristic with a d.c. output.
The voltage control may be scaled in absolute or arbitrary units. The voltage control sets the
no-load voltage, and the voltage will fall slightly as current is drawn (typically 3 V to 5 V per
100 A). Some power sources have a slope control that may be used to adjust the static
characteristic and the setting of this control should be noted on the validation certificate.
The voltage control if marked in absolute units should be validated at no-load voltages.
An arbitrarily marked scale should be checked for reproducibility / consistency.
MIG/MAG and FCW power sources do not usually have current controls. The output current of
such a welding power source is generally controlled by the wire feed speed setting which Is
set on the wire feeder control panel. The current varies automatically to regulate the burn off
rate of the consumable electrode. See Annex B on wire feed rate consistency and validate the
wire feeder if necessary.
If accurate measurement of the welding current and voltage Is required it is preferable to use
an ammeter and voltmeter (fitted to the power source or separate) which can be calibrated or
to use independent monitoring equipment.
CAUTION Do not short-circuit the output of a constant voltage power source as a very high
current will flow; use a load resistor.
For synergically controlied and pulsed MIG power sources, a validation method is
recommended in Annex C. |
8.5 Auxiliary components
For validation of auxiliary components see Annex E.
9 Validation techniques
9.1 General
It Is recognized that manufacturers have developed many specialized methods of validating
their welding equipment that may require detailed knowledge of the construction or access to
the interior of the equipment. The validation methods described in this European Standard are
intended to enable the user to check that the equipment is fit for the intended purpose without
the manufacturer's specialist knowledge. However, some of the methods of measurement
described may require specialist knowledge or apparatus.
9.2 Safety precautions
The validator should observe all normal welding safety precautions. Welding equipment
should be installed and used in accordance with CLC/TS 62081. If a TIG power source is
being validated using a welding arc as a power source load, protective clothing and eye
protection should be worn.
The validator should pay particular attention to safety earthing recommendations. Special
attention should be given to the connection of measuring Instruments and the welding current
circuit to prevent high current passing through the instruments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_11>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.3 Instrumentation The general rule for the selection of measuring instruments for use in validation tasks is that they should conform to the following: a) they should be in good condition; b) they should be calibrated by a recognized calibrator with standards traceable to a national c) they should be at least twice and preferably five times more accurate, than the accuracy The type of measurement and meter will be specified for the grade of accuracy and the type of electrical output of the power source. It is proposed that only three measuring terms be used for describing the basic electrical measuring techniques: a) instantaneous value; b) mean value; c) r.m.s. value. NOTE Ther.m.s. value may be ‘true’ or ‘indicated’. Some meters measure r.m.s. directly (‘true' r.m.s.) but many measure the mean and indicate 1,11 times the mean to give an equivalent to the r.m.s. value for a true sine wave. The straightforward measurement of welding parameters is complicated by the following factors: a) the current waveform Is usually complex, the direct current has some fluctuating b) the measurement of current from the output of power sources with a large ripple content, c) the shape of the waveform will affect the accuracy of the measurement if the waveshape d) the shape of the current and voltage waveform for a.c. power sources is assumed to be @) there is a wider range of meters and sensing devices in use now, which enable more f) the purpose of the measurement may be comparative in order to transfer a welding g) the resistance of the welding circuit will have an effect on the application of the welding h) in all cases where the validator is in doubt about the shape of the waveform and the effect list 11 od 25

No-load voltages for MIG power sources should be measured without a load connected and it
should be noted that these values might not agree with the rated no-load voltage, which
appears, on the rating plate. The rating plate no-load voltage is stated for safety reasons on
power sources conforming to EN 60974-1, and Is the peak voltage méasured with a specified
loading circult. However, for power sources conforming to EN 60974-1, the no-load voltage
should be stated as the mean or r.m.s. value.

For plasma cutting using air, the manufacturer may specify the load voltage as determined
under typical cutting conditions
NOTE Manufacturer's load voltage is allowed due to the nature of the plasma process, i.e. the interaction of the
plaama torch design, recommended plasma gas, cutting technique, sic. All may influence the voltage at which

<<PARAGRAPH>>9.6 Method
9.5.1 General
9.5.1.1 Measure the ambient temperature to ensure that it is within the power source and
test instrumentation rating. Record the ambient temperature on the validation certificate.
9.5.1.2 Measure the input voltage to ensure that it Is within the value specified for the power
source. Record the result of this measurement on the validation certificate. Check that the
correct tappings have been connected within the power source if relevant.
9.5.1.3 For engine driven power sources, check the rated load speed and no-load speed to
ensure that the power source meets the rated values.
9.5.1.4 Connect the resistive load across the output terminals of the power source as far as
practical. Connect the instrumentation used for validation of voltage across the resistive load,
and the current transducer in the circuit.
9.5.1.5 Connect the wire feed unit for validation to the source of power supply normally used
during welding.
9.5.1.6 Assemble and adjust the wire feeder according to the manufacturer's instructions.
9.5.1.7 Do not drive the wire feeder at speeds or loaded with filler wire diameters in excess
of that shown on the rating plate or recommended by the manufacturer.
9.5.1.8 Use terminals, cables and wires of high quality to connect the welding equipment
during validation and make all joints sound. Make all crimped and soldered joints free from
any signs of overheating. |
9.5.1.9 Select the validation/calibration range of the control or meter fitted to the power
source should as follows:
a) the full range of the control or meter (see note);
b) range of the control or meter;
c) selected points over the range of the control or meter.
NOTE For digital voltage and current meters the maximum value of the range ia given by the rated no-load
voltage and maximum rated welding current, respectively, of the power source.
Agree options b) or c) with the manufacturer, customer or user, prior to the validation/calibration
being carried out.
Make the measurements at the minimum setting, the maximum setting and three other points
nominally equally spaced between minimum and maximum, over the full or partial range.
Alternatively, make the measurements at the selected points as given above.
NOTE if a partial range is selected, tha minimum measurement point should be approached from below initially.
The second measurement point at maximum should be approached from above. The two measurements at each
point should then be averaged and compared to the control selting or reading to determine the errors.
9.5.2 Power source and welding instrumentation
9.5.2.1. Switch on the equipment 5 min before any calibration measurements.
9.6.2.2 Start with the minimum output setting (see 9.5.1), energize and stabilize the power
source output for 10s and then take a reading. Repeat this procedure for each of the
measurement points up to the maximum.
list 13 od 25<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PAGE_END>>
<<PAGE_14>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.5.2.3 After a further 10s, take a second reading at the maximum setting (see 8.5), and
repeat this procedure for each of the measurement points down to the minimum.
9.5.2.4 The power source should not be loaded in excess of that shown on the rating plate.
9.6.2.5 If validation at a particular current and or voltage is required, but the nature of the
load does not permit that current or voltage at the corresponding load voltage or current to be
achieved, then take points above and below the desired values and calculate the required
value.
9.5.2.6 At each validation point selected record the following:
a) the current and/or voltage control setting; or
b) the power source meter readings;
c) the two values of the true measurement of current and/or voltage from the test
instrumentation;
d) the mean value of the two measurements.
Record the results of measurements systematically and supply them on or with the validation
certificate.
9.5.2.7 If the power source has a slope note the setting. If it is necessary to validate
the power source at different settings of the slope control agree this prior to the validation.
9.5.2.8 It a check of consistency of an arbitrary scale Is being carried out, compare the
results obtained to. those obtained during the previous validation (see Clause 5).

Wire feed equipment
B.1 Validation accuracies
Wire feed equipment includes all systems designed to feed filler wire or consumable
continuous electrodes. It is recognized that in MIG/MAG and allied self-adjusting arc systems
in which the wire feed rate is linked to a function of the welding power, an absolute calibration
of wire feed rate is not necessary.
However if validation of wire feed equipment is required, the wire feed rate should conform to
the accuracy given in Table B.1.
Table B.1 — Validation accuracies for wire feed equipment
B.2 Requirements for validation
The following two basic types of wire feeders are used in welding:
a) wire feeders for consumable electrode processes, MIG welding, submerged arc
welding;
b) wire feeders for additional filler wire, 6.9. cold wire TIG walding, hot wire TIG welding.
The type of wire feeder affects the validation requirements.
On wire feeders for the consumable electrode processes, the speed control may or may not
be calibrated in units of wire feed speed. For example, in MIG welding the wire feed speed
may be adjusted to give a specific welding current with the speed control scale in arbitrary
units. It is not necessary to validate the speed control on such a wire feeder.
in some cases the speed control may be scaled with arbitrary units and the wire feeder fitted
with a wire feed speed meter. In this case the meter should be validated.
On a few wire feeders the speed control may be calibrated in absolute units in which case the
control should be validated.
Some MIG welding wire feeders may be interlocked with the power source preventing normal
wire feed operation without an arc. If the interlock cannot be overridden then the power
source has to be energized with an arc to validate the wire feeder.
The speed controls on wire feeders for filler wire are often scaled in wire feed speed units.
These units can be validated. If the unit is scaled In arbitrary units the validation procedure
can be used to compile a validation chart for the wire feeder. Wire feeders with wire speed
meters should be validated.

Slope, pulse and synergic controls
C.1 Validation accuracy
Slope and pulse controls are considered to be precision grade and the validation accuracies
should conform to + 5 % of setting, unless specified by the manufacturer.
C.2 Requirements for validation
Slope up and slope down controls on TIG welding power sources are validated in one of the
following ways:
a) as a variable time (in seconds) for the current to increase or decay between two different
levels;
b) as a rate of change of current (in amps per second) between two levels of current.
TIG welding pulse controls are validated In several different ways, for example:
a) peak current pulse height, amps;
b) background current height, amps;
Cc) peak current duration, seconds;
d) background current duration, seconds;
@) peak current pulse height, amps;
f) background current height, amps;
g) mark space time, seconds;
h) mark space ratio, number or percentage.
NOTE On or off time ia expreeged as a fractian or a percentage of the total cycle time.
The validation of slope up and slope down controls is straightforward, as the rate of change of
current is slow.
The validation of TIG welding pulse controls is an important contribution to the quality of pulsed
TIG welding. It ils a more difficult task than the validation of slope controls. It requires equipment
with a faster response than is necessary for the validation of slope controls. An instrument
response of at least ten times that of the maximum pulse frequency of the power source is
recommended.
C.3 Method
Energize and stabilize the power source output for 5 s for pulsed current validation. A period
of load current stabilisation is not applicable to slope up validation.
Record the current waveform two times at each setting using appropriate instrumentation.
Validate the slope up and slope down control at the following selected points of the control
range at designated points on the current control range:
a) the full range of the slope control; or
b) some part of the slope range; or
c) selected points on the slope range.

manufacturer or user or customer and the validator in advance of the calibration procedure. In
the absence of any agreement the validation should take place at the mid-point of the current
control range at the mid-point of the slope up or slope down control range.
Validate the current pulse control at points selected by the following:
a) the welding procedure developer;
b) the validator;
c) the equipment user.
In the absence of any stipulation of validation points by a), b) or c), the pulse control should
be validated at the following points on the pulse shape control ranges:
- peak current midrange;
- background current midrange;
- peak current on time minimum and maximum;
- background current on time midrange.
The specification and validation of the full range of the pulse shape controls should be the
province of the equipment manufacturer.
At each validation point, record the following:
a) the pulse control settings;
b) the measurement of currant flowing in the loading circuit.
The measuring instrument selected will record the current pulse shape electronically or
graphically. The record can be measured to determine the magnitude and duration of the
current pulses in the power source output circuit. The waveform is often not a true square
wave and care should be taken in determining the peak and background periods. It is
advisable to consult the equipment manufacturers.
The average value of the two measurements should be systematically recorded elther using a
notebook with numbered pages or numbered record sheets or directly on to the validation
certificate.
C.4 Pulsed MIG and synergic controls
Ammeters and voltmeters that measure mean values of the welding parameters may be
validated in accordance with this European Standard. Validation of other controls and pulsed
waveforms should be in accordance with the manufacturer's procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

It may also be necessary to connect electrical measuring instruments directly to the output terminals of the welding power source. Few measuring instruments are protected against the high voltage high frequency arc initiation discharges used in many TIG welding The discharge will damage or destroy the measuring instrument. The validator should take precautions, such as the following, against this damage: a) the simplest method of protection is to connect the measuring instrument after the arc has b) the meter may be connected inside the power source on the low voltage side or safe side c) the measuring instrument may be protected by a filter circuit similar to that provided in the d) the measuring instrument may be protected by an automatic disconnection circuit; e) the high voltage initiation circuit may be disconnected and the arc by a tungsten list 21 od 25

Validation of ancillary components In a welding system components of the most widely used welding systems conform to the required accuracy of
control of output. Other components in the welding system will affect the quality of the welded
product and need care and maintenance to ensure correct operation.
Welding manipulators, welding rotators, orbital welding rotation drives and robotic
manipulation devices control the welding speed and therefore influence the heat input to the
weld and metallurgical and mechanical properties of the weld. The speed on these
machines should be checked at intervals compatible with other maintenance and validation
tasks on the welding equipment to ensure that it conforms to the manufacturer's specification.
Three factors need to be checked:
a) the absolute accuracy of the speed control calibration;
b) the of the speed control calibration;
c) the consistency of the speed control during operation.
A number of devices are available to assist the user of welding equipment to check the speed
control. The simplest of these is the stopwatch and measuring rule; these instruments will
enable most rotary and linear devices to be checked. Electrical transducers are from
the manufacturers of the portable welding monitors. A rubber-tyred wheel runs on the moving
component and this wheel drives a tachogenerator which gives an output proportional to the
speed. More complex electromechanical transducers are available to fit on to welding
equipment to measure welding speed and displacement. Equipment manufacturers should be
consulted about these devices.
Arc voltage control devices are feedback control systems. A control to set the desired arc
voltage is normally part of the system. This may be a scaled control or an unscaled control
with a digital or analogue meter showing the set arc voltage.
The simplest way to check the arc voltage control is to do so with an arc running. The
set-up should be arranged so that the arc runs with the minimum of variation. Compare the
set voltage with the actual arc voltage over the desired operating range. To measure the arc
voltage, use a meter with a calibrated accuracy of 0,5 or better conforming to EN 60051-1.
CAUTION Do not start TIG arcs with high voltage high frequency initiators with the meter
connected across the output terminals (see Annex D).
Validation of an arc voltage control device without an arc Is more difficult and specialist
knowledge should be sought.
The most widely used gas flow control device is the bobbin flow meter. The easiest way to
check the operation of these meters is by direct comparison with a similar meter of known
accuracy. Such gauges can be obtained from the manufacturers with a traceable calibration.
This will rarely be better than 2 %.
The gauge to be checked should be connected In series with the standard gauge using short
lengths of pipework of the largest practical diameter. The system should be connected to a
supply of the appropriate gas and the flow readings compared at the desired gauge readings.
Electronic flow gauges are available and the validation of these devices should be entrusted
to specialists. A calibrated electronic flow device can be used to validate production flow
gauges.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Voltage drops in the welding circuit
The resistance of the welding circuit will introduce voltage drops between measurement
points. If long welding cables are used this should be taken into account. The following

welding processes.

it is important to note that the meters and control circuits used in arg welding equipment are
at particular points in the welding circuit; these points may ‘be different to those
used to attach measuring equipment during procedure qualification. The meter reading will
therefore tend to be higher than the actual arc voltage due to voltage drops in other sections
of the circuit.
For example, in this diagram, a voltage meter located on the power supply will normally
indicate the potential measured across points 1-7. However this is not ideal for applying the
specified weld procedure variables because there are voltage drops in sections 1-2, 3-4, and
6-7 which will vary with welding current, cable diameter, length and temperature.
During procedure qualification it is desirable to measure the true arc voltage between points
4-5 but this is usually impractical so connections are often made across 3-5. In practice this is
rarely a problem because the welding torch is usually the same in production and can be
considered a constant. However the difference may be significant when making a change from
an air-cooled torch to a water-cooled version or vice-versa. The voltage drop between points
5-6 is also normally insignificant provided that there is a good earth return connection.
Assuming that the arc voltage has been measured across points 3-5 during qualification,
problems will arise if these values are used for production welding relying on a power supply
voltage meter measuring the potential across 1-7. This is mainly due to the voltage drops
between 1-2 and 6-7.
The voltage drop in a welding cable is proportional to the amount of current flowing through it
and can be estimated using Table F.1.

NOTE Table F.1 is for only. Some welding equipment is designed in manner that these effects
are minimized or avoided, such as in the following examples.
- Constant current equipment may eliminate the effect if the contro! variables are wire fead speed and welding
current; the arc voltage will vary to suit the welding conditions.
- Constant voltage equipment may measure the potential between points 3-7 avoiding any effect due to changing
en of interconnection cables (1-2), but there can still be significant voltage drope in the earth retum cable
- Constant voltage equipment may be fitted with a 0.V sensing lead that attachse to the workpiece; the arc voltage
is then measured between 3-5.
When @quipment is used that does not specifically address thie problem, the following precautiona will reduce the
effects of voltage drops in the welding circuit:
- use the shortest possible interconnection and return current cable lengths;
- use heavier, lower-resistance welding cables;
- consider the use of external voltage meters;
- ensure that connectors are suitably rated; any overheating is indicative of significant voltage drops at the
connection;
- provide a comparison table to the operator to assist in compensating for the voltage drop effect.
