<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Part 12:
Automated full peripheral ultrasonic thickness testing of
seamless and welded (except submerged arc-welded) steel
tubes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 10893 specifies requirements for the automated full peripheral ultrasonic testing of seamless
and welded steel tubes, with the exception of submerged arc-welded (SAW) tubes, for wall thickness
measurement. It specifies the testing method and corresponding calibration procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
Full peripheral testing does not necessarily mean that 100 % of the tube surface is scanned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
This test can be carried out simultaneously with full peripheral ultrasonic testing for the detection of laminar
imperfections (see ISO 10893-8) using the same ultrasonic transducers for both inspection requirements. Under these
circumstances, the minimum lamination size under detection determines the percentage of the tube surface for scanning,
according to ISO 10893-8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 10893 can also be applicable to the testing of circular hollow sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 10893 is applicable to the thickness measurement of tubes with a specified outside diameter
equal to or greater than 25,4 mm and a minimum wall thickness of 2,6 mm, unless otherwise agreed on.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The operating authorization issued by the employer shall be according to a written procedure. Non-destructive
testing (NDT) operations shall be authorized by a level 3 NDT individual approved by the employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The definition of levels 1, 2 and 3 can be found in appropriate International Standards, e.g. ISO 9712 and
ISO 11484.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
The tube shall be tested using the ultrasonic single or multiple pulse echo technique, with piezoelectric
or electromagnetic transducers. The ultrasound shall be transmitted in the direction normal to the tube surface,
to determine that the tube thickness meets the specified requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2
During testing, the tubes and the probe assembly shall be moved relative to each other such that (with
the exception provided in Note 2 of Clause 1) the tube surface shall be scanned over equidistant non-
coincident helical paths along the entire length of the tube. Unless specified in the product standards or
agreed on by the manufacturer and purchaser, the minimum coverage shall be at the manufacturer's
discretion according to his manufacturing process, but shall be not less than 10 % of the surface area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Other scanning routes can be used by agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3
The suggested maximum width of each transducer, or each active aperture when using phased array
transducers, should be 25 mm measured in any direction. However, manufacturers may use larger
transducers provided they can demonstrate their capability for detecting the adopted reference standard; on
request, this capability shall be demonstrated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4
The equipment shall be capable of classifying tubes as either acceptable or suspect by means of an
automated trigger/alarm level combined with a marking and/or recording and/or sorting system.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6
Reference tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1
The reference tube (or partly scanned tube) shall have the same nominal diameter and thickness, same
surface finish, heat treatment and delivery condition (e.g. as-rolled, normalized, quenched and tempered) as
the tubes under test, and shall have similar acoustic properties (e.g. sound velocity and attenuation
coefficient).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2
The reference tube (or machined reference sample or machined block or hollow bar of steel) shall, at
the manufacturer's discretion, either<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
have a known area with a predetermined thickness with an accuracy better than  ± 0,1 mm, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
have a machined section(s) either at the specified minimum thickness or having one section at minimum
thickness and one section between minimum and maximum thickness limits. The thickness of the
reference tube used for calibrating the ultrasonic equipment shall have a tolerance of  ± 0,05 mm or  ± 0,2 %,
whichever is the greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7
Equipment calibration and checking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1
At the start of each test cycle, the equipment shall be calibrated statically using the selected reference
tube such that it indicates the thickness of the reference tube with an accuracy better than  ± 0,10 mm or  ± 2 %,
whichever is the greater, such that a trigger/alarm condition is produced whenever the specified thickness
limit(s) is exceeded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manufacturer shall demonstrate that the results achieved during the production testing are consistent with
those achieved at the static calibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2
During the production testing of the tubes, the relative rotational and translational speeds shall be
chosen such that the tube surface is scanned in accordance with 5.2. Relative speed of movement during
testing shall not vary by more than  ± 10 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3
The calibration of the equipment shall be checked at regular intervals during the production testing of
tubes of the same specified diameter, thickness and grade.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency of checking the calibration shall be at least every 4 h, but also whenever there is an equipment
operator team changeover and at the start and end of production.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4
The equipment shall be recalibrated if any of the parameters which were used during the initial
calibration are changed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5
If, on checking during production testing, the calibration requirements are not satisfied even after taking
into account an additional accuracy tolerance given in 7.6, all the tubes tested since the previous check shall
be retested after the equipment has been recalibrated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.6
To allow for system drift, an additional thickness accuracy tolerance of +1 % or +0,05 mm, whichever is
the greater in excess of that stated in 7.1, shall be taken into account during checking of the equipment
calibration during production testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.7
By agreement between the manufacturer and the purchaser, it shall be demonstrated that at the
advancing and/or rotating speed and pulse repetition frequency used, the equipment is capable of detecting a
non-conforming thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8
Acceptance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1
Any tube producing no trigger/alarm condition (see 7.1) shall be deemed to have passed this test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2
Any tube producing a trigger/alarm condition (see 7.1) shall be designated suspect or, at the
manufacturer's discretion, may be retested. If, after two consecutive retests, all signals are lower than the
trigger/alarm level, the tube shall be deemed to have passed this test; otherwise, the tube shall be designated
as suspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3
For suspect tubes, one or more of the following actions shall be taken, subject to the requirements of
the product standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
If the manufacturer can prove that the trigger/alarm condition arises from a combination of minor
imperfections, e.g. inclusion clusters, not individually or in combination extensive enough to cause
rejection, the tube shall be deemed to have passed the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
If applicable, the suspect area of the tube exhibiting thickening in excess of the upper tolerance limit may
be dressed by a suitable method. After checking that the remaining wall thickness is within the specified
tolerances, the tube shall be deemed to have passed the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The suspect area shall be cropped off.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
The tube shall be deemed not to have passed this test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
