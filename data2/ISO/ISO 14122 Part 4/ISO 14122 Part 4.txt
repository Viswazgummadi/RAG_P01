<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 14122-4 was prepared by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) in collaboration with
Technical Committee ISO/TC 199,  Safety of machinery , in accordance with the Agreement on technical
cooperation between ISO and CEN (Vienna Agreement).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Throughout the text of this document, read “...this European Standard...” to mean “...this International
Standard...”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 14122 consists of the following parts, under the general title  Safety of machinery — Permanent means of

Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard applies to all machinery (stationary and mobile) where fixed means of access are necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of this standard is to define the general requirements for safe access to machines mentioned in
E N  ISO 12100-2. EN ISO 14122-1 gives advice about the correct choice of access means when the necessary
a cc ess to the machine is not possible directly from the ground level or from a floor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard applies to fixed ladders, which are a part of a machine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard may also be applied to fixed ladders to that part of the building where the machine is installed,
providing the main function of that part of the building is to provide a means of access to the machine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This standard may be used also for means of access which are outside the scope of this standard. In those cases
the possible relevant national or other regulations should be taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard applies also to ladders which are not permanently fixed to the machine and which may be removed,
moved to the side or pivoted (swivel-mounted) for some operations of the machine (e. g. changing tools in a large
press).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the significant hazards covered by this standard, see Clause 4 of EN ISO 14122-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is not applicable to machinery which are manufactured before the date of publication of this standard
by CEN.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Safety requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The materials, dimensions of constituent elements and construction mode used shall meet the safety objectives of
this standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ladders shall be designed to meet the same installation requirements as the machine, taking into consideration
where necessary, conditions such as harsh environment, vibrations, etc.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As far as possible, fixed ladders should be designed with two stiles. In exceptional circumstances (e. g. a
continuous ladder with a varying angle of pitch or insufficient space to provide two stiles), fixed ladders may be
provided with only one stile.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All parts likely to be in contact with users shall be designed so as not to catch, hurt or hinder i. e. sharp corners,
welds with burrs, or rough edges, etc. should be avoided. Opening or closing the mobile parts (gate) shall not
cause further hazards (e. g. shearing or accidental falling) for persons using the ladder and those in the vicinity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fittings, hinges, anchor points, supports and mounting points shall hold the assembly sufficiently rigid and stable to
ensure the safety of users under normal conditions of use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Strength of fixed ladders<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.1
Ladder element<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ladder elements are considered to fulfil the requirements mentioned in 4.2.1 when they meet the requirements
of EN 131-2. The maximum deflection as indicated in 5.1 shall not exceed 50 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of fixed ladders with one stile instead of the lateral bending test (see 4.4 of EN 131-2:1993) a torsion test
shall be made by application of two test loads each 400 N. The deflection of the ladder shall not exceed 20 mm
(see 5.4.3 and Figure 16). For the rungs, the load is applied on a length of 100 mm close to the lateral devices
against slipping off. The residual deflection of the rungs shall be not more than 0,3 % related to the length of the
rung (see 5.4.2, and Figure 15).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.2
Safety cage<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The safety cage is considered to meet these requirements if the permanent deformation as the result of a vertical
load of 1000 N is not more than 10 mm and as the result of a horizontal load of 500 N is not more than 10 mm.
(see 5.3 and Figure 13).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1.3
Fixed ladders equipped with a fall arrester<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the requirements of 4.2.1.1, the combination of fall arrester and ladder shall be capable of stopping
the user from falling (see Clause 5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2
Fixing elements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fixing elements such as fittings, anchorage points, hinges, supports and mountings shall hold the assembly
sufficiently rigid and stable to ensure the safety of user under normal conditions of use (see verification in 5.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of fixed ladders equipped with a fall arrester the connecting elements shall withstand the stresses caused
by the fall arrester catching the person who falls down.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2.2
Anchoring points of fixed ladders<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The anchoring points and connections to them shall be capable of supporting 3000 N per stile. Up to four
anchorages may be considered to contribute to this support. See 5.5 for the test method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The ladder shall be fitted with a fall protection device when:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
height of the ladder flight is more than 3000 mm;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
height of the ladder is 3000 mm or less, but at the departure area there is the risk of falling an additional
distance. In this case, the total distance of fall from the upper level of the ladder could be more than 3000 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2
Choice of the type of fall protection device<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two main alternatives for protection of the users of fixed ladders against falls from a height are safety cages or fall
arresters:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  The cage shall be the required choice, as it is a means which is always present and the actual safety function
is independent of the operator's actions,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  Where it is not possible to use a cage, individual protective equipment shall be provided. The fall arrester is
only effective if the user chooses to use it. If a harness with an incompatible sliding system is used with a
guided type fall arrester, there will be a risk (requirements for information for use see Clause 6).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A fall arrester shall be designed only for low frequency and specialised access (e. g. maintenance).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
An appropriate individual fall protection device is able to arrest a fall better than a cage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Ladder<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The principal dimensions of the ladder shall be determined in accordance with 4.4.1 to 4.4.4 (See also Figures 4

<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1.2
Spacing between rungs and the departure and arrival area<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The distance between the walking surface of the departure area and the first rung shall not exceed the spacing
between two consecutive rungs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NO TE
In case of mobile machinery to be used on uneven ground, the distance between the walking surface of the
departure area and the first rung may be 400 mm max..<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,,`,,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The top rung shall be positioned at the same level as the walking surface of the arrival area (see Figure 6a). If the
gap between the walking surface and the ladder is greater than 75 mm, a floor extension shall be provided at the
arrival area to reduce this gap.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4.1.3
Position of rungs of fixed ladders with one stile<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A preload of 200 N perpendicular to the top of the rungs is applied for one minute. The position of the rung after
moving the preload is taken into account as a reference position for the test carried out with the test load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The direction of the preload and of the test load of 2,6 kN is perpendicular to the top of the rungs. The preload and
test load are equally distributed on a length of 100 mm close to the lateral devices provided at the end of the rungs
to prevent slipping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After removing the test load, the residual deflection of the rungs shall be not more than 0,3 % related to the length
L  of the rung. Point of measuring is at a distance of 50 mm from the lateral protective device provided at the end of
the rung to prevent slipping-off; the direction of measuring to be in the line of application of the test load. Measuring
of the deflection of the rungs shall be carried out no less than one minute after removing the test load.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
