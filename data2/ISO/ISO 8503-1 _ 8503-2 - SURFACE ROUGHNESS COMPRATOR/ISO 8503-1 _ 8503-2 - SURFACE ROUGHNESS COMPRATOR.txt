Comparator procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A precision nickel Comparator plate for grit and shot-blast
surface roughness comparison measurement.
When steel has been blast-cleaned, the surface consists of
random irregularities with peaks and valleys that are not
easily characterised.
Because of this random nature, experts have recommended
that the profile should be identified as either angular (where
grit abrasives have been used) or dimpled (where shot
abrasives have been used) and that they should be graded as
fine, medium or coarse with each grade being defined by
limits specified in ISO 8503.
The Surface Roughness Comparator is supplied in a protective
Wallet.
The Surface Roughness Comparator can also be supplied with
a X5 Illuminated Magnifier in an industrial foam-filled Carrying
Case.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Evaluation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Care<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Remove all loose dirt and debris from the test surface.
Select the appropriate surface profile reference Comparator .
The Grit Comparator is for comparing profiles after
blast-cleaning with grit abrasives, and the Shot Comparator is
for comparing profiles after blast-cleaning with shot abrasives.
Place the selected Comparator against an area of the test
surface.
Compare in turn the test surface with the four segments of
the Comparator, using the Illuminated Magnifier if necessary.
If the Illuminated Magnifier is used, place it so that the test
surface is viewed simultaneously with a segment of the
Comparator.
Assess the profiles on the Comparator that are nearest to the
profile of the test surface and determine its grade from the
following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Never place the Comparator face down on a rough surface.
Keep the Comparator in the protective Wallet provided when
not in use.
If the Comparator becomes tarnished, wash with a dilute
detergent solution and soft brush and dry with soft tissue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Practical Advice<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The Surface Roughness Comparator method is applicable to
steel surfaces that have been blast-cleaned to grades Sa 2 ½
and Sa 3 when the surface under test shows an overall
blast-cleaned appearance.
It is applicable to surfaces that have been cleaned with either
metallic or non-metallic abrasives.
When a mixture of shot and grit abrasives are used to
blast-clean a substrate, the Grit Surface Roughness
Comparator should be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fine-grade profiles equal to segment 1 and up to but
excluding segment 2.
Medium-grade profiles equal to segment 2 and up to but
excluding segment 3.
Coarse-grade profiles equal to segment 3 and up to but
excluding segment 4.
If any profile is assessed as below the lower limit for the fine
grading, assess this grading as finer than fine.
If any profile is assessed as greater than the upper limit for
the coarse grading, assess this grading as coarser than
coarse.
If visual assessment proves difficult, tactile assessment may
provide a useful guide.
It is possible to assess the closest grading by passing the back
of a fingernail or a wooden stylus held between thumb and
forefinger over the test surface and segments on the
Comparator alternately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
