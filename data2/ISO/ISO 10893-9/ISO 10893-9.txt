<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Reference sample<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
The reference standards defined in this part of ISO 10893 are convenient standards for calibration of
non-destructive testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards should not be construed as the
minimum size of imperfection detectable by such equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2
The ultrasonic equipment shall be calibrated either electronically using any flat reference sample
[see 7.1 a)] or a flat reference sample comprising flat-bottomed circular, square or rectangular recess
(see Figure 1) machined into the surface of the reference sample [see 7.1 b)].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The flat-bottomed circular reference standard shall be used as the primary means of establishing the test
sensitivity. When using one of the other types of reference standards, the test sensitivity shall be adjusted
such that it is equivalent to that obtained when using the flat-bottomed circular recess.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the through-transmission technique, either the recess shall be filled with a suitable sound attenuating
material, or a suitable sound attenuating material of the same dimensions as the reference standard shall be
attached to the surface of the test piece.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3
The reference recess shall be obtained by machining, spark erosion or other appropriate methods.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The bottom or the bottom corners of the recess can be rounded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4
The reference sample shall have a similar surface finish and similar acoustic properties (e.g. sound
velocity and attenuation coefficient) as the strip/plate under test. The reference sample selected by the
manufacturer for calibration purposes shall be of convenient length and width.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Dimensions of reference standards<<HEADING_END>>

Equipment calibration and checking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1
At the start of each test cycle, the equipment shall be calibrated statically either without reference
standard in accordance with 7.1 a) or using a reference standard in accordance with 7.1 b).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Calibration without reference standard: with the probe assembly positioned on the strip/plate under test,
the full amplitude of the first back-wall echo minus 6 dB shall be used to activate the respective
trigger/alarm of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test sensitivity may also be established with DAC (distance amplitude correction) curves as supplied
by the transducer manufacturer or with DAC curves as prepared by the tube or strip/plate manufacturer
using, in both cases, the 6 mm flat-bottomed hole curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manufacturer shall demonstrate that, at the set sensitivity, the equipment will detect, under static
conditions, the reference recess as given in 6.1 2 and Figure 1. If this is not the case, the necessary
adjustment in sensitivity shall be made prior to the production test run.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Calibration using a reference standard: under static conditions, with the transducer or each transducer in
turn centrally located over the reference standard, the full signal amplitude of the signal obtained from the
reference standard shall be used to activate their respective trigger/alarm of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2
During production testing of the strip/plate, the relative translational speeds and pulse repetition
frequency shall be chosen such that the minimum coverage values and maximum separation values between
adjacent scanning tracks given in Table 1 are obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3
The calibration of the equipment shall be checked at regular intervals during the production testing of
strip/plate.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency of checking the calibration shall be at least every 4 h, but also whenever there is an equipment
operation team changeover and at the start and end of the production run.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4
The equipment shall be recalibrated if any of the parameters which were used during the initial
calibration are changed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5
If, on checking during production testing, the calibration requirements are not satisfied, even after
increasing the test sensitivity by up to 3 dB to allow for system drift, all strips/plates tested since the previous
equipment check shall be retested after the equipment has been recalibrated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Acceptance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1
Any strip/plate producing signals lower than the trigger/alarm level shall be deemed to have passed this
test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2
Any strip/plate producing signals equal to or greater than the trigger/alarm level shall be designated
suspect or, at the discretion of the manufacturer, may be retested. If, after two consecutive retests, all signals
are lower than the trigger/alarm level, the strip/plate shall be deemed to have passed this test; otherwise, the
strip/plate shall be designated as suspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
If applicable, the evaluation can be based on DAC curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3
For suspect strips/plates, one or more of the following actions shall be taken, subject to the
requirements of the product standard:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the suspect area shall be explored by a manual ultrasonic compression wave technique in accordance
with Annex A to establish the extent of the laminar imperfections. The product shall be deemed to have
passed this test if the size and frequency of the laminar imperfections do not exceed the values given in
Tables 2 and 3. If the width,  C , of the laminar imperfection exceeds the  C min  that shall be considered (see
also the note in Table 3), an area of 500 mm  ×  500 mm with the indication in the centre shall be explored
100 % to establish the presence of other laminar imperfections exceeding  B max  and to determine if the
population density of laminar imperfections  >   B min  and  <   B max  exceeds the permissible values in Table 3.
In the event of further laminar imperfections exceeding the minimum width that shall be considered as
being detected, the exploration shall be extended for a further area of 500 mm  ×  500 mm with the new
indication at the centre. For the determination of the extent of the laminated suspect area, adjacent
suspect areas separated by less than the smaller of the two minor axes of the laminations shall be
considered as one lamination;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the suspect area shall be cropped off;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the strip/plate shall be deemed not to have passed the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(normative)
Procedure for the determination of the size of laminar imperfections
by manual ultrasonic testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex covers the procedure for manual ultrasonic pulse echo scanning of strip/plate for the determination
of the extent of laminated suspect areas found by automated/semi-automated testing for the detection of
laminar imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases of arbitration between the manufacturer and the purchaser or his representative regarding the extent
and frequency of detected laminar imperfections, this procedure shall be used. This procedure determines the
details of the sizing method to establish the extent and frequency of laminar imperfections in steel strip/plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2 Surface condition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface of the strip/plate shall be sufficiently free of foreign matter as to ensure the validity of the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3 Test equipment requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.1
The ultrasonic probe shall be guided over the strip/plate surface either manually or by mechanical
means. The ultrasound shall be transmitted in the direction normal to the tube surface.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.2
One of the following two types of ultrasonic testing equipment shall be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Equipment with a screen display and gain control, adjustable in 2 dB steps. The gain control shall be
adjusted such that the ultrasonic signals from the laminated suspect area under evaluation are between
20 % and 80 % of the usable height of the screen display.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Equipment without a screen display where automated signal amplitude measurement/assessment
facilities are used. The amplitude measuring unit shall be capable of signal amplitude assessment steps
not exceeding 2 dB.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.3
If dual transducer probes are used for manual determination of the size of the laminated suspect area,
examples of details given in Table A.1 shall be noted.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.4 Test procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Laminar imperfections shall be located by comparing the amplitude of the imperfection echo with the
amplitude of the echo of a 6 mm flat-bottom hole used during calibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Only those imperfections giving an echo at least equivalent in amplitude to that obtained with the 6 mm flat-
bottom hole shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to determine the extent of laminar imperfections that shall be considered, the method of measuring
the half-amplitude value shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method requires that the ultrasonic probe be passed over the laminated suspect area in transverse
direction (determination of dimension  C ) and longitudinal direction (determination of dimension  L ). The
suspect location shall be 100 % scanned. During the transverse scan, the positions  C 1  and  C 2  shall be
determined where, over the greatest transverse extent, the magnitude of the intermediate reflection equals
half of the related maximum value (6 dB difference in signal level). If this value is less than the minimum
allowable width (see Table 3) that shall be considered, no further explorations shall be done. Similarly, during
the longitudinal scan, the positions  L 1  and  L 2  shall be determined. The distances between points  C 1  and  C 2
and  L 1  and  L 2  are defined as the maximum width and length dimensions, respectively. The product of these
dimensions is defined as the area of the equivalent laminar imperfection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
