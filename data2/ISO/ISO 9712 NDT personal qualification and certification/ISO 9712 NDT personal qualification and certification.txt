<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since the effectiveness of any application of non-destructive testing (NDT) depends upon the capabilities of
the persons who perform or are responsible for the test, a procedure has been developed to provide a means
of evaluating and documenting the competence of personnel whose duties require the appropriate theoretical
and practical knowledge of the non-destructive tests they perform, specify, supervise, monitor or evaluate. An
added incentive stems from the worldwide comparability of a wide range of industrial applications requiring
common non-destructive testing approaches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When certification of NDT personnel is required in product standards, regulations, codes or specifications, it is
important to certify the personnel in accordance with this International Standard. When latitude is provided in
the criteria within this International Standard, the certification body has the final decision in determining specific
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When there is no requirement in legislation, in standard or in the order for certification of NDT personnel, it is
for employers of such personnel to decide how to assure themselves that they are competent to do the work
assignments. Thus, they may employ people who are already certified or they may apply their own expertise
so as to assure themselves that their employee has the necessary competence. In this last case, prudent
employers would no doubt use this International Standard as a reference document.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies requirements for principles for the qualification and certification of
personnel who perform industrial non-destructive testing (NDT).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
The term “industrial” implies the exclusion of applications in the field of medicine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The system specified in this International Standard can also apply to other NDT methods or to new techniques
within an established NDT method, provided a comprehensive scheme of certification exists and the method
or technique is covered by International, regional or national standards or the new NDT method or technique
has been demonstrated to be effective to the satisfaction of the certification body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
CEN/TR 14748 [5]  can be used as guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The certification covers proficiency in one or more of the following methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
acoustic emission testing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
eddy current testing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
infrared thermographic testing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
leak testing (hydraulic pressure tests excluded);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
magnetic testing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)

<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
radiographic testing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
strain gauge testing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
ultrasonic testing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
visual testing (direct unaided visual tests and visual tests carried out during the application of another NDT
method are excluded).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3
This International Standard specifies requirements for what are, in effect, third party conformity assessment
schemes. These requirements do not directly apply to conformity assessment by second or first parties, but relevant parts
of this International Standard can be referred to in such arrangements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 4
Wherever gender specific words such as “his”, “her”, “he” or “she” appear in this International Standard, the
other gender is also applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Work experience is based on a nominal 40 h/week or the legal week of work. When an individual
works in excess of 40 h/week, he may be credited with experience based on the total hours, but he
shall be required to produce evidence of this experience.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.2	 Level 3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Level 3 responsibilities require knowledge beyond the technical scope of any specific NDT method. This broad
knowledge may be acquired through a variety of combinations of education, training and experience. Table 3
details minimum experience for candidates who have successfully completed a technical school or at least two
years of engineering or science study at an accredited college or university. If this is not the case, the duration
has to be multiplied by a factor of 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For Level 3 certification, the intent of this International Standard is that work experience consists of time as a
Level 2. If the individual is being qualified directly from Level 1 to Level 3, with no time at Level 2, the experience
shall consist of the sum of the times required for Level 2 and Level 3. No reduction in the period of experience
shall be allowed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.3	 Possible reductions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3.1
The possible reductions in duration of experience are as described hereafter, provided that, when
several reductions are applicable, the total reduction does not exceed 50 % of the experience duration. Any
reduction does require acceptance by the certification body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When considering possible reduction in the duration of experience, the certification body should take into
consideration the following elements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The quality of experience can be variable, and skills may be assimilated more quickly in an environment
where the experience is concentrated and has a high degree of relevance to the certification sought.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 When gaining experience simultaneously in two or more surface NDT methods, i.e. MT, PT and VT, the
experience gained in the application of one NDT method may be complementary to the experience gained
in one or more other surface methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 Experience in one sector of an NDT method for which certification is already held may be complementary
to the experience in a different sector of the same NDT method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The level and quality of education possessed by the candidate should also be considered. This is
particularly the case for the Level 3 candidate but it can also be applicable for other levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.3.2
Credit for work experience may be gained simultaneously in two or more of the NDT methods covered
by this International Standard, with the reduction of total required experience as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 two testing methods: reduction of total required time by 25 %;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 three testing methods: reduction of total required time by 33 %;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 four or more testing methods: reduction of total required time by 50 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In all cases, the candidate shall be required to show that for each of the testing methods for which he seeks
certification, he has a minimum of 50% of the time required in Table 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3.3
In all cases, the candidate shall be required to show that for each of the NDT method and sector
combinations for which he seeks certification, he has at least half of the experience required, and this shall
never be less than one month in duration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3.4
When the certification sought is limited in application (e.g. thickness measurement or automated
testing), experience duration may be reduced by up to 50 % but shall not be less than one month.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.3.5
Up to 50 % of the practical experience time may be achieved by an appropriate practical course, the
duration of which may be weighted by a maximum factor of 5. This procedure shall not be used in conjunction
with that specified in 7.3.3.4. The course shall concentrate on practical solutions of frequently occurring testing
problems and should involve a significant element of testing known defective specimens. The programme shall
be approved by the certification body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4	 Vision requirements — all levels<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The candidate shall provide documentary evidence of satisfactory vision in accordance with the following
requirements:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
near vision acuity shall permit reading a minimum of Jaeger number 1 or Times Roman N 4.5 or equivalent
letters (having a height of 1,6 mm) at not less than 30 cm with one or both eyes, either corrected or uncorrected;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
colour vision shall be sufficient that the candidate can distinguish and differentiate contrast between the
colours or shades of grey used in the NDT method concerned, as specified by the employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The certification body may consider replacing the requirements in a) by compliance with an appropriate alternative.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>During the specific examination, the candidate shall be required to give answers to at least 20 multiple choice
questions, including questions involving calculations, NDT procedures and questions on codes, standards and
specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the specific examination covers two or more sectors, the minimum number of questions shall be at least 30,
evenly spread between the industrial or product sectors concerned (see Annex A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.3	 Practical examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3.1
The practical examination shall involve applying the test to prescribed specimens, recording (and, for
Level 2 candidates, interpreting) the resulting information to the degree required, and reporting the results in the
required format. Specimens used for training purposes shall not be used for examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3.2
Each specimen shall be uniquely identified and have a master report which includes all of the
equipment settings used to detect specified discontinuities contained within the specimen, which shall be
uniquely identified by an appropriate permanent marking to ensure that it is completely traceable. Such marking
shall not interfere with the practical testing or inspection of the specimen and shall, wherever practicable, be
concealed from the candidate while the specimen is being used for examination. The master report shall be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

retained as records.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3.3
Specimens shall be sector specific, simulating field geometries and shall contain discontinuities
representative of those likely to occur during manufacturing or in service. They may be natural, artificial or
implanted. For Level 2 evaluation tasks, data sets or films can be used instead of real specimens.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Specimens used for calibration or for measurement tasks (e.g. thickness or coating measurement) do not need
to contain discontinuities. For RT, the specimen need not contain discontinuities since these are exhibited in
the radiographs for interpretation. Similarly, for AT, TT, and ST the specimen(s) need not contain discontinuities
since these are exhibited in the data sets for Level 2 interpretation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Guidelines on discontinuity types in examination specimens can be found in CEN/TS 15053 [6]  or ISO/TS 22809. [1]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3.4
The certification body shall ensure that the number of areas or volumes to be tested is adequate to the
level, NDT method and sector concerned, and that those areas or volumes contain reportable discontinuities.
The requirements for the number of specimens and number of areas or volumes to be tested in the Level 1 and
Level 2 practical examinations are given in Annex B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.3.5
The Level 1 candidate shall follow the NDT instruction(s) provided by the examiner.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.3.6
The Level 2 candidate shall select the applicable NDT technique and determine the operating
conditions related to a given code, standard or specification.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3.7
For those examinations where discontinuities are normally replaced by artificial sources or data, the
Level 1 candidate shall demonstrate the ability to set up and calibrate the equipment, verify its sensitivity and
record the test data; the Level 2 candidate shall also demonstrate the ability to interpret and evaluate previously
recorded test data.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.3.8
The time allowed for the examination depends on the number of specimens and on their complexity.
The average time allowed shall be defined by the certification body. The recommended maximum time allowed
for each area or volume tested is:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
for Level 1: 2 h;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
for Level 2: 3 h.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.3.9
Level 2 candidates shall draft at least one NDT Instruction suitable for Level 1 personnel, for a
specimen selected by the examiner.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The recommended maximum time allowed for this part of the examination is 2 h.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.4	 Grading of the Level 1 and Level 2 qualification examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2.4.1
The general, specific and practical examinations shall be graded separately. When conventional
pre-prepared paper-based examinations are used, an examiner shall be responsible for the grading of the
examinations by comparison with model answers. At the option of the certification body, e-assessment systems
that automatically score candidate responses against stored data and grade the completed written examination
according to prepared algorithms may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2.4.2
The grading of the practical examination shall be based on items 1 to 4 in Table 5, with the recommended
weighting factors in relation to the level and method as applicable.<<HEADING_END>>

for Level 2, for the instruction, two retests of the whole recertification examination shall be allowed after at least
7 days and within six months of the first attempt at the recertification examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the event of failure in the two allowable retests, the certificate shall not be revalidated and, to regain
certification for that level, sector and method, the candidate shall apply for new certification. In this case, no
examination exemptions shall be awarded by virtue of any other valid certification held.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3	 Level 3<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.3.1 	 Level 3 certificate holders seeking recertification shall provide evidence of continued qualification
confirmed by:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
satisfying the Level 3 requirements of 11.3.2 for a written examination;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
meeting the requirements for a structured credit system, as given in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The individual may decide between the examination or credit system for recertification. If the credit system is
chosen and requires submission of employer’s documents or access to an employer’s premises, the individual
shall provide to the certification body a written statement of approval from the employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In both cases (written examination or credit system), the individual shall either provide appropriate documented
evidence, acceptable to the certification body, of his continued practical competence in the method or pass a
Level 2 practical examination, as specified in 11.2.2, except for the drafting of NDT instructions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>13	Transition period<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>13.1	  The aim of this clause is to permit the initiation of the system when a certification body applies the
certification scheme to an NDT method, which is not yet covered within its scheme or when a new sector is
created. The certification body may temporarily appoint, for a period not exceeding five years from the date of
implementation of the new method or sector, duly qualified personnel as examiners (see 3.9) for the purpose of
conducting, supervising and grading the qualification examinations. The five year implementation period is not
to be used by the certification body as a means to certify candidates who do not meet all the qualification and
certification requirements of this International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>13.2 	 Duly qualified personnel means that such personnel:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
have the knowledge of the principles of NDT and the specific knowledge in relation to the sector;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
have industrial experience of the application of the NDT method;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>To be successful, the candidate should achieve not less than 70 % in the NDT instruction writing part, i.e. 10,5 marks
out of the 15,0 marks allowed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a
The candidate failing to report a discontinuity specified on the specimen master report as “mandatory for candidates to report”
when performing the test under the conditions specified in the master report shall be awarded zero marks for part 3 of the practical
examination relating to the specimen tested. For RT, this condition applies to radiographic interpretation, i.e. failing one “mandatory to
report” discontinuity on one radiograph leads to zero marks for the set of radiographs in part 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b
The Level 2 candidate is required to produce an NDT instruction, suitable for Level 1 personnel, for a specimen selected by the
examiner. When the Level 2 candidate is testing a specimen for which no NDT instruction is required, the grade is calculated as a
percentage of the 85 remaining marks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
