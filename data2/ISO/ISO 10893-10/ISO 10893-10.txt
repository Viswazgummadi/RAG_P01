<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4
General requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1
Unless otherwise specified by the product standard or agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer,
this ultrasonic testing shall be carried out on tubes after completion of all the primary production process
operations (rolling, heat treating, cold and hot working, sizing and straightening, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
The tubes under test shall be sufficiently straight to ensure the validity of the test. The surfaces shall be
sufficiently free of foreign matter which can interfere with the validity of the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3
This test shall be carried out by suitable trained operators qualified in accordance with ISO 9712,
ISO 11484 or equivalent and supervised by competent personnel nominated by the manufacturer. In the case
of third-party inspection, this shall be agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The operating authorization issued by the employer shall be according to a written procedure. Non-destructive
testing (NDT) operations shall be authorized by a level 3 NDT individual approved by the employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The definition of levels 1, 2 and 3 can be found in appropriate International Standards, e.g. ISO 9712 and
ISO 11484.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
The tubes shall be tested by using an ultrasonic shear wave technique for the detection of longitudinal
and transverse imperfections. Lamb wave technique may be applied for the detection of longitudinal
imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2
During testing, the tubes and the transducer assembly shall be moved relative to each other such that
the whole of the tube surface is scanned, with coverage calculated on the dimension of the transducer(s). The
relative speed of movement during testing shall not vary by more than  ± 10 %. There can be a short length at
both tube ends which cannot be tested. Any untested ends shall be dealt with in accordance with the
requirements of the appropriate product standard (see Annex B).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3
Unless otherwise agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer, testing shall be carried out in two
opposite directions of sound propagation for the requested type of inspection, clockwise and anticlockwise for
the detection of longitudinal defects and forward and backward for the detection of transversal defects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4
For the detection of longitudinal imperfections, the maximum width of each individual transducer,
measured parallel to the major axis of the tube, shall be 25 mm. For U1 category tubes with an outside
diameter equal to or less than 50 mm, the width of any one transducer unit shall normally be restricted to a
maximum of 12,5 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of use of the Lamb wave technique or phased array technique, the maximum width of transducer
or active aperture, measured parallel to the major axis of the tube, shall be limited to 35 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the detection of transversal imperfections, the maximum width of each individual transducer, measured
perpendicular to the major axis of the tube, shall be 25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5
The ultrasonic test frequency of transducers that shall be used shall be in the range 1 MHz to 15 MHz
for shear wave technique and in the range 0,3 MHz to 1 MHz for Lamb wave technique, depending on the
product condition and properties, the thickness and surface finishing of tubes under examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6
The equipment shall be capable of classifying tubes as either acceptable or suspect, by means of an
automated trigger/alarm level combined with a marking and/or sorting system.<<HEADING_END>>

Reference tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
The reference standards defined in this part of ISO 10893 are convenient standards for calibration of
non-destructive testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards should not be construed as the
minimum size of imperfection detectable by such equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2
For the detection of longitudinal imperfections, the ultrasonic equipment shall be calibrated using
longitudinal reference notches on the outside and inside surfaces of a reference tube.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the detection of transverse imperfections, the ultrasonic equipment shall be calibrated using transverse
reference notches on the outside and inside surfaces of a reference tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For both examination types, when the tube internal diameter is less than 15 mm, the manufacturer and
purchaser may agree to waive the internal notch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For seamless tubes, where the detection of imperfections having other orientations can be requested, relevant
requirements replacing or in addition to those of this part of ISO 10893 shall be specified at the time of enquiry
and order.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3
The reference tubes shall have the same nominal diameter and thickness, same surface finish and
delivery condition (e.g. as-rolled, normalized, quenched and tempered) as the tubes under test, and shall have
similar acoustic properties (e.g. sound velocity and attenuation coefficient).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.4
In order to obtain clearly distinguishable signals, the notches shall be sufficiently separated from the
ends of the reference tubes and from each other.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Types of reference notches<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1
The reference notches shall lie parallel (longitudinal notches) or transverse (transverse notches) to
the major axis of the reference tube.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reference notches shall be of the “N” type (N-notch); the “V” type notch (V-notch) may be used at the
discretion of the manufacturer when the specified notch depth is less than 0,5 mm (see Figure 1). In the case
of “N” type notch, the sides shall be nominally parallel and the bottom shall be nominally square to the sides.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The bottom or the bottom corners of the notch can be rounded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

All conditions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a
The minimum notch depth that may be used is related to specific tube manufacturing methods where the surface
finish plays a dominant role in the minimum notch depth that can be adopted for ultrasonic equipment calibration in
order to achieve an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2.3
The maximum depth of notch for all acceptance levels and subcategories shall be 1,5 mm, except
for tubes with a wall thickness greater than 50 mm, for which it can be increased to 3,0 mm, unless otherwise
agreed on.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2.4
The tolerance on notch depth shall be  ± 15 % of reference notch depth or  ± 0,05 mm, whichever is
the greater, with the exception that when the notch depth is less than 0,3 mm, the tolerance shall be
± 0,03 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.3 Notch length<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified by the product standard or agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer, the
length of the reference notch(es) shall be greater than the width of the single transducer or single virtual
transducer, with the following limitation:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  maximum of 25 mm for cold-drawn, cold pilgered or machined tubes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  maximum of 50 mm for all other conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3.4 Verification of the reference standards<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The reference notch dimensions and shape shall be verified by a suitable technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Equipment calibration and checking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the start of each inspection cycle, the equipment, independently of the applied type of waves, shall be
calibrated to produce consistently clearly identifiable signals from the reference notches used. These signals
shall be used to activate the respective trigger/alarm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Adjustment of trigger/alarm level<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1
Where a single trigger/alarm level is used, the probes shall be adjusted such that the signals from the
internal and external reference notches are equal, as far as possible, and the full signal amplitude of the
lesser of the two signals shall be used to set the trigger/alarm level of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2
Where separate trigger/alarm levels are used for internal and external reference notches, the full
signal amplitude from each notch shall be used to set the relevant trigger/alarm level of the equipment. The
position and width of the gates shall be adjusted in such a way that the entire wall thickness of the tube is
tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.3
When only the external notch is used, the full signal amplitude from the external notch occurring
immediately after the internal gated time period shall be used as the internal notch signal amplitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Calibration check and recalibration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1
The calibration of the equipment shall be dynamically checked at regular intervals during the
production testing of tubes of the same specified diameter, thickness and grade, by passing the reference
tube through the testing installation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency of checking the calibration shall be at least every 4 h, but also whenever there is a testing
installation operator changeover and at the start and end of the production run.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2
During a dynamic check of the calibration, the relative speed of movement between the reference
tube and the probe assembly shall be the same as that used during the production test. Other calibration
conditions may be allowed, provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that the same results as the dynamic
check of the calibration are obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.3
The equipment shall be recalibrated if any of the parameters which were used during the initial
calibration are changed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.4
If, on checking during production testing, the calibration requirements are not satisfied, all tubes
tested since the previous acceptable equipment calibration shall be retested after the equipment has been
recalibrated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8
Acceptance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1
Any tube producing signals lower than the trigger/alarm level shall be deemed to have passed this test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2
Any tube producing signals equal to or greater than the trigger/alarm level shall be designated as
suspect or, at the discretion of the manufacturer, may be retested. If, after two consecutive retests, all signals
are lower than the trigger/alarm level, the tube shall be deemed to have passed this test; otherwise, the tube
shall be designated as suspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.3
For suspect tubes, one or more of the following actions shall be taken, subject to the requirements of
the product standard:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the suspect area shall be dressed or explored by a suitable method. After checking that the remaining
thickness is within tolerance, the tube shall be retested as previously specified. If no signals are obtained
equal to or greater than trigger/alarm level, the tube shall be deemed to have passed this test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The suspect area may be retested by other non-destructive techniques and test methods, by agreement
between the purchaser and manufacturer to agreed acceptance levels;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the suspect area shall be cropped off;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

untested end zones or local suspect areas (or both).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the beam angle in steel used for manual ultrasonic testing with shear waves shall be nominally the same
as that used during the original automated test;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
scanning shall be carried out with sound propagation in both circumferential and/or longitudinal directions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
scanning speed over the tube surface shall not exceed 150 mm/s;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
the type of ultrasonic transducer that shall be used during manual ultrasonic testing with shear waves
shall be of the contact, gap-scan or immersion type. Means shall be provided to ensure that the
transducer is held at the correct distance in relation to the tube surface, e.g. for contact type transducers,
the “wear face” at the front face of the transducer shall be fitted to the curvature of the tube under test;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
the width of the transducer, measured parallel to the major axis of the tube, used in the manual ultrasonic
test shall not exceed that used during the original automated test;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
the nominal frequency of the transducer used in manual testing shall not vary from that used during the
original automated test by more than  ± 1 MHz. Where Lamb waves have been used in the original
automated test, the frequency of shear wave transducers, if used for manual testing, shall be in the range
of 4 MHz to 5 MHz.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
