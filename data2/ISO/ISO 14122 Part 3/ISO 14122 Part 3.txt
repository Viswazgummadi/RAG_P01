Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO
member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical
committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has
the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in
liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 3.
Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting.
Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of member bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this part of ISO 14122 may be the subject of
patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
International Standard 14122-3 was prepared by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) in
collaboration with ISO Technical Committee TC 199, Safety of machinery, in accordance with the Agreement on
technical cooperation between ISO and CEN (Vienna Agreement).
Throughout the text of this standard, read "...this European Standard..." to mean ",..this International Standard...".
ISO 14122 consists of the following parts, under the general title Safety of machinery — Permanent means of
access fo machinery:
— Part 1: Choice of fixed means of access between two levels
— Part 2: Working platforms and walkways
— Part 3: Stairs, stepladders and guard-rails
— Part 4: Fixed ladders
For the purposes of this part of ISO 14122, the CEN annex regarding fulfilment of European Council Directives has
been removed.

Foreword
The text of EN ISO 14122-3:2001 has been prepared by Technical Committee CEN/TC 114 "Safety of machinery",
the secretariat of which is held by DIN, in collaboration with Technical Committee ISO/TC 199 "Safety of
machinery".
This European Standard shall be given the status of a national standard, either by publication of an identical text or
by endorsement, at the latest by October 2001, and conflicting national standards shall be withdrawn at the latest
by October 2001.
This European Standard has been prepared under a mandate given to CEN by the European Commission and the
European Free Trade Association, and supports essential requirements of EU Directive(s).
According to the CEN/CENELEC Internal Regulations, the national standards organizations of the following
countries are bound to implement this European Standard: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland and the United Kingdom.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 14122-3:2001(E) Introduction It is the third part of this document "Safety of machinery - Permanent means of access to machinery”. The parts of the standard are: Part 1: Choice of a fixed means of access between two levels Part 2: Working platforms and walkways Part 3: Stairs, step ladders and guard-rails | Part 4: Fixed ladders. This document is a type B standard as stated in EN 1070. This standard is to be read in conjunction with clause 1.6.2 "Access to operating position and servicing points” and 1.5.15 "Risk of slipping, tripping or falling" of the essential safety requirements expressed in annex A of EN 292-2:1991/A1:1995. See also 6.2.4 "Provision for safe access to machinery” of EN 292-2:1991. The provisions of this document may be supplemented or modified by a type C standard. NOTE 1 For machines which are covered by the scope of a type C standard and which have been designed and built according to the provisions of that standard, the provisions of that type C standard take precedence over the provisions of this ! type B standard. | The purpose of this standard is to define the general requirements for safe access to machines mentioned in | EN 292-2. Part 1 of EN ISO 14122 gives advice about the correct choice of access means when the necessary | access to the machine is not possible directly from the ground level or from a floor. The dimensions specified are consistent with established ergonomic data given in EN 547-3 "Safety of machinery - Human body dimensions — Part 3 : Anthropometric data”. NOTE 2 use of materials other than metals (composite materials, so-called materials, etc.) does not alter the application of the present standard.

1 Scope
This standard applies to all machinery (stationary and mobile) where fixed means of access are necessary.
This standard applies to stairs, step ladders and guard-rails which are a part of a machine.
This standard may also apply to stairs, step ladders and guard-rails to that part of the building where the machine is
installed, providing the main function of that part of the building is to provide a means of access to the machine.
NOTE This standard may be used also for means of access which are outside the scope of this standard. In those cases
the possible relevant national or other regulations should be taken into account.
This standard applies also to stairs, step ladders and guard-rails specific to the machine which are not permanently
fixed to the machine and which may be removed or moved to the side for some operations of the machine
(e.g. changing tools in a large press).
For the significant hazards covered by this standard, see clause 4 of EN ISO 14122 -1.

The materials and dimensions of constituent elements and construction mode used shall meet the safety objectives of this standard. 4.2. The materials used shall be, themselves, by their nature or by a complementary treatment, able to resist corrosion provoked by the surrounding atmosphere. 4.3. Any parts liable to be in contact with the users shall be designed so as not to hurt or hinder (sharp corners, welds with burrs, rough edges, etc.). 4.4 Steps and landings shall offer satisfactory slip resistance to avoid any risk of slipping. 4.5 Opening or closing of moving parts (gates) shall not cause further hazards (for example by shearing or by falling) to users and other persons in the vicinity. 4.6 Fittings, hinges, anchorage points, supports and mountings shall provide sufficient rigidity and stability to the assembly to ensure safety. 4.7 The structure and the steps shall be designed to satisfactorily resist the intended imposed loads. 4.7.1 For the structure the unfactored loads used in the industrial field, may vary from 1,5 kN/m’ for low density pedestrian traffic without load, up to 5 kN/m? for low density pedestrian traffic with load or for high density pedestrian traffic. 4.7.2 Steps shall resist the following unfactored loadings: — if the width w < 1200mm, then shall be distributed over an area of 100 mm x 100 mm where one — if the width w > 1200mm, then respectively shall be distributed simultaneously over each of the th The deflection between the structure and the steps under an unfactored load shall not exceed 1/300 of the span or 6 mm whichever is the lesser. 5 Safety requirements applicable to stairs 5.1.

On the same flight, the rise shall be constant wherever possible.

If it is justified, it may be increased, for example in the case of certain mobile machines.

simultaneously, the width shall be increased to 1000 mm. The width of the stair, when designated as an escape
way shall meet the requirements of appropriate regulations.
NOTE When justified by the risk assessment and restrictions due to the machinery or environment, the free width may be
reduced to no less than 500 mm’ if :
— _ the working platform or stair is used only occasionally, and ;
— the reduction is made only for a short distance.
5.8 The climbing height H of individual flights shall not exceed 3000 mm, otherwise a landing is deemed
necessary before continuing on to another flight. The length of the landing, /, shall be at least 800 mm and in any
case equal to or greater than the width of the stair. Only in the case of a single flight (see 3.1.2) shall the climbing
height not exceed 4000 mm.

handrail and kneerail positioned at the same level as that of the guard-rail that it extends to (for exit section of the
ladder, see prEN ISO 14122-4:1996).
