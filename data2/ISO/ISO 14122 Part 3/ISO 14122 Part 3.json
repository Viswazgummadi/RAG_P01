In those cases\nthe possible relevant national or other regulations should be taken into account.\nThis standard applies also to stairs, step ladders and guard-rails specific to the machine which are not permanently\nfixed to the machine and which may be removed or moved to the side for some operations of the machine\n(e.g. changing tools in a large press).\nFor the significant hazards covered by this standard, see clause 4 of EN ISO 14122 -1.\n2 Normative references\nThe following normative documents contain provisions which, through reference in this text, constitute provisions of\nthis part of ISO 14122.
