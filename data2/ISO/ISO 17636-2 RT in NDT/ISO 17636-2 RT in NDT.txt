<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies fundamental techniques of radiography with the object of enabling
satisfactory and repeatable results to be obtained economically. The techniques are based on generally
recognized practice and fundamental theory of the subject, inspection of fusion welded joints with digital
radiographic detectors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Digital detectors provide a digital grey value image which can be viewed and evaluated with a computer only.
The practice describes the recommended procedure for detector selection and radiographic practice.
Selection of computer, software, monitor, printer and viewing conditions are important but are not the main
focus of this part of ISO 17636.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedure specified in this part of ISO 17636 provides the minimum requirements and practice which
permits exposure and acquisition of digital radiographs with equivalent sensitivity for detection of
imperfections as film radiography, specified in ISO 17636-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 17636 specifies fundamental techniques of digital radiography with the object of enabling
satisfactory and repeatable results to be obtained economically. The techniques are based on generally
recognized practice and fundamental theory of the subject.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 17636 applies to the digital radiographic examination of fusion welded joints in metallic
materials. It applies to the joints of plates and pipes. Besides its conventional meaning, “pipe”, as used in this
International Standard, covers other cylindrical bodies such as tubes, penstocks, boiler drums, and pressure
vessels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This part of ISO 17636 complies with EN 14784-2. [6]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 17636 specifies the requirements for digital radiographic X- and gamma-ray testing by either
computed radiography (CR) or radiography with digital detector arrays (DDA) of the welded joints of metallic
plates and tubes for the detection of imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Digital detectors provide a digital grey value (GV) image which can be viewed and evaluated using a computer.
This part of ISO 17636 specifies the recommended procedure for detector selection and radiographic practice.
Selection of computer, software, monitor, printer and viewing conditions are important, but are not the main
focus of this part of ISO 17636. The procedure specified in this part of ISO 17636 provides the minimum
requirements for radiographic practice which permit exposure and acquisition of digital radiographs with
equivalent sensitivity for detection of imperfections as film radiography, as specified in ISO 17636-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 17636 does not specify acceptance levels for any of the indications found on the digital
radiographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If contracting parties apply lower test criteria, it is possible that the quality achieved is significantly lower than
when this part of ISO 17636 is strictly applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Terms and definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in ISO 5576 and the following apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.1
computed radiography
CR
storage phosphor imaging plate system
complete system comprising a storage phosphor imaging plate (IP) and a corresponding read-out unit
(scanner or reader), which converts the information from the IP into a digital image<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.2
storage phosphor imaging plate
IP
photostimulable luminescent material capable of storing a latent radiographic image of a material being
examined and, upon stimulation by a source of red light of appropriate wavelength, generates luminescence
proportional to radiation absorbed<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
When performing computed radiography, an IP is used in lieu of a film. When establishing techniques related
to source size or focal geometries, the IP is referred to as a detector, i.e. source-to-detector distance (SDD).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3.3
digital detector array system
DDA system
electronic device converting ionizing or penetrating radiation into a discrete array of analogue signals which
are subsequently digitized and transferred to a computer for display as a digital image corresponding to the
radiologic energy pattern imparted upon the input region of the device<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4
structure noise of imaging plate
structure noise of IP
structure   due to inhomogeneities in the sensitive layer (graininess) and surface of an imaging plate<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
After scanning of the exposed imaging plate, the inhomogeneities appear as overlaid fixed pattern noise in the
digital image.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
This noise limits the maximum achievable image quality of digital CR images and can be compared with the
graininess in film images.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>3.5
structure noise of digital detector array
structure noise of DDA
structure   due to different properties of detector elements (pixels)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
After read-out of the exposed uncalibrated DDA, the inhomogeneities of the DDA appear as overlaid fixed
pattern noise in the digital image. Therefore, all DDAs require, after read-out, a software based calibration (software and
guidelines are provided by the manufacturer). A suitable calibration procedure reduces the structure noise.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.6
grey value
GV
numeric value of a pixel in a digital image<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This is typically interchangeable with the terms pixel value, detector response, analogue-to-digital unit, and
detector signal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.7
linearized grey value
GV lin
numeric value of a pixel which is directly proportional to the detector exposure dose, having a value of zero if
the detector was not exposed<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This is typically interchangeable with the terms linearized pixel value, and linearized detector signal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.8

<<PARAGRAPH>>detector
b
SR
corresponds to half of the measured detector unsharpness in a digital image and corresponds to the effective
pixel size and indicates the smallest geometrical detail, which can be resolved with a digital detector at
magnification equal to one<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
For this measurement, the duplex wire IQI is placed directly on the digital detector array or imaging plate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
The measurement of unsharpness is described in ISO 19232-5, see also ASTM E2736 [13]  and
ASTM E1000. [8]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The contrast-to-noise ratio describes a component of image quality and depends approximately on the product
of radiographic attenuation coefficient and SNR. In addition to adequate CNR, it is also necessary for a digital radiograph
to possess adequate unsharpness or basic spatial resolution to resolve desired features of interest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Classification of radiographic techniques and compensation principles<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Classification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The radiographic techniques are divided into two classes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  Class A: basic techniques;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  Class B: improved techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Class B techniques are used when class A might be insufficiently sensitive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Better techniques compared to class B are possible and may be agreed between the contracting parties by
specification of all appropriate test parameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The choice of digital radiographic technique shall be agreed between the contracting parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nevertheless, the visibility of flaws using film radiography or digital radiography is equivalent when using class
A and class B techniques, respectively. The visibility shall be proven by the use of IQIs according to
ISO 19232-1 or ISO 19232-2 and ISO 19232-5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If, for technical reasons, it is not possible to meet one of the conditions specified for class B, such as the type
of radiation source or the source-to-object distance,  f , it may be agreed between the contracting parties that<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 17636-2:2013(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the condition selected may be that specified for class A. The loss of sensitivity shall be compensated by an
increase of minimum grey value and SNR N  for CR or SNR N  for the DDA-technique (recommended increase of
SNR N  by a factor >1,4). Because of the better sensitivity compared to class A, the test specimen may be
regarded as being examined to class B, if the correct IQI sensitivity is achieved. This does not apply if the
special SDD reduction as described in 7.6 for test arrangements 7.1.4 and 7.1.5 are used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Compensation principles, CP I, CP II or CP III<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1
General . Three rules (see 5.2.2 to 5.2.4) are applied in this part of ISO 17636 for radiography with
digital detectors to achieve a sufficient contrast sensitivity.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Application of these rules requires the achievement of a minimum contrast-to-noise ratio, CNR N , normalized to
the detector basic spatial resolution per detectable material thickness difference   w . If the required normalized
contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR N  per   w ) cannot be achieved due to an insufficient value of one of the following
parameters, this can be compensated by an increase in the SNR.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2
CP I . Compensation for reduced contrast (e.g. by increased tube voltage) by increased SNR (e.g. by
increased tube current or exposure time).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2.3
CP II . Compensation for insufficient detector sharpness (the value of SR b  higher than specified) by
increased SNR (increase in the single IQI wire or step hole value for each missing duplex wire pair value).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4
CP III . Compensation for increased local interpolation unsharpness, due to bad pixel correction for
DDAs, by increased SNR.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.5

General preparations and requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Protection against ionizing radiation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>WARNING — Exposure of any part of the human body to X-rays or gamma-rays can be highly
injurious to health. Wherever X-ray equipment or radioactive sources are in use, appropriate legal
requirements shall be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Local or national or international safety precautions when using ionizing radiation shall be strictly applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Surface preparation and stage of manufacture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, surface preparation is not necessary, but where surface imperfections or coatings can cause
difficulty in detecting defects, the surface shall be ground smooth or the coatings shall be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified, digital radiography shall be carried out after the final stage of manufacture, e.g.
after grinding or heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Location of the weld in the radiograph<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the digital radiograph does not show the weld, high density markers shall be placed on either side of
the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Identification of radiographs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Symbols shall be affixed to each section of the object being digitally radiographed. The images of these
symbols shall appear in the digital radiograph outside the region of interest where possible and shall ensure
unambiguous identification of the section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5 Marking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Permanent markings on the object to be examined shall be made in order to accurately locate the position of
each digital radiograph (e.g. zero point, direction, identification, measure).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the nature of the material and/or its service conditions do not permit permanent marking, the location
may be recorded by means of accurate sketches or photographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6 Overlap of digital images<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When digitally radiographing an area with two or more separate detectors (imaging plates), they shall overlap
sufficiently to ensure that the complete region of interest is digitally radiographed. This shall be verified by a
high density marker on the surface of the object which is to appear on each digital image. If the radiographs
are taken sequentially, the high density marker shall be visible on each of the radiographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7 Types and positions of image quality indicators<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality of image shall be verified by use of image quality indicators (IQIs) in accordance with ISO 19232-5
and ISO 19232-1 or ISO 19232-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Following the procedure outlined in Annex C, a reference image is required for the verification of the basic
spatial resolution of the digital detector system. The basic spatial resolution or duplex wire value shall be
determined to verify whether the system hardware meets the requirements specified as a function of the
penetrated material thickness in Tables B.13 and B.14. In this case, the duplex wire IQI shall be positioned
directly on the digital detector. The use of a duplex wire IQI (ISO 19232-5) for production radiographs is not
compulsory. The requirement for using a duplex wire IQI additionally to a single wire IQI for production
radiographs may be part of the agreement between the contracting parties. For use on production radiographs,
the duplex wire IQI shall be positioned on the object. The measured basic spatial resolution of the digital<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>image
b
SR<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>image (
) (see Annex C), shall not exceed the maximum values specified as a function of the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>penetrated material thickness (Tables B.13 or B.14). For single image inspection, the single wall thickness is
taken as the penetrated material thickness. For double wall double image inspection (Figures 11 or 12), with
the duplex wire on the source side of the pipe, the penetrated material thickness is taken as the pipe diameter<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>image

SR<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>spatial resolution of the detector (
) for double wall double image inspection shall correspond to the
values of Tables B.13 and B.14 chosen on the basis of twice the nominal single wall thickness as the
penetrated material thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the geometric magnification technique (see 7.7) is applied with  v     1,2, then the duplex wire IQI (ISO 19232-
5) shall be used on all production radiographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The duplex wire IQI shall be positioned tilted by a few degrees (2° to 5°) to the digital rows or columns of the
digital image. If the IQI is positioned at 45° to the digital lines or rows the obtained IQI number shall be
reduced by one.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The contrast sensitivity of digital images shall be verified by use of IQIs, in accordance with the specific
application as given in Tables B.1 to B.12 (see also ISO 19232-1 or ISO 19232-2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The single wire or step hole IQIs used shall be placed preferably on the source side of the test object at the
centre of the area of interest on the parent metal beside the weld. The IQI shall be in close contact with the
surface of the object. Its location shall be in a section of uniform thickness characterized by a uniform grey
value (mean) in the digital image.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>According to the IQI type used, cases a) and b) shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
When using a single wire IQI, the wires shall be directed perpendicular to the weld and its location shall
ensure that at least 10 mm of the wire length shows in a section of uniform grey value or SNR N , which is
normally in the parent metal adjacent to the weld. For exposures in accordance with 7.1.6 and 7.1.7, the
IQI can be placed with the wires across the pipe axis and they should not be projected into the image of
the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
When using a step hole IQI, it shall be placed in such a way that the hole number required is placed close
to the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For exposures in accordance with 7.1.6 and 7.1.7, the IQI type used can be placed either on the source or on
the detector side. If the IQIs cannot be placed in accordance with the above conditions, the IQIs are placed on
the detector side and the image quality shall be determined at least once from comparison exposure with one
IQI placed at the source side and one at the detector side under the same conditions. If filters are used in front
of the detector, the IQI shall be placed in front of the filter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For double wall exposures, when the IQI is placed on the detector side, the above test is not necessary. In this
case, refer to the correspondence tables (Tables B.9 to B.14).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the IQIs are placed on the detector side, the letter F shall be placed near the IQI and it shall be stated
in the test report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The identification numbers and, when used, the lead letter F, shall not be in the area of interest, except when
geometric configuration makes it impractical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If steps have been taken to guarantee that digital radiographs of similar test objects and regions are produced
with identical exposure and processing techniques, and no differences in the image quality value are likely,
the image quality need not be verified for every digital radiograph. The extent of image quality verification
should be subject to agreement between the contracting parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For exposures of pipes with diameter 200 mm and above with the source centrally located at least three IQIs
should be placed equally spaced at the circumference. The IQI images are then considered representative for
the whole circumference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.8 Minimum image quality values<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tables B.1 to B.14 show the minimum quality values for metallic materials. For other materials these
requirements or corresponding requirements may be agreed upon by contracting parties. The requirements
shall be determined in accordance with ISO 19232-4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case where Ir 192 or Se 75 sources are used, IQI values worse than the ones listed in Tables B.1 to
B.12 may be accepted by agreement of contracting parties as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally digital radiographic techniques in accordance with 7.1.2 to 7.1.9 shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The elliptical technique (double wall and double image) in accordance with Figure 11 should not be used for
external diameter  D e  > 100 mm or wall thickness  t  > 8 mm or weld width > D e  / 4. Two 90° displaced images
are sufficient if  t  /  D e  < 0,12, otherwise three images are needed. The distance between the two projected
weld images shall be about one weld width.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When it is difficult to carry out an elliptical examination for  D e     100 mm, the perpendicular technique in
accordance with 7.1.7 may be used (see Figure 12). In this case, three exposures 120 ° or 60 ° apart are
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For test arrangements in accordance with Figures 11, 13, and 14, the inclination of the beam shall be kept as
small as possible and be such as to prevent superimposition of the two images. The source-to-object distance,
f ,  shall be kept as small as possible for the technique shown in Figure 13, in accordance with 7.6. The IQI
shall be placed close to the detector with a lead letter F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other digital radiographic techniques may be agreed by the contracting parties when it is useful, e.g. for
reasons such as the geometry of the piece or differences in material thickness. In 7.1.9, an example of such a
case is presented. Additionally, thickness compensation with the same material may be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
In Annex A the minimum number of digital radiographs necessary is given in order to obtain an acceptable
radiographic coverage of the total circumference of a butt weld in pipe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.2.2 Other radiation sources<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The recommended penetrated thickness ranges for gamma-ray sources and X-ray equipment above 1 MeV
are given in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On thin steel specimens, gamma-rays from Se 75, Ir 192 and Co 60 sources do not produce digital
radiographs having as good a defect detection sensitivity as X-rays used with appropriate technique
parameters. However, because of the advantages of gamma-ray sources in handling and accessibility,
Table 2 gives a range of thicknesses for which each of these gamma-ray sources may be used when the use
of X-ray tubes is difficult.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>By agreement between the contracting parties, the penetrated material thickness may be further reduced to
10 mm for Ir 192 and 5 mm for Se 75.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For certain applications, wider material thickness ranges may be permitted, if sufficient image quality can be
achieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where digital radiographs are produced by CR using gamma-rays, the total travel time to and from
the source position shall not exceed 10 % of the total exposure time. Using DDAs, the capture time shall start
after the source is in position and shall end before the source is moved back.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

values (CR only) shall be achieved. Annex D describes the procedure for measurement of SNR N  and provides
a conversion table for users who prefer to use unnormalized measured SNR values instead of normalized
SNR N  values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Equivalent minimum grey values for CR may be used instead of minimum SNR N  values if they are determined
by means of the procedure of Annex D for the IP used, the scanner used and its settings and the required
SNR N  of Tables 3 and 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The SNR N  value shall be measured beside the weld near the wire or step hole IQIs in the thicker part of the
parent material in a zone of homogeneous wall thickness and grey values. The grey values in CR (only) shall
be measured in the region of interest in the weldment near the wire or step hole IQI. Since the roughness of
the material influences image noise and SNR N , the values in Table 3 are recommended values only. The
minimum SNR N  values shall be increased by a factor of 1,4 in comparison to Tables 3 and 4 if the SNR N
measurement is performed adjacent to the weld in the heat-affected zone, except if the weld cap and root are
flush with the parent material.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
In film radiography, the optical density is typically between 3,5 and 4 if measured in the heat-affected zone
(HAZ)/parent material. This corresponds to a higher SNR N  by about 1,4 in comparison to the centre of the weld, which
should have an optical density of 2 or higher. It is highly recommended that the SNR N  be measured in the heat-affected
zone, because this is typically an area of constant grey level and enables accurate measurements of the SNR N .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex D describes the method for determination of equivalent minimum grey values (for CR only) in lieu of the
required SNR N .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex D also provides a conversion table for users who prefer the measurement of unnormalized SNR
instead of SNR N . The minimum unnormalized SNR is determined from the SR b  of the detector and the
required SNR N  values in Tables 3 and 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The user shall define minimum grey values or SNR N  or SNR values for CR (see Annex D) for acceptance of
digital images. The user shall define minimum SNR N  or SNR values (see Annex D) for radiography with DDAs
for acceptance of digital images in analogy to the minimum optical density for film radiography. If no special
values are defined, the values of Tables 3 and 4 shall be achieved. The minimum SNR N  values are given in
Tables 3 and 4 for different radiation sources and material thicknesses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
For details of SNR N  measurement, see ISO 16371-1, ASTM E 2446 [10]  (for CR) or ASTM E2597 [11]  (for DDA)
and Annex D.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.2 Compensation principle II<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If both IQI sensitivities (contrast sensitivity by single IQI wires or step holes on the one hand and spatial
resolution of the detector by duplex wire IQIs on the other) of Table B.1 to Table B.14 cannot be achieved by
the detector system and exposure conditions used, an increase in single IQI wire visibility or step hole visibility
shall compensate for the exceeded unsharpness values (or exceeded SR b  values).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For example, if the required values of D12 and W16 (for 5 mm thickness, class B — Tables B.3 and B.14) are
not achieved at the same time for a specific detector set-up, then the values D11 and W17 provide an
equivalent detection sensitivity. The compensation shall be limited to a maximum increase of two single wires
for two missing resolved duplex wire pairs. If the required flaw sensitivity can be demonstrated for the specific
application, by agreement between the contracting parties, the compensation may be extended to a maximum
of three single wires for three missing resolved duplex wire pairs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For digital detectors (DDA), the contrast sensitivity depends on the used integration time and tube current
(milliampères) for acquisition of the radiographic images for a given distance and tube voltage, so the single
wire or step hole IQI visibility can be increased by increased exposure time and/or tube current setting. This
applies also for CR, but with a limitation due to the maximum achievable SNR N  due to the structure noise of
the sensitive PSL layer of imaging plates. The maximum achievable SNR N  for DDA radiography is limited by
the quality of the calibration procedure.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The SR b  of the detector is fixed by design and hardware parameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the magnification technique is used, the SR b  shall be taken from the magnified image (SR b  of the image)
and the duplex wire IQI measurement with the duplex wire IQI on the object (see 7.7).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.3.3 Metal screens for IPs and shielding<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using metal front screens, good contact between the sensitive detector layer and screens is required.
This may be achieved either by using vacuum-packed IPs or by applying pressure. Lead screens not in
intimate contact with the IPs may contribute to image unsharpness. The intensification obtained by use of lead
screens in contact with imaging plates is significantly smaller than in film radiography.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many IPs are very sensitive to low energy backscatter and X-ray fluorescence of back-shielding from lead.
This effect contributes significantly to edge unsharpness and reduced CNR, and should be minimized. It is
recommended that steel or copper shielding be used directly behind the IPs. Also a steel or copper shielding
between a backscatter lead plate and the IP may improve the image quality. Modern cassette and detector
designs may consider this effect and can be constructed in a way such that additional steel or copper
shielding outside the cassette is not required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Due to the protection layer between the lead and the sensitive layer of an IP, the effect of intensification by
electrons is considerably reduced and appears at higher energies. Depending on the radiation energy and protection layer
design, the effect of intensification amounts to between 20 % and 100 % only (compared to no screen) at typical X-ray
energies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The small intensification effect generated by a lead screen in contact with an IP can be compensated for by
increased exposure time or milliampère   minutes, if no lead screens are used. Since lead screens in contact
with IPs may generate scratches on IPs, if not carefully separated for the scan process, lead screens should
be used for intermediate filtering of scattered radiation outside of cassettes. No intermediate filtering is
recommended for inspecting steel specimen having a thickness < 12 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tables 3 and 4 show the recommended screen materials and thicknesses for different radiation sources.
Other screen thicknesses may be also agreed between the contracting parties provided the required image
quality is achieved. The usage of metal screens is recommended in front of IPs, and they may also reduce the
influence of scattered radiation when used with DDAs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4 Alignment of beam<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The beam of radiation shall be directed to the centre of the area being examined and should be perpendicular
to the object surface at that point, except when it can be demonstrated that certain imperfections are best
revealed by a different alignment of the beam. In this case, an appropriate alignment of the beam can be
permitted. Other ways of digital radiographing may be agreed between the contracting parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EXAMPLE
For better detection of lack of side wall fusion, the beam direction should be aligned with the weld
preparation angles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 Reduction of scattered radiation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.1 Metal filters and collimators<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to reduce the effect of scattered radiation, direct radiation shall be collimated as much as possible to
the section under examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With Se 75, Ir 192, and Co 60 radiation sources or X-ray sources above 1 MW, or in the case of edge scatter,
a sheet of lead can be used as a filter of low energy scattered radiation between the object and the cassette
or DDA. The thickness of this sheet is 0,5 mm to 2 mm in accordance with the penetrated thickness. Other
materials than lead, e.g. tin, copper or steel, can also be used as a filter. A thin steel or copper screen should
be positioned between the lead sheet and the detector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If necessary, the detector shall be shielded from backscattered radiation by a sheet of lead of at least 1 mm
thickness or a sheet of tin of at least 1,5 mm thickness, placed behind the detector. An additional shielding of
steel or copper (about 0,5 mm thickness) shall be applied between the lead shield and the detector to reduce

<<PARAGRAPH>>Therefore, it is recommended that the distance  f min  be increased to compensate for any additional

than required by Formula (6) or (7) or the IQI visibility as defined in Tables B.1 to B. 12 is achieved by
increased SNR (CP II).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tables B.13 and B.14 provide the maximum total image unsharpness values and SR b  requirements for

<<PARAGRAPH>>When the source is outside the object and the detector is on the other side (technique described in 7.1.8 as
double wall penetration and single image) the minimum source-to-object distance is determined only by the

<<PARAGRAPH>>Where possible it is preferable to avoid usage of a double wall technique (see 7.1.6 to 7.1.8) by placing the
radiation source inside the object to be radiographed, to achieve a more suitable direction of examination (see
7.1.4 and 7.1.5). The reduction in minimum source-to-object distance should not be greater than 20 %.When
the source is located centrally inside the object and the detector outside (technique shown in 7.1.4) and
provided that the IQI requirements are met, this percentage may be increased. However, the reduction in
minimum source-to-object distance shall not be greater than 50 %. A further reduction can be agreed by the
contracting parties provided that the IQI requirements are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7 Geometric magnification technique<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An obstacle to the application of CR and DDA systems for weld radiography is the large (≥50 µm) pixel size of
most digital detector arrays and most IP–scanner systems compared with the small grain size in film (which
leads to film having very high spatial resolution). This difficulty can be circumvented by taking advantage of
the unique property of DDAs to increase the SNR N  (CP II) in the image and/or the geometric magnification if
needed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Geometric magnification is different from digital magnification (zoom) of displayed images. Only geometric
magnification provides a reduction in image unsharpness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the required IQI-sensitivity (proven by single wire or step hole IQI) and SR b  (proven by duplex wire IQI, see
also Annex C) do not meet the requirements given in the appropriate Tables B.1 to B.14, one option is to
increase the image signal to noise ratio (see 7.3.2, CP II).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Another option is the application of the geometric magnification technique with increased distance between
the IP or DDA and the object combined with usage of an X-ray tube with a small focal spot or a gamma-ray
source with small source size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Finally, after employing both methods, if the required IQI values are still not visible, that CR system or the
DDA cannot be used for that examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The correct selection of magnification shall be proven by usage of the duplex wire IQI on the object in all
production radiographs. The duplex wire IQI shall be positioned on the side of the object nearer to the detector,
if 2SR b      d  (source or focal spot size  d ). Otherwise, the duplex wire IQI shall be positioned on the source side
of the object. It is recommended that duplex wire IQIs are positioned on both sides of the object for selection
of the magnification value, but only one needs to be seen in the final production radiographs after selection of
the correct magnification factor and source size or focal spot size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>IQIs may disturb digital images if automated defect recognition is applied. If no IQIs are used for a series of
production radiographs, the image quality shall be proven periodically by reference images with wire IQIs or
step hole IQIs and duplex IQIs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The image unsharpness  u Im  can be estimated from the magnification  v , the geometric unsharpness  u G  and the

<<PARAGRAPH>>u Im
is the required maximum image unsharpness in accordance with Table B.13 or Table B.14 for

<<PARAGRAPH>>The magnification shall be increased and/or the focal spot size shall be decreased to reduce the image
unsharpness so that it is less than or equal to the appropriate value specified in Tables B.13 or B.14. This
shall be proven by a duplex wire IQI positioned on the object, as described in the preceding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The magnification factor is typically different for the source and the detector sides of the object. Therefore, the
magnification  v  should be selected for the object centre. The variation of the magnification value between the
source side and the detector side should be within ±25 %. Smaller magnification values may be chosen if the
CP II as described in 7.3.2 is used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8 Maximum area for a single exposure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The number of digital radiographs for a complete examination of flat welds (see Figures 1, 15, 17, and 18) and
of curved welds with the radiation source arranged off-centre (see Figures 2 to 4 and 8 to 16) should be
specified in accordance with technical requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ratio of the penetrated thickness at the outer edge of an evaluated area of uniform thickness to that at the
centre beam shall not be more than 1,1 for class B and 1,2 for class A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The SNR N  values resulting from any variation of penetrated thickness should not be lower than those
indicated in Table 3 or 4. Alternatively, GVs may be used for CR as shown in Annex D.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The size of the area to be examined includes the weld and the heat-affected zones. In general, about 10 mm
of parent metal shall be examined on each side of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommendations for the number of digital radiographs are indicated in Annex A which gives an acceptable
examination of a circumferential butt weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9 Processing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.1 Scan and read-out of image<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Detectors or scanners are to be used in accordance with the conditions recommended by the detector or
scanner manufacturer to obtain the selected image quality. The digital radiographs should be free from
artefacts due to processing and handling or other causes which would interfere with interpretation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.2 Calibration of DDAs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If using DDAs, the detector calibration procedure, as recommended by the manufacturer, shall be applied.
The detector shall be calibrated with a background image (without radiation) and at least with one gain image
(X-rays on and homogeneously exposed). Multi-gain calibration will increase the achievable SNR N  and
linearity but takes more time. To minimize the noise due to calibration, all calibration images shall be taken
with an exposure dose (milliampère minutes or gigabecquerel minutes) at least twice as large as the dose
used for the inspection radiographs. Calibrated images should be treated as original images for quality
assurance if the procedure has been documented. The calibration shall be performed periodically and if the
exposure conditions change significantly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.3 Bad pixel interpolation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bad pixels are underperforming detector elements of DDAs. They are described in ASTM E2597. [11]<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If using DDAs, the detector shall be mapped to determine the bad pixel map in accordance with the
manufacturer guideline. This bad pixel map shall be documented. Bad pixel interpolation is acceptable and an
essential procedure for radiography with DDAs. It is recommended that only DDAs having no cluster kernel
pixels (CKP) in the region of interest (ROI) be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>DDAs without CKPs and CR shall be applied for inspection, which have a basic spatial resolution (SR b ) of the
detector less than or equal to that required in Table B.13 or B.14. If the magnification technique is used, then
the
shall be determined from the measured image as described in Annex C but with the duplex IQI
directly on the test object (see 7.7). This SR b  value shall be less than or equal to the values given in Table
B.13 or B.14. If the detector or image SR b  is higher than specified in Table B.13 or B.14, the CP II, as
described in 7.2.3, may then be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

the required
SNR N  shall be increased significantly. The inspection shall be performed on the basis of an agreement
between the contracting parties. The specified increase in SNR N  may compensate for locally increased
unsharpness due to bad pixel interpolation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The evaluation for bad pixels shall be performed periodically.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
By analogy to the CP II the increased SNR N  also compensates also for the local unsharpness caused by bad
pixel interpolation. This is considered as CP III.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9.4 Image processing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.9.4.1  The digital data of the radiographic detector shall be evaluated with linearized grey value
representation which is directly proportional to the radiation dose for determination of SNR, SR b  and SNR N .
For optimal image display, contrast and brightness should be interactively adjustable. Optional filter functions,
profile plots and an SNR, SNR N  tool should be integrated into the software for image display and evaluation.
For critical image analysis the operator shall interpret the image with a zoom factor between 1:1 (meaning 1
pixel of the digital radiograph is presented by one monitor pixel) and 1:2 (meaning 1 pixel of the digital
radiograph is presented by four monitor pixels).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.9.4.2  Further means of image processing applied on the stored raw data (e.g. high pass filtering for image
display) shall be documented, be repeatable and be agreed between the contracting parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.9.4.3  If further image processing (e.g. high pass filtering) is used when evaluating single wire or step hole
IQI values, then the same filter parameters shall be used for both weld evaluation and IQI value determination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.10 Monitor viewing conditions and storage of digital radiographs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The digital radiographs shall be examined in a darkened room. The monitor setup shall be verified with a

<<PARAGRAPH>>Linearized grey levels are the precondition for the measurement of correct basic spatial resolution values. This
means the grey values need to be proportional to the radiation exposure at a given location of the image. This
is typically supported by the manufacturer's software.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The duplex wire IQI shall be positioned directly on the detector surface or cassette surface and shall be read
in accordance with ISO 19232-5 for determination of the detector basic spatial resolution SR b .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If the duplex wire IQI is positioned on a test object, instead of directly on the detector, a measurement of the
image basic spatial resolution
is then obtained, not the detector basic spatial resolution SR b

<<PARAGRAPH>>If the first unsharp wire pair cannot be recognized clearly (see ISO 19232-5), the 20 % dip method shall be
applied as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>On the digital radiograph, the first wire pair giving a modulation (dip) of less than 20 % in relation to the double
peak size (see Figure C.1) shall be documented as result of the IQI test [e.g. D8 as shown in Figure C.1 c)]. A
profile function of the image-processing software shall be used to recognize the first wire pair with a dip of less
than 20 % [when averaged over both minima — see Figure C.1 d)]. The profile shall also be averaged [see
Figure C.1 b) and c)] over at least 21 single line profiles to improve the SNR in the profile plot.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>By usage of the duplex wire IQI, conforming to ISO 19232-5, the inherent image unsharpness  u i  shall be
determined and the basic spatial resolution SR b  of the detector shall be calculated with:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>D.1 Determination of SNR N  from SNR measured<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedure for measurement of the signal-to-noise ratio is specified in ISO 16371-1:2011, 6.1, in detail.
The measured signal to noise ratio, SNR measured , is typically determined in a window of 20    55 pixels (called
the region of interest) as the ratio of the linearized mean grey value to its standard deviation as specified in
ISO 16371-1:2011, 6.1.1. The linearized grey value is directly proportional to the dose of radiation at the
measured region of interest (ROI) and it is zero for unexposed areas. This mode shall be selected for SNR N
measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The window for the SNR measurement should be limited in width to 20 pixels. The length can be   55 pixel.
Larger length increases the accuracy of the SNR measurement. This applies especially if the median of the line SNR
values is considered in the software tool as specified in ISO 16371-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For similar radiation exposures, unsharp digital systems achieve a higher measured SNR than sharp ones,
but have lower performance for detection of fine flaws than sharp systems. Therefore, the measured SNR is
normalized by the basic spatial resolution. Systems with same normalized basic spatial resolution have similar
visualization performance for fine details.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The normalization is based on the basic spatial resolution value of the CR system (SR b ) as provided by the
manufacturer or determined by the user by the procedure specified in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All SNR N  values are normalized as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The SNR N  value is typically provided by the manufacturer's software, if the basic spatial resolution has been
entered in the software tool and a ROI is marked for measurement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A new qualification of the CR system by measurement of the basic spatial resolution, SR b , is required if any
scanner parameters, such as pixel resolution, scan speed and/or the imaging plate type, have been changed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table D.1 provides SNR N  values and the conversion to unnormalized SNR values for CR systems with
different SR b  performance. If the manufacturer's software does not provide SNR N  values, the user can
determine the converted SNR values for usage instead of the SNR N  values from Table D.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>D.2 Determination of minimum grey values<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When performing a CR inspection of objects of inhomogeneous thickness, it may be preferable to specify
minimum grey levels instead of minimum SNR N  values, because SNR N  measurements need a zone of
homogeneous grey level distribution in the digital image. It also may simplify the usage of different image-
processing software.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Linearized grey levels are the precondition for the measurement of correct SNR N  values and equivalent grey
values. This means the grey values need to be directly proportional (no offset) to the radiation exposure at a
given location of the scanned imaging plate. This is typically supported by the manufacturer’s software.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The dependence of image SNR N  on the grey mean value can be exploited using the CR technology, if no
image processing has been performed and the CR system provides linearized grey levels. The relationship
between grey levels and SNR N  can be used for a given set of scanner type and scanner parameters and the
same type and brand of imaging plates only. Changing any scanner settings such as pixel size, scan speed,
photomultiplier voltage or gain requires a new determination of the minimum grey value equivalent to the
required SNR N .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For CR, the correlation between SNR N  and mean grey value is widely independent of the kilovolt and
milliampère settings above 50 kV to a few megavolt X-ray tube voltage and also for gamma-ray sources. This does not
apply to DDAs. A qualification of minimum grey values, being equivalent to minimum SNR N  values can be used with any
of the exposure conditions as specified in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To determine a minimum grey value as being equivalent to a minimum SNR N  value of Table 3 or 4, the
procedure can be applied as specified in a) to d).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Perform an exposure of a step wedge as specified in Figure D.1. The use of a step wedge with large area<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>steps is recommended to avoid shading effects. The step wedge should cover the complete digital image
of the detector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) Measure in each step the mean grey value and the SNR N  as shown in Figure D.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) Plot in a graph the measured SNR N  (or SNR) as a function of the mean grey value (see Figure D.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Determine the equivalent minimum grey value for the minimum SNR N  which is required for the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>specification in accordance with Table 3 or Table 4. Table D.2 shows an example.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The resulting grey value can be taken for determination of the minimum CR grey value GV min  equivalent to
the minimum optical film density in film radiography (see Figure D.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively to the procedure above, the IP can be exposed sequentially with different exposures
(milliampère minutes)  (X-ray sources) or exposure times (gamma-ray sources). The exposures should be
taken under the same conditions as described in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Additional screens or plates of steel or aluminium shall be used in front of the IP cassette or IP envelope, if
this is applied for the production radiographs. The minimum grey values GV min  shall be determined from the
digital radiographs in equivalence to the achieved and required SNR N  or SNR (see Figure D.3) as specified in
Table D.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>No SNR or SNR N  values need to be measured in the production radiographs, if the specified minimum grey
value GV min  is achieved everywhere in the region of interest in a production radiograph.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recommended that a diagram is plotted as shown in Figure D.3 for better accuracy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Grey values, general remarks<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.1 Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In computed radiography, grey values may be used to render visual perceptions (visibility) as function of
image contrast and noise (SNR or grey value is used in lieu of optical density and film system class in film
radiography); thus, linear original grey values are used to measure the quantity of radiation penetrating a
particular area of a part. With this relationship, a grey value of “0” corresponds to “0” radiation dose (white in a
negative presentation as in film radiography) whereas a grey value of “4095” corresponds to a saturated
detector (black in a negative presentation as in film radiography) for a 12 bit CR system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>grey value and SNR N  measurements shall be performed using qualified software tools that determine average
grey value (mean value) within an ROI and/or SNR N  which is the ratio of the average grey value to the
standard deviation of the grey values within the ROI. The minimum image area of the ROI shall contain
1 100 pixels (i.e. 20    55 pixels, see ISO 16371-1) for quantitative measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Measured grey values of imaging plates are exactly proportional to the exposure dose for a given radiation
quality. The internal (electronic) gain setting of the scanner and the photomultiplier properties as well as the analogue-to-
digital converter properties (e.g. number of bits) determine the proportionality factor between dose and grey value. Any
changes of these parameters require a new qualification of the minimum grey values as determined in Annex D. Some
systems provide grey values in a logarithmic or square root characteristic or normalized values with unknown zero value.
These values shall be linearized and related to the real zero value (corresponding to zero exposure dose), otherwise the
grey values shall not be treated as equivalent to the optical density of films and cannot be used for SNR or CNR
measurements. grey values and SNR N  values shall be determined before any digital filtering of the digital radiograph.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>E.2 Noise control<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Computed radiographic images become “noisy”, when exposed under suboptimal conditions. Excessive CR
image noise (low SNR N  or CNR) can become a significant obstacle to the achievement of image quality
requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Suboptimal conditions to avoid include a) to f).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) Low exposure doses from X-ray or gamma-ray sources yield low CNRs. The CNR increases nonlinearly<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>with increasing exposure (milliampère seconds or gigabecquerel minutes) up to the maximum achievable
value due to the structure noise (fixed pattern noise) of real detectors.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) IPs generate image noise due to the internal structure of the radiation sensitive crystals and surface<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>roughness. For high-quality level radiography, IPs should be selected with low structure noise (fine-
grained type). The manufacturer should provide information on the maximum achievable SNR N  of the IP–
scanner systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) DDAs generate structure noise due to different properties of the detector elements. These can be<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>equalized by a calibration procedure. Modern calibration strategies allow very high SNRs to be achieved.
Thermal and other effects as well as the limited exposure time of calibration images limit the effectiveness
of the calibration and a small residual fixed pattern noise remains.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) Noise is generated by some materials, such as highly nickel-based alloys or rough surfaces. The noise<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>may hide the visibility of fine flaws and even reduce the IQI reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>e) Backscatter contributes to the grey value level in the images and to the noise significantly. Since it does<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>not typically contribute to the radiographic image contrast (CNR) the visibility of IQIs is reduced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
Excessively high radiation energy yields low contrast at constant noise level (for the same grey value<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>level). This reduces the CNR and therefore the IQI visibility. This may be compensated by increasing the
required grey level or reduction of X-ray voltage in comparison to film radiography (CP I).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
