Introduction
The performance of protective coatings of paint and related products applied to steel is
significantly affected by the state of the steel surface immediately prior to painting. The
principal factors that are known to influence this performance are:

a) the presence of rust and mil] scale;

b) the presence of surface contaminants, including salts, dust, oils and greases;

c) the surface profile.
International Standards ISO 8501, ISO 8502 and ISO 8503 have been prepared to provide
methods of assessing these factors, while ISO 8504 provides guidance on the preparation
methods that are available for cleaning steel substrates, indicating the capabilities of each in
attaining specified levels of cleanliness.
These International Standards do not contain recommendations for the protective coating system
to be applied to the steel surface. Neither do they contain recommendations for the surface
quality requirements for specific situations even though surface quality can have a direct
influence on the choice of protective coating to be applied and on its performance. Such
recommendations are found in other documents such as national standards and codes of
practice. It will be necessary for the users of these International Standards to ensure that the
qualities specified are:

— compatible and appropriate both for the environmental conditions to which the steel

will be exposed and for the protective coating system to be used;

— within the capability of the cleaning procedure specified.
The four International Standards referred to above deal with the following aspects of preparation
of steel substrates:
ISO 8501 Visual assessment of surface cleanliness;
ISO 8502 Tests for the assessment of surface cleanliness;
ISO 8503 Surface roughness characteristics of blast-cleaned steel substrates;
ISO 8504 Surface preparation methods.
Each of these International Standards is in turn divided into separate parts.

This part of ISO 8502 describes a field method for the assessment of the total amount of water-
soluble salts, the salts being regarded as forming one single contaminant. The more aggressive
contaminants causing corrosion and blistering (the ionic species) can easily be dissolved off and
determined rapidly by this method. Consequently, the less aggressive and not so easily dissolved
minor part of contaminant will remain un-assessed. For additional information on the test
method, its potential and its limitations, see BRESLE, A., Conductometric determination of
salts on steel surfaces, MP (Materials Performance), June 1995, Vol. 34, No.6, pp. 35-37,
NACE Intemational, Houston TX, USA.
Rusty steel substrates, particularly those of rust grades C or D (see ISO 8501-1), even when
blast-cleaned to preparation grade Sa3 (see ISO 8501-1 and ISO 8501-2), may still be
contaminated by water-soluble salts and corrosion products. These compounds are almost
colourless and are localized at the lowest point of the rust pits. If they are not removed prior to
painting, chemical reactions can result in blister formation and accumulations of rust that
destroy the adhesion between the substrate and the applied protective coating.

Part 9:
Field method for the conductometric determination of water-soluble
salts

1 Scope

This part of ISO 8502 describes a field method for the assessment of the total surface density of
various water-soluble salts (mostly chlorides and sulfates) on steel surfaces before and/or after
surface preparation.

The individual surface densities of chlorides, sulfates, etc., cannot be determined by this
method.

This method assesses ionic contaminants only. These represent the greater part of the
contamination.

2 Normative references

The following standards contain provisions which, through reference in this text, constitute
provisions of this part of ISO 8502. At the time of publication, the editions indicated were valid.
All standards are subject to revision, and parties to agreement based on this part of ISO 8502 are
encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent editions of the standards
indicated below. Members of IEC and ISO maintain registers of currently valid International
Standards.

ISO 3696:1987, Water for analytical laboratory use — Specification and test methods.

ISO 8502-6:1995, Preparation of steel substrates before application of paints and related
products — Tests for the assessment of surface cleanliness — Part 6: Extraction of soluble
contaminants for analysis — The Bresle method.

3 Principle

The salts on the given area of the steel surface are dissolved by the Bresle method (see
ISO 8502-6), using water as solvent. The conductivity of the solution thus obtained is measured.
Finally, the total surface density of the salts in this area is calculated by a simple but sufficiently
accurate equation.

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1  Pour into the beaker (5.2)  an  amount of water (clause 4) that is just large enough for the
operation  of  the conductometer (5.1). Usually a volume between  10  ml  and  20  ml  is needed.  To
prevent foreign matter inside the beaker and syringe, and on the conductometer probe, from
influencing the result, carry out the following blank test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2  Completely fill the syringe (5.4) with water from the beaker. Then empty the syringe back
into the beaker.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3  Immerse the electrodes of the conductometer fully in the water in the beaker and agitate
gently. Record the conductivity  (yi)  and the units in which it is expressed, for example pS/cm.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>63.2  Fill the syringe with about one-quarter of the water contained in the beaker.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3  After  1  min,  suck the water back into the syringe cylinder  (see  5.6  of  IS0  8502-6: 1995).<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4  Without removing the syringe needle from the patch, re-inject the water into the patch

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.5  At the end of the 10th cycle, retrieve  as  much  as  possible  of  the water  from  the patch

Equation (4) gives p, expressed in the SI unit kg/m’.
Multiplying the numerical value obtained from equation (4) by 10° gives p, in mg/m’.
Multiplying the numerical value obtained from equation (4) by 10° gives p, in ug/cem?.
Inserting different values of V in equation (3) for other volumes of water gives equations similar
to equation (4). Three straight lines corresponding to three different equations are plotted in

<<HEADING level=3>>8  Accuracy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accuracy  of  the method depends on the accuracy of the empirical constant  c  in equation  (3),
and on the accuracy  to  which the variables in that equation can be determined. But other factors
will  also  have an influence on the accuracy, such  as  variations in temperature. Very little has
been published on these matters. Practical experience has shown, however, that most variations
have negligible influence on the overall accuracy, except that in the constant  c,  which is
dependent upon the types  of  salt dissolved in the water in  6.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In  the majority of cases, the following types of ion are pre-dominant in the water: Cl-,  S04",
HC03-,  Na', Ca" and  Fe".  Other types of ion may also be present. Usually, however, their
contribution to the variation in the constant  c  is only marginal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The value  of  the constant  c  (5  kg.m%') given in clause  7  is representative of what can be called
normal conditions.  It  is based on calculations of the total conductivity from the specific
conductivities of the individual ions extracted from ten rusty steel specimens. Should the
conditions be more extreme, e.g. due to some particular industry in the vicinity, the variation in
the constant  c  may amount  to  about  &  12  %.  This conclusion is drawn from calculations that are
based on the known specific conductance of each type  of  ion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
