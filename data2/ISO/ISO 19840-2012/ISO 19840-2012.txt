<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard supplements the ISO 12944 series with regard to the measurement and acceptance
criteria for the thickness of a dry film. If specified or agreed, the standard can also be used for other applications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The objective of this International Standard is to achieve uniformity of practice for measuring the dry-film
thickness of a coating on a roughened surface. The chosen methods entail the measurement of dry-film
thickness using measurement instruments based on the permanent magnet principle and the inductive magnet
principle. Instruments using the eddy current principle can be used but their use is normally on non-ferrous
metal surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If a coating is applied to a roughened steel substrate, the measurement of its dry-film thickness is more
complicated than for smooth surfaces. Roughened steel substrates include those prepared by abrasive blast-
cleaning or abrading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The effect of surface roughness on the measurement result increases with profile depth, but the result will also
depend on the design of the measurement probe and the thickness of the coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex A, which is informative, is a method based on adjusting the instrument to known thicknesses on a rough
surface. In this method, no correction value is used. In this standard, individual readings are used. Annex B
describes a method for multiple readings. The methods in Annexes A and B are intended to be used only if
specified or agreed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD
ISO 19840:2012(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>Paints and varnishes — Corrosion protection of steel structures
by protective paint systems — Measurement of, and acceptance
criteria for, the thickness of dry films on rough surfaces<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies a procedure for the verification of dry-film thickness against nominal dry-
film thickness on rough surfaces, including the adjustment of the instruments used, the definition of inspection
areas, sampling plans, measurement methods and acceptance/rejection criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this standard, any specified thickness is taken to be nominal as defined in ISO 12944-5,
and the dry-film thickness is the typical thickness above the peaks of the surface profile.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedure described in this International Standard is based on the use of instruments of the permanent
magnet, electromagnet and eddy current type. Instrument accuracy is verified both at zero and at a known
thickness on a smooth surface and adjusted if necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements taken on a coating on a roughened steel substrate will therefore be higher than the actual value
above the peaks of the profile. The thickness of the dry film above the peaks of the profile is defined as the
instrument reading minus an appropriate correction value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The dry-film thickness is obtained by using the appropriate correction value applied to readings based on
adjustment on a smooth, flat steel surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where individual readings, based on adjustment on a smooth, flat steel surface without the use of correction
values, are specified or agreed, it is important to recognize that this method does not conform with this
International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is applicable if the nominal dry-film thickness is 40 µm or greater.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
If the nominal thickness is less than the surface roughness of the substrate, the uncertainty of the measurement
will increase.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4 Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The thickness of the coating on the prepared steel surface is measured using one of the non-destructive
methods described in ISO 2808. The measurement instruments used are adjusted. For the measurement, a
sampling plan is laid down as well as an appropriate correction value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard also specifies criteria which are used with regard to acceptance or non-acceptance
of film thickness values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Principle of the applicable measurement methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1 Permanent-magnet principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instruments of this type produce a static magnetic field. They measure the magnetic field strength between a
permanent magnet and a magnetic substrate. The magnetic field strength is related to the coating thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2 Pull-off permanent-magnet principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instruments of this type produce a static magnetic field. They measure the force required to overcome the
magnetic attraction between a magnet and a magnetic substrate. This force is related to the coating thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3 Magnetic-induction principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instruments of this type use an electronic probe to generate a magnetic field with either a permanent magnet
(with a Hall sensor) or an electromagnet (with an electromagnetic induction coil). They produce a coating
thickness measurement by measuring the change in magnetic field strength within their probes due to the
proximity of the magnetic substrate. The magnetic field strength is related to the coating thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Other methods using a similar principle are available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4 Eddy current principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instruments of this type — mainly used on non-magnetic metal substrates — produce a varying high-frequency
magnetic field. They measure the magnetic field strength produced by eddy currents caused by the probe in a
conductive substrate. The magnetic field strength is related to the coating thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5 Apparatus and materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All instruments for measuring dry-film thicknesses will give variable values within very small areas on roughened
surfaces due to the influence of the surface roughness and the variations inherent in the method(s) used to
apply the paint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The type of measurement equipment and material shall be specified or agreed between the interested parties
before the measurements commence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Measurement equipment using a magnetic field<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1 Electromagnet<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instruments using this principle may be equipped with either a single- or twin-pole probe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This equipment may incorporate a statistical capability. This enables the minimum, maximum, mean and
standard deviation to be calculated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using a twin-poled instrument, it is recommended that the instrument be moved to positions 90°, 180°
and 270° from the original position where the first reading was made, for example the instrument is pivoted
around the first point of measurement. The mean value of the four readings taken should be determined and
represents the dry-film thickness at the particular spot. In this case, the arithmetic mean value of the four
readings is used in place of an individual reading.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2 Permanent magnet<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instruments of this type incorporate a permanent magnet with one or more poles in the form of hemispherical
contacts which are placed on the coated surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using a twin-poled instrument, it is recommended that the instrument be moved to positions 90°, 180°

<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3 Magnetic pull-off<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This type of instrument most commonly incorporates a permanent magnet to which is attached a spring.
Various forms of the instrument are available, including a simple pencil type, a spring balance type and another
type to which tension is applied by turning a calibrated circular dial until the magnet and attached spring detach
from the coated surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Instruments as described in 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 have a fixed scale graduation and should only be used when a
lower level of accuracy can be accepted. They can only be adjusted at one particular point on the scale, and
this adjustment will have a limited effect on calibration over the full range.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4 Eddy current<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This type of instrument commonly utilizes an electromagnet to produce a magnetic field. The strength of the
magnetic field is related to the coating thickness. These instruments are mainly used to measure the thickness
of coatings on non-magnetic (i.e. non-ferrous) metal substrates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Materials<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1 Foils/shims<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Foils/shims with verified thickness with assigned values traceable to recognized standards and with thicknesses
above the dry-film thickness to be measured are preferred.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of other foils/shims is permitted provided they are verified by a traceable method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Care should be taken to ensure that foils/shims are in good condition before they are used. Foils/shims will
wear more quickly when used on roughened surfaces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2 Uncoated test plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Use an uncoated, smooth, flat, visually clean, square, rectangular or circular steel test plate free of mill scale
and at least 3 mm thick and with a minimum side or diameter of 25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.3 Pre-coated test plates<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Use certified, smooth, flat, visually clean pre-coated steel test plates with assigned values traceable to
recognized standards and with coating thicknesses near to the expected dry-film thickness to be measured.
The dimensions shall be at least equal to those specified in 5.3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6 Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Sampling plan<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sampling plan defines the number of measurements to be taken in an inspection area. If the structure has
not been divided into individual inspection areas, the whole structure is considered as the inspection area for
measuring the dry-film thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Inspection areas will normally be defined in the project specification (see also ISO 12944-7 and ISO 12944-8).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedures for areas requiring special consideration, such as welds, edges, corners, fixtures, areas with
observed defects, shall be agreed by the interested parties. For more details, see Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum number of randomly taken measurements to be taken for verifying the dry-film thickness on
inspection areas is given in Table 1. The number of measurements given is generally considered as being
representative for inspection areas for the purposes of this International Standard. This number shall be
increased for inspection areas having a difficult configuration with regard to paint application or measurement
or limitations in accessibility (difficult areas). Each difficult area, e.g. stiffeners, brackets, supports, attached
piping, shall have additional random measurements taken appropriate to its area in accordance with Table 1,
over and above the random measurements in the inspection area.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Before use, it shall be ascertained that the instrument is in good working condition and correctly adjusted. Verification
shall then be carried out on uncoated test plates (5.3.2) at zero and with verified foils/shims (5.3.1) above and below
the specified dry-film thickness. Pre-coated test plates (5.3.3) may be used instead of verified foils/shims.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If the result of the verification is outside the range given by the manufacturer, the instrument shall not be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Adjustment is carried out by the user in most cases. Calibration, on the other hand, is the process of setting
and recording the thickness values displayed on a dry-film thickness gauge to known values of thickness across the range
of the gauge. Calibration is carried out by the gauge manufacturer using traceable thickness standards in most cases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Measurement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurements on the dry film shall only be taken after instrument accuracy has been checked in accordance
with 6.2. The measurement instrument shall then be used in accordance with the instrument manufacturer’s
instructions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Following completion of a series of measurements, and preferably during the measurements, the adjustment of the
instrument shall be re-verified. If this is not in accordance with 6.2, the results of the measurements shall be rejected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When, during a series of measurements, an individual dry-film thickness value does not meet a criterion [see
9 b) and d)], a repeated measurement not more than 10 mm from the point of the first measurement shall be
carried out. The first value shall then be rejected and replaced by the result of the repeated measurement. This
new measurement will then be the individual dry-film thickness. If this individual dry-film thickness does not meet
the criterion (see Clause 9), it shall not be replaced. For maximum numbers of repeated measurements within an
inspection area see Table 1. The number of replaced measurements shall be indicated in the test report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sampling plan shall be completed even if values do not meet the criteria, unless otherwise agreed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Annex A
(informative)
Method based on adjusting the instrument to known thicknesses on a
rough surface<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex describes a method of measuring the dry-film thickness of a coating on an abrasive blast-cleaned
or otherwise mechanically roughened substrate, based on adjusting the instrument to known thicknesses on a
rough surface representative of the surface to be measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using this method, the following details of this International Standard do not apply: Introduction,
paragraph 3; Clause 1, paragraph 2; 6.1; Clause 7; and Clause 10, item g).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2
Adjustment of the instrument<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.1
Before adjustment, check the power supply to the instrument to ensure that is adequate. Also check that
the probe and the surface to be measured are clean and uncontaminated.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2.2
On commencement of the measurement, adjust the instrument in the environment and at the site where
it is to be used. Particular attention should be paid to the following:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— that the operating temperature of the instrument and the probe has been reached prior to calibration;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— that there are no sources of magnetic disturbance nearby, for example electric cables, welding units, generators;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— that the object to be measured does not vibrate when the adjustment is carried out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.2.3
Use for the adjustment an unpainted section of the steel structure which has been cleaned and pre-
treated in exactly the same way as the painted sections. If this is not possible, a special adjustment sample can
be provided which is, in its material properties that can affect the film thickness measurement, similar to the
steel structure and has been cleaned and pre-treated in the same way. The electrical and magnetic properties
of the substrate can vary depending on differences in its chemical composition and morphological structure, e.g.
caused by different heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
As a rule, the effect of substrate thickness is manifest in substrates up to a thickness of approximately 1 mm.
Thereafter, it declines. At a substrate thickness of above approximately 5 mm, the effect is generally insignificant.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.2.4
If the instrument has several measurement ranges, select that range which is most suitable for the
measurement object. Select suitable calibrated shims for the measurement range. One shim should be thinner
and one thicker than the NDFT of the coat(s) on the measurement object. Place the thinner shim on the unpainted
surface and the probe on the shim. Adjust the scale reading to the value of the shim. Then place the thicker
shim on the unpainted surface and repeat the procedure. Check an intermediate-value shim to ensure that the
adjustment is correct.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The instrument is now ready for use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For some instruments, setting to zero is required with the probe on the prepared but uncoated surface. On blast-
cleaned surfaces such a procedure will introduce errors. To minimize measurement errors on a blast-cleaned surface,
it is recommended that at least one of the shims used for adjustment be thinner than the film to be measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

If the instrument cannot be adjusted to fully agree with the different shims, a calibration curve showing
correct values as a function of the reading may be plotted as an aid to making the measurements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.2.6
When the instrument range is changed, adjust the instrument again. In the event of extensive
measurements, checking of the instrument using shims at least once per hour is necessary. If discrepancies
occur, the instrument adjustment should be repeated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3
Statistical instruments<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Some instruments allow adjustment to mean values obtained from a series of readings performed on different parts
of the surface. Since such adjustment is more representative of the surface, the reading variations will diminish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Multiple readings<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1
Multiple readings on a test area<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A circular surface of diameter 30 mm of the inspection area is used as the test area, and multiple readings
are taken within this test area. If the number of readings is not specified in the contract or specification, five
individual readings (see 3.2) are taken. The acceptance/rejection criterion is then based on the arithmetic
mean of these multiple readings; no significance is attached to any individual reading when this annex is used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.2
Number and distribution of test areas<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The number of test areas and their distribution should be as given in Table 1 for inspection areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Areas requiring special consideration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Coating thickness gauges based on magnetic principles are affected by the magnetic properties, the shape
and the surface finish of the substrate under test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Ideally, gauges should be adjusted using a sample of steel which is truly representative of the substrate to
be tested. It is, however, recognized that this is not a practical procedure in many inspection environments,
for example when the substrate is not accessible as it has been coated before testing commences or when
processing such as welding, cutting, bending, etc., has changed the nature of the substrate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In many instances, the effect of these changes will be small compared to the effect of the blast-cleaned
surface finish which is dealt with in the main body of this International Standard. Care needs to be taken on
weld material, on areas at or close to the edges of the substrate, and at or close to bends as, depending on the
specific design of the coating thickness gauge, the effect will be most noticeable in these areas.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is good practice to identify critical areas of the structure that are affected by welding, cutting, bending
and other processes which change the shape, thickness, magnetic properties (due to work hardening, heat
treatment, etc.) or surface finish (due to impact damage, handling defects, etc.) and to measure the coatings in
these areas using agreed special procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For guidance, test areas within 15 mm of edges, welds, holes, etc., should be considered as requiring special
consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Manufacturers of gauges will quote parameters such as minimum substrate thickness and minimum sample
diameter. These parameters characterize the design of the gauge and, particularly, the performance of the
probe, so that the user can determine when the application under consideration is going to affect the normal
performance of the gauge.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
A practical assessment of these local effects can be carried out on an uncoated and blast-cleaned sample of
the substrate concerned to determine the effect on the zero adjustment of a gauge set up on an uncoated, smooth, flat,
clean steel test plate as defined in 5.3.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the condition of the sample is influencing the readings of the gauge on a representative foil/shim of known
thickness, it will show up as a variation with respect to readings on the foil/shim on the more usual blast-
cleaned steel substrate. Readings should preferably be taken on a foil/shim of thickness representative of the
coating to be measured, first on the affected area and then on an unaffected area adjacent to the affected area.
If these readings differ by more than 10 µm and the area is deemed to be critical, the gauge should be adjusted
on a typical example to compensate for the effects. Readings taken in this way should be noted separately,
together with the test results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Determination of a specific correction value<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a specific correction value is to be determined, proceed as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adjust the instrument in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and 6.2. Check the adjustment for
intermediate values following the manufacturer’s specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Use the adjusted instrument on the blast-cleaned or otherwise roughened surface to check a measured
foil/shim of approximately 125 µm thickness (but not less than 115 µm or greater than 160 µm). Using the
foil/shim, take 10 measurements at different points on the blast-cleaned or otherwise roughened surface and
determine the arithmetic mean value. From the mean value, subtract the known value of the foil thickness. The
value obtained is the correction value.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
