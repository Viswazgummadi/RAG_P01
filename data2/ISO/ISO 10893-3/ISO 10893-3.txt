<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Reference tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
The reference standards defined in this part of ISO 10893 are convenient standards for calibration of
non-destructive testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards should not be considered as the
minimum size of imperfections detectable by such equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.2
Each single probe of the magnetic flux leakage equipment shall be calibrated using a reference notch
on the outside surface or notches on outside and inside surfaces of a reference tube.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, a circular reference hole drilled radially through the full thickness of the reference tube may be
used for equipment calibration by agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer. In this case, the
maximum diameter of the reference hole for a specific acceptance level shall be agreed on and the
manufacturer shall demonstrate that the test sensitivity achieved using the reference hole and the equipment
settings is essentially equivalent to that obtained when using the specified external reference notch and the
agreed internal reference notch depth.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The diameter of the holes can be specified based on factors involving intended service or other appropriate
criteria. Typical holes diameter range is from 0,80 mm to 3,20 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 10893-3:2011(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The internal surface of the reference tube may be dressed or machined prior to the preparation of the internal
notch. The internal notch should not be used when the tube internal diameter is less than 20 mm, unless
otherwise agreed on between the purchaser and the manufacturer or when the tube thickness is greater than
20 mm since, due to technical limitations given in Annex A, the test at the tube bore is not adequate even after
applying the maximum ratios given in Table A.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.3
The reference tubes shall have the same specified diameter and thickness, same surface finish and
delivery condition (e.g. as-rolled, normalized, quenched and tempered) and similar steel grade as the tubes
being tested. For specified wall thickness exceeding 10 mm, the wall thickness of the reference tubes may be
greater than the specified wall thickness of the pipe under inspection provided the notch depth is calculated on
the specified wall thickness of the pipe being inspected. The manufacturer shall demonstrate, on request, the
effectiveness of the adopted solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4
The external and the eventual internal notches and the reference hole shall be sufficiently separated
from the ends of the reference tube and from each other (when both notches are used), such that clearly
distinguishable signals are obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Reference notches<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The reference notch(es) shall be of the “N” type (see Figure 3) and shall lie parallel to the major axis of
the tube; when transverse imperfection detection has been agreed on between the purchaser and
manufacturer, the reference notch(es) shall lie transversally to the major axis of the tube (see Figure 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The sides shall be nominally parallel and the bottom shall be nominally square to the sides;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The reference notch shall be formed by machining, spark erosion or other methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The values of notch depth specified in this table are the same for the corresponding categories, in all International Standards
concerning non-destructive testing of steel tubes where reference is made to different acceptance levels. Although the reference
standards are identical, the various test methods involved can give different test results. Accordingly, the acceptance level designation
prefix F (flux leakage) has been adopted to avoid any inferred direct equivalence with other test methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Equipment calibration and checking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1
At the start of each inspection cycle, the equipment shall be calibrated to produce consistently
(e.g. from three consecutive passes of the reference tube through the equipment), clearly identifiable signals
from the reference standard(s). These signals shall be used to activate their respective trigger alarm of the
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2
During the calibration check, the relative speed of movement between the reference tube and the
transducer assembly shall be the same as that used during the production test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3
The calibration of the equipment shall be checked at regular intervals during the production testing of
tubes of the same specified diameter, thickness and grade by passing the reference tube through the test
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency of checking the calibration shall be at least every 4 h, but also whenever there is an equipment
operator team changeover and at the start and end of production.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4
The equipment shall be recalibrated if any of the parameters which were used during the initial
calibration are changed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5
If, on checking during production testing, the calibration requirements are not satisfied, all tubes tested
since the previous acceptable equipment calibration shall be retested after the equipment has been
recalibrated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8
Acceptance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1
Any tube producing signals lower than the trigger/alarm level shall be deemed to have passed this
test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2
Any tube producing signals equal to or greater than the trigger/alarm level shall be designated
suspect, or at the discretion of the manufacturer, may be retested. If, after two consecutive retests, all signals
are lower than the trigger/alarm level, the tube shall be deemed to have passed this test; otherwise, the tube
shall be designated as suspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(normative)
Limitations of magnetic flux leakage test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using this method, the inspected products shall be magnetically saturated inserting them in an external
strong magnetic field; the aim of this saturation is to cause flux leakage/flux diversion from imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the magnetic flux leakage testing of tubes, the sensitivity of the test is at maximum at the tube surface
adjacent to the magnetic transducer and decreases with increasing tube thickness due to effective diminishing
flux diversion from imperfection at the tube bore surface in relation to that at the external surface. The signal
response from internal surface imperfection may thus be smaller than that from an external imperfection of the
same size.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As a result, it may be necessary for the internal notch depth to be increased in excess of that specified for the
external notch depth by an amount agreed on by the purchaser and the manufacturer, being dependent, for
example on the type of equipment in use and the surface condition of the tube being tested. For that reason,
Table A.1 is generally applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.2 Fixed or rotating magnetic transducer<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These test techniques use one or more magnetic transducers to describe a helical path over the tube surface.
For this reason, these techniques detect longitudinal imperfections with a minimum length dependant on the
width of the transducer and the inspection helical pitch. It is recognized that transverse imperfections are
normally not detectable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3 Multiple transducers technique<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This test technique uses multiple fixed magnetic transducers surrounding the tube during its linear movement.
For this reason the technique detects predominantly transverse imperfections having a minimum length
dependant on the circumferential dimension of the transducer. It is recognized that longitudinal imperfections
are normally not detectable unless they have a significant transverse component (oblique).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
