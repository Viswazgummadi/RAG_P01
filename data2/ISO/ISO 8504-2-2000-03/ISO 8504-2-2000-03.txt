<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO
member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical
committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has
the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in
liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting.
Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this part of ISO 8504 may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standard ISO 8504-2 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 35, Paints and varnishes,
Subcommittee SC 12, Preparation of steel substrates before application of paints and related products.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 8504-2:1992), which has been updated and
editorially revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 8504 consists of the following parts, under the general title Preparation of steel substrates before application of
paints and related products — Surface preparation methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 1: General principles<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The performance of protective coatings of paint and related products applied to steel is significantly affected by the
state of the steel surface immediately prior to painting. The principal factors that are known to influence this
performance are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the presence of rust and mill scale;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the presence of surface contaminants, including salts, dust, oils and greases;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the surface profile.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards ISO 8501, ISO 8502 and ISO 8503 have been prepared to provide methods of assessing
these factors, while ISO 8504 provides guidance on the preparation methods that are available for cleaning steel
substrates, indicating the capabilities of each in attaining specified levels of cleanliness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These International Standards do not contain recommendations for the protective coating system to be applied to
the steel surface. Neither do they contain recommendations for the surface quality requirements for specific
situations even though surface quality can have a direct influence on the choice of protective coating to be applied
and on its performance. Such recommendations are found in other documents such as national standards and
codes of practice. It will be necessary for the users of these International Standards to ensure the qualities
specified are<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>compatible and appropriate both for the environmental conditions to which the steel will be exposed and for the
protective coating system to be used;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>within the capability of the cleaning procedure specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The four International Standards referred to below deal with the following aspects of preparation of steel substrates:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 8501 — Visual assessment of surface cleanliness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 8502 — Tests for the assessment of surface cleanliness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 8503 — Surface roughness characteristics of blast-cleaned steel substrates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 8504 — Surface preparation methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each of these International Standards is in turn divided into separate parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The primary objective of surface preparation is to ensure the removal of deleterious matter and to obtain a surface
that permits satisfactory adhesion of the priming paint to steel. It should also assist in reducing the amounts of
contaminants that initiate corrosion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 8504 describes abrasive blast-cleaning methods. It should be read in conjunction with ISO 8504-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Abrasive blast-cleaning is a most effective method for mechanical surface preparation. It is widely applicable
because this method of surface preparation has a number of versatile features listed below.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The method allows a high production rate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The equipment can be stationary or mobile and is adaptable to the objects to be cleaned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The method is applicable to most types and forms of steel surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Many different surface states can be produced, for example different preparation grades and surface profiles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Effects such as cleaning, peening, roughening, levelling and lapping can be produced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
It is possible to remove selectively partly failed coatings, leaving sound coatings intact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 8504 describes abrasive blast-cleaning methods for the preparation of steel surfaces before
coating with paints and related products. It also contains information on the effectiveness of the individual methods
and their fields of application.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 8504 is applicable to new and corroded steel surfaces and to steel surfaces that are uncoated or have been
previously coated with paints and related products. For limitations, see note 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
These methods are essentially intended for hot-rolled steel to remove mill scale, rust, etc., but could also be used
for cold-rolled steel of sufficient thickness to withstand the deformation caused by the impact of abrasive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
There are several items that should be included in the purchaser's procurement documents to supplement this part
of ISO 8504. Items that should be considered as a part of surface preparation before coating are edge grinding, removal of
grease and oil, porosity of welds, removal of weld spatter, removal of burrs and other sharp edges, grinding of welds, filling of
pits and other surface imperfections that may cause premature failure of the coating system (see ISO 8501-3 for more
information) and the removal of water-soluble contaminants.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Terms and definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this part of ISO 8504, the following terms and definitions apply:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1
abrasive blast-cleaning
impingement of a high-kinetic-energy stream of abrasive on to the surface to be prepared<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The abrasive is typically propelled either by centrifugal force or by a high-velocity stream of fluid such as air or water
to remove rust, mill scale, existing coatings and other contaminants and expose the substrate. The cleaned surface has a
characteristic secondary profile dependent on the blast-cleaning conditions, the properties of the abrasive, the initial condition of
the surface and the properties of the steel being blast-cleaned. The initial surface roughness or primary profile may be altered
by the abrasive blast-cleaning procedure. Surface profiles are assessed using the method described in ISO 8503-2. When
selecting a surface preparation method, it is necessary to consider the preparation grade required to give a level of surface
cle anliness and, if required, a surface profile (roughness), such as coarse, medium or fine (see ISO 8503-1 and ISO 8503-2),
appropriate to the coating system to be applied to the steel surface. Since the cost of surface preparation is usually in proportion
to the level of cleanliness, a preparation grade appropriate to the purpose and type of coating system or a coating system
appropriate to the preparation grade which can be achieved should be chosen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2
blast-cleaning abrasive
solid material intended to be used for abrasive blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.3
shot
particles that are predominantly round, that have a length of less than twice the maximum particle width and that do
not have edges, broken faces or other sharp surface defects<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.4
grit
particles that are predominantly angular, that have fractured faces and sharp edges and that are less than half-
round in shape<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.5
cylindrical particles
sharp-edged particles, having a diameter-to-length ratio of 1:1, cut so that their faces are approximately at right
angles to their centreline<<HEADING_END>>

Abrasives<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1
Materials and types<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1.1
A wide variety of natural and synthetic solid materials and several liquids are used for abrasive blast-
cleaning. Solid materials commonly in use for the preparation of steel surfaces before coating are given in Table 1.
Each material provides a characteristic performance and surface finish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When selecting a blast-cleaning abrasive, the following factors relating to its initial condition shall be considered:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>sub-group and type (see Table 1);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>indication of chemical composition;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>range of particle size (see 4.1.2);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>particle hardness (for example Vickers, Rockwell or Mohs, or as measured by another appropriate method).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards for metallic and non-metallic blast-cleaning abrasives are listed for information in annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

General requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1
Technical<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Abrasives shall be dry (except when added to pressurized liquid or slurry blast-cleaning systems) and shall be free-
flowing to permit consistent metering into the blast stream.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Abrasives shall meet the requirements specified in the ISO 11124 and ISO 11126 series of standards and be free
from corrosive constituents and adhesion-impairing contaminants. Because of their deleterious effect on the blast-
cleaned steel surface, permanently contaminated abrasives (for example those that cannot be cleaned before
recycling and those produced from slag that has been granulated by the use of saline water, i.e. sea water, for
cooling) are not permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2
Health and safety<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Equipment, materials and abrasives used for surface preparation can be hazardous if used carelessly. Many
national regulations exist for those materials and abrasives that are considered to be hazardous during or after use
(waste management), such as free silica or carcinogenic or toxic substances. These regulations are therefore to be
observed. It is important to ensure that adequate instructions are given and that all required precautions are
exercised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3
Selection considerations<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1
Selection of a suitable abrasive, together with an appropriate blast-cleaning method and operating
conditions, is necessary to achieve the required standard of surface preparation.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The type of blast-cleaning abrasive — i.e. its particle size distribution, shape, hardness, density and impact
behaviour (deformation or shatter characteristics) — is important in determining the standards of cleanliness, the
cleaning rate and the resulting surface profile of the blast-cleaned surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The particle size distribution of abrasives should be determined using the methods specified in ISO 11125-2 and
ISO 11127-2 respectively (see annex A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3.2
Preliminary blast-cleaning tests are recommended to determine the most effective abrasive, the resulting
surface preparation grade and the resulting surface profile (see ISO 8501-1 or ISO 8501-2 and ISO 8503-2). If
recycled abrasive is to be used for the surface preparation work, it is essential that a preliminary test be carried out
with the same material, as new abrasive may give misleading results [see also 4.3.3 c)].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3
When selecting an abrasive, it is essential that the following considerations be taken into account:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The influence of a particular particle size on the resulting surface profile is normally greater for metallic
abrasives than for non-metallic abrasives. This is because the shatter characteristics differ and because
differences in density affect the kinetic energy of the abrasive particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
A balanced mixture of particle sizes will produce the optimum level of cleanliness, cleaning rate and surface
profile.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
In blast-cleaning plants where the abrasive is recycled, it is necessary<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to remove dust and contaminants before the abrasive is re-used and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>to make up for the abrasive which is lost by wear and adherence to the workpieces; this is done by
controlled additions of new abrasive so that the abrasive mixture is maintained within the prescribed
particle size limits or particle size distribution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Complete renewal of abrasive charges in recycling machines requires a period of use before the mixture reaches a
steady condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

workpieces having different rust grades (see ISO 8501-1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Most centrifugal abrasive blast-cleaning equipment is stationary and the abrasive is circulated in a closed system.
The workpieces are either fed through or rotated within the equipment. In certain cases, the equipment may be mobile, and
therefore useful for cleaning large uninterrupted surfaces, such as ships' hulls and oil storage tanks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.3
Effectiveness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method can achieve preparation grade Sa 3 on steel of all rust grades defined in ISO 8501-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1.4
Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Centrifugal abrasive blast-cleaning equipment has to be carefully set up for each application and so this method is
generally limited to repetitive work associated with high-volume throughput or continuous production.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, chemicals contaminating a steel surface cannot be totally removed by centrifugal blast-cleaning. Thus,
additi o nal treatment is required (see 6.3) if complete removal is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2
Compressed-air abrasive blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.1
Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Compressed-air abrasive blast-cleaning is carried out by feeding the abrasive into an air stream and directing the
air/abrasive mixture at high velocity from a nozzle on to the surface to be cleaned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The abrasive may be injected into the air stream from a pressurized container or may be drawn into the air stream
by suction from an unpressurized container.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.2
Field of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method is suitable for cleaning workpieces (including large structures) of all types. It is also applicable to
workpieces having different rust grades (see ISO 8501-1). It may be used either continuously or intermittently and
may be used when centrifugal abrasive blast-cleaning (5.1.1) is not suitable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This system of cleaning can be used in factories, rooms or cabinets, or on site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.3

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2.4
Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method gives rise to evolution of free dust and its use may be restricted in applications where dust
suppression or extraction facilities are unable to meet permissible environmental contamination levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, chemicals contaminating a steel surface cannot be totally removed by compressed-air abrasive blast-
cleaning. Thus, additional treatment is required (see 6.1 and 6.3) if complete removal is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3
Vacuum or suction-head abrasive blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.1
Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is similar to compressed-air abrasive blast-cleaning (5.1.2) but with the blast nozzle enclosed in a
suction head sealed to the steel surface, collecting the spent abrasive and contaminants. Alternatively, the
air/abrasive stream may be sucked on to the surface by reduced pressure at the suction head.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.2
Field of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method is particularly suitable for localized cleaning where the dust and debris resulting from other blast-
cleaning techniques are unacceptable and where the technical requirements (for example tight sealing of the
suction head to the surface) can be met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.3
Effectiveness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is clean, with little dust produced in the area, and can achieve preparation grade Sa 2½ as defined in
ISO 8501-1. After an extended period of cleaning with this method, preparation grade Sa 3 may be obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3.4
Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is more time-consuming than other blast-cleaning methods. It is unsuitable for cleaning heavily
corroded steel (of rust grade D as defined in ISO 8501-1) and not applicable to irregular shapes due to the
necessity to seal the suction head tightly to the surface and difficulties in handling the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, chemicals contaminating a steel surface cannot be totally removed by vacuum or suction-head abrasive
blast-cleaning. Thus, additional treatment is required (see 6.1 and 6.3) if complete removal is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Wet abrasive blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The water used for wet abrasive blast-cleaning shall have a low salt content to avoid contamination of the surface
being prepared.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Moisture-injection abrasive blast-cleaning (compressed-air moisture-injection abrasive blast-
cleaning)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2.1
Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is similar to compressed-air abrasive blast-cleaning (5.1.2) but with the addition, upstream of the
nozzle, of a very small amount of liquid (usually clean, fresh water) to the air/abrasive stream, resulting in a blast-
cleaning procedure which is dust-free in the suspended-particle size range of less than 50 µm. The consumption of
water can be controlled and is usually 15 l/h to 25 l/h.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A suitable rust inhibitor may be added to the water (see, however, 5.2.2.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 8504-2:2000(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2.2
Field of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is suitable for cleaning workpieces (including large structures) of all types. It is also applicable to
workpieces having different rust grades (see ISO 8501-1) as the addition of liquid can be controlled to match the
intensity of the dust produced. It can be used in the majority of cases where high dust levels and large amounts of
water are to be avoided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The addition of liquid, which binds the dust, is controlled in such a way that normally no liquid drips out of the
nozzle. This means that the individual abrasive particles are enveloped with an extremely thin liquid film that, when
the particles burst, prevents the formation of dust around the surface being treated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2.3
Effectiveness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is versatile and can achieve preparation grade Sa 3 on steel of all rust grades defined in ISO 8501-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2.4
Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface preparation quality achieved by this method differs from that obtained by compressed-air abrasive
blast-cleaning (5.1.2) only by the fact that the prepared surface is initially moist. The moisture disappears within a
few minutes, the time depending on the ambient conditions, and may cause a light, negligible rust trace on the
roughened surface. In cases where "flash rusting" occurs, suitable coating systems are necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a rust inhibitor is used, it shall be compatible with the subsequent coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The use of a rust inhibitor in the water may require that special waste disposal procedures have to be taken to
comply with local environmental regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3
Compressed-air wet abrasive blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3.1
Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is similar to compressed-air abrasive blast-cleaning (5.1.2) but with the addition of liquid (generally
clean, fresh water) downstream of the nozzle to produce a stream of air, water and abrasive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A suitable rust inhibitor may be added to the water (see, however, 5.2.3.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3.2
Field of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is suitable for cleaning workpieces (including large structures) of all types. It is also applicable to
workpieces having different rust grades (see ISO 8501-1) and particularly for pitted and chemically contaminated
steel, provided the presence of water is permitted. It may be used in both continuous and intermittent operations,
particularly where cleaned surfaces are required to have low levels of residual soluble salts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For surface preparation during maintenance, it is possible to partially or selectively remove existing coatings by
adjusting the pressure and the proportions of air, water and abrasive in the mixture.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3.3
Effectiveness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method can achieve preparation grade Sa 3 as defined in ISO 8501-1. The method is particularly suitable for
reducing the amount of water-soluble contaminants and minimizing dust generation during cleaning. Since the
water is added downstream of the nozzle, the chemical cleaning action is less effective.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.3.4
Limitations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The blast-cleaned surface is usually covered with a slurry that impairs visual examination by the operator. This
slurry must therefore be removed by a dry blast or water jet. The surface may need to dry before application of<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Slurry blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4.1
Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A dispersion of fine abrasive in water or another liquid is directed, with pumps or compressed air, on to the surface
to be cleaned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A suitable rust inhibitor may be added (see, however, 5.2.3.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4.2
Field of application<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method is suitable for producing a fine surface profile on surfaces requiring little or no secondary profile, often
needed for small workpieces.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.4.3

Pressurized-liquid blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.5.1
Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An abrasive (or a mixture of abrasives) is introduced into a stream of liquid (generally clean, fresh water) and the
stream directed through a nozzle on to the surface to be cleaned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The stream is predominantly pressurized liquid, and additions of solid abrasives are normally less than for
compressed-air wet abrasive blast-cleaning.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The abrasive may be introduced either dry (with or without air) or as a wet slurry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A suitable rust inhibitor may be added to the water (see, however, 5.2.3.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Effectiveness<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method can achieve preparation grade Sa 3 on steel of rust grades A, B and C and Sa 2½ on steel of rust
grade D as defined in ISO 8501-1. It is particularly suitable for reducing the amount of water-soluble contaminants
but is less easy to control than compressed-air wet abrasive blast-cleaning (see 5.2.3) for removal of soluble salts,
and the high water pressure is a potential hazard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1
Preparation before blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Check visually for the presence of oil, grease, salts or similar contaminants. Remove any deposits of these using a
degreasing or washing procedure and check whether any contaminants are still present. Mask off areas not to be
blast-cleaned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Suitable methods for removal of contaminants are described in ISO 12944-4 2) .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
It is important that surface deposits of grease, oil, dirt and slag be removed prior to blast-cleaning, preferably with a
detergent wash or clean organic solvent. If this stage is omitted, the presence of these deposits when transferred to the abrasive
makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to clean the abrasive for re-use.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
It may be advantageous to remove heavy, firmly adhering rust and scale by hand- or power-tool cleaning (see
ISO 8504-3). In addition, recommendations regarding the preliminary treatment of welds, the removal of weld spatter and the
removal of burrs and other sharp edges should be provided.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3
When using wet abrasive blast-cleaning methods (see 5.2), a suitable detergent may be added to the liquid to assist
the removal of grease, oil, dirt and soluble salts during the blast-cleaning process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2
Blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.1
Assess the rust grade(s) of the workpiece, by the method described in ISO 8501-1 and/or in ISO 4628-3,
within the limits of a contract or specification, if any.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2
Determine the minimum preparation grade required, by reference to 6.2.1 and to the preparation grades
defined in ISO 8501-1 and/or ISO 8501-2. Also determine the required surface profile by reference to ISO 8503-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.3
Select the appropriate blast-cleaning method from those described in clause 5 to produce the required
preparation grade and surface profile.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.4
Select the appropriate type and particle size distribution of blast-cleaning abrasive to suit the properties of
the workpiece, the characteristics of the blast-cleaning equipment and the required preparation grade and surface
profile. For information on existing International Standards, see annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3
After blast-cleaning<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After dry abrasive blast-cleaning, remove loosely adhering dust, debris and blast-cleaning abrasive from the
surface by suction, by brushing or by use of compressed air free of oil and moisture. If the amount of residual
soluble impurities is to be reduced, wash with a steam jet, hot fresh water, solvent or other suitable cleaner
(followed by rinsing with clean fresh water) and dry.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>After wet abrasive blast-cleaning, wash all surfaces down with fresh water to remove loosely adhering abrasive and
other residues. The water may contain an agreed rust inhibitor. Compressed air free of oil and moisture or other
means (for example heated air) may then be used to assist in drying the surfaces before application of paint.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Befor e a pplication of paints and related products, a blast-cleaned surface may need to dry, and "flash rusting" may
occur. This thin iron oxide film will need to be removed if considered detrimental to the subsequent coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
