Foreword
ISO (the Intemational Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. Intemational organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.
The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.
ISO 2808 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 35, Paints and varnishes, Subcommittee SC 9,
General test methods for paints and varnishes.
This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition (ISO 2808:1997), which has been technically revised.
The main changes are as follows:
a) The structure of the standard has been changed inte four maln clauses:
4) determination of wet-film thickness;
2) determination of thickness;
a) determination of the thickness of uncured powder layers; and
4) measurement of film thickness on rough surfaces.
b) Methods using and acoustic techniques have been added.
6) The split-beam method has been deleted as such Instrument are no longer manufactured.

b) are made before and after coating application

The film thickness is calculated from the difference between the readings.

§.2.3 General
In the “coating application” variant, a template with holes is used to ensure that the determination of
the substrate thickness and total thickness Is carried out at exactly the same points.
The “coating application” variant is preferred in the case of plastic substrates since in most cases the
substrate cannot be exposed without causing damage.
In the “coating removal" variant, the measurement areas shall be circled and labelled. The coating shall be
carefully and completely removed in the measurement areas without damaging the substrate mechanically or
chemically. The substrate may be partly masked using adhesive tape before coating in order to obtain well-
defined steps from one layer to the next.
In the case of the depth gauge and profilometer (methods 4B and 4C), the coating which is not removed in the
region of the measurement area shall remain undamaged.
In the case of the profilometer (method 4C), the shoulder between the substrate and the film surface shall be
sufficiently well defined.
With hard substrates (e.g. glass) the coating can be removed mechanically, but with less hard substrates (e.g.
steel) the coating shall be removed chemically using a solvent or paint remover.
NOTE 2 In the of less hard substrate materials such as steel, the film can be cut through with a core drill of
10 mm diameter and the disc of coating thus formed removed with a solvent or paint ramover.
All surfaces (coating, substrate, reverse side of specimen) which are contacted or gauged shall be clean and
free from film residues.

Before use, and, if necessary, adjust the instrument In accordance with the manufacturers instructons
far steel, using the smooth steal plate, which shall be polished with 400 grit abrasive paper to remove all
staining and products before use. The verfication shims shall be paced behyeen the probe and the
steel plate. Verfication shims of thicknesses above and below the expected film thickness shall be
used.
7.3.2
Measureinents an the dry coating shall be made ln accordance with the instrument manufacturer's instructions
for smacth steel. For the number of readings, see 7.3.3.
7.3.4 Number of readings
It is ta take at least three readings evenly spread in each test area.
As 4 guide, It ls recommended thal there be two test areas every metre for flat plates, four every metre
length for webs, to every metre length for flanges and two or more every metre length for ples (depending

It is generally recommended that, for off-shore and other marine work, more readings are taken.
