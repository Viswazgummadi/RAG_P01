The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO\ntechnical committees.

Intemational organizations, governmental and\nnon-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.\nInternational Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.\nThe main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft Standards\nadopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. as an\nInternational Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.\nAttention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent\nrights.
