<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO
member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical
committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has
the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in
liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting.
Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this part of ISO 14122 may be the subject of
patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of EN ISO 14122 defines the general requirements for safe access to machines mentioned in EN 292-2. It
gives advice about the correct choice of access means when the necessary access to the machine is not possible
directly from the ground level or from a floor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of EN ISO 14122 applies to all machinery (stationary and mobile) where fixed means of access are
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of EN ISO 14122 applies to means of access which are a part of a machine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of EN ISO 14122 may also apply to means of access to that part of the building (e.g. working platforms,
walkways, ladders) where the machine is installed, providing the main function of that part of the building is to
provide a means of access to the machine.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
This part of EN ISO 14122 may be used also for means of access which are outside the scope of this part of
EN ISO 14122. In those cases the possible relevant national or other regulations should be taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of EN ISO 14122 applies also to access means specific to the machine which are not permanently fixed to
the machine and which may be removed or moved to the side for some operations of the machine (e.g. changing
tools in a large press).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of EN ISO 14122 does not apply to lifts, to moveable elevating platforms or other devices specially
designed to lift persons between two levels<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2

from falling of materials or objects when they may cause a risk to persons.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other hazards  generated by the machinery , e.g.  caused by the functioning of the machinery  (moving parts of
the machine, movement of the machine itself (mobile machines), radiation, hot surface, noise, steam, hot liquids) or
caused by its environment (harmful airborne substances) are not covered by this part of EN ISO 14122 but the
designer of the machine should consider them, e.g. by preventing the access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
EN 1050 gives principles for risk assessment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of EN ISO 14122 is primarily aimed at the prevention of persons falling and of excessive physical efforts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Requirements for the selection of the fixed means of access<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There shall be a safe and convenient means of access to all the zones and points of the machine where the need
for access can be foreseen during the phases of the "life" of the machinery (see 3.11 of EN 292-1:1991).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 14122-1:2001(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2
Preferred means of access<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The preferred means of access to the machinery shall be in the following order :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
access directly from the ground level or from a floor, (for more details see 5.3.1.1 and EN ISO 14122-2) ;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
lifts, ramps or stairs, (for more details see 5.4) ;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
stepladders or ladders, (for more details see 5.5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3
Selection of the means of access<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1
Basic solutions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1.1
Whenever possible, access to control devices and other parts of the machine is preferred from either a
ground level or a floor. This is particularly important where frequent access is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.1.2
If level access according to 5.3.1.1 is not possible or practicable,<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
a lift<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
suitable ramp with an angle of pitch less than 10 ° (see 5.4.b))<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
stairs with an angle of pitch from a minimum of 30 ° to maximum of 38 ° (see 5.4.c))<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>shall normally be selected as a safe and suitable basic solution for the necessary access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3.2
Conditions for the selection of stepladder or ladder<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2.1
In the design of access to machinery, stepladders and ladders shall be avoided as far as practicable
due to the higher risk of falling and because of the higher physical efforts when using these access means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2.2
If access means according to 5.3.1 are not possible, selection of a stepladder or ladder may be
considered. The final decision shall be made on the basis of the risk assessment, including ergonomic aspects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the level of risk (see EN 1050) is considered to be too high, the basic construction of the means of access to the
machine shall be changed to allow accessways with a reduced risk to be used (see 5.3.1 and annex A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2.3
The following list presents some examples of the cases when a stepladder or ladder may be selected.
These are only examples - the final selection shall always be done case by case on the basis of risk assessment.
In most cases more than one of the conditions in the following list shall be fulfilled to make the selection of a
stepladder or ladder possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Short vertical distance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
The means of access is foreseen to be used infrequently.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
When estimating the frequency of the use, the whole life of the machinery is considered. If the means of access is to
be used frequently, e.g. during the assembly or installation of the machine or during periodical major maintenance tasks, a
stepladder or ladder is not an adequate solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
The user will not be carrying any large tools or any other equipment when using the means of access.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For the choice between stepladder and ladder see 5.5.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4
Choice among lift, ramp or stair<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The installation of a stair or ramp as means of access between two levels is always preferable to that of a
stepladder or ladder.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When selecting either a lift, ramp or stair, the following points shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
A lift may be the best solution in the following cases;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>need for frequent access of several persons;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>long vertical distances;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>heavy loads to transport;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An alternative escape route is always needed in addition to a lift.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
A ramp may be the best solution in the following cases;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>for a short vertical distance ;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>where it is necessary to transport wheeled vehicles (forklift trucks, manually moved carts etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Different angles of the ramp are depending on the use :<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>for hand carts or other manually transported wheeled vehicles, maximum angle 3 ° (particularly when
likely to be used by handicapped persons);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>for motor vehicles (e.g. forklift truck), maximum angle 7 °;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>for walking, up to 20 ° (generally and preferably not more than 10 °).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
Ramps are often preferable to stairs with only one or two steps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
The properties of the surface have very strong influence on the safety of the ramp. The surface should have very
good resistance against slipping in particular for ramps between 10 ° and 20 °.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Stairs (for detailed requirements see EN ISO 14122-3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Preferred angle of pitch is between 30 ° and 38 °.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.5
Selection between stepladder and ladder<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When making the selection between stepladder and ladder at least the following points a) and b) shall be
considered. For the detailed requirements of these means of access, see prEN ISO 14122-4:1996 (fixed ladders)
and EN ISO 14122-3 (stepladders).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Consequences on the level of safety affected by the choice of stepladders;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
if a person is coming down the stepladder and not facing it, there could be an increased risk of falling;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
if a person is using the stepladder whilst carrying small objects, there could be an increased risk of falling;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
according to EN ISO 14122-3, the maximum flight of a stepladder without a rest platform is limited;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
stepladders with an angle of pitch between 60 ° and 75 ° should only be selected due to space limits or
process requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Consequences on the level of safety affected by the choice of ladders;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
the person needs to face the ladder and also to use his hands for holding. Therefore, it is considered
highly unlikely that the user will descend facing away from the ladder;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
ladders are physically harder to use;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
according to prEN ISO 14122-4:1996 the maximum flight of ladders without a rest platform is limited;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Two main alternatives for protection of the users of fixed ladders against falls from a height are safety
cages or fall arresters:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The cage shall be the required choice, as it is a means which is always present and the actual level of
safety is independent of the operator's actions,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where it is not possible to use a cage, individual protective equipment shall be provided. The fall
arrester is only effective if the user chooses to use it. If a harness with an incompatible sliding system
is used with a guided type fall arrester, there will be a risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A fall arrester shall be designed only for low frequency and specialised access (e. g. maintenance).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE An appropriate individual fall protection device is able to arrest a fall better than a cage.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
