<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

This test shall be carried out by suitable trained operators qualified in accordance with ISO 9712,
ISO 11484 or equivalent and supervised by competent personnel nominated by the manufacturer. In the case
of third-party inspection, this shall be agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The operating authorization issued by the employer shall be according to a written procedure. Non-destructive
testing (NDT) operations shall be authorized by a level 3 NDT individual approved by the employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The definition of levels 1, 2 and 3 can be found in appropriate International Standards, e.g. ISO 9712 and
ISO 11484.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
As specified in the product standard, the test shall be executed using an ultrasonic pulse echo
technique for the detection of laminar imperfections in accordance with 5.2 or 5.3 and/or 5.4. The ultrasound
shall be transmitted in the direction normal to the tube surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
For testing in accordance with 5.2 or 5.3, the relative speed of movement during testing shall not vary
by more than  ± 10 %. For determining the extent of the laminated suspect area, adjacent suspect areas
separated by less than the smaller of the two minor axes of the laminations shall be considered as one
lamination. There may be a short length at both tube ends which cannot be tested in the case of testing in
accordance with 5.2 or 5.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any untested ends shall be dealt with in accordance with the requirements of the appropriate product
standards (see also 5.4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3
The ultrasonic test frequency that shall be applied shall be in the range of 2 MHz to 10 MHz.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4
The suggested maximum width of each transducer, or each active aperture when using phased array
transducers, should be 25 mm measured in any direction. However, manufacturers may use larger
transducers providing their capability for detecting the adopted reference standard; on request, this capability
shall be demonstrated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.5
The equipment shall be capable of classifying tubes as either acceptable or suspect by means of an
automated trigger/alarm level combined with a marking and/or sorting system.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.6
Where manual ultrasonic testing is required, this shall be carried out in accordance with Annex A.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For wall thicknesses less than 5 mm, where difficulties can occur in detecting and sizing laminar imperfections
using this method of test, an alternative method of test can be agreed on by the manufacturer and purchaser.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Full peripheral testing of seamless and welded (except SAW) tubes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During testing, the tubes and the transducer assembly shall be moved relative to each other such that the
tube surface is scanned in order to detect laminar imperfections with a size equal to or greater than the
relevant minimum lamination size,  B min , with a circumferential dimension,  C min , calculated as given in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4.2
During testing, the tubes and the probe assembly shall be moved relative to each other such that the
circumference of the tube ends is scanned from the outside surface, or the inside surface where appropriate,
over a length of approximately 25 mm or 2  T  ( T  = specified tube thickness, in millimetres), whichever is the
greater, with a maximum of 50 mm, from the point where the outside surface meets the face or bevel.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of submerged arc-welded tubes, when the weld reinforcement precludes a test for laminar
imperfections close to and over the reinforcement, a zone 25 mm on either side of the weld reinforcement

<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
The reference standards defined in this part of ISO 10893 are convenient standards for the calibration
of non-destructive testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards should not be construed as the
minimum size of imperfections detectable by such equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2
The ultrasonic equipment shall be calibrated either electronically using any tube [see 7.1 a)] or with a
reference standard comprising a flat-bottomed circular, square or rectangular recess (see Figure 1) machined
into the inner surface of a reference tube (or reference sample), with the exception that for acceptance
level U0 (see 5.2 and Table 1), only the flat-bottomed circular recess shall be used [see 7.1 b)].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The flat-bottomed circular recess shall be used as the primary means of establishing the test sensitivity. When
using one of the other types of reference standard, the test sensitivity shall be adjusted such that it is
equivalent to that obtained when using the flat-bottomed circular recess.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3
The reference recess shall be obtained by machining, spark erosion or other appropriate methods.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The bottom or the bottom corners of the recess can be rounded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4
The reference tubes shall have the same nominal diameter and thickness, same surface finish, heat
treatment and delivery conditions (e.g. as-rolled, normalized, quenched and tempered) as the tubes being
tested and shall have similar acoustic properties (e.g. sound velocity and attenuation coefficient).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Equipment calibration and checking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1
At the start of each test cycle, the equipment shall be calibrated statically either without a reference
standard in accordance with 7.1 a) or using a reference standard in accordance with 7.1 b).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Calibration without a reference standard: with the probe assembly positioned on the tube under test, the
full amplitude of the first back wall echo minus 6 dB shall be used to activate their respective trigger/alarm
level of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test sensitivity may be established with distance amplitude correction (DAC) curves as supplied by
the transducer manufacturer or DAC curves as prepared by the tube manufacturer using, in both cases,
the 6 mm flat-bottomed hole curve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manufacturer shall demonstrate that at the set sensitivity, the equipment detects under static
conditions the reference standard as given in 6.1.2 and Figure 1. If this is not the case, the necessary
adjustment in sensitivity shall be made prior to the testing of production tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Calibration using a reference standard: under static conditions, with the transducer or each transducer of
a probe assembly centrally located over the reference standard, the full signal amplitude of the signal
obtained from the reference standard shall be used to activate their respective trigger/alarm level of the
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2
During production testing, the relative rotational and/or translational speeds and pulse repetition
frequency shall be chosen to provide full surface coverage of the zone of the tube under test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3
The calibration of the equipment shall be checked at regular intervals during the production testing of
tubes of the same nominal diameter, thickness and grade.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency of checking the calibration shall be at least every 4 h, but also whenever there is an equipment
operator team changeover and at the start and end of the production run.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The equipment shall be recalibrated if any of the test parameters which were used during initial
calibration are changed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5
If, on checking during production testing, the calibration requirements are not satisfied, even after
increasing the test sensitivity by up to 3 dB to allow for system drift, all tubes tested since the previous
equipment check shall be retested after the equipment has been recalibrated, provided suitable records of the
concerned tubes are available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Acceptance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.1
Any tube producing signals lower than the trigger/alarm level shall be deemed to have passed this
test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1.2
Any tube producing signals equal to or greater than the trigger/alarm level shall be designated
suspect or, at the discretion of the manufacturer, may be retested. If, after two consecutive retests, all signals
are lower than the trigger/alarm level, the tube shall be deemed to have passed this test; otherwise, the tube
shall be designated as suspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For tube end testing, this condition only applies when the circumferential length of imperfection exceeds
6 mm, which shall be detected, if applicable, by the half-amplitude method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If applicable, the evaluation may be based on DAC curves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.1.3

(normative)
Procedure for the determination of the size of laminar imperfections
by manual ultrasonic testing<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex covers the procedure for manual ultrasonic pulse echo scanning of tubes for the determination of
the extent of laminated suspect areas found by automated/semi-automated testing for the detection of laminar
imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases of arbitration between the manufacturer and the purchaser or his representative regarding the extent
and frequency of detected laminar imperfections, this procedure shall be used. This procedure determines the
details of the sizing method to establish the extent and frequency of laminar imperfections in steel tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2 Surface condition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface of the tube shall be sufficiently free of foreign matter as to ensure the validity of the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3 Test equipment requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.1
The ultrasonic probe shall be guided over the tube surface either manually or by mechanical means.
The ultrasound shall be transmitted in the direction normal to the tube surface.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.2
One of the following two types of ultrasonic testing equipment shall be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Equipment with a screen display and gain control, adjustable in 2 dB steps. The gain control shall be
adjusted such that the ultrasonic signals from the laminated suspect area under evaluation are between
20 % and 80 % of the usable height of the screen display.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Equipment without a screen display where automated signal amplitude measurement/assessment
facilities are used. The amplitude measuring unit shall be capable of signal amplitude assessment steps
not exceeding 2 dB.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3.3
If dual transducer probes are used for manual determination of the size of the laminated suspect area,
examples of details given in Table A.1 shall be noted.<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.4 Test procedure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Laminar imperfections shall be located by comparing the amplitude of the imperfection echo with the
amplitude of the echo of a 6 mm flat-bottomed hole used during calibration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Only those imperfections giving an echo at least equivalent in amplitude to that obtained with the 6 mm flat-
bottomed hole shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to determine the extent of laminar imperfections which should be considered, the method of
measuring the half-amplitude value shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This method requires that the ultrasonic probe be passed over the laminated suspect area in a transverse
direction (for the determination of dimension  C ) and longitudinal direction (for the determination of dimension
L ). The suspect location shall be 100 % scanned. During the transverse scan, the positions  C 1  and  C 2  shall be
determined where, over the greatest circumferential extent, the magnitude of the intermediate reflection
equals half of the related maximum value (6 dB difference in signal level). If this value is less than the
minimum allowable width,  C min , which should be considered (see Table 1), no further explorations shall be
carried out. Similarly, during the longitudinal scan, the positions  L 1  and  L 2  shall be determined (see Table 2).
The distances between points  C 1  and  C 2  and  L 1  and  L 2  are defined as the maximum width and length
dimensions, respectively. The product of these dimensions is defined as the area of the equivalent laminar
imperfection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
