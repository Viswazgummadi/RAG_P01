<<HEADING level=3>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation  of  national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work  of  preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested  in  a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental,  in  liaison with ISO, also take part  in  the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters  of  electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted  in  accordance with the rules given  in  the ISO/IEC Directives, Part  2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task  of  technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated  to  the member bodies for voting. Publication as  an<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standard requires approval by at least 75  %  of  the member bodies casting a  vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention  is  drawn to the possibility that some  of  the elements  of  this document may be the subject  of  patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Hot dip galvanized coatings<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies material, process, dimensional and some performance requirements for
hot dip spun galvanized coatings applied  to  coarse threaded steel fasteners from  M8  up  to  and including M64
and for property classes up  to  and including 10.9 for bolts, screws and studs and 12 for nuts.  It  is  not
recommended to hot dip galvanize threaded fasteners  in  diameters smaller than M8 and/or with pitches below
1,25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Attention is drawn to the fact that the proof loads and stresses under proof load of oversize tapped nuts with
threads  M8  and M10 and the ultimate tensile loads and proof loads of undersize threaded bolts and screws with threads
M8  and M10 are reduced as compared  to  the values specified  in  ISO 898-2 and ISO 898-1 respectively and are specified
in  AnnexA.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It  primarily concerns the spun hot dip galvanizing  of  threaded steel fasteners, but it may also be applied to
other threaded steel parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specifications given  in  this International Standard may also be applied to non-threaded steel parts such
as washers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.1
Chemical composition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Materials as included  in  ISO 898-1 and ISO 898-2 are suitable for hot dip galvanizing except if the total
content  of  phosphorus and silicon is between 0,03  %  and 0,13  %,  in  which case high temperature galvanizing
(530°C  to  560°C)  is recommended.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1.2
Surface condition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The surface  of  the fastener, before immersion  in  the molten zinc, shall be clean and free from all contaminants
that would adversely effect the galvanizing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Hot dip galvanizing procedures  and  precautions<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1
Stress relief<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Fasteners subjected to  severe  work hardening may require stress relief before acid cleaning and hot dip
galvanizing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2
Cleaning and pickling<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Parts shall be cleaned. During the cleaning process, hydrogen could be absorbed into the steel. The hydrogen
may not effuse completely  in  the galvanizing bath and consequently, may lead to brittle failure. Unless
otherwise agreed, parts heat treated or work hardened to a hardness of  ;:,  320 HV shall be cleaned using an
inhibited acid, alkaline or mechanical process. Immersion time in the inhibited acid depends on the
as-received surface condition and should be  of  minimum duration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
An inhibited acid is an acid to which a suitable inhibitor has been added to reduce corrosive attack  on  the  steel
and absorption of hydrogen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3
Baking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If baking is carried out, it shall be carried out prior to surface activation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4
Fluxing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Parts shall be surface  activated,  and dried  if  necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5
Hot dip galvanizing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Normal temperature galvanizing  is  carried out at a bath temperature  of  455°C  to 480 °C. High temperature
galvanizing is used to produce a smoother and thinner coating and is carried out at a bath temperature of
530°C  to 560 °C. The finish obtained using the high temperature process is dull.  In  order to avoid micro-
cracks, bolts, screws and studs  of  property class 10.9 in sizes M27 and  above,  shall not be high temperature
galvanized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Galvanizing shall not be carried out at bath temperatures between  480°C  and 530 °C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.6
Spinning  and  quenching<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Parts shall be spun immediately following removal from the galvanizing bath and quenched  in  water or air
cooled depending on size consideration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7
Special  requirements  for  nuts<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nut threads and other internal threads shall be tapped after hot dip galvanizing. Retapping shall not be
permitted.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.8
Post-treatment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Most galvanized parts do not require any post treatment. When required by the purchaser, treatments such as
chromating or phosphating may be applied to reduce the possibility  of  wet storage staining (white corrosion) or
to  assist subsequent painting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6
Requirements  on  thread tolerances and additional marking<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1
General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Dimensional limits for ISO metric screw threads M10 to M64 before and after coating are specified  in
ISO  965-1  to ISO 965-5. All other dimensions and tolerances  of  fasteners apply before hot dip galvanizing.
Dimensional limits for internal and external screw threads M8 with thread tolerances 6AX and 6AZ for internal
threads and 6az for external threads are specified  in  Annex  B.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
It is not possible to check the thread tolerance of a hot dip galvanized part by stripping the coating and
gauging the thread thereafter, since some steel is dissolved from the part during the galvanizing process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2
Requirements and  precautions  in  assembling  hot  dip  galvanized threaded fasteners<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1
General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This clause applies only to parts with thread tolerances  in  accordance with ISO 965-1 to ISO 965-5 and with
marking according to the marking requirements for fasteners as given  in  ISO  898-1  and ISO 898-2. The
marking specified  in  6.2.2 and 6.2.3 shall be carried out  in  addition to the marking according to ISO 898-1 and
ISO 898-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The application  of  zinc coating by the hot dip process results  in  the deposition  of  a heavy coating thickness  of
zinc (always  in  excess  of  40  iJm).  Hence, it is necessary to manufacture screw threads to special limits  in
order  to  accommodate such heavy coatings.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are two different methods provided for, which give the necessary fundamental deviations (clearances)
for the zinc layer applied to fasteners by hot dip galvanizing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The first method (see 6.2.2) consists  of  using nuts tapped oversize to tolerance class 6AZ or 6AX after coating,
to  mate with bolts or screws manufactured with screw threads to tolerance position g or h before coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The second method (see 6.2.3) consists  of  using bolts or screws manufactured with threads undersized to
tolerance class 6az before coating, to mate with nuts tapped  to  tolerance position H or G after coating.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nuts tapped  oversize  (marked  with  Z  or  X)  shall  never  be mated  with  bolts  or  screws  with  undersized
threads (marked  with  U), because  such  combinations  create a  high  probability  of  thread  stripping.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Assembling hot dip galvanized nuts tapped  to  tolerance position H or G after coating with hot dip galvanized
bolts or screws manufactured with threads  to  tolerance position 9 or h before coating results  in  thread
interference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 10684:2004(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2.2
Nuts tapped oversize to tolerance class 6AZ or 6AX after coating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Oversize tapping  of  nuts and internal threads  to  tolerance class 6AZ or 6AX  in  accordance with  ISO  965-5  is
required after hot dip galvanizing when the mating bolts or screws or external threads are manufactured  to
tolerance position g or h  in  accordance with ISO 965-1 to ISO 965-3 before hot dip galvanizing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nuts tapped oversize shall be marked with the letter Z immediately after the property class mark  in  case  of
tolerance class 6AZ or with the letter X  in  case  of  tolerance class 6AX. See example  in  Figure  1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 1 -
Example  of  marking of hot dip galvanized nuts tapped oversize
to tolerance position 6AZ after coating<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In  order to reduce the risk  of  interference  on  assembly  of  threads with hot dip galvanized coatings, the coating
thickness on the mating bolts or screws or external threads advisably should not exceed one quarter  of  the
minimum clearance  of  the thread combination. These values are given  in  Table 1 for information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Special requirements  for  marking  when  supplying  fasteners  in  sealed  containers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If hot dip galvanized bolts or screws and mating nuts are packed together and supplied  in  the manufacturer's
sealed container, the additional marking  of  the bolts, screws or nuts as described in 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 is not
mandatory. The label on each sealed container shall indicate the additional marking as required  in  6.2.2 and
6.2.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Additional marking  of  products  or  labelling of containers as described in 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 is not mandatory for
fasteners with a special marking related to a product standard which specifies the thread tolerance for hot dip
galvanized bolts, screws, studs or nuts and, therefore, does not allow the manufacturer to choose the thread
tolerance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Coating  requirements<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1
Appearance  of  zinc  coating<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The hot dip galvanized parts shall be free from uncoated areas, blisters, flux deposits, black spots, dross<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>inclusions and other defects that would impair the intended use  of  the parts. Dull appearance shall not
constitute grounds for rejecting parts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.2
Considerations  for  hot  dip  galvanized washers<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Hot dip galvanized washers tend to bond to each other and suitable acceptance criteria should be agreed
upon at the time  of  ordering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Zinc  coating  thickness<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The local coating thickness shall be a minimum  of  40  !-1m  and the batch  average  coating thickness shall be a
minimum of 50  !-1m.  The measurement  of  the local coating thickness shall be made on measuring areas as
shown in Figure  3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Measurement  of  the local coating thickness shall be conducted by the magnetic method in accordance with
ISO 2178 on every production lot. To calculate the local coating thickness, a minimum  of  five  readings shall be
taken and  averaged.  In  case the geometry does not permit  five  readings,  five  samples shall be used to
establish the readings to be  averaged.  In  case  of  dispute, the gravimetric method  in  accordance with<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 1460 shall be used. For the calculation  of  the batch  average  coating thickness, the surface area  of  the
fastener can be evaluated according to Annex  D.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.4
Adhesion  of  zinc  coating<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The zinc coating shall adhere tenaciously to the surface  of  the base metal. The method for testing the
adherence is specified  in  Annex  E.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Special  requirements  for  bolts,  screws  and  nuts
with  thread  sizes  M8 and M10<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.1  General<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For  M8  and M10 ultimate tensile loads and proof loads lower than those specified  in  ISO 898-1 and  ISO  898-2
are specified  in  this annex taking into account the relatively large fundamental deviations according to 6.2.2
and 6.2.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For nuts tapped oversize, the reduced overlap  of  thread M8 and M10 significantly reduces the proof load
values as compared with those given  in  ISO 898-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For bolts and screws with undersized threads, the stress areas for  M8  and M10 are significantly smaller than
the stress areas given  in  ISO 898-1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A.2 Minimum  proof  loads  for  hexagon  nuts  tapped oversize  to  tolerance class 6AZ  or
6AX after coating<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>According to 6.2.2 nuts may be tapped oversize to tolerance class 6AZ or 6AX  in  accordance with  ISO  965-5
and Annex  B.  For thread sizes M8 and M10 tolerance class 6AZ gives the largest fundamental deviation.
Consequently, for thread sizes  M8  and M10 the fundamental deviations for tolerance class 6AZ are used  to
establish the proof loads as given  in  Table A.1. Stresses under proof load are given  in  Table A.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All other mechanical property requirements as given  in  ISO 898-2 are valid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A.3  Minimum  ultimate  tensile  loads and  proof  loads  for  bolts  and  screws  with
threads undersized  to  tolerance  class 6az before  coating<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>According to 6.2.3 bolts, screws and external threads have to be threaded undersize to tolerance class 6az  in
accordance with ISO 965-4 and Annex  B.  For thread sizes M8 and M10 tolerance class 6az gives large
fundamental deviations and this reduces the stress area. Consequently, for thread sizes M8 and M10, the
ultimate tensile loads and proof loads are reduced. For principles  of  calculation, see Annex  C.  The reduced
values are given  in  Tables A.3 and A.4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All other mechanical property requirements as given  in  ISO 898-1 are valid.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex gives guidance for the evaluation  of  the surface areas  of  bolts, screws and nuts which are needed
for the determination  of  the batch  average  thickness according to 8.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The surface areas given in Tables  D.1  and  D.2  apply only if agreed upon between the parties concerned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.2  Bolts and screws<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To obtain the total surface area  of  a bolt or screw, the following parameter values are necessary
(see Figure 0.1):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the surface area,  A 1,  of  a length  of  1 mm  of  the threaded shank  of  the bolt or screw;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the surface area,  A 2,  of  a length  of  1 mm  of  the unthreaded shank  of  the bolt or screw;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the surface area,  A 3,  of  the head (including surface  of  the end face).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The total surface areas,  A,  is then calculated as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A  =  A1  x  thread length  +  A2  x  shank length  +  A3<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
