<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 14344 was jointly prepared by the International Institute of Welding, Commission II,  Arc welding and filler
metals , and Technical Committee ISO/TC 44,  Welding and allied processes , Subcommittee SC 3,  Welding
consumables . IIW has been approved as an international standardizing body in the field of welding by the ISO
Council.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 14344:2002). Compared to the previous edition,
normative reference to ISO 9001 has been deleted and some lot definitions have been revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requests for official interpretations of any aspect of this International Standard should be directed to the
Secretariat of ISO/TC 44/SC 3 via your national standards body. A complete listing of these bodies can be

<<HEADING level=1>>Welding consumables — Procurement of filler materials and
fluxes<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies tools for communication between a purchaser and a supplier of welding
consumables within quality systems, such as those based upon ISO 9001 [1] .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In production, the components of welding consumables are divided into discrete, predetermined quantities so
that satisfactory tests with a sample from that quantity will establish that the entire quantity meets specification
requirements. These quantities, known by such terms as heats, lots, blends, batches and mixes, vary in size
according to the manufacturer. For identification purposes, each manufacturer assigns a unique designation to
each quantity. This designation usually consists of a series of numbers or letters, or combinations thereof,
which will enable the manufacturer to determine the date and time (or shift) of manufacture, the type and
source of the raw materials used, and the details of the procedures used in producing the welding consumable.
This designation stays with the welding consumable and can be used to identify the material later, in those
cases in which identification is necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard, together with an applicable International Standard or other standard for welding
consumables, provides a method for preparing those specific details needed for welding consumable
procurement which consist of:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the welding consumable classification (selected from the applicable International Standard or other
standard for welding consumables);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the lot classification (selected from Clause 4);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the testing schedule (selected from Clause 5).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Selection of the specific welding consumable classification, lot classification, and testing schedule depends
upon the requirements of the application for which the welding consumable is being procured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard does not apply to non-consumable electrodes or shielding gases.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2
Terms and definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this International Standard, the following terms and definitions apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1
dry batch
quantity of dry ingredients mixed at one time in one mixing vessel<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Liquid binder, when added to a dry batch, produces a wet mix. A dry batch can be divided into smaller
quantities, in which case addition of the liquid binder produces as many wet mixes as there are smaller quantities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Certification by an intermediate provider<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When another organization, not fully integrated into the production of the product, labels the product, and
hence provides certification, that organization's quality assurance system shall provide that traceability of all
data required from the original manufacturer is maintained and available. Such a programme includes
planning, documentation, testing and certification of the test results. It also includes control of the inspection
and measuring equipment, as well as control of any nonconforming material. It involves auditing of the
activities and provides for developing and implementing any corrective action that may be necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Certification by a third party<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Certification may be performed by a third party in one of two ways. The third party may actually conduct the
testing required and may provide the results of the tests. Or the third party may witness the conducting of the
tests while they are being carried out by the manufacturer or by an intermediate provider. In either case, the
third party is responsible for auditing the quality assurance system of the manufacturer or intermediate
provider.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
