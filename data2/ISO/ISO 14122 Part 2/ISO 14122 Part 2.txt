<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO
member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical
committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has
the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in
liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting.
Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this part of ISO 14122 may be the subject of
patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 3 : Stairs, stepladders and guard-rails<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part 4 : Fixed ladders.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This document is a type B standard as stated in EN 1070.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This standard is to be read in conjunction with clause 1.6.2 "Access to operating position and servicing points"
and 1.5.15 "Risk of slipping, tripping or falling" of the essential safety requirements expressed in annex A of
EN 292-2:1991/A1:1995. See also 6.2.4 "Provision for safe access to machinery" of EN 292-2:1991.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The provisions of this document may be supplemented or modified by a type C standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
For machines which are covered by the scope of a type C standard and which have been designed and built
according to the provisions of that standard, the provisions of that type C standard take precedence over the provisions of this
type B standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of this standard is to define the general requirements for safe access to machines mentioned in
EN 292-2. Part 1 of EN ISO 14122 gives advice about the correct choice of access means when the necessary
access to the machine is not possible directly from the ground level or from a floor.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The dimensions specified are consistent with established ergonomic data given in EN 547-3 "Safety of machinery -
Human body dimensions – Part 3 : Anthropometric data".<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
The use of materials other than metals (composite materials, so-called "advanced" materials, etc.) does not alter the
application of the present standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex A is informative and contains "Different methods of determining levels of slip-resistance",<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>In accordance with the values mentioned in EN 547-1 and EN 547-3 standards, unless exceptional circumstances
exist the minimum headroom over working platforms and walkways shall be 2100 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
When justified by the risk assessment and restrictions due to the machinery or environment, the clear height may be
reduced to no less than 1900 mm if:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
the working platform or walkway is used only occasionally, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
the reduction is made only for a short distance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless there are exceptional circumstances, the clear width of a walkway shall be minimum 600 mm but preferably
800 mm. When the walkway is usually subject to passage or crossing of several persons simultaneously, the width
shall be increased to 1000 mm. The width of the walkway, when designated as an escape way shall meet the
requirements of appropriate regulations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
When justified by the risk assessment and restrictions due to the machinery or environment, the free width may be
reduced to no less than 500 mm if:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the working platform or walkway is used only occasionally, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the reduction is made only for a short distance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If there are isolated obstacles on a wall or under a ceiling that restrict the required width or height, guarding shall be
provided. Moreover, safety measures, e.g. padding, shall be fitted to prevent injuries. Warning signs should also be
considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.3
Facilities or equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guard-rails in accordance with EN ISO 14122-3 shall be provided if there is a risk of falling from walkways or
working platforms from a height of 500 mm or more.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guard-rails are also required at places where there is a risk of sinking or collapsing (e.g. walkway to access to an
extraction machine on a roof).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Appropriate facilities shall be provided for handling heavy objects without rolling or placing them on working
platforms.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Hazards due to stagnation and/or accumulation of liquid<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Floorings shall be designed such that any liquids spilled on them are drained away. If this requirement is not
possible to fulfil for some special reasons, slipping and other hazards caused by the liquid shall be prevented or
minimized in some other suitable way.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.2
Hazards due to accumulated substances<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Floorings shall be made in such a way that neither dirt, snow, ice, etc. nor other substances may accumulate.
Therefore, permeable floorings such as gratings or cold formed planks are an advantage. If this is not possible and
permeable floorings are not used, facilities for removing the accumulated substances shall be provided where
necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.3
Trip hazards<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To avoid trip hazards, the greatest difference between the tops of neighbouring flooring surfaces shall not exceed
4 mm in height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Flooring<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generally, the risk assessment effects the choice of open floorings to working platforms or walkways:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>the flooring of a working platform or walkway shall only have such maximum openings that a ball with a
diameter of 35 mm cannot fall through;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>floorings above a place where people are working, as opposed to occasional passage, shall have such
maximum openings that a ball with a diameter of 20 mm cannot fall through unless the same safety is
guaranteed by other suitable means.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where the risk assessment concludes that hazards caused by objects or other materials falling or
passing through the flooring are more significant than the slipping, falling, etc. hazards, the flooring shall have
no opening.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Joints<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Between the edges of floorings and adjacent construction elements or opening edges required to suit elements
fitted in the openings e.g. piping, bins or supports, a toe plate is necessary if the distance between flooring and
element exceeds 30 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.5
Falling through flooring hazard<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If flooring is made of detachable elements, i.e. removable, e.g. where required for maintenance of auxiliary
equipment mounted below flooring:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
any hazardous movement of these elements shall be prevented e.g. by fasteners;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—
it shall be possible to inspect fixings in order to detect any corrosion or any hazardous loosening or change of
position of clamps.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.4.6
Slip hazards<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Floorings shall have a surface finish which is designed to reduce the risk of slipping. Whilst waiting for the
European standards on enhanced slip resistance, see informative annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>—
1,5 kN concentrated load applied in the most unfavourable position over a concentrated load area
of 200 mm x 200 mm for the flooring.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When loaded with the design load, the deflection of the flooring shall not exceed 1/200 th   of the span and the
difference between the loaded and a neighbouring unloaded flooring shall not exceed 4 mm in height.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
