<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Non-destructive testing of steel tubes —<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>Part 5:
Magnetic particle inspection of seamless and welded
ferromagnetic steel tubes for the detection of surface
imperfections<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 10893 specifies requirements for magnetic particle inspection of seamless and welded
ferromagnetic steel tubes for the detection of surface imperfections on the tube body and the end/bevel face
at the ends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the tube body, it specifies requirements for the detection of surface imperfections on all or part of the
outside surface of tubes. However, by agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, it can be
applicable to the inside surface over a limited length from the ends of tubes, dependent on the tube diameter.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition, this part of ISO 10893 can be used, as appropriate, to locate the position of external surface
imperfections detected by another non-destructive testing method (e.g. ultrasonic) prior to dressing of the tube
surface, and to ensure complete removal of the imperfection after dressing is complete.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the end/bevel face at the ends of plain-end and beveled-end tubes,   this part of ISO 10893 specifies
requirements for the detection of laminar imperfections which can interfere with subsequent fabrication and
inspection operations (e.g. welding and ultrasonic inspection of the welds).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 10893 is applicable to the detection of imperfections, other than laminar imperfections, on the
end/bevel face. In this case, magnetization is applied in the direction essentially perpendicular to the
orientation of the particular imperfections being detected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It can also be applicable to the testing of hollow sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 10893-5:2011(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.1
Inspection area (the tube body or end/bevel face) and inspection direction (longitudinal or transverse)
shall be as specified in the product standards or purchaser order.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
The entire outside surface of each tube or part of it, as required, shall be inspected using the
magnetic particle method, for the detection of longitudinal and/or transverse surface imperfections, using a.c.
or d.c. magnetization, as appropriate to the magnetic particle technique adopted. In the case of end/bevel
testing, the use of dry magnetic powder is only permitted by prior agreement between the purchaser and
manufacturer. Otherwise, the requirements given in ISO 9934-1, ISO 9934-2 and ISO 9934-3 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.3
The detecting media shall be applied simultaneously with magnetization to reveal the presence of
surface imperfections, using an illumination of not less than 500 lux.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The use of residual magnetism, i.e. application of magnetic particles after initial tube magnetization, is only
permitted after prior agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, but generally not permitted in the
case of end/bevel face testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In cases where there is insufficient sensitivity due, for instance, either to poor contrast between the detecting
media and the part of the tube surface under inspection or as a result of the magnetization technique adopted,
the tube area being tested shall, prior to inspection, be coated with a white background paint to aid contrast.
Alternatively, fluorescent particles shall be used and the inspection carried out in a darkened area using a
UV-A radiation source, with a background white light level not exceeding 20 lux and a black light intensity of at
least 10 W/m 2 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4
It is outside the scope of this part of ISO 10893 to specify the levels of magnetization required, and
current levels required to achieve such levels of magnetization, to reveal the presence of unacceptable
surface imperfections. However, in all cases, the magnetization requirements together with the use of
detecting media (with the exception in 5.1.2) given in ISO 9934-1, ISO 9934-2 and ISO 9934-3 shall apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.5
During the production testing of tubes, the level of magnetization achieved using the adopted
technique and equipment shall be checked at regular intervals, not exceeding 4 h, for example using a
magnetic field strength meter, as appropriate. In the case of end/bevel testing, alternatively, a reference tube
containing either an artificial simulation of, or a naturally occurring laminar imperfection on, the end/bevel face
may be used, where the manufacturer shall demonstrate the presence of a consistent indication of the
imperfection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Testing the tube body<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the production testing of tubes, magnetization shall be applied in the circumferential direction for the
detection of longitudinal surface imperfections or in the direction parallel to the major axis of the tube for the
detection of transverse surface imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2.2 Magnetization methods<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For testing the tube body one of the following magnetization methods shall be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Method A — Current flow method<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The current derived from a d.c., a.c., full or half-wave rectified a.c. external power source is passed between
two contact areas on the surface of the tube. This method is intended for the detection of imperfections which
lie generally parallel to the major axis of the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 10893-5:2011(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Method B — Threaded bar/cable method<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The current (as in method A) is passed through a rigid bar or flexible cable placed within the tube bore and
approximately concentric with it. This method is intended (as in method A) for the detection of imperfections
which lie generally parallel to the major axis of the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Method C — Encircling coil method<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A rigid or semi-rigid current-carrying coil is placed around the tube and the surface of the tube within the
influence of the coil is magnetized in the direction parallel to the major axis of the tube, favouring the detection
of generally transverse imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
Method D — Magnetic flow method<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The tube, or part of it, forms part of the magnetic circuit of an electromagnet which carries current from an
external power source (as in method A). This method favours the detection of imperfections lying at right
angles to an imaginary line connecting the poles pieces of the electromagnet.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other magnetization techniques or combinations of the techniques given in 5.2.2 a) to 5.2.2 d) may be used
provided the requirements for field strength and direction are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Testing the end/bevel face<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.1
During the production testing of the end/bevel face at both ends, magnetization shall, at the discretion
of the manufacturer, be applied either parallel to the major axis of the tube or radially through the tube
thickness; simultaneously, the detecting media shall be applied to the end/bevel face, to reveal the presence
of laminar imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.2
When using magnetization parallel to the major axis of the tube, this shall be achieved using a rigid
concentric coil surrounding or inside the tube, positioned close to the tube end. The coil shall be energized
using an alternating or a half- or full-wave rectified or direct current source. In this case, it shall be
demonstrated by a measuring device that the induced currents in the tube wall produce a magnetic flux
perpendicular to the surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, the current flow method may be used by passing current around the tube circumference using
clamps on the tube end that are 180° apart. After inspection, the test shall be repeated after rotating the
clamps by 90° with respect to their initial position. In this case, but only by agreement between the purchaser
and manufacturer, it is permissible to conduct the test using residual magnetization and fluorescent particles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3.3
When using magnetization applied radially through the thickness of the tube at the ends, this shall be
achieved using an a.c. or d.c. yoke, with the pole pieces applied radially between the inner and outer surface
of the tube across the tube thickness at the ends. By agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer,

<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Special requirements for evaluation of indications in the pipe body<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The magnetic particle inspection method does not make it possible to determine the nature, shape, orientation
and, more particularly, the depth of surface imperfections revealed as indications. The dimensions and extent
of magnetic particle “build-up” of indications do not directly represent the actual dimensions of the surface
imperfection causing the indication. For these reasons, the classification/evaluation of magnetic particle
indications shall be as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
linear indications: indications where the length of the indication is equal to or more than three times the
width of the indication;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
rounded indications: indications which are circular or elliptical in shape, where the length of the indication
is less than three times the width of the indication;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
accumulated indications: indications which are linear or rounded and are aligned or clustered with a
separation of not more than the length of the smallest indication   and consisting of at least three indications;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
non-relevant indications: indications which may result from localized surface irregularities to a particular
tube-making process, for example machining marks, scratches and sizing/straightening marks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum dimension of indications that shall be considered during the evaluation shall be as given in
Table 1, in relation to the acceptance level specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Only relevant indications with their major dimension equal to or greater than that given in Table 1 shall be
taken into account when determining the incidence of such indications, according to the appropriate
acceptance level. Non-relevant indications are not to be considered during evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Relevant indications obtained by magnetic particle inspection in accordance with this part of ISO 10893 shall
be evaluated and classified as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For general testing of tube surfaces, either of the entire surface or a localized area, an imaginary frame
aperture of 100 mm  ×  150 mm shall be placed over the area with the highest incidence of relevant
indications. The indications shall be classified with regard to the type, number and dimensions of the
indications within the frame, according to the appropriate acceptance level given in Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
For testing the weld seam of a welded tube, an imaginary frame aperture of 50 mm  ×  150 mm, with the
weld centred on the 50 mm dimension of the frame aperture, shall be placed over the area with the
highest incidence of relevant indications. The indications shall be classified with regard to the type,
number and dimensions of the indications within the frame, according to the appropriate acceptance level
given in Table 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
For calculating the cumulative length of accumulated indications, the length along the major axis of linear
and rounded indications shall be used, and in cases where the separation between two adjacent
indications is less than the length or the diameter of the larger of the two indications, the indications shall
be considered as one and the sum of the individual lengths or diameters plus the separation shall be
used to calculate the overall length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 Tube body<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubes or parts of tubes not showing indications in excess of those permitted by the corresponding acceptance
level shall be deemed to have passed the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Tubes or parts of tubes showing indications in excess of those permitted by the corresponding acceptance
level shall be designated suspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For suspect tubes, one or more of the following actions shall be taken:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the suspect area shall be dressed or explored using a suitable method. After checking that the remaining
thickness is within the tolerance limits, the tube shall be retested as previously specified. If no indications are
obtained equal to or greater than the acceptance Ievel, the tube shall be deemed to have passed this test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>By agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer the suspect area may be retested by other non-
destructive techniques and test methods to agreed acceptance levels;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the suspect area shall be cropped off;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the tube shall be deemed not to have passed the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 End/bevel face<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any tube producing either no indication at all or an individual indication of laminar imperfections on the end/bevel
face at both ends of the tube, less than 6 mm in circumference, shall be deemed to have passed the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any tube producing an individual indication of a laminar imperfection on the end/bevel face at either end of the
tube, equal to or greater than 6 mm in circumference, shall be designated suspect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For a suspect tube, the manufacturer may either reject the tube or machine the end/bevel face(s). In the latter
case, the manufacturer shall ensure that, as a result of re-machining the tube end(s), the detected laminar
imperfection(s) has (have) been removed, and shall subject the re-machined end/bevel face to a repeat test
as specified above, using the same magnetic particle technique, etc. as in the original test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To facilitate the determination of how far the detected laminar imperfection(s) on the end/face bevel extend
along the length of the tube from the tube end, the manufacturer may carry out an ultrasonic test over the tube
end zone, in accordance with ISO 10893-8.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8
