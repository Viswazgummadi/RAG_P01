<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The performance of protective coatings of paint and related products applied to steel is significantly affected
by the state of the steel surface immediately prior to painting. The principal factors that are known to influence
this performance are<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the presence of rust and mill scale,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the presence of surface contaminants, including salts, dust, oils and greases, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) the surface profile.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 8501, ISO 8502 and ISO 8503 have been prepared to provide methods of assessing these factors, while
ISO 8504 provides guidance on the preparation methods that are available for cleaning steel substrates,
indicating the capabilities of each in attaining specified levels of cleanliness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These International Standards do not contain recommendations for the protective coating systems to be
applied to the steel surface. Neither do they contain recommendations for the surface quality requirements for
specific situations even though surface quality can have a direct influence on the choice of protective coating
to be applied and on its performance. Such recommendations are found in other documents such as national
standards and codes of practice. It will be necessary for the users of these International Standards to ensure
that the qualities specified are<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  compatible and appropriate both for the environmental conditions to which the steel will be exposed and
for the protective coating system to be used, and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  within the capability of the cleaning procedure specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The four International Standards referred to above deal with the following aspects of preparation of steel
substrates before application of paints and related products:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  ISO 8501 on visual assessment of surface cleanliness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  ISO 8502 on tests for the assessment of surface cleanliness;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  ISO 8503 on surface roughness characteristics of blast-cleaned steel substrates;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  ISO 8504 on surface preparation methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Each of these International Standards is in turn divided into separate parts. This part of ISO 8502 describes a
method for the assessment of chloride-containing salts that are readily soluble in water and are present on a
steel surface. Rusted steel substrates, particularly of rust grades C or D (see ISO 8501-1), even when blast
cleaned to preparation grade Sa 3 (see ISO 8501-1) can still be contaminated by soluble salts and corrosion
products. These compounds are almost colourless and are localized at the lowest point of the rust pits. If they
are not removed prior to painting, chemical reactions can result in large accumulations of rust that destroy the
adhesion between the substrate and the applied protective coating. Even if the salt is readily soluble in water,
it is often impossible to remove it completely from the surface by a simple washing such as that described in
this procedure. The method does not therefore determine the total amount of chloride on the surface but gives
an indication of the cleanliness level of the surface. Prolonging the washing time should remove a larger
proportion of the salt.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 8502 describes a method for the determination of chloride-containing salts that are readily
soluble in water and are present on a steel surface. The method is also applicable to previously coated
surfaces. It will normally be used in a laboratory using washings sampled from surfaces on site.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The method is applicable to the determination of salts that have been deposited on the steel surface before,
during or after the cleaning operations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
ISO 8502-5, Preparation of steel substrates before application of paints and related products — Tests for the
assessment of surface cleanliness — Part 5: Measurement of chloride on steel surfaces prepared for painting (ion
detection tube method) , describes a field test for the determination of chloride on a surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
Although the procedure for chloride determination is generally accurate, the overall precision of the method is
limited by uncertainties in the sampling procedure. In addition, traces of iron chloride at the bottom of pits are difficult to
extract into the sample.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 3
The performance of a paint system is affected by the amount of soluble chloride remaining on the surface. The
acceptable level of this contamination is related to the service conditions. For further information regarding levels of water-
soluble salt contamination see ISO/TR 15235  [1] .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
