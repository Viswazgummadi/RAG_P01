<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards
bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out
through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical
committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work.
ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of
electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard provides the fundamental concepts, principles and vocabulary for quality
management systems (QMS) and provides the foundation for other QMS standards. This International
Standard is intended to help the user to understand the fundamental concepts, principles and
vocabulary of quality management, in order to be able to effectively and efficiently implement a QMS
and realize value from other QMS standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard proposes a well-defined QMS, based on a framework that integrates
established fundamental concepts, principles, processes and resources related to quality, in order
to help organizations realize their objectives. It is applicable to all organizations, regardless of size,
complexity or business model. Its aim is to increase an organization’s awareness of its duties and
commitment in fulfilling the needs and expectations of its customers and interested parties, and in
achieving satisfaction with its products and services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard contains seven quality management principles supporting the fundamental
concepts described in  2.2 . In  2.3 , for each quality management principle, there is a “statement”
describing each principle, a “rationale” explaining why the organization would address the principle,
“key benefits” that are attributed to the principles, and “possible actions” that an organization can take
in applying the principle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard contains the terms and definitions that apply to all quality management
and QMS standards developed by ISO/TC 176, and other sector-specific QMS standards based on those
standards, at the time of publication. The terms and definitions are arranged in conceptual order, with
an alphabetical index provided at the end of the document.  Annex A  includes a set of diagrams of the
concept systems that form the concept ordering.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Guidance on some additional frequently-used words in the QMS standards developed by ISO/TC 176,
and which have an identified dictionary meaning, is provided in a glossary available at:  http://www.iso.

<<HEADING level=1>>Quality management systems — Fundamentals and
vocabulary<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1	 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard describes the fundamental concepts and principles of quality management
which are universally applicable to the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 organizations seeking sustained success through the implementation of a quality management system;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 customers seeking confidence in an organization’s ability to consistently provide products and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>services conforming to their requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 organizations seeking confidence in their supply chain that product and service requirements will<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>be met;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 organizations and interested parties seeking to improve communication through a common<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>understanding of the vocabulary used in quality management;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 organizations performing conformity assessments against the requirements of ISO 9001;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 providers of training, assessment or advice in quality management;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 developers of related standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies the terms and definitions that apply to all quality management
and quality management system standards developed by ISO/TC 176.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2	 Fundamental concepts and quality management principles<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.1	 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality management concepts and principles described in this International Standard give
the organization the capacity to meet challenges presented by an environment that is profoundly
different from recent decades. The context in which an organization works today is characterized by
accelerated change, globalization of markets and the emergence of knowledge as a principal resource.
The impact of quality extends beyond customer satisfaction: it can also have a direct impact on the
organization’s reputation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Society has become better educated and more demanding, making interested parties increasingly
more influential. By providing fundamental concepts and principles to be used in the development of
a quality management system (QMS), this International Standard provides a way of thinking about the
organization more broadly.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All concepts, principles and their interrelationships should be seen as a whole and not in isolation of
each other. No individual concept or principle is more important than another. At any one time, finding
the right balance in application is critical.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>2.2	 Fundamental concepts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An organization focused on quality promotes a culture that results in the behaviour, attitudes, activities
and processes that deliver value through fulfilling the needs and expectations of customers and other
relevant interested parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.1
Quality<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality of an organization’s products and services is determined by the ability to satisfy customers
and the intended and unintended impact on relevant interested parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality of products and services includes not only their intended function and performance, but
also their perceived value and benefit to the customer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A QMS comprises activities by which the organization identifies its objectives and determines the
processes and resources required to achieve desired results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.2
Quality management system<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The QMS manages the interacting processes and resources required to provide value and realize results
for relevant interested parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The QMS enables top management to optimize the use of resources considering the long and short term
consequences of their decision.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A QMS provides the means to identify actions to address intended and unintended consequences in
providing products and services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Understanding the context of the organization is a process. This process determines factors which
influence the organization’s purpose, objectives and sustainability. It considers internal factors such as
values, culture, knowledge and performance of the organization. It also considers external factors such
as legal, technological, competitive, market, cultural, social and economic environments.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.3
Context of an organization<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of the ways in which an organization’s purpose can be expressed include its vision, mission,
policies and objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The concept of interested parties extends beyond a focus solely on the customer. It is important to
consider all relevant interested parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.4
Interested parties<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Part of the process for understanding the context of the organization is to identify its interested parties.
The relevant interested parties are those that provide significant risk to organizational sustainability if
their needs and expectations are not met. Organizations define what results are necessary to deliver to
those relevant interested parties to reduce that risk.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organizations attract, capture and retain the support of the relevant interested parties they depend
upon for their success.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.5
Support<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Top management support of the QMS and engagement of people enables:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.5.1

<<PARAGRAPH>>Responsible acquisition, deployment, maintenance, enhancement and disposal of resources support the
organization in achieving its objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>People are essential resources within the organization. The performance of the organization is
dependent upon how people behave within the system in which they work.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.5.2
People<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Within an organization, people become engaged and aligned through a common understanding of the
quality policy and the organization’s desired results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A QMS is most effective when all employees understand and apply the skills, training, education and
experience needed to perform their roles and responsibilities. It is the responsibility of top management
to provide opportunities for people to develop these necessary competencies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.2.5.3

<<HEADING level=3>>2.4	 Developing the QMS using fundamental concepts and principles<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.1
QMS model<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organizations share many characteristics with humans as a living and learning social organism. Both
are adaptive and comprise interacting systems, processes and activities. In order to adapt to their
varying context, each needs the ability to change. Organizations often innovate to achieve breakthrough
improvements. An organization’s QMS model recognizes that not all systems, processes and activities
can be predetermined; therefore it needs to be flexible and adaptable within the complexities of the
organizational context.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.1.1
General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Organizations seek to understand the internal and external context to identify the needs and
expectations of relevant interested parties. This information is used in the development of the QMS
to achieve organizational sustainability. The outputs from one process can be the inputs into other
processes and are interlinked into the overall network. Although often appearing to be comprised of
similar processes, each organization and its QMS is unique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.1.2
System<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization has processes that can be defined, measured and improved. These processes interact
to deliver results consistent with the organization’s objectives and cross functional boundaries. Some
processes can be critical while others are not. Processes have interrelated activities with inputs to
deliver outputs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.1.3
Processes<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>People collaborate within a process to carry out their daily activities. Some activities are prescribed
and depend on an understanding of the objectives of the organization, while others are not and react to
external stimuli to determine their nature and execution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.1.4
Activity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A QMS is a dynamic system that evolves over time through periods of improvement. Every organization
has quality management activities, whether they have been formally planned or not. This International
Standard provides guidance on how to develop a formal system to manage these activities. It is
necessary to determine activities which already exist in the organization and their suitability regarding
the context of the organization. This International Standard, along with ISO 9004 and ISO 9001, can
then be used to assist the organization to develop a cohesive QMS.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.2
Development of a QMS<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A formal QMS provides a framework for planning, executing, monitoring and improving the performance
of quality management activities. The QMS does not need to be complicated; rather it needs to accurately<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 9000:2015(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>﻿<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>reflect the needs of the organization. In developing the QMS, the fundamental concepts and principles
given in this International Standard can provide valuable guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>QMS planning is not a singular event, rather it is an ongoing process. Plans evolve as the organization
learns and circumstances change. A plan takes into account all quality activities of the organization and
ensures that it covers all guidance of this International Standard and requirements of ISO 9001. The
plan is implemented upon approval.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is important for an organization to regularly monitor and evaluate both the implementation of the
plan and the performance of the QMS. Carefully considered indicators facilitate these monitoring and
evaluation activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Auditing is a means of evaluating the effectiveness of the QMS, in order to identify risks and to
determine the fulfilment of requirements. In order for audits to be effective, tangible and intangible
evidence needs to be collected. Actions are taken for correction and improvement based upon analysis
of the evidence gathered. The knowledge gained could lead to innovation, taking QMS performance to
higher levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The approaches to a QMS described in QMS standards developed by ISO/TC 176, in other management
system standards and in organizational excellence models are based on common principles. They all
enable an organization to identify risks and opportunities and contain guidance for improvement. In
the current context, many issues such as innovation, ethics, trust and reputation could be regarded as
parameters within the QMS. Standards related to quality management (e.g. ISO 9001), environmental
management (e.g. ISO 14001) and energy management (e.g. ISO 50001), as well as other management
standards and organizational excellence models, have addressed this.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2.4.3
QMS standards, other management systems and excellence models<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The QMS standards developed by ISO/TC  176 provide a comprehensive set of requirements and
guidelines for a QMS. ISO 9001 specifies requirements for a QMS. ISO 9004 provides guidance on a
wide range of objectives of a QMS for sustainable success and improved performance. Guidelines for
components of a QMS include ISO  10001, ISO  10002, ISO  10003, ISO  10004, ISO  10008, ISO  10012
and ISO 19011. Guidelines for technical subjects in support of a QMS include ISO 10005, ISO 10006,
ISO  10007, ISO  10014, ISO  10015, ISO  10018 and ISO 10019. Technical reports in support of a QMS
include ISO/TR 10013 and ISO/TR 10017. Requirements for a QMS are also provided in sector-specific
standards, such as ISO/TS 16949.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The various parts of an organization’s management system, including its QMS, can be integrated as a
single management system. The objectives, processes and resources related to quality, growth, funding,
profitability, environment, occupational health and safety, energy, security and other aspects of the
organization can be more effectively and efficiently achieved and used when the QMS is integrated
with other management systems. The organization can perform an integrated audit of its management
system against the requirements of multiple International Standards, such as ISO  9001, ISO  14001,
ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 50001.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The ISO handbook “The integrated use of management system standards” can provide useful guidance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Concept relationships and their graphical representation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1	 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In terminology work, the relationships between concepts are based on the hierarchical formation of the
characteristics of a species so that the most economical description of a concept is formed by naming its
species and describing the characteristics that distinguish it from its parent or sibling concepts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are three primary forms of concept relationships indicated in this annex: generic (see  Clause A.2 ),
partitive (see  Clause A.3 ) and associative (see  Clause A.4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2	 Generic relation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Subordinate concepts within the hierarchy inherit all the characteristics of the superordinate concept
and contain descriptions of these characteristics which distinguish them from the superordinate (parent)
and coordinate (sibling) concepts, e.g. the relation of spring, summer, autumn and winter to season.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Generic relations are depicted by a fan or tree diagram without arrows (see  Figure A.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>Figure A.1 — Graphical representation of a generic relation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3	 Partitive relation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Subordinate concepts within the hierarchy form constituent parts of the superordinate concept, e.g.
spring, summer, autumn and winter can be defined as parts of the concept year. In comparison, it is
inappropriate to define sunny weather (one possible characteristic of summer) as part of a year.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Partitive relations ar e depicted by a rake without arrows (see  Figure A.2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Associative relations cannot provide the economies in description that are present in generic and
partitive relations but are helpful in identifying the nature of the relationship between one concept and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
