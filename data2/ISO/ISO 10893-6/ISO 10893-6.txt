<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4
General requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1
Unless otherwise specified by the product standard or agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer, a
radiographic inspection shall be carried out on tubes after completion of all the  primary production process
operations (rolling, heat treating, cold and hot working, sizing, primary straightening, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
This inspection shall be carried out by trained operators qualified in accordance with ISO 9712,
ISO 11484 or equivalent, and supervised by competent personnel nominated by the manufacturer. In the case
of third-party inspection, this shall be agreed on between the purchaser and manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The operating authorization issued by the employer shall be according to a written procedure. NDT operations
shall be authorized by a level 3 NDT individual approved by the employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The definitions of level 1, 2 and 3 can be found in appropriate International Standards, e.g. ISO 9712 and
ISO 11484.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3
The tubes under test shall be sufficiently straight and free of foreign matter as to ensure the validity of
the test. The surfaces of the weld seam and adjacent parent metal shall be sufficiently free of such foreign
matter and surface irregularities which can interfere with the interpretation of the radiographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surface grinding is permitted in order to achieve an acceptable surface finish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4
In cases where the weld reinforcement is removed, markers, usually in the form of lead arrows, shall be
placed on each side of the weld such that its position can be identified on the radiograph.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5
Identification symbols, usually in the form of lead letters, shall be placed on each section of the weld
beam radiograph such that the images of these symbols appear in the radiograph to ensure unequivocal
identification of the section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6
Permanent markings shall be provided on the source side of the tube surface to provide reference
points for the accurate relocation of the position of each radiograph. Where the nature of the product or its
intended service conditions render stamping impossible, other suitable means shall be provided for relocating
the radiographs, e.g. by paint marking or reference to accurate sketches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 10893-6:2011(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.7
When carrying out radiography of a continuous length of a weld with separate films, adjacent films shall
overlap by at least 10 mm to ensure that no portion of the weld length remains unexamined.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
The weld of longitudinally or helically welded tubes shall be radiographically tested using the X-ray film
technique. The application of non-film, digital radiographic techniques shall conform to ISO 10893-7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2
Two image quality classes A and B, in accordance with ISO 17636, shall be specified:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  class A: X-ray examination technique with standard sensitivity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  class B: X-ray examination technique with enhanced sensitivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Most applications are covered by the use of image quality class A. Image quality class B is intended for more
important and difficult applications where image quality class A can be insufficiently sensitive to reveal all the
imperfections being detected. Image quality class B requires the use of film system class C4 or higher (fine grain films and
lead screens) and, therefore, generally requires a longer exposure time. The required image quality class is usually stated
in the relevant product standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.3
The film system class used shall be at least film system class C5 for image quality class A and shall be
at least C4 (C3 for X-ray voltage  <  150 kV) for image quality class B. (The classes are defined in ISO 5579,
ISO 11699-1 and ISO 17636.)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The front intensifying metal screen, for both image quality class B and image quality class A, shall have a
thickness of between 0,02 mm and 0,25 mm. Other thicknesses may be adopted for the back intensifying
screen. In cases where a double film technique is used, both intensifying screens, if used, shall be in the
upper thickness range of the front intensifying screen.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.4
Salt intensifying screens shall not be used.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5
The amount of back-scattered and internally scattered X-ray radiation absorbed by the film shall be
minimized.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If there is doubt regarding the adequacy of protection from back-scattered X-ray radiation, a characteristic
symbol (typically, a 10 mm high lead letter, typically “B” and 1,5 mm thick) shall be attached to the back of the
cassette or film holder and a radiograph shall be made in the normal manner. When the image of this symbol
appears on the radiograph at a lighter density than the background, it is an indication that protection against
back-scattered X-ray radiation is insufficient and it is essential that additional precautions be taken.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6
The beam of radiation shall be directed at the centre of the section of the weld seam under examination
and shall be normal to the tube surface at that point.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.7
The diagnostic length shall be such that the increase in penetrated thickness at the ends of the useful
length of a radiograph shall not exceed the penetrated thickness at the centre of the radiograph by more than
10 % for image quality class B or by more than 20 % for image quality class A, provided the conditions
specified in 5.11 and Clause 8 are not compromised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.8
The single wall penetration technique shall be used. If this technique is impracticable for dimensional
reasons, use of the double wall penetration technique is permitted by agreement.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.9
The separation between the film and the weld surface shall be as small as possible.<<HEADING_END>>

under examination is not less than 2,3 for image quality class B and not less than 2,0 for image quality class A.
Fog density shall not exceed 0,3. Fog density (here) is defined as the total density (emulsion and base) of a
processed, unexposed film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Image quality<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1
The image quality shall be determined by the use of a mild steel image quality indicator (IQI) of the type
specified in ISO 19232-1 or ISO 19232-2, and agreed on between the purchaser and the manufacturer. The
IQI shall be placed on the surface facing the source of radiation, on the parent material   adjacent to the weld
(see Figures 3 and 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The IQI shall only be placed on the film side when the surface facing the radiation source is inaccessible. In
these circumstances, a letter “F” shall be placed near the IQI and this procedural change recorded in the test
report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For further details, see ISO 19232-1, ISO 19232-2 and ISO 17636.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Defects are imperfections with a size and/or population density greater than the specified acceptance
limits. Defects are considered to adversely affect or limit the intended use of the tubes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10 Acceptance limits<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1  Acceptance limits are applicable to radiographic examination of the weld seam and specified in 10.2 to
10.6, unless alternative requirements are specified in the product standards.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2  Cracks, incomplete penetration and lack of fusion are not acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3  Individual circular slag inclusions and gas pockets up to 3,0 mm or  T /3 in diameter ( T  = specified wall
thickness), whichever is the smaller, are acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sum of the diameters of all such permitted individual imperfections in any 150 mm or 12 T  of weld length,
whichever is the smaller, shall not exceed 6,0 mm or 0,5 T , whichever is the smaller, where the separation
between individual inclusions is less than 4 T .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4  Individual elongated slag inclusions up to 12,0 mm or  T  in length, whichever is the smaller, or up to
1,5 mm in width are acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accumulated length of such permitted individual imperfections in any 150 mm or 12 T  of weld length,
whichever is the smaller, shall not exceed 12,0 mm where the separation between individual inclusions is less
than 4 T .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For information, the criteria specified in 10.3 and 10.4 are shown diagrammatically in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5  Individual undercuts of any length having a maximum depth of 0,4 mm and not encroaching on the
minimum wall thickness are acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Individual undercuts of a maximum length of  T /2 having a maximum depth of 0,5 mm and not exceeding 10 %
of the specified wall thickness are acceptable, provided there are not more than two such undercuts in any
300 mm of the weld length, and all such undercuts are dressed out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6  Undercuts on the inside and outside welds which are coincident in the longitudinal direction are not
acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
