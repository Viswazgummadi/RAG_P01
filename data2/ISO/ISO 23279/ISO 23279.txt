<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 23279 was prepared by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Technical Committee
TC 121,  Welding , in collaboration with ISO Technical Committee TC 44,  Welding and allied processes ,
Subcommittee SC 5,   Testing and inspection of welds , in accordance with the Agreement on technical
cooperation between ISO and CEN (Vienna Agreement).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 23279:2007), which has been technically
revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Non-destructive testing of welds — Ultrasonic testing —
Characterization of indications in welds<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies how to characterize embedded indications by classifying them as planar
or non-planar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This procedure is also suitable for indications that break the surface after removal of the weld reinforcement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2
Normative references<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document. For dated
references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced
document (including any amendments) applies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 17640,  Non-destructive testing of welds — Ultrasonic testing — Techniques, testing levels, and
assessment<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3
Principle<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Classification of indications as planar or non-planar is based on several parameters:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) welding techniques;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) geometrical position of the indication;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) maximum echo amplitude;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) directional reflectivity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) echostatic pattern (i.e. A-scan);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
echodynamic pattern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The process of classification involves examining each of the parameters against all the others in order to
arrive at an accurate conclusion.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For guidance, Figure A.1 gives the classification of internal weld indications suitable for general applications.
Figure A.1 should be applied in conjunction with the two first parameters listed above and not taken in
isolation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The classification procedure specified in this International Standard is also suitable for indications that are
surface breaking after removal of the weld reinforcement (see Figure 1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The classification is carried out by the successive application of several discriminatory criteria to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) echo amplitude;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) directional reflectivity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) echostatic pattern (A-scan);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) echodynamic pattern.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These criteria are applied using a flowchart procedure (see Annex A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recommended that the same probes be used for detection of indications and for classification. The
flowchart procedure standardizes a system of classification. Several thresholds are defined in decibels by a
comparison with the distance amplitude curve (DAC) or by a comparison between the maximum echo heights
from the discontinuity when tested from different directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Proposed thresholds for the different stages in the flowchart procedure are given in Table A.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The flowchart procedure calls for five stages:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) stage 1: to avoid the classification of indications with very low echo amplitudes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) stage 2: to classify all indications with high echo amplitude as planar;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c) stage 3: primarily to classify lack of fusion;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) stage 4: primarily to classify inclusions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e) stage 5: primarily to classify cracks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Indications resulting from a combination of an inclusion and lack of fusion are classified as planar by the
flowchart procedure. An example of this type of flaw is given in Figure A.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Echo amplitude criteria (stages 1 and 2)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.1
Low amplitudes (stage 1)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is accepted that an indication with an echo amplitude lower than the evaluation level as specified in
ISO 11666  [1]  (defined as  T 1  in Figure A.1) is not significant and shall not be characterized.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For special applications, this value  T 1  may be lowered, if defined by specification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2.2
High amplitudes (stage 2)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is assumed that an indication with an echo amplitude that is at least equal to the reference level plus 6 dB
(defined as  T 2  in Figure A.1) is a planar indication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Directional reflectivity criteria (stage 3)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.1
Applicability based on length<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stage 3 of the flowchart procedure shall be applied only to those indications exceeding:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
t  for the range of thicknesses 8 mm  u   t  u  15 mm;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
t /2 or 15 mm, whichever is the larger, for thicknesses over 15 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For indications not exceeding the specified length proceed to stage 4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.2
Application conditions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following application conditions apply:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
echoes compared shall be obtained from the same reflector;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the comparison shall be made at the position where echo height,  H d, max , is the highest along the
indication;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
when a straight beam probe and an angle beam probe are used, their frequencies shall be chosen to give
similar wavelengths (e.g. 4 MHz for longitudinal waves and 2 MHz for shear waves);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
when two or more probe angles are used, the differences between the nominal refraction angles shall be
equal to or greater than 10°;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
if the comparison is made between a beam passing through the weld and a beam passing through the
base material only, the attenuation of the weld shall be taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3.3
Criteria<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The highest echo amplitude,  H d, max , obtained from the indication is compared to the minimum echo amplitude,
H d, min , obtained from all the other directions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To satisfy the directional reflectivity, the following conditions shall be fulfilled simultaneously:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
H d, max  is greater than or equal to  T 3  (the reference level minus 6 dB);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the modulus of the difference in indication echo amplitudes, | H d, max   −   H d, min |, from two different
directions is at least:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

9 dB using shear wave angle beam probes only, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)
15 dB using one shear wave angle beam probe and one longitudinal wave normal beam probe.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The directional reflectivities depend on refraction angle and examination conditions (half skip, full skip).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of different directions of examination are given in Figure B.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An example of the application of these criteria is given in Figure B.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Echostatic pattern criteria (stage 4)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At this stage, the echostatic pattern (i.e. A-scan) of the indication is compared with that obtained from the
reference reflector (3 mm diameter side drilled hole).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the echostatic pattern is single and smooth, the indication is classified as non-planar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the echostatic pattern is not both single and smooth, proceed to stage 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This criteria shall be fulfilled for at least two directions of examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.5 Transverse echodynamic pattern criteria (stage 5)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The transverse echodynamic pattern of an indication is the envelope of the resulting echoes when the
ultrasonic probe is moved perpendicular to the indication, in accordance with ISO 17640. The analysis takes
into account not only the envelope, but also the behaviour of the echoes inside it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Classification of indications depends on the patterns observed:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
pattern 1: single non-planar;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
pattern 2: excluded by previous stage;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
pattern 3 and pattern 4: planar, if observed for the two highest reflectivity directions — if only observed for
one reflectivity direction, use complementary examination (see 4.6);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
pattern 5: cluster of non-planar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The patterns used for classification are given in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This criteria shall be fulfilled for at least two directions of examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.6 Complementary examination<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of doubt, carry out additional examinations, for example:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
use of additional reflectivity directions or probes;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
analysis of echodynamic pattern when the probe is moved parallel to the indication [see Figures C.1 c),
C.2 c), C.3 c), C.4 c), C.5 c)].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
results from other non-destructive testing (e.g. radiography).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  with  T 4  = 15 dB between reflections obtained with shear waves and longitudinal waves.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The angles at which the ultrasonic beam is incident upon the indication shall have a difference of at least 10°.
The comparison shall be made upon the same area of the indication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stages 4 and 5: These criteria shall be fulfilled for at least two directions of examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Stage 5: If the echodynamic pattern does not match pattern 3, the indication is classified as non-planar.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The echo patterns are those defined in Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indications resulting from a combination of an inclusion and lack of fusion are classified as planar by the
flowchart procedure. An example of this type of flaw is given in Figure A.2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.2 Pattern 2<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An extended smooth reflector response is shown in Figure C.2. At any probe position, the A-scan shows a
single sharp echo. When the ultrasonic beam is moved over the reflector, the echo rises smoothly to a plateau
and is maintained, with minor variations in amplitude of up to 4 dB, until the beam moves off the reflector,
when the echo falls smoothly to noise level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>C.3 Pattern 3<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There are two variants of an extended rough reflector response, depending upon the angle of incidence of the
probe beam on the reflector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One variant, at near normal incidence, is shown in Figure C.3. At any probe position, the A-scan shows a
single but ragged echo. As the probe is moved, this may undergo large (greater than  ± 6 dB) random
fluctuations in amplitude. The fluctuations are caused by reflection from different facets of the reflector, and by
random interference of waves scattered from groups of facets.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The second variant of an extended rough reflector response, oblique incidence, “travelling echo pattern”, is
shown in Figure C.4. At any probe position the A-scan shows an extended train of signals (“subsidiary peaks”)
within a bell-shaped pulse envelope. As the probe is moved, each subsidiary peak travels through the pulse
envelope, rising to its own maximum towards the centre of the envelope, and then falling. The overall signal
may show large (greater than  ± 6 dB) random fluctuations in amplitude.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
