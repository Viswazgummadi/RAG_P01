<<HEADING level=1>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Achieving a balance between the environment, society and the economy is considered essential to meet
the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.
Sustainable development as a goal is achieved by balancing the three pillars of sustainability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.1   Background<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Societal expectations for sustainable development, transparency and accountability have evolved with
increasingly stringent legislation, growing pressures on the environment from pollution, inefficient
use of resources, improper waste management, climate change, degradation of ecosystems and loss of
biodiversity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This has led organizations to adopt a systematic approach to environmental management by
implementing environmental management systems with the aim of contributing to the environmental
pillar of sustainability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The purpose of this International Standard is to provide organizations with a framework to protect
the environment and respond to changing environmental conditions in balance with socio-economic
needs. It specifies requirements that enable an organization to achieve the intended outcomes it sets
for its environmental management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.2   Aim of an environmental management system<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A systematic approach to environmental management can provide top management with information
to build success over the long term and create options for contributing to sustainable development by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 protecting the environment by preventing or mitigating adverse environmental impacts;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 mitigating the potential adverse effect of environmental conditions on the organization;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 assisting the organization in the fulfilment of compliance obligations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 enhancing environmental performance;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 controlling or influencing the way the organization’s products and services are designed,
manufactured, distributed, consumed and disposed by using a life cycle perspective that can
prevent environmental impacts from being unintentionally shifted elsewhere within the life cycle;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 achieving financial and operational benefits that can result from implementing environmentally
sound alternatives that strengthen the organization’s market position;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 communicating environmental information to relevant interested parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard, like other International Standards, is not intended to increase or change
an organization’s legal requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The success of an environmental management system depends on commitment from all levels and
functions of the organization, led by top management. Organizations can leverage opportunities to
prevent or mitigate adverse environmental impacts and enhance beneficial environmental impacts,
particularly those with strategic and competitive implications. Top management can effectively address
its risks and opportunities by integrating environmental management into the organization’s business
processes, strategic direction and decision making, aligning them with other business priorities,
and incorporating environmental governance into its overall management system. Demonstration of
successful implementation of this International Standard can be used to assure interested parties that
an effective environmental management system is in place.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3   Success factors<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Adoption of this International Standard, however, will not in itself guarantee optimal environmental
outcomes. Application of this International Standard can differ from one organization to another<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>due to the context of the organization. Two organizations can carry out similar activities but can
have different compliance obligations, commitments in their environmental policy, environmental
technologies and environmental performance goals, yet both can conform to the requirements of this
International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The level of detail and complexity of the environmental management system will vary depending on
the context of the organization, the scope of its environmental management system, its compliance
obligations, and the nature of its activities, products and services, including its environmental aspects
and associated environmental impacts.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basis for the approach underlying an environmental management system is founded on the concept
of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA). The PDCA model provides an iterative process used by organizations to
achieve continual improvement. It can be applied to an environmental management system and to each
of its individual elements. It can be briefly described as follows.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4   Plan-Do-Check-Act model<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 Plan: establish environmental objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance
with the organization’s environmental policy.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 Do: implement the processes as planned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 Check: monitor and measure processes against the environmental policy, including its commitments,
environmental objectives and operating criteria, and report the results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 Act: take actions to continually improve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 1  shows how the framework introduced in this International Standard could be integrated into a
PDCA model, which can help new and existing users to understand the importance of a systems approach.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 1 — Relationship between PDCA and the framework in this International Standard<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard conforms to ISO’s requirements for management system standards.
These requirements include a high level structure, identical core text, and common terms with core
definitions, designed to benefit users implementing multiple ISO management system standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such
as those for quality, occupational health and safety, energy or financial management. However, this
International Standard enables an organization to use a common approach and risk-based thinking to
integrate its environmental management system with the requirements of other management systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard contains the requirements used to assess conformity. An organization that
wishes to demonstrate conformity with this International Standard can do so by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 making a self-determination and self-declaration, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 seeking confirmation of its conformance by parties having an interest in the organization, such as
customers, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 seeking confirmation of its self-declaration by a party external to the organization, or<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 seeking certification/registration of its environmental management system by an external
organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex A  provides explanatory information to prevent misinterpretation of the requirements of this
International Standard.  Annex B  shows broad technical correspondence between the previous edition of
this International Standard and this edition. Implementation guidance on environmental management
systems is included in ISO 14004.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 “shall” indicates a requirement;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 “should” indicates a recommendation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 “may” indicates a permission;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 “can” indicates a possibility or a capability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Information marked as “NOTE” is intended to assist the understanding or use of the document. “Notes
to entry” used in  Clause 3  provide additional information that supplements the terminological data and
can contain provisions relating to the use of a term.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The terms and definitions in  Clause 3  are arranged in conceptual order, with an alphabetical index
provided at the end of the document.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Annex A
(informative)
Guidance on the use of this International Standard<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1	 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The explanatory information given in this annex is intended to prevent misinterpretation of the
requirements contained in this International Standard. While this information addresses and is consistent
with these requirements, it is not intended to add to, subtract from, or in any way modify them.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements in this International Standard need to be viewed from a systems or holistic
perspective. The user should not read a particular sentence or clause of this International Standard
in isolation from other clauses. There is an interrelationship between the requirements in some
clauses and the requirements in other clauses. For example, the organization needs to understand
the relationship between the commitments in its environmental policy and the requirements that are
specified in other clauses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Management of change is an important part of maintaining the environmental management system that
ensures the organization can achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system
on an ongoing basis. Management of change is addressed in various requirements of this International
Standard, including<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 maintaining the environmental management system (see  4.4 ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 environmental aspects (see  6.1.2 ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 internal communication (see  7.4.2 ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 operational control (see  8.1 ),<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 internal audit programme (see  9.2.2 ), and<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 management review (see  9.3 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As part of managing change, the organization should address planned and unplanned changes to
ensure that the unintended consequences of these changes do not have a negative effect on the intended
outcomes of the environmental management system. Examples of change include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 planned changes to products, processes, operations, equipment or facilities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 changes in staff or external providers, including contractors;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 new information related to environmental aspects, environmental impacts and related technologies;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 changes in compliance obligations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2 Clarification of structure and terminology<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The clause structure and some of the terminology of this International Standard have been changed to
improve alignment with other management systems standards. There is, however, no requirement in
this International Standard for its clause structure or terminology to be applied to an organization’s
environmental management system documentation. There is no requirement to replace the terms used
by an organization with the terms used in this International Standard. Organizations can choose to use
terms that suit their business, e.g. “records”, “documentation”, or “protocols”, rather than “documented
information”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>﻿<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3 Clarification of concepts<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the terms and definitions given in  Clause 3 , clarification of selected concepts is provided
below to prevent misunderstanding.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 In this International Standard, the use of the word “any” implies selection or choice.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The words “appropriate” and “applicable” are not interchangeable. “Appropriate” means suitable
(for, to) and implies some degree of freedom, while “applicable” means relevant or possible to apply
and implies that if it can be done, it needs to be done.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The word “consider” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it can be excluded; whereas
“take into account” means it is necessary to think about the topic but it cannot be excluded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 “Continual” indicates duration that occurs over a period of time, but with intervals of interruption
(unlike “continuous” which indicates duration without interruption). “Continual” is therefore the
appropriate word to use when referring to improvement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 In this International Standard, the word “effect” is used to describe the result of a change to the
organization. The phrase “environmental impact” refers specifically to the result of a change to
the environment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The word “ensure” means the responsibility can be delegated, but not the accountability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 This International Standard uses the term “interested party”; the term “stakeholder” is a synonym
as it represents the same concept.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard uses some new terminology. A brief explanation is given below to aid both
new users and those who have used previous editions of this International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The phrase “compliance obligations” replaces the phrase “legal requirements and other requirements
to which the organization subscribes” used in the previous edition of this International Standard.
The intent of this new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 “Documented information” replaces the nouns “documentation”, “documents” and “records” used
in previous editions of this International Standard. To distinguish the intent of the generic term
“documented information”, this International Standard now uses the phrase “retain documented
information as evidence of....” to mean records, and “maintain documented information” to mean
documentation other than records. The phrase “as evidence of….” is not a requirement to meet legal
evidentiary requirements; its intent is only to indicate objective evidence needs to be retained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The phrase “external provider” means an external supplier organization (including a contractor)
that provides a product or a service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The change from “identify” to “determine” is intended to harmonize with the standardized
management system terminology. The word “determine” implies a discovery process that results in
knowledge. The intent does not differ from that of previous editions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The phrase “intended outcome” is what the organization intends to achieve by implementing its
environmental management system. The minimal intended outcomes include enhancement of
environmental performance, fulfilment of compliance obligations and achievement of environmental
objectives. Organizations can set additional intended outcomes for their environmental management
system. For example, consistent with their commitment to protection of the environment, an
organization may establish an intended outcome to work towards sustainable development.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The phrase “person(s) doing work under its control” includes persons working for the organization
and those working on its behalf for which the organization has responsibility (e.g. contractors). It
replaces the phrase “persons working for it or on its behalf” and “persons working for or on behalf
of the organization” used in the previous edition of this International Standard. The intent of this
new phrase does not differ from that of the previous edition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>﻿<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 The concept of “target” used in previous editions of this International Standard is captured within
the term “environmental objective”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4	 Context of the organization<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4.1	 Understanding the organization and its context<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The intent of  4.1  is to provide a high-level, conceptual understanding of the important issues that
can affect, either positively or negatively, the way the organization manages its environmental
responsibilities. Issues are important topics for the organization, problems for debate and discussion
or changing circumstances that affect the organization’s ability to achieve the intended outcomes it sets
for its environmental management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of internal and external issues which can be relevant to the context of the organization include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 environmental conditions related to climate, air quality, water quality, land use, existing
contamination, natural resource availability and biodiversity, that can either affect the
organization’s purpose, or be affected by its environmental aspects;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 the external cultural, social, political, legal, regulatory, financial, technological, economic, natural
and competitive circumstances, whether international, national, regional or local;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the internal characteristics or conditions of the organization, such as its activities, products and
services, strategic direction, culture and capabilities (i.e. people, knowledge, processes, systems).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An understanding of the context of an organization is used to establish, implement, maintain and
continually improve its environmental management system (see  4.4 ). The internal and external
issues that are determined in  4.1  can result in risks and opportunities to the organization or to the
environmental management system (see  6.1.1  to  6.1.3 ). The organization determines those that need to
be addressed and managed (see  6.1.4 ,  6.2 ,  Clause 7 ,  Clause 8  and  9.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4.2	 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An organization is expected to gain a general (i.e. high-level, not detailed) understanding of the
expressed needs and expectations of those internal and external interested parties that have been
determined by the organization to be relevant. The organization considers the knowledge gained
when determining which of these needs and expectations it has to or it chooses to comply with, i.e. its
compliance obligations (see  6.1.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of an interested party perceiving itself to be affected by the organization’s decisions or
activities related to environmental performance, the organization considers the relevant needs and
expectations that are made known or have been disclosed by the interested party to the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Interested party requirements are not necessarily requirements of the organization. Some interested
party requirements reflect needs and expectations that are mandatory because they have been
incorporated into laws, regulations, permits and licences by governmental or even court decision. The
organization may decide to voluntarily agree to or adopt other requirements of interested parties (e.g.
entering into a contractual relationship, subscribing to a voluntary initiative). Once the organization
adopts them, they become organizational requirements (i.e. compliance obligations) and are taken into
account when planning the environmental management system (see  4.4 ). A more detailed-level analysis
of its compliance obligations is performed in  6.1.3 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4.3	 Determining the scope of the environmental management system<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The scope of the environmental management system is intended to clarify the physical and
organizational boundaries to which the environmental management system applies, especially if
the organization is a part of a larger organization. An organization has the freedom and flexibility to
define its boundaries. It may choose to implement this International Standard throughout the entire<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>organization, or only in (a) specific part(s) of the organization, as long as the top management for that
(those) part(s) has authority to establish an environmental management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In setting the scope, the credibility of the environmental management system depends upon the choice
of organizational boundaries. The organization considers the extent of control or influence that it
can exert over activities, products and services considering a life cycle perspective. Scoping should
not be used to exclude activities, products, services, or facilities that have or can have significant
environmental aspects, or to evade its compliance obligations. The scope is a factual and representative
statement of the organization’s operations included within its environmental management system
boundaries that should not mislead interested parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Once the organization asserts it conforms to this International Standard, the requirement to make the
scope statement available to interested parties applies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4.4	 Environmental management system<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization retains authority and accountability to decide how it fulfils the requirements of this
International Standard, including the level of detail and extent to which it:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 establishes one or more processes to have confidence that it (they) is (are) controlled, carried out
as planned and achieve the desired results;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 integrates environmental management system requirements into its various business processes,
such as design and development, procurement, human resources, sales and marketing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
incorporates issues associated with the context of the organization (see  4.1 ) and interested party
requirements (see  4.2 ) within its environmental management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If this International Standard is implemented for (a) specific part(s) of an organization, policies,
processes and documented information developed by other parts of the organization can be used to
meet the requirements of this International Standard, provided they are applicable to that (those)
specific part(s).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

change, see  Clause A.1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5	 Leadership<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.1	 Leadership and commitment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To demonstrate leadership and commitment, there are specific responsibilities related to the
environmental management system in which top management should be personally involved or which
top management should direct. Top management may delegate responsibility for these actions to
others, but it retains accountability for ensuring the actions are performed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.2	 Environmental policy<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An environmental policy is a set of principles stated as commitments in which top management
outlines the intentions of the organization to support and enhance its environmental performance. The
environmental policy enables the organization to set its environmental objectives (see  6.2 ), take actions
to achieve the intended outcomes of the environmental management system, and achieve continual
improvement (see  Clause 10 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Three basic commitments for the environmental policy are specified in this International Standard to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 protect the environment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 fulfil the organization’s compliance obligations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
continually improve the environmental management system to enhance environmental performance.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>﻿<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These commitments are then reflected in the processes an organization establishes to address specific
requirements in this International Standard, to ensure a robust, credible and reliable environmental
management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The commitment to protect the environment is intended to not only prevent adverse environmental
impacts through prevention of pollution, but to protect the natural environment from harm
and degradation arising from the organization’s activities, products and services. The specific
commitment(s) an organization pursues should be relevant to the context of the organization, including
the local or regional environmental conditions. These commitments can address, for example, water
quality, recycling, or air quality, and can also include commitments related to climate change mitigation
and adaptation, protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, and restoration.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>While all the commitments are important, some interested parties are especially concerned with
the organization’s commitment to fulfil its compliance obligations, particularly applicable legal
requirements. This International Standard specifies a number of interconnected requirements related
to this commitment. These include the need to:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 determine compliance obligations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 ensure operations are carried out in accordance with these compliance obligations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 evaluate fulfilment of the compliance obligations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 correct nonconformities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.5.3	 Organizational roles, responsibilities and authorities<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Those involved in the organization’s environmental management system should have a clear
understanding of their role, responsibility(ies) and authority(ies) for conforming to the requirements
of this International Standard and achieving the intended outcomes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specific roles and responsibilities identified in  5.3  may be assigned to an individual, sometimes
referred to as the “management representative”, shared by several individuals, or assigned to a member
of top management.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.6	 Planning<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.6.1	 Actions to address risks and opportunities<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The overall intent of the process(es) established in  6.1.1  is to ensure that the organization is able to
achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, to prevent or reduce undesired
effects, and to achieve continual improvement. The organization can ensure this by determining its
risks and opportunities that need to be addressed and planning action to address them. These risks and
opportunities can be related to environmental aspects, compliance obligations, other issues or other
needs and expectations of interested parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.6.1.1	 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Environmental aspects (see  6.1.2 ) can create risks and opportunities associated with adverse
environmental impacts, beneficial environmental impacts, and other effects on the organization. The
risks and opportunities related to environmental aspects can be determined as part of the significance
evaluation or determined separately.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Compliance obligations (see  6.1.3 ) can create risks and opportunities, such as failing to comply (which
can damage the organization’s reputation or result in legal action) or performing beyond its compliance
obligations (which can enhance the organization’s reputation).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 14001:2015(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>﻿<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization can also have risks and opportunities related to other issues, including environmental
conditions or needs and expectations of interested parties, which can affect the organization’s ability to
achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system, e.g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 environmental spillage due to literacy or language barriers among workers who cannot understand
local work procedures;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 increased flooding due to climate change that could affect the organizations premises;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
lack of available resources to maintain an effective environmental management system due to
economic constraints;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)	 introducing new technology financed by governmental grants, which could improve air quality;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)	 water scarcity during periods of drought that could affect the organization’s ability to operate its
emission control equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Emergency situations are unplanned or unexpected events that need the urgent application of specific
competencies, resources or processes to prevent or mitigate their actual or potential consequences.
Emergency situations can result in adverse environmental impacts or other effects on the organization.
When determining potential emergency situations (e.g. fire, chemical spill, severe weather), the
organization should consider:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 the nature of onsite hazards (e.g. flammable liquids, storage tanks, compressed gasses);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 the most likely type and scale of an emergency situation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 the potential for emergency situations at a nearby facility (e.g. plant, road, railway line).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although risks and opportunities need to be determined and addressed, there is no requirement for formal
risk management or a documented risk management process. It is up to the organization to select the
method it will use to determine its risks and opportunities. The method may involve a simple qualitative
process or a full quantitative assessment depending on the context in which the organization operates.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The risks and opportunities identified (see  6.1.1  to  6.1.3 ) are inputs for planning actions (see  6.1.4 ) and
for establishing the environmental objectives (see  6.2 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An organization determines its environmental aspects and associated environmental impacts, and
determines those that are significant and, therefore, need to be addressed by its environmental
management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.6.1.2	 Environmental aspects<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Changes to the environment, either adverse or beneficial, that result wholly or partially from
environmental aspects are called environmental impacts. The environmental impact can occur at local,
regional and global scales, and also can be direct, indirect or cumulative by nature. The relationship
between environmental aspects and environmental impacts is one of cause and effect.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When determining environmental aspects, the organization considers a life cycle perspective. This
does not require a detailed life cycle assessment; thinking carefully about the life cycle stages that can
be controlled or influenced by the organization is sufficient. Typical stages of a product (or service)
life cycle include raw material acquisition, design, production, transportation/delivery, use, end-of-
life treatment and final disposal. The life cycle stages that are applicable will vary depending on the
activity, product or service.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An organization needs to determine the environmental aspects within the scope of its environmental
management system. It takes into account the inputs and outputs (both intended and unintended)
that are associated with its current and relevant past activities, products and services; planned or
new developments; and new or modified activities, products and services. The method used should
consider normal and abnormal operating conditions, shut-down and start-up conditions, as well as
the reasonably foreseeable emergency situations identified in  6.1.1 . Attention should be paid to prior<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>occurrences of emergency situations. For information on environmental aspects as part of managing
change, see  Clause A.1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An organization does not have to consider each product, component or raw material individually to
determine and evaluate their environmental aspects; it may group or categorize activities, products
and services when they have common characteristics.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When determining its environmental aspects, the organization can consider:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 emissions to air;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 releases to water;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
releases to land;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)	 use of raw materials and natural resources;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)	 use of energy;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
energy emitted (e.g. heat, radiation, vibration (noise), light);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)	 generation of waste and/or by-products;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)	 use of space.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the environmental aspects that it can control directly, an organization determines
whether there are environmental aspects that it can influence. These can be related to products and
services used by the organization which are provided by others, as well as products and services that it
provides to others, including those associated with (an) outsourced process(es). With respect to those
an organization provides to others, it can have limited influence on the use and end-of-life treatment
of the products and services. In all circumstances, however, it is the organization that determines the
extent of control it is able to exercise, the environmental aspects it can influence, and the extent to
which it chooses to exercise such influence.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consideration should be given to environmental aspects related to the organization’s activities,
products and services, such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 design and development of its facilities, processes, products and services;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 acquisition of raw materials, including extraction;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 operational or manufacturing processes, including warehousing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 operation and maintenance of facilities, organizational assets and infrastructure;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 environmental performance and practices of external providers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 product transportation and service delivery, including packaging;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 storage, use and end-of-life treatment of products;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 waste management, including reuse, refurbishing, recycling and disposal.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no single method for determining significant environmental aspects, however, the method
and criteria used should provide consistent results. The organization sets the criteria for determining
its significant environmental aspects. Environmental criteria are the primary and minimum criteria
for assessing environmental aspects. Criteria can relate to the environmental aspect (e.g. type, size,
frequency) or the environmental impact (e.g. scale, severity, duration, exposure). Other criteria may
also be used. An environmental aspect might not be significant when only considering environmental
criteria. It can, however, reach or exceed the threshold for determining significance when other criteria
are considered. These other criteria can include organizational issues, such as legal requirements or
interested party concerns. These other criteria are not intended to be used to downgrade an aspect
that is significant based on its environmental impact.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>A significant environmental aspect can result in one or more significant environmental impacts, and
can therefore result in risks and opportunities that need to be addressed to ensure the organization
can achieve the intended outcomes of its environmental management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization determines, at a sufficiently detailed level, the compliance obligations it identified in
4.2  that are applicable to its environmental aspects, and how they apply to the organization. Compliance
obligations include legal requirements that an organization has to comply with and other requirements
that the organization has to or chooses to comply with.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.6.1.3	 Compliance obligations<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Mandatory legal requirements related to an organization’s environmental aspects can include, if
applicable:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 requirements from governmental entities or other relevant authorities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 international, national and local laws and regulations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

requirements specified in permits, licenses or other forms of authorization;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)	 orders, rules or guidance from regulatory agencies;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)	 judgements of courts or administrative tribunals.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Compliance obligations also include other interested party requirements related to its environmental
management system which the organization has to or chooses to adopt. These can include, if applicable:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 agreements with community groups or non-governmental organizations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 agreements with public authorities or customers;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 organizational requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 voluntary principles or codes of practice;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 voluntary labelling or environmental commitments;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 obligations arising under contractual arrangements with the organization;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 relevant organizational or industry standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization plans, at a high level, the actions that have to be taken within the environmental
management system to address its significant environmental aspects, its compliance obligations, and
the risks and opportunities identified in  6.1.1  that are a priority for the organization to achieve the
intended outcomes of its environmental management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.6.1.4	 Planning action<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The actions planned may include establishing environmental objectives (see  6.2 ) or may be incorporated
into other environmental management system processes, either individually or in combination. Some
actions may be addressed through other management systems, such as those related to occupational
health and safety or business continuity, or through other business processes related to risk, financial
or human resource management.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When considering its technological options, an organization should consider the use of best-available
techniques, where economically viable, cost-effective and judged appropriate. This is not intended to
imply that organizations are obliged to use environmental cost-accounting methodologies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.6.2	 Environmental objectives and planning to achieve them<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Top management may establish environmental objectives at the strategic level, the tactical level
or the operational level. The strategic level includes the highest levels of the organization and the<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>environmental objectives can be applicable to the whole organization. The tactical and operational
levels can include environmental objectives for specific units or functions within the organization and
should be compatible with its strategic direction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Environmental objectives should be communicated to persons working under the organization’s control
who have the ability to influence the achievement of environmental objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirement to “take into account significant environmental aspects” does not mean that an
environmental objective has to be established for each significant environmental aspect, however,
these have a high priority when establishing environmental objectives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>“Consistent with the environmental policy” means that the environmental objectives are broadly
aligned and harmonized with the commitments made by top management in the environmental policy,
including the commitment to continual improvement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indicators are selected to evaluate the achievement of measurable environmental objectives.
“Measurable” means it is possible to use either quantitative or qualitative methods in relation to
a specified scale to determine if the environmental objective has been achieved. By specifying “if
practicable”, it is acknowledged that there can be situations when it is not feasible to measure an
environmental objective, however, it is important that the organization is able to determine whether or
not an environmental objective has been achieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.7	 Support<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.7.1	 Resources<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Resources are needed for the effective functioning and improvement of the environmental management
system and to enhance environmental performance. Top management should ensure that those with
environmental management system responsibilities are supported with the necessary resources.
Internal resources may be supplemented by (an) external provider(s).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Resources can include human resources, natural resources, infrastructure, technology and financial
resources. Examples of human resources include specialized skills and knowledge. Examples of
infrastructure resources include the organization’s buildings, equipment, underground tanks and
drainage system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.7.2	 Competence<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The competency requirements of this International Standard apply to persons working under the
organization’s control who affect its environmental performance, including persons:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 whose work has the potential to cause a significant environmental impact;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 who are assigned responsibilities for the environmental management system, including those who:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>1)	 determine and evaluate environmental impacts or compliance obligations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>2)	 contribute to the achievement of an environmental objective;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>3)	 respond to emergency situations;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

in achieving the commitments, including how their work can affect the organization’s ability to fulfil its
compliance obligations.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.7.4	 Communication<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Communication allows the organization to provide and obtain information relevant to its environmental
management system, including information related to its significant environmental aspects,
environmental performance, compliance obligations and recommendations for continual improvement.
Communication is a two-way process, in and out of the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When establishing its communication process(es), the internal organizational structure should be
considered to ensure communication with the most appropriate levels and functions. A single approach
can be adequate to meet the needs of many different interested parties, or multiple approaches might
be necessary to address specific needs of individual interested parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The information received by the organization can contain requests from interested parties for specific
information related to the management of its environmental aspects, or can contain general impressions
or views on the way the organization carries out that management. These impressions or views can
be positive or negative. In the latter case (e.g. complaints), it is important that a prompt and clear
answer is provided by the organization. A subsequent analysis of these complaints can provide valuable
information for detecting improvement opportunities for the environmental management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Communication should:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 be transparent, i.e. the organization is open in the way it derives what it has reported on;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 be appropriate, so that information meets the needs of relevant interested parties, enabling them
to participate;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
be truthful and not misleading to those who rely on the information reported;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)	 be factual, accurate and able to be trusted;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)	 not exclude relevant information;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
be understandable to interested parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

information on communication, see ISO 14063.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.7.5	 Documented information<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>An organization should create and maintain documented information in a manner sufficient to ensure
a suitable, adequate and effective environmental management system. The primary focus should be on
the implementation of the environmental management system and on environmental performance, not
on a complex documented information control system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In addition to the documented information required in specific clauses of this International Standard,
an organization may choose to create additional documented information for purposes of transparency,
accountability, continuity, consistency, training, or ease in auditing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Documented information originally created for purposes other than the environmental management
system may be used. The documented information associated with the environmental management
system may be integrated with other information management systems implemented by the
organization. It does not have to be in the form of a manual.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

opportunities, significant environmental aspects and compliance obligations. An organization has
the flexibility to select the type of operational control methods, individually or in combination, that
are necessary to make sure the process(es) is (are) effective and achieve(s) the desired results. Such
methods can include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 designing (a) process(es) in such a way as to prevent error and ensure consistent results;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
determining the use and amount of documented information necessary.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization decides the extent of control needed within its own business processes (e.g.
procurement process) to control or influence (an) outsourced process(es) or (a) provider(s) of products
and services. Its decision should be based upon factors such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 knowledge, competence and resources, including:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 the competence of the external provider to meet the organization’s environmental management
system requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 the technical competence of the organization to define appropriate controls or assess the
adequacy of controls;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 the importance and potential effect the product and service will have on the organization’s ability
to achieve the intended outcome of its environmental management system;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 the extent to which control of the process is shared;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 the capability of achieving the necessary control through the application of its general
procurement process;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 improvement opportunities available.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When a process is outsourced, or when products and services are supplied by (an) external provider(s),
the organization’s ability to exert control or influence can vary from direct control to limited or no
influence. In some cases, an outsourced process performed onsite might be under the direct control of
an organization; in other cases, an organization’s ability to influence an outsourced process or external
supplier might be limited.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When determining the type and extent of operational controls related to external providers, including
contractors, the organization may consider one or more factors such as:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 environmental aspects and associated environmental impacts;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—	 risks and opportunities associated with the manufacturing of its products or the provision of its
services;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.9.1	 Monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When determining what should be monitored and measured, in addition to progress on environmental
objectives, the organization should take into account its significant environmental aspects, compliance
obligations and operational controls.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.9.1.1	 General<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>﻿<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The methods used by the organization to monitor and measure, analyse and evaluate should be defined
in the environmental management system, in order to ensure that:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 the timing of monitoring and measurement is coordinated with the need for analysis and
evaluation results;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 the results of monitoring and measurement are reliable, reproducible and traceable;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the analysis and evaluation are reliable and reproducible, and enable the organization to report
trends.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The environmental performance analysis and evaluation results should be reported to those with
responsibility and authority to initiate appropriate action.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For additional information on environmental performance evaluation, see ISO 14031.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency and timing of compliance evaluations can vary depending on the importance of
the requirement, variations in operating conditions, changes in compliance obligations and the
organization’s past performance. An organization can use a variety of methods to maintain its
knowledge and understanding of its compliance status, however, all compliance obligations need to be
evaluated periodically.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.9.1.2	 Evaluation of compliance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If compliance evaluation results indicate a failure to fulfil a legal requirement, the organization
needs to determine and implement the actions necessary to achieve compliance. This might require
communication with a regulatory agency and agreement on a course of action to fulfil its legal
requirements. Where such an agreement is in place, it becomes a compliance obligation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A non-compliance is not necessarily elevated to a nonconformity if, for example, it is identified and
corrected by the environmental management system processes. Compliance-related nonconformities
need to be corrected, even if those nonconformities have not resulted in actual non-compliance with
legal requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.9.2	 Internal audit<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Auditors should be independent of the activity being audited, wherever practicable, and should in all
cases act in a manner that is free from bias and conflict of interest.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Nonconformities identified during internal audits are subject to appropriate corrective action.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When considering the results of previous audits, the organization should include:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)	 previously identified nonconformities and the effectiveness of the actions taken;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)	 results of internal and external audits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For additional information on establishing an internal audit programme, performing environmental
management system audits and evaluating the competence of audit personnel, see ISO  19011. For
information on internal audit programme as part of managing change, see  Clause A.1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.9.3	 Management review<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The management review should be high-level; it does not need to be an exhaustive review of detailed
information. The management review topics need not be addressed all at once. The review may take
place over a period of time and can be part of regularly scheduled management activities, such as board
or operational meetings; it does not need to be a separate activity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Relevant complaints received from interested parties are reviewed by top management to determine
opportunities for improvement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>For information on management review as part of managing change, see  Clause A.1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>“Suitability” refers to how the environmental management system fits the organization, its operations,
culture and business systems. “Adequacy” refers to whether it meets the requirements of this
International Standard and is implemented appropriately. “Effectiveness” refers to whether it is
achieving the desired results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.10	Improvement<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.10.1	General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The organization should consider the results from analysis and evaluation of environmental performance,
evaluation of compliance, internal audits and management review when taking action to improve.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Examples of improvement include corrective action, continual improvement, breakthrough change,
innovation and re-organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.10.2	Nonconformity and corrective action<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the key purposes of an environmental management system is to act as a preventive tool. The
concept of preventive action is now captured in  4.1  (i.e. understanding the organization and its context)
and  6.1  (i.e. actions to address risks and opportunities).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.10.3	Continual improvement<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The rate, extent and timescale of actions that support continual improvement are determined by
the organization. Environmental performance can be enhanced by applying the environmental
management system as a whole or improving one or more of its elements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
