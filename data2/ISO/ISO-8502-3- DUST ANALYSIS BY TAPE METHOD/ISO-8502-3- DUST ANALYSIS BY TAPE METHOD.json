The principal factors that are known to\ninfluence this performance are:\na) the presence of rust and mill scale; |\nb) the presence of surface contaminants, salts, dust, oils and =:\ngreases: |\nc) the surface profile. |\nInternational Standards ISO 8501, ISO 8502 and ISO 8503 have been\nprepared to provide methods of assessing these factors, while ISO 8504\nprovides guidance on the preparation methods that are available for\ncleaning steel substrates, indicating the capabilities of each in attaining\nspecified levels of cleanliness.\nThese International Standards do not contain recommendations for the\nprotective coating systems to be applied to the steel surface. Neither do\nthey contain recommendations for the surface quality requirements for\nspecific situations even though surface guality can have a direct influ-\nence on the choice of protective coating to be applied and on its per-\nformance. Such recommendations are found in other documents such\nas national standards and codes of practice. It will be necessary for the\nusers of these [nternational Standards to ensure that the qualities\nspecified are:\n-\u2014\u2014 compatible and appropriate both for the environmental conditions to\nwhich the steel will be exposed and for the protective coating system\nto be used;\n\u2014 within the capability of the cleaning procedure specified. |\nThe four International Standards referred to above deal with the follow-\ning aspects of preparation of steel substrates:\niSO 8501 \u2014 Visual assessment of surface cleanliness;\nISO 8502 \u2014 Tests for the assessment of surface cleanliness:\nISO 8503 Surface roughness characteristics of biast-cleaned steei\nsubstrates;\nISO 8504 \u2014 Surface preparation methods.\nEach of these International Standards is in turn divided into separate\nparts,\niv",
