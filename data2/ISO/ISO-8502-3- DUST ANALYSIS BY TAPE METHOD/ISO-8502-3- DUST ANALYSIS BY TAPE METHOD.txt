Foreword ‘
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide
federation of national standards bodies (iSO member bodies). The work
of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for i
which a technical committee has been established has the right to be
represented on that committee. International organizations, govern-
mental and non-governmental, [n liaison with ISO, also take part in the
work. ISO closely with the International Electrotechnical :
Commission on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.
Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are
to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an Inter-
national Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the member
bodies casting a vote.
International Standard ISO 8502-3 was prepared by Technical Committee
ISO/TC 35, Paints and varnishes, Sub-Committee SC 12, Preparation of

Introduction
The performance of protective coatings of paint and related products
applied to steel is significantly affected by the state of the steel surface
immediately prior to painting. The principal factors that are known to
influence this performance are:
a) the presence of rust and mill scale; |
b) the presence of surface contaminants, salts, dust, oils and =:
greases: |
c) the surface profile. |
International Standards ISO 8501, ISO 8502 and ISO 8503 have been
prepared to provide methods of assessing these factors, while ISO 8504
provides guidance on the preparation methods that are available for
cleaning steel substrates, indicating the capabilities of each in attaining
specified levels of cleanliness.
These International Standards do not contain recommendations for the
protective coating systems to be applied to the steel surface. Neither do
they contain recommendations for the surface quality requirements for
specific situations even though surface guality can have a direct influ-
ence on the choice of protective coating to be applied and on its per-
formance. Such recommendations are found in other documents such
as national standards and codes of practice. It will be necessary for the
users of these [nternational Standards to ensure that the qualities
specified are:
-—— compatible and appropriate both for the environmental conditions to
which the steel will be exposed and for the protective coating system
to be used;
— within the capability of the cleaning procedure specified. |
The four International Standards referred to above deal with the follow-
ing aspects of preparation of steel substrates:
iSO 8501 — Visual assessment of surface cleanliness;
ISO 8502 — Tests for the assessment of surface cleanliness:
ISO 8503 Surface roughness characteristics of biast-cleaned steei
substrates;
ISO 8504 — Surface preparation methods.
Each of these International Standards is in turn divided into separate
parts,

pipes, and In structural cavities. Special inspection should be carried
out fo ensure that such areas are adequately cleaned and adequately
free from dust before painting.
Because of subjective factors involved in the test procedure, the test
does not allow the precise determination of dust retained on blast-
cleaned steel surfaces. Nevertheless, when carried out by experienced
operators, and especially when used to compare the performance of
surfaces under fest with agreed standard specimens, it gives very useful
information.
There are many possible variables in the conditions at sites where tests
may be required to be carried out. Agreements made between inter-
ested parties where appropriate should include the number or frequency
of tests, the test locations, and the dates and times when the tests are
ce to be carried out.
