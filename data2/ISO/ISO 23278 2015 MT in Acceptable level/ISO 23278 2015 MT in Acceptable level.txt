<<HEADING level=1>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards
bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out
through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical
committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work.
ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of
electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are
described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular the different approval criteria needed for the
different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the
editorial rules of the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (see  www.iso.org/directives ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of
patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. Details of any
patent rights identified during the development of the document will be in the Introduction and/or on
the ISO list of patent declarations received (see  www.iso.org/patents ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD
ISO 23278:2015(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=1>>Non-destructive testing of welds — Magnetic particle
testing — Acceptance levels<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1	 Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies acceptance levels for indications from imperfections in
ferromagnetic steel welds detected by magnetic particle testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance levels are primarily intended for use during manufacture examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
They can also be used for in-service inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance levels in this International Standard are based on detection capabilities that can be
expected when using techniques specified in ISO 17638 and parameters recommended in  Annex A . The
acceptance levels can be related to welding standards, application standards, specifications or codes.
Such a relationship is shown in ISO 17635 for ISO 5817.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acceptance levels for grouped indications are not covered by this International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>2	 Normative references<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following documents, in whole or in part, are normatively referenced in this document and are
indispensable for its application. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated
references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO/TS 18173,  Non-destructive testing — General terms and definitions<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3 Terms and definitions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in ISO/TS 18173 and the following apply.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.1
linear indication
l
indication having a length greater than three times its width<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>3.2
non-linear indication
d
indication having a length less than or equal to three times its width<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4	 Testing parameters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many parameters, either individually or in combination, will affect the ability of a technique to detect
imperfections of a given size and orientation with respect to the condition of the test surface.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Detection of small imperfections is highly dependent on the surface condition of the weld and the
detection media used. Examples of the application of these parameters to give a high probability of
detection are given in  Annex A .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5	 Acceptance levels<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1	 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The width of the test surface shall include the weld metal and the adjacent parent metal up to a distance
of 10 mm on each side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acceptance levels prescribed for linear indications are those corresponding to the evaluation level.
Indications lower than this shall not be taken into account. Acceptable indications do not have to be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any adjacent indications separated by less than the major dimension of the smaller shall be assessed as
a single, continuous indication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Local grinding may be used to improve the classification of all or just part of a test surface, when it is
required to work to a higher detection limit than that expected by the existing weld surface condition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acceptance levels are given in  Table 1 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a
Acceptance levels 2 and 3 may be specified with a suffix “X”, which denotes that all linear indications detected shall be
assessed to level 1. However, the probability of detection of indications smaller than those denoted by the original acceptance
level can be low.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2	 Removal of imperfections<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the product specification permits, local grinding may be used to reduce or remove imperfections
which are the cause of unacceptable indications. All such areas shall be re-tested and evaluated with the
same magnetic system and technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Recommended testing parameters<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommended testing parameters for reliable detection of small imperfections are given in  Table A.1 .
The surfaces are in the as-welded condition. It may be necessary to improve the surface condition, e.g. by
abrasive paper or local grinding, to permit accurate interpretation of indications. The detection media
are given in order of preference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The weld cap and parent material offer smooth clean surfaces with negligible undercut, rippling and spatter. The surface
finish is typical of welds, made by automatic TIG-welding; submerged arc welding (fully mechanized) and manual metal arc
welding with iron powder electrodes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b
The weld cap and parent material offer reasonably smooth surfaces with minimal undercut, rippling and spatter. The
surface finish is typical of welds made by manual metal arc welding vertical downwards and MAG-welding using argon rich
gas for the capping runs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c
The weld cap and parent material are in the as-welded condition. The surface finish is typical of welds made by manual
metal arc welding or MAG-welding in any position.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
