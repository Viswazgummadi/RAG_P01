<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Digital radiography has been used for the testing of longitudinal weld seams in submerged arc-welded steel
tubes for some years. Digital radiography can be automated, and is considered to be more environmentally
friendly than film-based radiographic techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Digital radiography maintains the levels of security and availability afforded by X-ray film testing, which have
been in place for many years. Images can be made available in a fraction of the time previously taken by film-
based techniques, and usually at a lower exposure level and increased detector unsharpness when compared
to film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The storage and handling of digital images maintain the same levels of integrity available from film-based
techniques, yet gain all the benefits associated with comprehensive data storage and retrieval systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Imaging systems are constantly under development, and an important aspect of this part of ISO 10893 is to
qualify the use of those alternative systems currently available. This part of ISO 10893 describes the steps
required to deliver these benefits.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

General requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1
Unless otherwise specified by the product standard or agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer, a
radiographic inspection inspection shall be carried out on welded tubes after completion of all the primary
manufacturing process operations (rolling, heat treating, cold and hot working, sizing and primary
straightening, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
This inspection shall be carried out by trained operators qualified in accordance with ISO 9712,
ISO 11484 or equivalent. Competent personnel, nominated by the manufacturer, shall supervise all inspection.
In the case of third-party inspection, this shall be agreed on between the purchaser and manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The operating authorization issued by the employer shall be according to a written procedure. Non-destructive
testi n g (NDT) operations shall be authorized by a level 3 NDT individual approved by the employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The definition of levels 1, 2 and 3 can be found in appropriate standards, e.g. ISO 9712 and ISO 11484.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3
The tubes under test shall be sufficiently straight and free of foreign matter as to ensure the validity of
the test. The surfaces of the weld seam and adjacent parent metal shall be sufficiently free of such foreign
matter and surface irregularities which would interfere with the interpretation of the radiographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surface grinding is permitted in order to achieve an acceptable surface finish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.4
In cases where the weld reinforcement is removed, markers, usually in the form of lead arrows, shall be
placed on each side of the weld such that its position can be identified on the radiographic image. Alternatively,
an integrated automatic positioning system may be used to identify the position of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.5
Identification symbols, usually in the form of lead letters, shall be placed on each section of the weld
seam radiograph such that the projection of these symbols appears in each radiographic image to ensure
unequivocal identification of the section. Alternatively, an integrated automatic positioning system may be
used to identify the position of each radiographic image along the pipe weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.6
Markings shall be displayed on the recorded radiographic images to provide reference points for the
accurate relocation of the position of each radiograph. Alternatively, the automated measured image position
may be displayed on the digital image viewing screen by software for accurate position relocation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.7
When carrying out radiography on a continuous length of a weld, the pipe or pipe wall shall pass
between the X-ray tube and detector at a speed which is sufficient to allow accurate defect detection, or the
pipe shall move in start-stop mode and digital radiographs shall be taken when the pipe is not moving.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following digital imaging methods can be used in replacement of radiographic film:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1
The weld seam shall be tested by a digital radiographic technique, corresponding to 5 a) to 5 c).<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2
Two image quality classes, A and B, conforming to ISO 17636, shall be specified as:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  class A: radiographic examination technique with standard sensitivity;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  class B: radiographic technique with enhanced sensitivity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Image quality class A is used for most applications. Image quality class B is intended for applications where
increased sensitivity is required to reveal all the imperfections being detected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The required image quality class should be stated in the relevant product standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3
The digital image displayed shall meet the required quality class A or B.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4
The beam of radiation shall be directed at the centre of the section of the weld seam under examination
and shall be normal to the tube surface at that point.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.5
The diagnostic length shall be such that the increase in penetrated thickness at the ends of the useful
length of the sensitive detector input screen shall not exceed the penetrated thickness at the centre of the
detector by more than 10 % for image quality class B or by more than 20 % for image quality class A, provided
the specific requirements of 6.9 and Clause 7 are satisfied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.6
The single wall penetration technique shall be used. When the single wall technique is impracticable for
dimensional reasons, the use of the double wall penetration technique may be used, by agreement, if the
required sensitivities can be shown to be achievable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7
The separation between the detector and the weld surface shall be as small as possible for contact
technique (no magnification).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum value of the source-to-weld distance,  f , shall be selected such that the ratio of this distance to
the effective focal spot size,  d , i.e.  f / d , conforms to the values given by the following formulae (contact
technique):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.8
An obstacle to the implementation of DDA systems is the large ( >  50 μm) pixel size of the array
compared to the small grain size in film (which leads to film having very high spatial resolution).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It can, therefore, not be possible to achieve the required geometric resolution with a setup typically used for
film radiography. This difficulty may be circumvented by using geometric magnification to achieve the required
geometric resolution or by making use of the compensation principle [increasing the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) in the image] described in 7.1. Any combination of these measures is allowed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Exposure conditions, including X-ray tube voltage, shall achieve the image quality indicator (IQI)
requirements in Clause 7. Image contrast and brightness may be adjusted as required for digital image
viewing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Image quality<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1
The image quality shall be determined by the use of IQIs of the type specified in ISO 19232-1,
ISO 19232-2 and ISO 19232-5, and agreed on between the purchaser and manufacturer. The appropriate IQI
shall be placed on the source side of the weld on the base material adjacent to the weld. In the case of a wire
type IQI, at least 10 mm of the wires shall be visible on the parent material (see Figures 3 and 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>When the source side is inaccessible, the IQIs may be placed on the detector side of the object. In these
circumstances a letter “F” shall be placed near the IQIs and this procedural change shall be recorded in the
test report. Detector-side positions typically show 1 or 2 more wires, or holes, than if the same IQI was on the
source side. Customers may ask for a trial exposure to be carried out on a sample piece of pipe, with IQIs
placed on both source and detector sides as a comparison.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the tubes under inspection have the same dimensions and grade, it is sufficient to use the IQI only
every 4 h, or twice a shift, to check image sensitivity. When carrying out the sensitivity checks, though, the IQI
shall be placed on the source side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The parameters used with the trial exposures (settings of X-ray source, detector and geometry) shall not be
changed for the subsequent images acquired with detector-side IQIs. For stable systems and processes, such
as automated testing systems using DDAs, it is sufficient to prove the image quality once per shift as long as
tube dimension, tube material and testing parameters remain unchanged. In this case, the image quality proof
should be performed only with source side IQIs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>By usage of the duplex wire IQI, conforming to ISO 19232-5, the image unsharpness,  U g , shall be measured.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The read-out unsharpness,  U g , value for the duplex wire IQI is the smallest wire pair element number (largest
wire diameter) with a dip separation below 20 %, measured with a profile plot across the duplex wire in the
digital image.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The duplex wire IQI should be positioned at an approximately 5° angle towards the pixel orientation in order to
avoid aliasing effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The basic spatial resolution, SR b , of the detector which is fixed by the construction and hardware parameters
shall be determined by placing the duplex wire IQI directly in front of the detector. In this case, SR b  is given by:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SR b  = 0,5  U g
(3)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Compensation principle<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If both IQI sensitivities of Tables 1 and 2 (wire or hole and duplex wire IQI) cannot be achieved by the detector
system used, an increase in single wire visibility can compensate too high unsharpness values.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EXAMPLE
For 10 mm wall thickness, class B; it is necessary to use wire number W14 and duplex D11. If D11
cannot be reached, compensation is possible: two steps down from D11 to D9, but increasing two steps up from W14
to W16.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The contrast sensitivity for digital detectors depends on the integration time and tube current (mA) used for the
acquisition of the radiographic images for a given distance and tube voltage, so the single wire visibility can be
increased by an increased exposure time and mA setting.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2
The two image quality classes are defined in Tables 1 and 2. The minimum normalized SNR norm  in the
base material should be  >  70 for testing class A and  >  100 for testing class B. The normalized SNR norm  shall
be calculated from the measured SNR in the image at base material adjacent to the welding seam and
normalized by the basic spatial resolution of the detector system:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>SNR norm  = SNR  ×  88,6 μm/SR b
(4)<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For details of SNR measurement, see, for example, EN 14784-1, ASTM E2446 or ASTM E2597. IQI quality for
larger wall thicknesses is available in ISO 17636.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

For the double wall penetration technique, the image quality value for use shall be taken as that
corresponding to twice the specified wall thickness.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.4
Where available, the performance of the digital system should also be measured, using representative
quality indicators (RQIs). RQIs should be of the same dimensions and grade as the tubes under inspection.
RQIs containing actual or simulated linear defects, such as lack of penetration, lack of fusion and cracks, are
advised in order to ensure digital set-up is capable of meeting inspection specifications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Image processing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>8.1
The digital data of the radiographic detector shall be evaluated proportional to the radiation dose. This
shall be the prerequisite for correct measurements of SNR for evaluation of image quality. For optimal image
display, contrast and brightness should be interactively adjustable. Optional filter functions, profile plots and
the SNR tool should be integrated into the software for image display and evaluation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>8.2
Further means of image processing applied on the stored raw data (e.g. high pass filtering for image
display) shall be documented, repeatable and agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer.<<HEADING_END>>

Classification of indications<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.1
All indications found on the radiograph shall be classified as weld imperfections or defects, as described
in 9.2 and 9.3.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>9.2
Imperfections are discontinuities in the weld seam detectable by the radiographic testing method
described in this part of ISO 10893. Imperfections with a size and/or population density that are within the
specified acceptance limits are considered to have no practical implications on the intended use of the tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>9.3
Defects are imperfections with a size and/or population density greater than the specified acceptance
limits. Defects are considered to adversely affect or limit the intended use of the tubes.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10 Acceptance limits<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.1  Acceptance limits are applicable to radiographic examination of the weld seam and specified in 10.2 to
10.6, unless alternative requirements are specified in the product standards.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.2  Cracks, incomplete penetration and lack of fusion are not acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.3  Individual circular slag inclusions and gas pockets up to 3,0 mm or  T /3 in diameter ( T  = specified wall
thickness), whichever is the smaller, are acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The sum of the diameters of all such permitted individual imperfections in any 150 mm or 12 T  of weld length,
whichever is the smaller, shall not exceed 6,0 mm or 0,5 T , whichever is the smaller, where the separation
between individual inclusions is less than 4 T .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.4  Individual elongated slag inclusions up to 12,0 mm or  T  in length, whichever is the smaller, or up to
1,5 mm in width are acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The accumulated length of such permitted individual imperfections in any 150 mm or 12 T  of weld length,
whichever is the smaller, shall not exceed 12,0 mm where the separation between individual inclusions is less
than 4 T .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For information, the criteria specified in 10.3 and 10.4 are shown diagrammatically in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.5  Individual undercuts of any length having a maximum depth of 0,4 mm and not encroaching on the
minimum wall thickness shall be acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Individual undercuts of a maximum length of  T /2 having a maximum depth of 0,5 mm and not exceeding 10 %
of the specified wall thickness shall be acceptable, provided there are not more than two such undercuts in
any 300 mm of the weld length, and all such undercuts are dressed out.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>10.6  Undercuts on the inside and outside welds, which are coincident in the longitudinal direction, shall not
be acceptable.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11 Acceptance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.1  Any tubes not showing indications in excess of that permitted by the corresponding acceptance limits
shall be deemed to have passed the test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>11.2  Any tubes showing indications in excess of that permitted by the corresponding acceptance limits shall
be deemed suspect.<<HEADING_END>>

product standard:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the suspect area shall be removed by dressing. Complete removal of the defect shall be verified by either
liquid penetrant or magnetic particle testing, and the dressed area shall be retested by radiography. The
remaining wall thickness shall be measured by an appropriate technique to verify compliance with the
specified tolerances;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
the suspect area shall be repaired by welding carried out to an approved welding procedure. The repaired
area shall then be subject to radiographic examination in accordance with the requirements of this part of
ISO 10893 and the product standard;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the suspect area shall be cropped off. The remaining length of the tube shall be measured to verify
conformance to the specified tolerances;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
the tube shall be rejected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1 2  Image storage and display<<HEADING_END>>
