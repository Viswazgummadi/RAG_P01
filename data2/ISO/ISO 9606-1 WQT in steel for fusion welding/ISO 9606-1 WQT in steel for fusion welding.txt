<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 9606-1 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 44,  Welding and allied processes , Subcommittee
SC 11,  Qualification requirements for welding and allied processes personnel .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 9606-1:1994), which has been technically
revised. It also incorporates the Amendment ISO 9606-1:1994/Amd.1:1998.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ability of a welder to follow verbal or written instructions and verification of a person's skills are important
factors in ensuring the quality of the welded product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The testing of a welder's skill in accordance with this International Standard depends on the welding
techniques and conditions used, in which uniform rules are complied with and standard test pieces are used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The principle of this International Standard is that a qualification test qualifies a welder not only for the
conditions used in the test, but also for all other conditions which are considered easier to weld in accordance
with this International Standard. It is presumed that the welder has received training and/or has industrial
practice within the range of qualification.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The qualification test can be used to qualify a welding procedure and a welder provided that all the relevant
requirements, e.g. test piece dimensions and testing requirements are satisfied (see ISO 15614-1 [11] ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All new qualifications shall be in accordance with each part of this International Standard from its date of issue.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the end of its period of validity, existing qualification tests of welders in accordance with the requirement of
a national standard may be revalidated according to this International Standard. This is providing that the
technical intent of this International Standard is satisfied. It is necessary for the new range of qualification to
be interpreted in accordance with the requirements of this International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 9606 specifies the requirements for qualification testing of welders for fusion welding of steels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It provides a set of technical rules for a systematic qualification test of the welder, and enables such
qualifications to be uniformly accepted independently of the type of product, location and examiner or
examining body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When qualifying welders, the emphasis is placed on the welder's ability manually to manipulate the electrode,
welding torch or welding blowpipe, thereby producing a weld of acceptable quality.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The welding processes referred to in this part of ISO 9606 include those fusion-welding processes which are
designated as manual or partly mechanized welding. It does not cover fully mechanized and automated
welding processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
For such processes, see ISO 14732 [10] .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The qualification of welders is based on essential variables. For each essential variable, a range of
qualification is defined. If the welder has to weld outside the range of welder qualification, a new qualification
test is required. The essential variables are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  welding process(es);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  product type (plate or pipe);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.4 Type of weld<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The qualification test shall be carried out as butt or fillet welding. The following criteria are applicable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
Butt welds cover butt welds in any type of joint except branch connections [see also c)].<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
Butt welds do not qualify fillet welds or vice versa. It is, however, permissible to qualify a fillet weld in
combination with a butt weld, e.g. single bevel joint preparation with permanent material backing (a
minimum test piece thickness of 10 mm shall be used). See Annex C.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For this combination test, all testing requirements specified in this part of ISO 9606 shall be fulfilled and
associated ranges of qualification shall be given based on the test conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
Butt welds in pipes qualify branch joints with an angle   60° and the same range of qualification as in
Tables 1 to 12. For a branch weld, the range of qualification is based on the outside diameter of the
branch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
For applications where the type of weld cannot be qualified by means of either a butt or fillet or for branch
connections of less than 60°, a specific test piece should be used to qualify the welder, when specified
(e.g. by the product standard).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
Butt welds may qualify fillet welds if a supplementary fillet weld test piece (see Figure 3) is welded with
each   process, filler material (FM) group and electrode covering/core, in accordance with Tables 3, 4,
and 5. The test piece shall be at least 10 mm thick, or the thickness of the butt weld test piece if the
thickness is less, and completed using a single layer in the PB position. For this supplementary test, the
welder shall be qualified for all fillet welds as given for the butt weld qualification variables related to the
range of qualification for fillet welds (e.g. Tables 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12). Fillet weld positions PA and PB are
qualified by this test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5 Filler material grouping<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The qualification test shall be carried out with filler material from one of the groups listed in Table 2. When
welding with filler materials outside the filler material grouping in Table 2, a separate test is required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The parent material used in a qualification test should be from any suitable material from ISO/TR 15608,
material groups 1 to 11.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>  profile and dimensions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance requirements for imperfections found by test methods performed according to this part of
ISO 9606 shall, unless otherwise specified, be assessed in accordance with ISO 5817. A welder is qualified if
the imperfections are within ISO 5817, quality level B, except for the following imperfection types for which
level C shall apply: excess weld metal (502); excessive convexity (503); excessive throat thickness (5214);
excessive penetration (504); and undercut (501).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Bend-test specimens shall not reveal any discrete discontinuity   3 mm in any direction. Discontinuities
appearing at the edges of a test specimen during testing shall be ignored in the evaluation unless there is
evidence that cracking is due to incomplete penetration, slag or other discontinuity. The sum of the greatest
discontinuities exceeding 1 mm but less than 3 mm in any one bend specimen shall not exceed 10 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If the imperfections in the welder's test piece exceed the permitted maximum specified, then the welder fails
the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=2>>Job knowledge<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>B.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test of job knowledge is recommended, but it is not mandatory.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>However, some countries may require that the welder undergo a test of job knowledge. If the job knowledge
test is carried out, it should be recorded on the welder's qualification test certificate.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex outlines the job knowledge that a welder should have in order to ensure that procedures are
followed and common practices are complied with. The job knowledge indicated in this annex is only pitched
at the most basic level.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Owing to different training programmes in various countries, it is only proposed to standardize general
objectives or categories of job knowledge. The actual question used should be drawn up in the individual
country concerned, but should include questions on areas covered in B.2, relevant to the qualification test of
welders.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The actual tests of a welder's job knowledge may be given by any of the following methods or combinations of
these methods:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
written objective tests (multiple choice);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
oral questioning following a set of written questions;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
computer testing;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
demonstration/observation testing following a written set of criteria.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The test of job knowledge is limited to the matters related to the welding process used in the test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
