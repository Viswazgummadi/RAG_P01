<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5
Test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 Test techniques<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
The tubes shall be tested by the eddy current method for the detection of imperfections using in
“absolute mode” and/or in “differential mode”   one of the following alternative automated or semi-automated
techniques:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
concentric coil technique — full peripheral (see Figure 1);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
fixed or rotating probe/pancake coil technique — full peripheral (see Figure 2);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
segment coil technique — weld seam only (see Figure 3) or full body (see Figure 4).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For all techniques, the chosen relative speed of movement during the testing shall not vary by more than
± 10 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is recognized that there may be a short length at both tube ends which cannot be tested. Any untested ends
shall be dealt with in accordance with the requirements of the appropriate product standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
See Annex A for guidelines on the limitations of the eddy current test method.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.2
When testing tubes using the concentric coil technique, the maximum tube outside diameter that shall
be tested shall be restricted to 180 mm (250 mm for E4H).<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Square and rectangular tubes, used for structural purposes, with a maximum dimension across the diagonal
of 180 mm may also be tested using this technique with adequately shaped coils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.3
When testing tubes using the rotating or fixed probe/pancake coil technique, the tube and the
probe/pancake coil shall be moved   relative to each other or the movement shall be simulated by electronic
commutation through the individual probes composing the pancake, such that the whole of the tube surface is
scanned. There is no restriction on the maximum tube outside diameter using this technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
It is emphasized that only external surface breaking imperfections can be detected using this technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.4
When testing the weld of welded tubes using the segment coil technique, there is no restriction on the
maximum tube outside diameter. The test coil shall be maintained in proper alignment with the weld, such as
that the whole of the weld is scanned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1.5
When testing the full body of tubes using the segment coils technique, the maximum tube outside
diameter that shall be tested shall be limited to:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯   ∅  219,1 mm for 2  ×  180° coils,<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯   ∅  508,0 mm for 4  ×  100° coils.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
It is emphasized that the test sensitivity is at a maximum at the tube surface adjacent to the test coil and
decreases with increasing thickness (see Annex A).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Test equipment<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The equipment shall be capable of classifying tubes as either acceptable or suspect tubes by means of an
automated trigger/alarm level combined with a marking and/or sorting system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Reference tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
The reference standards defined in this part of ISO 10893 are convenient standards for calibration of
non-destructive testing equipment. Their dimensions should not be considered as the minimum size of
imperfections detectable by such equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2
The reference tubes shall have the same specified diameter and thickness, same surface finish, and
delivery condition (e.g. as-rolled, normalized, quenched and tempered) and similar steel grade as the tubes
being tested. For specified wall thickness exceeding 5 mm, the wall thickness of the reference tubes may be
greater than the specified wall thickness of the pipe under inspection, provided the notch depth is calculated
on the specified wall thickness of the pipe being inspected. The manufacturer shall demonstrate, on request,
the effectiveness of the adopted solution.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3
The reference standards for the various testing techniques shall be as follows:<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
a reference hole or holes as defined in 6.2 and 6.5.1, when using the concentric coil technique;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
a reference hole or holes as defined in 6.3 and 6.5.1, when using the segment coil technique;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
a reference notch as defined in 6.4 and 6.5.2, when using the fixed or rotating probe/pancake coil
technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 1
In special cases, for example when testing hot tubes or using equipment contained within a continuous tube
mill, a modified calibration or calibration checking procedure can be used, by agreement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE 2
When using the concentric coil technique a longitudinal notch can be used, by agreement, as the reference
standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4
The reference standards (see 6.2 to 6.4) shall be sufficiently separated longitudinally (in the case of
reference holes) and from the ends of the reference tube such that clearly distinguishable signal indications
are obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Concentric coil technique<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.1
When using the eddy current concentric coil technique, the reference tube shall contain three or four
circular holes, drilled radially through the full thickness of the reference tube. The holes shall be
circumferentially displaced respectively at 120° or 90° from each other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.2.2
Alternatively, only one hole shall be drilled through the full thickness of the reference tube and during
calibration and calibration checking the reference tube shall be passed through the equipment with the hole
positioned at 0°, 90°, 180° and 270°.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Segment coil technique<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.1
When using the segment coil technique, the reference tube shall contain a single circular hole, drilled
radially through the full thickness of the reference tube and located adjacent or directly in the weld seam.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3.2
When using the segment coil technique, for full body inspection, the reference tube shall contain three
circular holes, drilled radially through the full thickness of the reference tube. Each segment coil shall be
checked with the reference tube, and the three holes shall be displaced as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>⎯  180° segment coils: 0°,  + 90° and  − 90° from the centre of the coil;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

The values of notch depth specified in this table are the same for the corresponding categories, in
all International Standards concerning non-destructive testing of steel tubes where reference is made to
different acceptance levels. Although the reference standards are identical, the various test methods involved
can give different test results. Accordingly, the acceptance level designation prefix E (eddy current) has been
adopted to avoid any inferred direct equivalence with other test methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7
Equipment calibration and checking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.1
At the start of each inspection cycle, the equipment shall be calibrated to produce consistently,
(e.g. from three consecutive passes of the reference tube through the equipment), clearly identifiable signals
from the reference standard(s). These signals shall be used to activate their respective trigger alarm of the
equipment as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
when using multiple reference holes in the reference tube (concentric coil techniques or segment coil
technique for testing full surface), the full amplitude obtained from the reference hole giving the smallest
signal shall be used to set trigger/alarm level of the equipment. When using a single reference hole in the
reference tube, the reference tube shall be passed through the inspection equipment with the reference
hole, on successive runs, positioned as specified in 6.2.2, and the full amplitude obtained from the
reference hole run giving the smallest signal shall be used to set trigger/alarm level of the equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
when using a single reference hole (segment coil technique for testing the weld of welded tubes), the full
amplitude obtained from the reference hole run giving the smallest signal shall be used to set the
trigger/alarm level of the equipment;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
when using the reference notch (fixed or rotating probe/pancake coil technique), the full signal amplitude
obtained from the reference notch shall be used to set the trigger/alarm level of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2
During the calibration check, the relative speed of movement between the reference tube and the test
coils/probes shall be the same as that used during the production test (see also 5.1.2, 5.1.3 and 5.1.4). The
same equipment settings, for instance frequency, sensitivity, phase discrimination, filtering and eventual
magnetic saturation, shall be employed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3
The calibration of the equipment shall be checked at regular intervals during the production testing of
tubes of the same specified diameter, thickness and grade by passing the reference tube through the test
equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The frequency of checking the calibration shall be at least every 4 h, but also whenever there is an equipment
operator team changeover and at the start and end of production.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.4
The equipment shall be recalibrated if any of the parameters which were used during the initial
calibration are changed.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.5
If on checking during production testing, the calibration requirements are not satisfied then all tubes
tested since the previous acceptable equipment calibration shall be retested after the equipment has been
recalibrated.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Guidance notes on limitations of eddy current test method<<HEADING_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 Eddy current depth of penetration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>During the eddy current testing of tubes, the sensitivity of the test is at a maximum at the tube surface
adjacent to the test coil and decreases with increasing distance from the test coil. The signal response from a
subsurface or internal surface imperfection is thus smaller than that from an external surface imperfection of
the same size. The capacity of the test equipment to detect subsurface or internal surface imperfections is
determined by various factors, but predominantly by the thickness of the tube under test and the eddy current
excitation frequency.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The excitation frequency applied to the test coil determines the extent to which the induced eddy current
intensity penetrates the tube wall. The higher the excitation frequency, the lower the penetration and
conversely, the lower the excitation frequency, the higher the penetration. In particular, the physical
parameters of the tube (conductivity, permeability, etc.) should be taken into account.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2 Concentric coil/segment coil technique<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>These test techniques are preferred since they can detect short longitudinal imperfections and transverse
imperfections, both of which break, or lie below, the surface adjacent to the test coil.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum length of the longitudinal imperfection which is detectable is principally determined by the
search coil arrangement and by the rate of change of section along the length of the imperfection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using these techniques on ferromagnetic steel, the products being inspected shall be magnetically
saturated, inserting them into an external strong magnetic field. The intention of this saturation is to normalize
and reduce the magnetic permeability of the material in order to increase the penetration capability of eddy
current and to reduce possible magnetic noises from material itself.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3 Fixed or rotating probe/pancake coil technique<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This test technique uses one or more probes/coils to describe a helical path over the tube surface. For this
reason, this technique detects longitudinal imperfections with a minimum length dependent on the width of the
test coil and the inspection helical pitch. It is recognized that transverse imperfections are not normally
detectable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Since the excitation frequency is significantly higher than that using concentric coil/segment coil, only
imperfections which break the tube surface adjacent to the test coil are detectable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
