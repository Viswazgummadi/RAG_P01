<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 23277 was prepared by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) Technical Committee
CEN/TC 121,  Welding  (as EN 1289:1998 and its Amd.1:2002 and Amd.2:2003), and was adopted, under a
special “fast-track procedure”, by Technical Committee ISO/TC 44,  Welding and allied processes ,
Subcommittee SC 5,  Testing and inspection of welds , in parallel with its approval by the ISO member bodies.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This document constitutes a consolidated version.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requests for official interpretations of any aspect of this International Standard should be directed to the
Secretariat of ISO/TC 44/SC 5 via your national standards body. A complete listing of these bodies can be
found at  http://www.iso.org .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

of welds — Acceptance levels<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard specifies acceptance levels for indications from surface breaking imperfections in
metallic welds detected by penetrant testing.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance levels are primarily intended for use during manufacture examination, but where appropriate
they can be used for in-service inspection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The acceptance levels in this International Standard are based on detection capabilities that can be expected
when using techniques specified in ISO 3452 and parameters recommended in Annex A. The acceptance
levels can be related to welding standards, application standards, specifications or codes. Such a relationship
is shown in ISO 17635 for ISO 5817 and ISO 10042.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Testing parameters<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Many parameters, either individually or in combination, will affect the shape and size of a penetrant indication
produced by a weld imperfection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following items are significant factors that will affect the shape and size of indications.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.2 Sensitivity<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Penetrant materials are classified in accordance with ISO 3452-2, including a sensitivity level which relates to
the ability to detect small imperfections. Generally higher sensitivity materials should be used for the detection
of small imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.3 Surface condition<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Surface condition is directly related to the minimum detectable imperfection size. Best results are normally
achieved when inspecting smooth surfaces. Surface roughness or irregularities (e. g. undercut, spatter) can
cause high background and non-relevant indications resulting in a low probability of detection for small
imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>4.4 Process and technique<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Penetrant systems and techniques should be selected according to the test surface condition. In some cases
the choice will have a direct effect on the limits of reliable detection, for example the removal of excess
penetrant by swab cleaning on rough surfaces is not recommended when seeking small imperfections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Guidance on these matters is given in Annex A and in ISO 3452.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Acceptance levels<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The width of the test surface shall include the weld metal and the adjacent parent metal up to a distance of
10 mm on each side.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Indications produced by penetrant testing do not usually display the same size and shape characteristics as
the imperfection causing that indication. For the purposes of this standard, it is the size of the indication which
should be assessed against the values shown in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acceptance levels prescribed for linear indications are those corresponding to the evaluation level. Indications
lower than this shall not be taken into account. Normally, acceptable indications shall not be recorded.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Local grinding may be used to improve the classification of all or part of a test surface when it is required to
work to a higher detection limit than that recommended by the existing weld surface condition in Table A.1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Acceptance levels for welds in metallic materials are given in Table 1.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Initial evaluation shall be carried out as described in ISO 3452 and final evaluation of indication size shall be
carried out after a designated minimum development time has elapsed, and before the indication has
degenerated such that it no longer represents the causing imperfection.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3 Grouped indications<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Any adjacent indications separated by less than the major dimension of the smaller shall be assessed as a
single, continuous indication.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Grouped indications shall be evaluated in accordance with an application standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the product specification permits, local grinding may be used to reduce or remove imperfections which
are the cause of unacceptable indications. All such areas shall be re-tested and evaluated with the same
penetrant system and technique.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
