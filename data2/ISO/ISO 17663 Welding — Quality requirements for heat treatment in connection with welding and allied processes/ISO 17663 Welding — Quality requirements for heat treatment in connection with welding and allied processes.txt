<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO 17663 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 44,  Welding and allied processes , Subcommittee
SC 10,  Unification of requirements in the field of metal welding .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This first edition cancels and replaces ISO/TR 17663:2001, which has been technically revised.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requests for official interpretations of any aspect of this International Standard should be directed to the
Secretariat of ISO/TC 44/SC 10 via your national standards body. A listing of these bodies can be found at

<<HEADING level=3>>9.6 General rules for local post weld heat treatment of welds in pipe work<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is permissible to heat treat separate sections of the product or component in the furnace, provided that the
length,  L , expressed in millimetres, of the overlap of the previously heat-treated sections is equal to the
greater of 1 500 mm or the value of  L  as given in Equation (1):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>D
is the outside diameter of the product or component, expressed in millimetres;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>t
is the nominal thickness at the weld, expressed in millimetres.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
Equation (1) is equivalent to  (

as given in European standards. Equation (1) is more user-friendly
because only the outer diameter,  D , is used instead of the inner or outer radius,  R i  or  R e , respectively. An example is given
in Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is permissible to locally heat treat circumferential welds by inductive or resistance heating around the entire
circumference of the product or component. The width of the heated zone,  L W , expressed in millimetres, shall
not be less than the value of  L  as given in Equation (1) nor more than 12  t , with the weld being in the centre.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the attaching butt weld is at a distance,  L BW , expressed in millimetres, greater than the value of  L  as
given in Equation (1) from the branch/stub to shell weld, it may be post-weld heat-treated in isolation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the attaching butt weld is at a distance,  L BW , less than the value of  L  as given in Equation (1) from the
branch/stub to the shell weld, the post-weld heat treatment shall be applied simultaneously to the butt weld
and the branch/stub to shell weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
