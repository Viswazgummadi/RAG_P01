<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

General requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.1
Unless otherwise specified by the product standard or agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer,
this liquid penetrant inspection shall be carried out on tubes after completion of all the primary production
process operations (rolling, heat treating, cold and hot working, sizing, primary straightening, etc.).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.2
The surface of the tube being tested shall be sufficiently clean and free of oil, grease, sand, scale or
any other foreign matter which can potentially interfere with the correct interpretation of the indications
obtained from liquid penetrant testing. The type of indications, as well as the minimum dimension of the
surface imperfections detected, depends on the specific tube manufacturing process and the surface finish.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3
This inspection shall be carried out by trained operators, qualified in accordance with ISO 9712,
ISO 11484 or equivalent, and supervised by competent personnel nominated by the manufacturer. In the case
of third-party inspection, this shall be agreed on between the purchaser and manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The operating authorization issued by the employer shall be according to a written procedure. NDT operations
shall be authorized by a level 3 NDT individual approved by the employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The definition of levels 1, 2 and 3 can be found in appropriate International Standards, e.g. ISO 9712 and
ISO 11484.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.1
A liquid penetrant is applied to the surface being examined and allowed to enter the surface
imperfections. All excess penetrant is then removed; the surface of the part is dried and a developer is applied.
The developer functions both as a blotter to absorb penetrant that has been trapped in imperfections and as a
contrasting background to enhance the visibility of penetrant indications. The dyestuffs in penetrants are either
colour-contrast (visible under white light) or fluorescent (visible under ultraviolet light). For both penetrant
techniques, the following three types of penetrant systems can be used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
water washable;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
post emulsifying;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
solvent removable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the term “penetrant materials” is used in this part of ISO 10893, it is intended to include all penetrants,
solvents or cleaning agents, developers, etc., used in the testing process.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 10893-4:2011(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1.2
For each tube or each part of the tube under test, either a colour-contrast penetrant technique or a
fluorescent penetrant technique, both techniques with one of the three types of penetrant systems, shall be
used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The general principles and the methods of verification of liquid penetrant testing as described in ISO 3059,
ISO 3452-1 and ISO 3452-2 shall be applied (see 5.3).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.2 Detection of imperfections and their classification<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The liquid penetrant method is an effective means of detecting imperfections which are open to the surface
(called surface imperfections in this part of ISO 10893). Typical surface imperfections detectable by this
method are cracks, seams, laps, cold shuts, laminations and porosity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The liquid penetrant method does not make it possible to determine the nature, shape and, more generally,
the dimensions of the surface imperfections revealed. The dimensions of the penetrant indication do not
directly represent the actual dimensions of the surface imperfection causing this indication. That is why the
classification of liquid penetrant indications shall be the following:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
linear indications — indications where the length of the indication is equal to or more than three times the
width of the indication;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
rounded indications — indications which are circular or elliptical in shape, where the length of the
indication is less than three times the width of the indication;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
accumulated indications — indications which are linear or rounded and are aligned or clustered with a
separation of not more than the length of the smallest indication and consisting of at least three
indications;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
non-relevant indications — indications which may result from localized surface irregularities to a particular
tube-making process, for example machining marks, scratches and sizing/straightening marks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum dimension of indications that shall be considered during the evaluation shall be as given in
Table 1, in relation to the acceptance level specified.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Table 1 — Minimum dimension of indications that shall be considered for evaluation<<HEADING_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
for the choice of the penetrant system, the tube surface condition as well as the test category shall be
taken into account;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
for stainless steel tubes, low halogen (chlorine/fluorine) and low sulphur penetrant materials shall be
applied;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the temperature of application shall be between 10 °C and 50 °C. When it is not practicable to conduct
the liquid penetrant testing within the given temperature range, the testing procedure shall be qualified at
the proposed temperature using the liquid penetrant comparator block (e.g. a quench-cracked aluminium
block);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
the penetrant should be applied by brushing or spraying. For parts of tubes, dipping or flooding is less
effective but not prohibited;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
the dwell time shall be not less than that recommended by the manufacturer of the penetrant system;
usually it is between 3 min and 30 min;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
the removal of excess water-washable or post-emulsified penetrant shall be performed with rinsing by
water, under black light conditions where appropriate, at a pressure around 200 kPa (2 bar) with a
maximum of 350 kPa (3,5 bar). The temperature of the water used for rinsing shall be less than 40 °C.
The excess solvent-removable penetrant shall be removed insofar as possible by using wipes of white,
Iint-free material that is clean and dry, until most traces of penetrant have been removed. Then the
surface shall be lightly wiped with a Iint-free material that has been slightly moistened with solvent, until
all remaining traces of excess penetrant have been removed. Flushing the surface with solvent following
the application of the penetrant and prior to developing is prohibited;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>g)
drying of the surface subsequent to washing with water can be assisted by using wipes of white, Iint-free
material that is clean and dry or by using a hot-air blast at a pressure below 200 kPa (2 bar) and a
temperature below 70 °C. Drying after the solvent-removing process is generally by normal   evaporation,
therefore no other drying techniques are necessary. The temperature of the tube shall not exceed 50 °C,
unless otherwise agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>h)
the wet developer shall be applied by spraying, in such a manner as to assure complete coverage of the
area being tested with a thin, even film of developer. The dry-powder developer shall be applied either by
dipping the tube, or the parts of the tube being tested, into a fluid bed of dry developer or by dusting it
with the dry-powder developer through a manual powder bulb or a spray powder gun (conventional or
electrostatic), provided the powder is dusted evenly over the entire surface being tested;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>i)
the development time begins as soon as the wet-developer coating is dry or immediately after the
application of the dry-powder developer. Generally, the development time is equal to the penetration time
and varies from 5 min to 30 min, and if the bleed out does not alter the inspection results; development
periods of more than 30 min are permitted;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>j)
the inspection of the areas being tested shall be performed after the applicable development time as
specified in 5.3 i), to assure proper bleed out of penetrant from the imperfections on to the developer
coating. It is good practice to observe the surface while applying the developer as an aid to evaluating
indications. For fluorescent penetrant indications, the inspection shall be carried out in a darkened area
using a UV-A radiation source with a background of light level not exceeding 20 lux and a black light
intensity of at least 10 W/m 2  on the surface of the area being inspected. For visible penetrant indications,
the illumination of the surface of the area being inspected shall be not less than 500 Iux.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Evaluation of indications<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1
Four acceptance levels, corresponding to four severity levels with maximum permissible number or
maximum permissible dimensions (diameter or length) have been established in accordance with Tables 2
and 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2
The inspection shall be carried out visually without image   magnification.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A remote inspection technique, such as using television camera, is permitted provided the manufacturer can
demonstrate that the acceptance criteria are not affected.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>6.3
Only relevant indications with major dimensions equal to or greater than those given in Table 1 shall be
taken into consideration for the acceptance levels. Relevant indications are those which result from
unacceptable imperfections. Similar indications produced by machining marks or other non-relevant surface
conditions shall not be considered. Any indication in excess of the dimensions of the acceptance level
according to 6.1, which is believed to be non-relevant, shall be re-examined to verify whether or not actual
defects are present. Surface conditioning may precede the re-examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4
Relevant indications obtained by the liquid penetrant testing in accordance with this part of ISO 10893
shall undergo the following evaluation and classification.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
For testing the total surface of the tube or part of tube, an imaginary frame aperture of 100 mm  ×  150 mm
shall be placed over the area showing the greatest number of indications. The classification based on the
kind, number and dimension of the indications shall be taken according to Table 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
For testing the weld seam, an imaginary frame aperture of 50 mm  ×  150 mm shall be placed over the
area showing the greatest number of indications, with the 50 mm dimension centred over the weld seam.
The classification based on the kind, number and dimension of the indications shall be taken according to
Table 3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
For testing the bevel face at the tube ends, linear indications with a length less than 6 mm shall be
acceptable.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
For calculating the cumulative length of accumulated indications, the length of the major axis of each
linear or rounded indication shall be taken into account. Where the separation between to adjacent
indications is less than the length or the diameter of the larger of the two indications, they shall be
considered as one indication and the sum of the individual lengths or diameters plus the separation shall
be used to calculate the overall length.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Acceptance<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1
Any tubes showing no indications in excess of that permitted by the corresponding acceptance level
shall be deemed to have passed the test.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2
Any tubes showing indications in excess of that permitted by the corresponding acceptance level shall
be deemed suspect.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3
For suspect tubes, one or more of the following actions shall be taken subject to the requirements of the
product standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
The suspect area shall be dressed or explored by using a suitable method. After checking that the
remaining thickness is within tolerance, the tube shall be retested as previously specified. If no indications
are obtained equal to or greater than the acceptance Ievel, the tube shall be deemed to have passed this
test.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>By agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, the suspect area may be retested by other non-
destructive techniques and test methods to agreed acceptance levels.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
