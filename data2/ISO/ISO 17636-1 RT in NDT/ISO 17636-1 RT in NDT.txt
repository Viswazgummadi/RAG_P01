<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Classification of radiographic techniques<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The radiographic techniques are divided into two classes:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  Class A: basic techniques;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>  Class B: improved techniques.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Class B techniques are used when class A might be insufficiently sensitive.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Better techniques compared to class B are possible and may be agreed between the contracting parties by
specification of all appropriate test parameters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The choice of radiographic technique shall be agreed between the contracting parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If, for technical or industrial reasons, it is not possible to meet one of the conditions specified for class B, such
as the type of radiation source or the source-to-object distance,  f ,  it may be agreed by contracting parties that
the condition selected may be that specified for class A. The loss of sensitivity shall be compensated by an
increase of minimum density to 3,0 or by selection of a better film system class with a minimum density of 2,6.
The other conditions for class B remain unchanged, especially the image quality achieved (see Tables B.1 to<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>© ISO 2013 – All rights reserved

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 17636-1:2013(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>B.12). Because of the better sensitivity compared to class A, the test specimen may be regarded as being
examined to class B. This does not apply if the special SFD reductions as described in 7.6 for test
arrangements 7.1.4 and 7.1.5 are used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6
General preparations and requirements<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 Protection against ionizing radiation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>WARNING — Exposure of any part of the human body to X-rays or gamma-rays can be highly
injurious to health. Wherever X-ray equipment or radioactive sources are in use, appropriate legal
requirements shall be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Local or national or international safety precautions when using ionizing radiation shall be strictly applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.2 Surface preparation and stage of manufacture<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In general, surface preparation is not necessary, but where surface imperfections or coatings can cause
difficulty in detecting defects, the surface shall be ground smooth or the coatings shall be removed.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise specified, radiography shall be carried out after the final stage of manufacture, e.g. after
grinding or heat treatment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.3 Location of the weld in the radiograph<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the radiograph does not show the weld, high density markers shall be placed on either side of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.4 Identification of radiographs<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Symbols shall be affixed to each section of the object being radiographed. The images of these symbols shall
appear in the radiograph outside the region of interest where possible and shall ensure unambiguous
identification of the section.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.5 Marking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Permanent markings on the object to be examined shall be made in order to accurately locate the position of
each radiograph (e.g. zero point, direction, identification, measure).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the nature of the material and/or its service conditions do not permit permanent marking, the location
may be recorded by means of accurate sketches or photographs.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.6 Overlap of films<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When radiographing an area with two or more separate films, the films shall overlap sufficiently to ensure that
the complete region of interest is radiographed. This shall be verified by a high density marker on the surface
of the object which is to appear on each film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.7 Types and positions of image quality indicators<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality of image shall be verified by use of image quality indicators (IQIs) in accordance with ISO 19232-1
or ISO 19232-2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The IQI used shall be placed preferably on the source side of the test object at the centre of the area of
interest on the parent metal beside the weld. The identification numbers and, when used, the lead letter F,
shall not be in the area of interest, except when geometric configuration makes it impractical .  The IQI shall be
in close contact with the surface of the object.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 17636-1:2013(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Its location shall be made in a section of uniform thickness characterized by a uniform optical density on the
film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>According to the IQI type used, cases a) and b) shall be considered.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
When using a wire IQI, the wires shall be directed perpendicular to the weld and its location shall ensure
that at least 10 mm of the wire length shows in a section of uniform optical density, which is normally in
the parent metal adjacent to the weld. For exposures in accordance with 7.1.6 and 7.1.7, the IQI can be
placed with the wires across the pipe axis and they should not be projected into the image of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
When using a step hole IQI, it shall be placed in such way that the hole number required is placed close
to the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For exposures in accordance with 7.1.6 and 7.1.7, the IQI type used can be placed either on the source or on
the film side. If the IQIs cannot be placed in accordance with the above conditions, the IQIs are placed on the
film side and the image quality shall be determined at least once from comparison exposure with one IQI
placed at the source side and one at the film side under the same conditions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For double wall exposures, when the IQI is placed on the film side, the above test is not necessary. In this
case, refer to the correspondence tables (Tables B.3 to B.12).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where the IQIs are placed on the film side, the letter F shall be placed near the IQI and it shall be stated in the
test report.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If steps have been taken to guarantee that radiographs of similar test objects and regions are produced with
identical exposure and processing techniques, and no differences in the image quality value are likely, the
image quality need not be verified for every radiograph. The extent of image quality verification should be
subject to agreement between the contracting parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For exposures of pipes with diameter 200 mm and above with the source centrally located at least three IQIs
should be placed equally spaced at the circumference. The film(s) showing IQI images are then considered
representative for the whole circumference.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The films shall be viewed in accordance with ISO 5580.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>From the examination of the image of the IQI on the radiograph, the number of the smallest wire or hole which
can be discerned is determined. The image of a wire is accepted if a continuous length of at least 10 mm is
clearly visible in a section of uniform optical density. In the case of the step hole type IQI, if there are two
holes of the same diameter, both shall be discernible, in order that the step be considered as visible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The IQI value  obtained shall be indicated on the test report of the radiographic examination. In each case the
type of indicator used shall be clearly stated, as shown on the IQI.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>Tables B.1 to B.12 show the minimum quality values for metallic materials. For other materials these
requirements or corresponding requirements may be agreed upon by contracting parties. The requirements
shall be determined in accordance with ISO 19232-4.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case where Ir 192 or Se 75 sources are used, IQI values worse than the ones listed in Tables B.1 to

<<PARAGRAPH>>Normally radiographic techniques in accordance with 7.1.2 to 7.1.9 shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>X-ray film shall be placed as close to the object as possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The elliptical technique (double wall and double image) in accordance with Figure 11 should not be used for
external diameter  D e  > 100 mm or wall thickness  t  > 8 mm or weld width > D e /4. Two 90 ° displaced images
are sufficient if  t / D e  < 0,12; otherwise three images are needed. The distance between the two projected weld
images shall be about one weld width.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When it is difficult to carry out an elliptical examination at  D e     100 mm, the perpendicular technique in
accordance with 7.1.7 may be used (see Figure 12). In this case, three exposures 120° or 60° apart are
required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For test arrangements in accordance with Figures 11, 13, and 14, the inclination of the beam shall be kept as
small as possible and be such as to prevent superimposition of the two images. The source-to-object distance,
f , shall be kept as small as possible for the technique shown in Figure 13, in accordance with 7.6. The IQI
shall be placed close to the film with a lead letter F.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Other radiographic techniques may be agreed by the contracting parties when it is useful, e.g. for reasons
such as the geometry of the piece or differences in material thickness. In 7.1.9 an example of such a case is
presented. Multi-film techniques shall not be used to reduce exposure times on uniform sections. Additionally,
thickness compensation with the same material may be applied.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>thickness and material<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For some applications where there is a thickness change across the area of the object being radiographed, a
modification of technique with a slightly higher voltage may be used, but it should be noted that an excessively
high tube voltage leads to a loss of defect detection sensitivity. For steel, the increment shall be not more than
50 kV, for titanium not more than 40 kV, and for aluminium not more than 30 kV.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>On thin steel specimens, gamma-rays from Se 75, Ir 192 and Co 60 sources do not produce radiographs
having as good a defect detection sensitivity as X-rays used with appropriate technique parameters. However,
because of the advantages of gamma-ray sources in handling and accessibility, Table 2 gives a range of
thicknesses for which each of these gamma-ray sources may be used when the use of X-ray tubes is difficult.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For certain applications, wider wall thickness ranges may be permitted, if sufficient image quality can be
achieved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Other ways of radiographing may be agreed between the contracting parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>EXAMPLE
For better detection of lack of side wall fusion, the beam direction should be aligned with the weld
preparation angles.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5 Reduction of scattered radiation<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.1 Metal filters and collimators<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to reduce the effect of backscattered radiation, direct radiation shall be collimated as much as
possible to the section under examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>With Se 75, Ir 192, and Co 60 radiation sources or in the case of edge scatter a sheet of lead can be used as
a filter of low energy scattered radiation between the object and the cassette. The thickness of this sheet is
0,5 mm to 2 mm in accordance with the penetrated thickness.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.5.2 Interception of backscattered radiation<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The presence of backscattered radiation shall be checked for each new test arrangement by means of a lead
letter B (with a minimum height of 10 mm and a minimum thickness of 1,5 mm) placed immediately behind
each cassette. If the image of this symbol records as a lighter image on the radiograph, it shall be rejected. If
the symbol is darker or invisible the radiograph is acceptable and demonstrates good protection against
backscattered radiation.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If necessary, the film shall be shielded from backscattered radiation by a sheet of lead of at least 1 mm
thickness, or a sheet of tin of at least 1,5 mm thickness, placed behind the film–screen combination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.6 Source-to-object distance<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum source-to-object distance  f min  depends on the source size or focal spot size  d  and on the object-
to-film distance  b . The source size or focal spot size  d  shall be in accordance with EN 12543 or EN 12679.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>When the source size or focal spot size is defined by two dimensions, the larger shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The distance  f  shall, where practicable, be chosen so that the ratio of this distance to the source size or focal
spot size  d , i.e.  f / d , is not less than the values given by Formulae (1) and (2):<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>If the distance  b  is less than 1,2 t  then the dimension  b  in Formulae (1) and (2) and Figure 21 shall be replaced
by the nominal thickness  t .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For determination of the source-to-object distance  f min , the nomogram in Figure 21 may be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This nomogram is based on Formulae (1) and (2).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In class A, if detection of planar imperfections is a requirement, the minimum distance  f min  shall be the same
as for class B in order to reduce the geometric unsharpness by a factor of 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In critical technical applications of crack-sensitive materials, more sensitive radiographic techniques than
class B shall be used.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>When using the elliptic technique specified in 7.1.6 or the perpendicular technique specified in 7.1.7,  b  shall be
replaced by the external diameter,  D e , of the pipe in Formulae (1) and (2) and in Figure 21.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the source is outside the object and film on the other side (technique specified in 7.1.8 as double wall
penetration and single image) the minimum source-to-object distance is determined only by the wall thickness
(i.e. not by the pipe diameter).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where possible, it is preferable to avoid usage of a double wall technique (see 7.1.6.to 7.1.8) by placing the
radiation source inside the object to be radiographed, to achieve a more suitable direction of examination (see
7.1.4 and 7.1.5). The reduction in minimum source-to-object distance should not be greater than 20 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the source is located centrally inside the object and film outside (technique shown in 7.1.4) and
provided that the IQI requirements are met, this percentage may be increased. However, the reduction in<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

contracting parties provided that the IQI requirements are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.7 Maximum area for a single exposure<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The number of radiographs for a complete examination of flat welds (see Figures 1, 15, 17, and 18) and of
curved welds with the radiation source arranged off-centre (see Figures 2 to 4 and 8 to 16) should be
specified in accordance with technical requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The ratio of the penetrated thickness at the outer edge of an evaluated area of uniform thickness to that at the
centre beam shall not be more than 1,1 for class B and 1,2 for class A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The densities resulting from any variation of penetrated thickness should not be lower than those indicated in
7.8 and not higher than those allowed by the available illuminator, provided suitable masking is possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The size of the area to be examined includes the weld and the heat-affected zones. In general, about 10 mm
of parent metal shall be examined on each side of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Recommendations for the number of radiographs are indicated in Annex A which gives an acceptable
examination of a circumferential butt weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.8 Density of radiograph<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Exposure conditions should be such that the minimum optical density of the radiograph in the area examined
is greater than or equal to those given in Table 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>Table 5 — Optical density of the radiographs<<HEADING_END>>

The value may be reduced by special agreement between the contracting parties to 1,5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c
The value may be reduced by special agreement between the contracting parties to 2,0.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>High optical densities can be used with advantage where the viewing light is sufficiently bright in accordance
with 7.10. The maximum readable film density depends on the film viewer used and its maximum luminance
(see ISO 5580). The maximum readable density shall be posted on the viewer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In order to avoid unduly high fog densities arising from film ageing, development or temperature, the fog
density shall be checked periodically on a non-exposed sample taken from the films being used, and handled
and processed under the same conditions as the actual radiograph. The fog density shall not exceed 0,3. Fog
density here is defined as the total density (emulsion and base) of a processed, unexposed film.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When using a multi-film technique with interpretation of single films, the optical density of each film shall be in
accordance with Table 5.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If double film viewing is requested, the optical density of one single film shall not be lower than 1,3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.9 Processing<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Films are processed in accordance with the conditions recommended by the film and chemical manufacturer
to obtain the selected film system class. Particular attention shall be paid to temperature, developing time and
washing time. The film processing shall be controlled regularly in accordance with ISO 11699-2. The<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>The minimum number of exposures required is presented in Figures A.1 to A.4 which are valid for pipes with
an external diameter exceeding 100 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the deviation of the wall thickness of the joint to be examined, when using a single exposure   t / t  does

examination methods.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When   t / t  is less than or equal to 10 %, Figures A.1 and A.2 are used. In this case, it is likely that transverse
