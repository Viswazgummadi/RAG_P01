<<HEADING level=2>>Foreword<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies
(ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO
technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been
established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and
non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards
adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an
International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent
rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>1
Scope<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 10893 specifies requirements for the automated ultrasonic shear wave (generated by
conventional or phased array technique) testing of the weld seam of submerged arc-welded (SAW) or electric
resistance and induction-welded (EW) steel tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For SAW tubes, the test covers the detection of imperfections oriented predominantly parallel to or, by
agreement, perpendicular to the weld seam or both.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For EW tubes, the test covers the detection of imperfections oriented predominantly parallel to the weld seam.
In the case of testing on longitudinal imperfections, Lamb wave testing can be applied at the discretion of the
manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the detection of imperfections at the weld seam of EW tubes, full peripheral ultrasonic testing is possible.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This part of ISO 10893 can also be applicable to the testing of circular hollow sections.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>4.3
This test shall be carried out by suitably trained operators, qualified in accordance with ISO 9712,
ISO 11484 or equivalent and supervised by competent personnel nominated by the manufacturer. In the case
of third-party inspection, this shall be agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The operating authorization issued by the employer shall be according to a written procedure. Non-destructive
testing (NDT) operations shall be authorized by a level 3 NDT individual approved by the employer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>NOTE
The definition of levels 1, 2 and 3 can be found in appropriate International Standards, e.g. ISO 9712 and
ISO 11484.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5
Test method<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.1
The weld seam of the tube shall be tested using an ultrasonic shear wave technique for the detection of
longitudinal and/or transverse imperfections. Lamb wave technique may be applied for the detection of
longitudinal imperfections of EW tubes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Unless otherwise agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer, testing shall be carried out in two opposite

<<PARAGRAPH>>5.2
During testing, the tubes and the probe assembly shall be moved relative to each other such that the
whole area under inspection is scanned with coverage calculated on the dimension of the transducer(s).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The relative speed of movement during testing shall not vary by more than 10 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.3
There can be a short length at both tube ends which cannot be tested. Any untested ends shall be dealt
with in accordance with the requirements of the appropriate product standard.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of SAW tubes, the untested ends may, at the manufacturer's discretion, be checked either by a
manual ultrasonic test in accordance with this part of ISO 10893 or by a radiographic test in accordance with
ISO 10893-6 or ISO 10893-7.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In the case of EW tube, the untested ends may be tested in accordance with Annex A.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.4
For the detection of longitudinal imperfections, the maximum width of each individual transducer,
measured parallel to the major axis of the tube, shall be 25 mm. For the detection of transverse imperfections,
the maximum width of each individual transducer, measured perpendicular to the major axis of the tube, shall
be 25 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In case of the use of Lamb wave technique or phased array technique, the maximum length of transducer or
active aperture shall be limited to 35 mm.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>5.5
The ultrasonic test frequency of transducers shall be in the range 1 MHz to 15 MHz for shear wave
technique and in the range of 0,3 MHz to 1 MHz for Lamb wave technique, depending on the product
condition and properties, the thickness and surface finishing of tubes under examination.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>5.6
The equipment shall be capable of classifying tubes as either   acceptable or suspect, by means of an
automated trigger/alarm level, combined with a marking or sorting system (or both).<<HEADING_END>>

Reference tube<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.1
The reference standards defined in this part of ISO 10893 are convenient standards for establishing
the sensitivity of non-destructive testing equipment. The dimensions of these standards should not be
construed as the minimum size of imperfection detectable by such equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.2
For SAW tubes, for the detection of longitudinal imperfections, the equipment shall be calibrated using
four longitudinal reference notches, two on the outside surface and two on the inside surface, in the parent
material close to the weld seam of a reference tube, and/or a reference hole located in the centre of the weld
(see Figure 1).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, by agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer, the equipment may be calibrated using
internal and external notches located on the centre of the weld seam. In this case, the depth of the notches
shall be agreed on by the purchaser and manufacturer, and the manufacturer shall demonstrate that the
sensitivity is equivalent to that obtained from the edge notches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>For the detection of transverse imperfections, if requested, the equipment shall be calibrated using two
transverse notches in the weld seam, one on the external and one on the internal surface of reference tube,
and/or a reference hole located in the centre of the weld.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The selection of the notches or the hole is left to the discretion of the manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>--`,,```,,,,````-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>6.1.3
For EW tubes, the ultrasonic equipment shall be calibrated using a longitudinal reference notch on the
outside and inside surfaces of a reference tube.<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>When the tube internal diameter is less than 15 mm, the manufacturer and purchaser may agree to waive the
internal notch.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Alternatively, a reference hole drilled through the wall of the reference tube may be used for equipment
calibration, by agreement between the purchaser and manufacturer. In this case, the diameter of the drill
required to produce the reference hole for a specific acceptance level shall also be agreed on and the
manufacturer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the purchaser that the test sensitivity achieved using the
reference hole is essentially equivalent to that obtained when using the specified reference notch(es).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Such notches and drill holes shall be located in the centre of the weld line, unless otherwise agreed on by the
purchaser and manufacturer.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.4
The reference tubes shall have the same nominal diameter and thickness, same surface finish and
same heat treatment delivery condition (e.g. as-rolled, normalized, quenched and tempered) as the tubes
under test, and shall have similar acoustic properties (e.g. sound velocity and attenuation coefficient). The
manufacturer shall have the option of removing the weld bead of SAW tubes inside and outside such that it is
in alignment with the curvature of the tube body.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>6.1.5
In order to obtain clearly distinguishable signals, the external and internal notches and the hole shall
be sufficiently separated from the ends of the reference tube/sample and from each other.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Equipment calibration and checking<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.1 General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>At the start of each test cycle, the equipment, independently of the applied type of waves, shall be calibrated
to produce consistently clearly identifiable signals from the used reference notches. These signals shall be
used to activate the respective trigger/alarm level(s) of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.2 Adjustment of the trigger/alarm level<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.1
Where a single trigger/alarm level is used, the probe(s) shall be adjusted such that the signals from
the internal and external reference notches are as equal as possible, and the full signal amplitude of the lesser
of the two signals shall be used to activate the trigger/alarm level of the equipment.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.2
Where separate trigger/alarm levels are used for internal and external reference notches, the full
signal amplitude from each notch shall be used to set the relevant trigger/alarm level of the equipment. The
positions and widths of the gates shall be adjusted in such a way that the entire wall thickness of the tube is
tested.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.2.3
When using the reference hole, the manufacturer shall demonstrate that the sensitivity achieved at
the inner and outer surfaces is essentially equivalent to that achieved when using the specified reference
notches.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>7.3 Calibration check and recalibration<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.1
The calibration of the equipment shall be checked at regular intervals during the production testing of
tubes of the same diameter, thickness and grade, by passing the tube through the inspection installation. The
frequency of checking the calibration shall be at least every 4 h, but also whenever there is an equipment
operator changeover and at the start and end of the production run.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>7.3.2
During a dynamic check of the calibration, the relative speed of movement between the reference
tube and the transducer assembly shall be the same as that used during the production test. Other calibration
conditions are allowed, provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that the same results as the dynamic
check of the calibration are obtained.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(normative)
Manual/semi-automated testing of untested ends and suspect areas<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 Untested tube ends<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If specified by the relevant product standard, the weld seam at the tube end zone which cannot be tested by
the automated ultrasonic equipment shall be subjected to a manual/semi-automated test, from the ultimate
tube ends and over the length of the original untested zone plus 10 %.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manual/semi-automated ultrasonic test shall be carried out such that the whole length of the untested end
is scanned with a 10 % overlap, with reference to the ultrasonic transducer width used, measured in the
direction parallel to the major axis of the tube.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The manual/semi-automated ultrasonic test shall be carried out using the ultrasonic shear wave technique or
Lamb wave technique, test sensitivity (reference notch depth) and general test parameters, as used during the
original automated test on the main tube length, with the restrictions given in A.3.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.2 Local suspect areas<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>If appropriate, local areas on the tube deemed suspect by the automated ultrasonic equipment shall be
subjected to a test by manual ultrasonic shear wave technique or Lamb wave technique, test sensitivity
(reference notch depth) and general test parameters, as used during the original automated test, with the
restrictions given in A.3, so that the whole of the local suspect area is scanned.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3 Manual/semi-automated ultrasonic test restrictions<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The following restrictions apply to the application of a manual/semi-automated ultrasonic test to untested end
zones and/or local suspect areas:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a)
the beam angle in steel used for manual ultrasonic testing with shear waves shall be nominally the same
as that used during the original automated test;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b)
scanning shall be carried out with ultrasonic beam propagation in circumferential or longitudinal directions
(or both);<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
scanning speed over the tube surface shall not exceed 150 mm/s;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d)
the ultrasonic probe type used during manual ultrasonic testing with shear waves shall be of the contact,
gap-scan or immersion type. Means shall be provided to ensure that the probe is held at the correct
distance in relation to the tube surface, e.g. for contact type probes, the “wear face” at the front face of
the probe shall be fitted to the curvature of the tube under test;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>e)
the width of the transducer, measured parallel to the major axis of the tube, used in the manual ultrasonic
test shall not exceed that used during the original automated test;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>f)
the nominal frequency of the transducer used in manual testing shall not vary from that used during the
original automated test by more than  ± 1 MHz. Where Lamb waves have been used in the original
automated test, the frequency of shear wave transducers, if used for manual testing, shall be in the range
of 4 MHz to 5 MHz.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
