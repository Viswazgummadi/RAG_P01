<<PARAGRAPH>>ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards
bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out
through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical
committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work.
ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of
electrotechnical standardization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are

<<HEADING level=1>>Introduction<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.1   General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The adoption of a quality management system is a strategic decision for an organization that can help
to improve its overall performance and provide a sound basis for sustainable development initiatives.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The potential benefits to an organization of implementing a quality management system based on this
International Standard are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) the ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable
statutory and regulatory requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) facilitating opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
addressing risks and opportunities associated with its context and objectives;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) the ability to demonstrate conformity to specified quality management system requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard can be used by internal and external parties.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>It is not the intent of this International Standard to imply the need for:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— uniformity in the structure of different quality management systems;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— alignment of documentation to the clause structure of this International Standard;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— the use of the specific terminology of this International Standard within the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality management system requirements specified in this International Standard are
complementary to requirements for products and services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard employs the process approach, which incorporates the Plan-Do-Check-Act
(PDCA) cycle and risk-based thinking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The process approach enables an organization to plan its processes and their interactions.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The PDCA cycle enables an organization to ensure that its processes are adequately resourced and
managed, and that opportunities for improvement are determined and acted on.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk-based thinking enables an organization to determine the factors that could cause its processes and
its quality management system to deviate from the planned results, to put in place preventive controls
to minimize negative effects and to make maximum use of opportunities as they arise (see  Clause A.4 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Consistently meeting requirements and addressing future needs and expectations poses a challenge
for organizations in an increasingly dynamic and complex environment. To achieve this objective, the
organization might find it necessary to adopt various forms of improvement in addition to correction
and continual improvement, such as breakthrough change, innovation and re-organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— “shall” indicates a requirement;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— “should” indicates a recommendation;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— “may” indicates a permission;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— “can” indicates a possibility or a capability.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Information marked as “NOTE” is for guidance in understanding or clarifying the associated requirement.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>0.2   Quality management principles<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard is based on the quality management principles described in ISO 9000. The
descriptions include a statement of each principle, a rationale of why the principle is important for the
organization, some examples of benefits associated with the principle and examples of typical actions
to improve the organization’s performance when applying the principle.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The quality management principles are:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— customer focus;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— leadership;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— engagement of people;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— process approach;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— improvement;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— evidence-based decision making;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— relationship management.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3   Process approach<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3.1   General<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing,
implementing and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system, to enhance customer
satisfaction by meeting customer requirements. Specific requirements considered essential to the
adoption of a process approach are included in  4.4 .<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization’s
effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its intended results. This approach enables the organization
to control the interrelationships and interdependencies among the processes of the system, so that the
overall performance of the organization can be enhanced.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The process approach involves the systematic definition and management of processes, and their
interactions, so as to achieve the intended results in accordance with the quality policy and strategic
direction of the organization. Management of the processes and the system as a whole can be achieved
using the PDCA cycle (see 0.3.2) with an overall focus on risk-based thinking (see 0.3.3) aimed at taking
advantage of opportunities and preventing undesirable results.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The application of the process approach in a quality management system enables:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) understanding and consistency in meeting requirements;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) the consideration of processes in terms of added value;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
the achievement of effective process performance;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>d) improvement of processes based on evaluation of data and information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Figure 1  gives a schematic representation of any process and shows the interaction of its elements. The
monitoring and measuring check points, which are necessary for control, are specific to each process
and will vary depending on the related risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PAGE_9>>
<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 9001:2015(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The PDCA cycle can be briefly described as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>—  Plan : establish the objectives of the system and its processes, and the resources needed to deliver
results in accordance with customers’ requirements and the organization’s policies, and identify
and address risks and opportunities;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>—  Do : implement what was planned;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>—  Check : monitor and (where applicable) measure processes and the resulting products and services
against policies, objectives, requirements and planned activities, and report the results;<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>—  Act : take actions to improve performance, as necessary.<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.3.3   Risk-based thinking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Risk-based thinking (see  Clause A.4 ) is essential for achieving an effective quality management system.
The concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard
including, for example, carrying out preventive action to eliminate potential nonconformities, analysing
any nonconformities that do occur, and taking action to prevent recurrence that is appropriate for the
effects of the nonconformity.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>To conform to the requirements of this International Standard, an organization needs to plan and
implement actions to address risks and opportunities. Addressing both risks and opportunities
establishes a basis for increasing the effectiveness of the quality management system, achieving
improved results and preventing negative effects.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Opportunities can arise as a result of a situation favourable to achieving an intended result, for
example, a set of circumstances that allow the organization to attract customers, develop new products
and services, reduce waste or improve productivity. Actions to address opportunities can also include
consideration of associated risks. Risk is the effect of uncertainty and any such uncertainty can have
positive or negative effects. A positive deviation arising from a risk can provide an opportunity, but not
all positive effects of risk result in opportunities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>0.4   Relationship with other management system standards<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard applies the framework developed by ISO to improve alignment among its
International Standards for management systems (see  Clause A.1 ).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard enables an organization to use the process approach, coupled with the
PDCA cycle and risk-based thinking, to align or integrate its quality management system with the
requirements of other management system standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard relates to ISO 9000 and ISO 9004 as follows:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 9000  Quality management systems — Fundamentals and vocabulary  provides essential
background for the proper understanding and implementation of this International Standard;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 9004  Managing for the sustained success of an organization — A quality management approach
provides guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond the requirements of this
International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Annex B  provides details of other International Standards on quality management and quality
management systems that have been developed by ISO/TC 176.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems,
such as those for environmental management, occupational health and safety management, or
financial management.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Sector-specific quality management system standards based on the requirements of this International
Standard have been developed for a number of sectors. Some of these standards specify additional
quality management system requirements, while others are limited to providing guidance to the
application of this International Standard within the particular sector.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=1>>Annex A
(informative)
Clarification of new structure, terminology and concepts<<HEADING_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.1 Structure and terminology<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The clause structure (i.e. clause sequence) and some of the terminology of this edition of this
International Standard, in comparison with the previous edition (ISO 9001:2008), have been changed
to improve alignment with other management systems standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no requirement in this International Standard for its structure and terminology to be applied
to the documented information of an organization’s quality management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The structure of clauses is intended to provide a coherent presentation of requirements, rather than a
model for documenting an organization’s policies, objectives and processes. The structure and content
of documented information related to a quality management system can often be more relevant to its
users if it relates to both the processes operated by the organization and information maintained for
other purposes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no requirement for the terms used by an organization to be replaced by the terms used in this
International Standard to specify quality management system requirements. Organizations can choose
to use terms which suit their operations (e.g. using “records”, “documentation” or “protocols” rather
than “documented information”; or “supplier”, “partner” or “vendor” rather than “external provider”).
Table A.1  shows the major differences in terminology between this edition of this International
Standard and the previous edition.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

Standard uses “products and services”. “Products and services” include all output categories (hardware,
services, software and processed materials).<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>ISO 9001:2015(E)<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The specific inclusion of “services” is intended to highlight the differences between products and
services in the application of some requirements. The characteristic of services is that at least part of
the output is realized at the interface with the customer. This means, for example, that conformity to
requirements cannot necessarily be confirmed before service delivery.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In most cases, products and services are used together. Most outputs that organizations provide to
customers, or are supplied to them by external providers, include both products and services. For
example, a tangible or intangible product can have some associated service or a service can have some
associated tangible or intangible product.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.3 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Subclause 4.2  specifies requirements for the organization to determine the interested parties that
are relevant to the quality management system and the requirements of those interested parties.
However,  4.2  does not imply extension of quality management system requirements beyond the scope
of this International Standard. As stated in the scope, this International Standard is applicable where
an organization needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that
meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and aims to enhance customer
satisfaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>There is no requirement in this International Standard for the organization to consider interested
parties where it has decided that those parties are not relevant to its quality management system. It is
for the organization to decide if a particular requirement of a relevant interested party is relevant to its
quality management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.4 Risk-based thinking<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard,
e.g. through requirements for planning, review and improvement. This International Standard
specifies requirements for the organization to understand its context (see  4.1 ) and determine risks as
a basis for planning (see  6.1 ). This represents the application of risk-based thinking to planning and
implementing quality management system processes (see  4.4 ) and will assist in determining the extent
of documented information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>One of the key purposes of a quality management system is to act as a preventive tool. Consequently,
this International Standard does not have a separate clause or subclause on preventive action. The
concept of preventive action is expressed through the use of risk-based thinking in formulating quality
management system requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The risk-based thinking applied in this International Standard has enabled some reduction in
prescriptive requirements and their replacement by performance-based requirements. There is greater
flexibility than in ISO 9001:2008 in the requirements for processes, documented information and
organizational responsibilities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Although  6.1  specifies that the organization shall plan actions to address risks, there is no requirement
for formal methods for risk management or a documented risk management process. Organizations can
decide whether or not to develop a more extensive risk management methodology than is required by
this International Standard, e.g. through the application of other guidance or standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Not all the processes of a quality management system represent the same level of risk in terms of the
organization’s ability to meet its objectives, and the effects of uncertainty are not the same for all
organizations. Under the requirements of  6.1 , the organization is responsible for its application of risk-
based thinking and the actions it takes to address risk, including whether or not to retain documented
information as evidence of its determination of risks.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.5 Applicability<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard does not refer to “exclusions” in relation to the applicability of its
requirements to the organization’s quality management system. However, an organization can review
the applicability of requirements due to the size or complexity of the organization, the management
model it adopts, the range of the organization’s activities and the nature of the risks and opportunities
it encounters.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The requirements for applicability are addressed in  4.3 , which defines conditions under which an
organization can decide that a requirement cannot be applied to any of the processes within the scope
of its quality management system. The organization can only decide that a requirement is not applicable
if its decision will not result in failure to achieve conformity of products and services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.6 Documented information<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>As part of the alignment with other management system standards, a common clause on “documented
information” has been adopted without significant change or addition (see  7.5 ). Where appropriate,
text elsewhere in this International Standard has been aligned with its requirements. Consequently,
“documented information” is used for all document requirements.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where ISO 9001:2008 used specific terminology such as “document” or “documented procedures”,
“quality manual” or “quality plan”, this edition of this International Standard defines requirements to
“maintain documented information”.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where ISO 9001:2008 used the term “records” to denote documents needed to provide evidence
of conformity with requirements, this is now expressed as a requirement to “retain documented
information”. The organization is responsible for determining what documented information needs to
be retained, the period of time for which it is to be retained and the media to be used for its retention.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>A requirement to “maintain” documented information does not exclude the possibility that the
organization might also need to “retain” that same documented information for a particular purpose,
e.g. to retain previous versions of it.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Where this International Standard refers to “information” rather than “documented information” (e.g. in
4.1 : “The organization shall monitor and review the information about these external and internal issues”),
there is no requirement that this information is to be documented. In such situations, the organization
can decide whether or not it is necessary or appropriate to maintain documented information.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<HEADING level=3>>A.7 Organizational knowledge<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>In  7.1.6 , this International Standard addresses the need to determine and manage the knowledge
maintained by the organization, to ensure the operation of its processes and that it can achieve
conformity of products and services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Requirements regarding organizational knowledge were introduced for the purpose of:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) safeguarding the organization from loss of knowledge, e.g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— through staff turnover;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— failure to capture and share information;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) encouraging the organization to acquire knowledge, e.g.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— learning from experience;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— mentoring;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— benchmarking.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<HEADING level=3>>A.8 Control of externally provided processes, products and services<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>All forms of externally provided processes, products and services are addressed in  8.4 , e.g. whether
through:<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>a) purchasing from a supplier;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>b) an arrangement with an associate company;<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>c)
outsourcing processes to an external provider.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Outsourcing always has the essential characteristic of a service, since it will have at least one activity
necessarily performed at the interface between the provider and the organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The controls required for external provision can vary widely depending on the nature of the processes,
products and services. The organization can apply risk-based thinking to determine the type and extent
of controls appropriate to particular external providers and externally provided processes, products
and services.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

(informative)
Other International Standards on quality management and quality
management systems developed by ISO/TC 176<<HEADING_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The International Standards described in this annex have been developed by ISO/TC 176 to provide
supporting information for organizations that apply this International Standard, and to provide
guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond its requirements. Guidance or requirements
contained in the documents listed in this annex do not add to, or modify, the requirements of this
International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>Table B.1  shows the relationship between these standards and the relevant clauses of this
International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This annex does not include reference to the sector-specific quality management system standards
developed by ISO/TC 176.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>This International Standard is one of the three core standards developed by ISO/TC 176.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 9000  Quality management systems — Fundamentals and vocabulary  provides an essential
background for the proper understanding and implementation of this International Standard.
The quality management principles are described in detail in ISO 9000 and have been taken into
consideration during the development of this International Standard. These principles are not
requirements in themselves, but they form the foundation of the requirements specified by this
International Standard. ISO 9000 also defines the terms, definitions and concepts used in this
International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 9001 (this International Standard) specifies requirements aimed primarily at giving confidence in
the products and services provided by an organization and thereby enhancing customer satisfaction.
Its proper implementation can also be expected to bring other organizational benefits, such as
improved internal communication, better understanding and control of the organization’s processes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 9004  Managing for the sustained success of an organization — A quality management approach
provides guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond the requirements of this
International Standard, to address a broader range of topics that can lead to improvement of the
organization’s overall performance. ISO 9004 includes guidance on a self-assessment methodology
for an organization to be able to evaluate the level of maturity of its quality management system.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>The International Standards outlined below can provide assistance to organizations when they are
establishing or seeking to improve their quality management systems, their processes or their activities.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10001  Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for codes of conduct for
organizations  provides guidance to an organization in determining that its customer satisfaction
provisions meet customer needs and expectations. Its use can enhance customer confidence in an
organization and improve customer understanding of what to expect from an organization, thereby
reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings and complaints.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10002  Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for complaints handling
in organizations  provides guidance on the process of handling complaints by recognizing and
addressing the needs and expectations of complainants and resolving any complaints received.
ISO 10002 provides an open, effective and easy-to-use complaints process, including training of
people. It also provides guidance for small businesses.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10003  Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for dispute resolution external
to organizations  provides guidance for effective and efficient external dispute resolution for<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>product-related complaints. Dispute resolution gives an avenue of redress when organizations
do not remedy a complaint internally. Most complaints can be resolved successfully within the
organization, without adversarial procedures.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10004  Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for monitoring and measuring
provides guidelines for actions to enhance customer satisfaction and to determine opportunities for
improvement of products, processes and attributes that are valued by customers. Such actions can
strengthen customer loyalty and help retain customers.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10005  Quality management systems — Guidelines for quality plans  provides guidance on
establishing and using quality plans as a means of relating requirements of the process, product,
project or contract, to work methods and practices that support product realization. Benefits of
establishing a quality plan are increased confidence that requirements will be met, that processes
are in control and the motivation that this can give to those involved.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10006  Quality management systems — Guidelines for quality management in projects  is applicable
to projects from the small to large, from simple to complex, from an individual project to being part
of a portfolio of projects. ISO 10006 is to be used by personnel managing projects and who need to
ensure that their organization is applying the practices contained in the ISO quality management
system standards.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10007  Quality management systems — Guidelines for configuration management  is to assist
organizations applying configuration management for the technical and administrative direction
over the life cycle of a product. Configuration management can be used to meet the product
identification and traceability requirements specified in this International Standard.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10008  Quality management — Customer satisfaction — Guidelines for business-to-consumer
electronic commerce transactions  gives guidance on how organizations can implement an effective
and efficient business-to-consumer electronic commerce transaction (B2C ECT) system, and
thereby provide a basis for consumers to have increased confidence in B2C ECTs, enhance the ability
of organizations to satisfy consumers and help reduce complaints and disputes.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10012  Measurement management systems — Requirements for measurement processes and
measuring equipment  provides guidance for the management of measurement processes and
metrological confirmation of measuring equipment used to support and demonstrate compliance
with metrological requirements. ISO 10012 provides quality management criteria for a measurement
management system to ensure metrological requirements are met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO/TR 10013  Guidelines for quality management system documentation  provides guidelines for
the development and maintenance of the documentation necessary for a quality management
system. ISO/TR 10013 can be used to document management systems other than those of the
ISO quality management system standards, e.g. environmental management systems and safety
management systems.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10014  Quality management — Guidelines for realizing financial and economic benefits  is addressed
to top management. It provides guidelines for realizing financial and economic benefits through the
application of quality management principles. It facilitates application of management principles
and selection of methods and tools that enable the sustainable success of an organization.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10015  Quality management — Guidelines for training  provides guidelines to assist organizations
in addressing issues related to training. ISO 10015 can be applied whenever guidance is required
to interpret references to “education” and “training” within the ISO quality management system
standards. Any reference to “training” includes all types of education and training.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO/TR 10017  Guidance on statistical techniques for ISO 9001:2000  explains statistical techniques
which follow from the variability that can be observed in the behaviour and results of processes,
even under conditions of apparent stability. Statistical techniques allow better use of available data
to assist in decision making, and thereby help to continually improve the quality of products and
processes to achieve customer satisfaction.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>

<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10018  Quality management — Guidelines on people involvement and competence  provides
guidelines which influence people involvement and competence. A quality management system
depends on the involvement of competent people and the way that they are introduced and
integrated into the organization. It is critical to determine, develop and evaluate the knowledge,
skills, behaviour and work environment required.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
<<PARAGRAPH>>— ISO 10019  Guidelines for the selection of quality management system consultants and use of their services
provides guidance for the selection of quality management system consultants and the use of their
services. It gives guidance on the process for evaluating the competence of a quality management
system consultant and provides confidence that the organization’s needs and expectations for the
consultant’s services will be met.<<PARAGRAPH_END>>
