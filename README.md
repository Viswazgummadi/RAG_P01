Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for technical document analysis. The system integrates advanced natural language processing techniques, including document preprocessing, vector database creation, and fine-tuned language model inference. The implementation focuses on handling complex technical documents, particularly standards and specifications, with the ability to process both PDF and pre-formatted text inputs.

I. Introduction
Technical document analysis presents unique challenges due to the specialized nature of content and the need for precise information retrieval. This implementation addresses these challenges by combining state-of-the-art language models with efficient retrieval mechanisms, enabling accurate and context-aware responses to user queries.

II. System Architecture
The RAG system comprises several key components:

A. Document Preprocessing
B. Vector Database Creation
C. Language Model Fine-tuning
D. Query Processing and Retrieval
E. Response Generation

III. Implementation Details
A. Document Preprocessing
PDF Processing:

Utilizes PyMuPDF and pdf2image for text and image extraction

Implements OCR using Tesseract for scanned documents

Extracts metadata, text content, and structural information

Text Formatting:

Converts extracted content to a standardized format with special tags

Preserves document structure (headings, paragraphs, tables)

Metadata Extraction:

Captures document properties (title, author, date)

Identifies sections and their hierarchies

B. Vector Database Creation
Text Chunking:

Implements RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for content segmentation

Optimizes chunk size and overlap for retrieval efficiency

Embedding Generation:

Utilizes HuggingFaceEmbeddings with the "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model

Generates vector representations for each text chunk

FAISS Integration:

Implements FAISS for efficient similarity search

Stores vectors and associated metadata for quick retrieval

C. Language Model Fine-tuning
Model Selection:

Uses Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 as the base model

Implements LoRA for efficient adaptation to the technical domain

Training Data Preparation:

Generates instruction-response pairs from processed documents

Implements data cleaning and quality filtering

Fine-tuning Process:

Utilizes PyTorch and Transformers libraries for model training

Implements gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training

D. Query Processing and Retrieval
Query Analysis:

Detects file references and section requests in user queries

Implements metadata filtering for targeted retrieval

Context Retrieval:

Performs similarity search using FAISS

Implements a fallback mechanism for direct lookup of standards

Reranking:

Implements a custom reranking algorithm to improve relevance

Considers document structure and query specificity

E. Response Generation
Prompt Engineering:

Designs context-aware prompts for different query types

Incorporates retrieved context and query information

Inference:

Utilizes the fine-tuned model for response generation

Implements temperature and top-p sampling for controlled generation

Post-processing:

Cleans generated responses to remove artifacts

Implements fallback mechanisms for low-quality responses

IV. Evaluation and Results
The system's performance was evaluated using a set of standard metrics:

Retrieval Accuracy: Measured by relevance of retrieved contexts

Response Quality: Assessed through human evaluation and automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE)

Inference Speed: Benchmarked for various query types and document sizes

V. Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of the RAG approach for technical document analysis. The system shows significant improvements in accuracy and context-awareness compared to traditional question-answering systems.

VI. Future Work
Potential areas for future enhancement include:

Multi-modal RAG incorporating image analysis

Improved handling of mathematical and chemical formulas

Integration with domain-specific knowledge bases# RAG_P01
