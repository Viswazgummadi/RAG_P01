      "prediction": "# Cocoa bean storage and processing\n\n## Introduction\n\nCocoa beans are perishable commodities and need to be stored and processed under proper conditions to preserve the quality and nutritive values. The damage to cocoa beans due to fungal, microbial and insect attacks can be minimized to a large extent if cocoa beans are stored in structures which prevent as far as practicable, the entry of insects, rodents, birds and other animals. In addition, the moisture content should be maintained at a level below 9% during storage and processing.\n\n## Storage and handling of cocoa beans\n\n### Storage and handling of cocoa beans\n\nCocoa beans are perishable commodities. They should be stored and handled under proper conditions to preserve the quality and nutritive values.\n\n### Storage of cocoa beans\n\nCocoa beans should be stored in structures which prevent as far as practicable, the entry of insects, rodents, birds and other animals. The moisture content should be maintained at a level below 9% during storage and processing. The storage buildings should be built in such a way as to prevent the entry of rain water and to facilitate the free movement of air.\n\n### Handling of cocoa beans\n\nThe handling of cocoa beans should be done in such a way as to minimize the damage due to insects and rodents. The following are the precautions to be taken during the handling of cocoa beans:\n\n- All the handling equipments should be cleaned before use.\n- The storage facilities should be kept clean and free of insects, rodents and birds.\n- All the handling equipments should be kept clean and free of insects, rodents and birds.\n- The floors of the storage facilities and the equipments should be free from cracks and crevices.\n- The doors of the storage facilities should be fitted with insect screens.\n- The doors should be closed when not in use.\n- The floors of the storage facilities should be raised above the ground level to prevent the entry of rodents.\n- The storage facilities should be kept free from insects, rodents and birds by regular fumigation.\n- The floors should be kept clean.\n- The storage facilities should be kept clean.\n\n## Processing of cocoa beans\n\nThe processing of cocoa beans involves the following steps:\n\n- Sorting\n- Cleaning\n- Winnowing\n- Grading\n- Stacking\n- Drying\n- Storing\n\n### Sorting of cocoa beans\n\nCocoa beans are sorted by removing the damaged, mouldy, insect-infested, light-coloured, under-sized, over-sized, over-ripe and discoloured beans. The sorting is done by hand picking, by using air-sorting machines, by using electronic graders and by using optical graders.\n\n### Cleaning of cocoa beans\n\nThe cleaning is done by removing foreign materials like stones, sand, mud, husks, sticks, leaves, etc. from the beans. The cleaning is done by hand picking, by using air-cleaning machines, by using electronic graders and by using optical graders.\n\n### Winnowing of cocoa beans\n\nThe winnowing is done by removing the germ from the beans. The winnowing is done by hand picking, by using air-winnowing machines, by using electronic graders and by using optical graders.\n\n### Grading of cocoa beans\n\nThe grading is done by separating the beans of different sizes. The grading is done by hand picking, by using air-grading machines, by using electronic graders and by using optical graders.\n\n### Stacking of cocoa beans\n\nThe stacking is done by piling up the beans in the storage facilities.\n\n### Drying of cocoa beans\n\nThe drying is done to reduce the moisture content of the beans to about 8%. The drying is done by natural drying, by artificial drying and by sun drying.\n\n### Storing of cocoa beans\n\nThe storing is done by keeping the beans in the storage facilities. The storing is done by keeping the beans in the storage facilities.",
