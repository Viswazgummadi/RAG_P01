FOREWORD\n0.1  This Indian Standard was adopted by the Indian Standards Institution\non 12 December\n1981, after the draft finalized by the Stimulant\nFoods\nSectional\nCommittee,\nhad been approved by the Agricultural\nand Food\nProducts Division Council.\n\n0.2 The damage to cocoa beans due to fungal, microbial and insect attacks\ncan be minimized to a large extent if cocoa beans are stored in structures\nwhich prevent as far as practicable,\ntheir entry inside and also if suitable\nmeasures are taken during handling, transport and storage.\n\n0.3 The damage and pollution of cocoa beans during storage are due to\ntemperature,\nmoisture and dampness, insects and rodents. It is, therefore,\nobvious that in order to conserve cocoa beans they should be stored in\nsound structures of different types, each type being suitable for a particular\nregion in the country\nand code of practice\nshould be formulated\nand\nadopted for handling,\ntransporting\nand storing;\nwhen such standards\nbecome available and are implemented,\nthey will go a long way in mini-\nmising the loss of cocoa beans.\n\n0.4 This standard has been formulated\nmainly with a view to guiding\nprocessors, dealers and other agencies connected with handling of cocoa\nbeans so that the damage to cocoa beans is, as far as possible, reduced to\nthe minimum.\n\n0.5 This code has been prepared for the construction\nof structures which\nwould permit effective control of insect and other pests of stored cocoa\nbeans and which entirely exclude rain and ground moisture.\n\n### 1. SCOPE\n<<HEADING level=3>>1.1  This standard\ncovers requirements\nand method for construction\nof\ncocoa beans bag storage type structures.<<HEADING_END>>\n### 2.  TERMINOLOGY\n### 2.0  For the purpose of this standard, the following definitions shall apply.\n### 3\n\n### IS : 18817 - 1981\n<<HEADING level=3>>2.1 Bag -\nA container made either of jute,\nfabric or laminates\nhaving\nthe standard dimensions and containing a net content of60 to 65 kg of dry\ncocoa beans.<<HEADING_END>>\n<<HEADING level=3>>2.2  Bag Storage Structure -\nStructure in which bags containing cocoa\nbeans are stored.<<HEADING_END>>\n### 3.  LOCATION\n3.1 The cocoa beans bag storage structure shall be located on a raised\nand well-drained\nsite, or on suitably made-up soils, if necessary.\n\n3.2 The structure shall not be located on lands subjected\nto\u2019 floods or\ninundations and shah be safe from damage by surface or seepage water.\n\n3.3 The structure shall be at least 15 m away from residential buildings,\nfactories ( other than cocoa processing factories ), dairies, poultry farms,\nkilns and other possible sources of fire and 30 m away from garbage, dump-\ning grounds, slaughter\nhouses, hide curing centres, tanneries\nand such\nother places, the close vicinity of which is deleterious to safe storage of\ncocoa beans.\n\n3.4 The structure\nshall be away from large trees.\n\n3.5 The structure shall be generally accessible to lorries and preferably\nsituated near a rail head with goods siding.\n\n3.5.1 Where the structure is near waterways, such as ferry heads and\ndocks sufficient berthing,\nloading and unloading facilities shall be made\navailable.\n\n### 4.  BAG STORAGE STRUCTURES\n4.1  The bag storage structure may be of dimensions most economically\nsuited to the land available.\nThe storage capacity\nshall be calculated\ntaking into account the coefficient factor of 0*8m2 per metric tonne of\ncured cocoa seeds.\n\nNOTE  1 -\nThe coefficient factor is derived from (a) 14 bags stacked one over the\nother; (b) each such bag containing 62.5 kg of cocoa beans; (c) 30 percent floor area\nfor passage, in between the stacks; and (d) stacks of 30 bags.\n\nNOTE 2 -\nThe minimum height of the wall may be 5.5 m for flat roofed structures\nand in the case of other structures the minimum wall height may be 425 m inside\nat the point where the roof crosses the wall.\n\n### 4\n\n### IS : 18817 - 1981\n### 5. FOUNDATION\n5.1  The foundation shall be carried to a depth of not less than one metre\nunless rock, sheet-rock or laterite is met with at a higher level and shall\nhave concrete\nbedding of suitable\nthickness\nunless rock, sheet-rock\nor\nlaterite is met with.\n\n5.2 The foundation masonry shall be of stone burnt bricks, concrete blocks\nor other suitable materials depending upon the availability\nof the same\nat a particular\nregion.

The drain pipe shall be located\nin such a way that it shall not obstruct the ventilators.\n\n13.3 All round the structure, abutting the plinth a pavement 0.5 m wide\nand 150 mm thick of lime concrete or cement concrete 1  :  3  :  6 or rubble\nstone pitching set in cement mortar 1  :  4 shall be constructed with suitable\ndrainage arrangement.\nThe pavement shall slope outside at 1 in 10.\n\n<<HEADING level=3>>14. UNDERGROUND\nDRAINAGE\n- BY RUBBLE DRAIN<<HEADING_END>>\n<<HEADING level=3>>14.1  Where ground water is likely to rise during the rainy season above\nthe lowest level of the foundation, a trench 0.7 m wide shall be constructed\nall round the structure.<<HEADING_END>>\n7\n\n### IS : 10017 - 1981\n14.2 The trench shall be one metre away from the outer periphery of the\nstructure, and shall be at the lowest level of the foundation with a longi-\ntudinal bed slope towards the natural fall of the ground. It shall be con-\nnected to an outfall drain for ultimate disposal of the water. It shall be\nfilled with rubble or brick bats or graded jelly to a depth of O-7 m and the\nrest with earth, and then levelled.\n\n14.3 The rubble filling of drain should be so arranged as to have the effect\nof an inverted filter, that is, bigger rubble should be put at the bottom and\nthe size of rubble, brick bat or jelly to be reduced gradually.\n\nNOTE-The\nrequirements given under 14 above depend upon locality and site\nconditions may and not be insisted upon in the case of inland region with rainfall\nof less than 750 mm. In coastal and heavy rainfall regions these are necessary, where\nthe soil conditions require.\n\nDocument Type: Digital\nTotal Pages: 9", "metadata": {"filename": "1.txt", "source_path": "data/API/1/1.txt", "Document Type": "Digital", "Total Pages": "9", "title": "Untitled Document"}}
