low-alloy steel piping used\nin the compression, pumping, and transmission of crude petroleum, petroleum products, fuel gases, carbon dioxide,\nnitrogen, and where applicable, covers welding on distribution systems. It applies to both new construction and in-\nservice welding. The welding may be done by a shielded metal arc welding, submerged arc welding, gas tungsten arc\nwelding, gas metal arc welding, flux-cored arc welding, plasma arc welding, oxyacetylene welding, or flash butt-\nwelding process or by a combination of these processes using a manual, semiautomatic, mechanized, or automatic\nwelding technique or a combination of these techniques. The welds may be produced by position or roll welding or by\na combination of position and roll welding.\n\n\n\n\nThis standard also covers the procedures for radiographic, magnetic particle, liquid penetrant, and ultrasonic testing,\nas well as the acceptance standards to be applied to production welds tested to destruction or inspected by\nradiographic, magnetic particle, liquid penetrant, ultrasonic, and visual testing methods.\n\n\n\n\nThe values stated in either U.S. customary units (USC) units or metric units (SI) are to be regarded separately as\nstandard. Each system is to be used independently of the other, without combining values in any way.\n\n\n\n\nThe figures depicted in this standard are not drawn to scale.\n\n\n\n\nIt is intended that all work performed in accordance with this standard meets or exceeds the requirements of this\nstandard.\n\n\n\n\nWhile this standard is comprehensive, it may not address all issues that may arise. The absence of guidance or\nrequirements  is not to be considered prohibitive to  a particular activity or approach that is based upon sound\nengineering judgment. For example, other industry standards, reliable engineering tests and analyses, or established\nindustry practices may provide useful reference to establish sound engineering judgment.\n\n\n### 2 Normative References\n\n\nThe following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.

(230 mm) long and approximately 1 in.\n(25 mm) wide and may be machine cut or oxygen cut. They shall be notched with a hacksaw on each side at the\ncenter of the weld, and each notch shall be approximately  1 / 8  in. (3 mm) deep and the edges shall be smooth and\nparallel.\n\n\n\n\nNick break specimens prepared in this manner from welds made with certain mechanized and semiautomatic\nprocesses may fail through the pipe instead of the weld. When previous testing experience indicates that failures\nthrough the pipe can be expected, the external reinforcement may be notched to a depth of not more than  1 / 16  in.\n(1.6 mm), measured from the original weld surface (see Figure 5, bottom).\n\n\n\n\nAt the company\u2019s option, nick break specimens for qualification of a procedure using a semiautomatic or mechanized\nwelding process may be macroetched prior to being nicked.\n\n\n### 5.6.3.2 Method\n\n\nThe nick break specimens shall be broken through the weld by any convenient method (i.e. pulling, bending, or\nstriking). This does not exclude other testing methods. The exposed area of the fracture shall be at least  3 / 4  in.\n(19 mm) wide.\n\n\n### 5.6.3.3 Requirements\n\n\nThe exposed surfaces of each nick break specimen shall show complete penetration and fusion. The greatest\ndimension of any gas pocket shall not exceed  1 / 16  in. (1.6 mm), and the combined area of all gas pockets shall not\nexceed 2 % of the exposed surface area.

Before any production welding is performed, welders shall be qualified\naccording to the applicable requirements of 6.2 through 6.8. It is the intent of this standard that a welder who\nsatisfactorily completes the procedure qualification test is a qualified welder, provided the number of test specimens\nrequired by 6.5 has been removed, tested, and meet the acceptance criteria of 5.6, for each welder.\n\n\n\n\nPrior to starting the qualification tests, the welder shall be allowed reasonable time to adjust the welding equipment to\nbe used. The welder shall follow the requirements of the applicable qualified welding procedure specification. The\nqualification of welders shall be conducted in the presence of a representative acceptable to the company.\n\n\n\n\nA welder shall qualify for welding by performing a test on segments of pipe nipples or on full-size pipe nipples, as\nspecified in 6.2.1. When segments of pipe nipples are used, they shall be supported so that typical flat, vertical, and\noverhead welds are produced.\n\n\n\n\nThe essential variables associated with procedure and welder qualifications are not identical. The essential variables\nfor welder qualification are specified in 6.2.2 and 6.3.2.\n\n\n### 6.2 Single Qualification\n### 6.2.1 General\n\n\nFor qualification to a single weld procedure specification, a welder shall make a test weld using a qualified procedure\nto join pipe nipples or segments of pipe nipples. The welder shall make a butt weld in either the rolled or the fixed\nposition. When the welder is qualifying in the fixed position, the axis of the pipe shall be horizontal, vertical, or inclined\nfrom horizontal at an angle of not more than 45\u00b0.\n\n\n\n\nA welder making a single-qualification test for branch connections, fillet welds, or other similar configurations shall\nfollow the specific welding procedure specification.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in the essential variables described in 6.2.2 require requalification of the welder.\n\n\n\n\nThe weld shall be acceptable if it meets the requirements of 6.4 and either 6.5 or 6.6.\n\n\n### 6.2.2 Scope\n\n\nA welder who has successfully completed the qualification test described in 6.2.1 shall be qualified within the limits of\nthe essential variables described below. If any of the following essential variables are changed, the welder shall be\nrequalified using an applicable qualified procedure.\n\n\n\n\na) A change from one welding process to another welding process or combination of processes, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n1) a change from one welding process to a different welding process; or\n\n\n\n\n2) a change in the combination of welding processes, unless the welder has qualified on separate qualification\ntests, using each of the welding processes that are to be used for the combination of welding processes.\n\n\n\n\nb) A change in the direction of welding from vertical uphill to vertical downhill or vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n27\n\n\n\n\nc) A change of filler metal classification from Group 1 or 2 to any other group or from any Group 3 through 9 to\nGroup 1 or 2 (see Table 1). A change of filler metal classification not listed in Table 1 to any other filler metal\nclassification or vice versa.\n\n\n\n\nd) A change from one specified OD group to another. These groups are defined as follows:\n\n\n\n\n1) specified OD less than 2.375 in. (60.3 mm),\n\n\n\n\n2) specified OD from 2.375 in. (60.3 mm) through 12.750 in. (323.9 mm),\n\n\n\n\n3) specified OD greater than 12.750 in. (323.9 mm).\n\n\n\n\ne) A change from one specified wall thickness group to another.

(19.1 mm).\n\n\n\n\nf)\nA change in position from that for which the welder has already qualified (e.g. a change from rolled to fixed or a\nchange from vertical to horizontal or vice versa). A welder who qualifies in the fixed position shall also be qualified\nto perform rolled welds within the essential variables qualified. A welder who qualifies on a butt weld shall also be\nqualified to make lap fillet welds within the essential variables qualified. A welder who successfully passes a butt\nweld qualification test in the fixed position with the axis inclined 45\u00b0 from horizontal shall be qualified to do butt\nwelds and lap fillet welds in all positions.\n\n\n\n\ng) A change in the joint design (e.g. the elimination of a backing strip or a change from V bevel to U bevel).\n\n\n### 6.3 Multiple Qualification\n### 6.3.1 General\n\n\nFor multiple qualification, a welder shall successfully complete the two tests described below, using qualified\nprocedures.\n\n\n\n\nFor the first test, the welder shall make a butt weld in the fixed position with the axis of the pipe either horizontal or\ninclined from horizontal at an angle of not more than 45\u00b0. This butt weld shall be made on pipe with an OD of at least\n6.625 in. (168.3 mm) and with a wall thickness of at least 0.250 in. (6.4 mm) without a backing strip. The weld shall be\nacceptable if it meets the requirements of 6.4 and either 6.5 or 6.6. Specimens may be removed from the test weld at\nthe locations shown in Figure 12, or they may be selected at the relative locations shown in Figure 12 but without\nreference to the top of the pipe, or they may be selected from locations that are spaced equidistantly around the entire\npipe circumference. The sequence of adjacent specimen types shall be identical to that shown in Figure 12 for the\nvarious pipe diameters. Specimens shall not include the longitudinal weld.\n\n\n\n\nFor the second test, the welder shall lay out, cut, fit, and weld a branch-on-pipe connection in which the specified\ndiameters of the run and the branch pipes are equal. This test shall be performed with a pipe diameter of at least\n6.625 in. (168.3 mm) and with a specified wall thickness of at least 0.250 in. (6.4 mm). A hole with specified diameter\napproximately equal to the inside diameter (ID) of the branch pipe shall be cut in the run. The weld shall be made with\nthe run pipe axis horizontal and the branch pipe axis extending vertically downward from the run pipe.\n\n\n\n\nThe completed weld shall exhibit complete penetration around the entire circumference. Completed root beads shall\nnot contain any burn-through (BT) of more than  1 / 4  in. (6 mm). The sum of the maximum dimensions of separate\nunrepaired BTs in any continuous 12 in. (300 mm) length of weld shall not exceed  1 / 2  in.

They shall be\nprepared and tested in accordance with 5.8.1 and 5.8.2. The exposed surfaces shall meet the requirements of 5.8.3.\n\n\n### 6.3.2 Scope\n\n\nA welder who has successfully completed the butt weld qualification test described in 6.3.1 on pipe with an OD\ngreater than or equal to 12.750 in. (323.9 mm) and a branch weld with pipe and branch having specified ODs greater\nthan or equal to 12.750 in. (323.9 mm) in which the specified diameters of the run and branch pipes are equal shall be\nqualified to weld in all positions; on all wall thicknesses, joint designs, and fittings; and on all pipe diameters. A welder\nwho has successfully completed the butt weld and branch weld requirements of 6.3.1 on pipe with an OD less than\n12.750 in. (323.9 mm) shall be qualified to weld in all positions; on all wall thicknesses, joint designs, and fittings; and\non all pipe ODs less than or equal to the OD used by the welder in the qualification tests.\n\n\n\n\nIf any of the following essential variables are changed in a welding procedure specification, the welder using the new\nprocedure shall be requalified.\n\n\n\n\na) A change from one welding process to another welding process or combination of processes, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n1) a change from one welding process to a different welding process; or\n\n\n\n\n2) a change in the combination of welding processes, unless the welder has qualified on separate qualification\ntests, each using the same welding process that is used for the combination of welding processes.\n\n\n\n\nb) A change in the direction of welding from vertical uphill to vertical downhill or vice versa.\n\n\n\n\nc) A change of filler metal classification from Group 1 or 2 to any other group or from any Group 3 through 9 to\nGroup 1 or 2 (see Table 1). A change of filler metal classification not listed in Table 1 to any other filler metal\nclassification or vice versa.\n\n\n### 6.4 Visual Examination\n\n\nFor a qualification test weld to meet the requirements for visual examination, the weld shall be free from cracks,\ninadequate penetration, and BT, and must present a neat workman-like appearance. The depth of undercutting\nadjacent to the final bead on the outside of the pipe shall not be more than  1 / 32  in. (0.8 mm) or 12.5 % of the pipe wall\nthickness, whichever is smaller, and there shall not be more than 2 in. (50 mm) of undercutting in any continuous\n12 in. (300 mm) length of weld.\n\n\n\n\nWhen semiautomatic or mechanized welding is used, filler wire protruding into the inside of the pipe shall be kept to a\nminimum.\n\n\n\n\nFailure to meet the requirements of this section shall be adequate cause to eliminate additional testing.\n\n\n### 6.5 Destructive Testing\n### 6.5.1 Sampling of Test Butt Welds\n\n\nTo test butt welds, samples shall be cut from each test weld. Figure 12 shows the locations from which the specimens\nare to be removed if the test weld is a complete circumferential weld. If the test weld consists of segments of pipe\nnipples, an approximately equal number of specimens shall be removed from each segment. The total number of\nspecimens and the tests to which each shall be submitted are shown in Table 3. The specimens shall not include the\nlongitudinal weld. The specimens shall be air cooled to ambient temperature prior to testing. For pipe with an OD less\nthan or equal to 1.315 in. (33.4 mm), one full-pipe section specimen may be substituted for the root bend and nick\nbreak specimens. This full-section specimen shall be tested in accordance with 5.6.2.2 and shall meet the\nrequirements of 6.5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n### 6.5.2 Tensile Strength, Nick Break, and Bend Test Procedures for Butt Welds\n\n\nThe specimens shall be prepared for tensile strength, nick break, and bend tests, and the tests shall be performed as\ndescribed in 5.6. However, for the purpose of welder qualification under Section 6, it is not necessary to calculate the\ntensile strength of the coupons. The tensile strength test may even be omitted; in which case the specimens\ndesignated for the tensile test shall be subjected to the nick break test. For qualification of welding equipment and\noperators under Section 12, the tensile strength test shall not be omitted and the tensile strength shall be determined.\n\n\n### 6.5.3 Tensile Strength Test Requirements for Butt Welds\n\n\nFor the tensile strength test, if any of the reduced section specimens or the full section specimen breaks in the weld or\nat the junction of the weld and the parent material and fails to meet the soundness requirements of 5.6.3.3, the welder\nshall be disqualified.\n\n\n### 6.5.4 Nick Break Test Requirements for Butt Welds\n\n\nFor the nick break test, if any specimen shows imperfections that exceed those allowed by 5.6.3.3, the welder shall\nbe disqualified.\n\n\n### 6.5.5 Bend Test Requirements for Butt Welds\n\n\nFor the bend tests, if any specimen shows imperfections that exceed those allowed by 5.6.4.3 or 5.6.5.3, the welder\nshall be disqualified. Welds in high strength pipe may not bend to the full U shape. These welds shall be considered\nacceptable if the specimens that crack are broken apart and their exposed surfaces meet the requirements of 5.6.3.3.\n\n\n\n\nIf one of the bend test specimens fails to meet these requirements and, in the company\u2019s opinion, the imperfection\nobserved is not representative of the weld, the test specimen may be replaced by an additional specimen cut adjacent\nto the one that failed. The welder shall be disqualified if the additional specimen also shows imperfections that exceed\nthe specified limits.\n\n\n<<HEADING level=3>>Table 3\u2014Type and Number of Butt Weld Test Specimens per Welder for Welder Qualification Test and\nDestructive Testing of Production Welds<<HEADING_END>>\n<<HEADING level=3>>Outside Diameter of Pipe\nNumber of Specimens<<HEADING_END>>\n<<HEADING level=3>>in.\nmm\nTensile Strength\nNick Break\nRoot Bend\nFace Bend\nSide Bend\nTotal<<HEADING_END>>\n\n\nWall Thickness  \u2264  0.500 in.

Figure 10 shows the locations from which the\nspecimens are to be removed if the test weld is a complete circumferential weld. If the test weld consists of segments\nof pipe nipples, an approximately equal number of specimens shall be removed from each segment. The specimens\nshall be air cooled to ambient temperature prior to testing.\n\n\n### 6.5.7 Test Method and Requirements for Fillet Welds\n\n\nThe fillet weld specimens shall be prepared and the test shall be performed as described in 5.8.\n\n\n### 6.6 Nondestructive Testing (NDT)\u2014Butt Welds Only\n### 6.6.1 General\n\n\nAt the company\u2019s option, the qualification butt weld may be examined by radiography or automatic ultrasonic testing\nusing a qualified NDT procedure in lieu of the tests specified in 6.5.\n\n\n### 6.6.2 Inspection Requirements\n\n\nWhen radiography is utilized, radiographs shall be made of each of the test welds. The welder shall be disqualified if\nany of the test welds do not meet the requirements of 9.3.\n\n\n\n\nWhen automatic ultrasonic testing is utilized, each test weld shall be fully examined. The welder shall be disqualified if\nany of the test welds do not meet the requirements of 9.6.\n\n\n\n\nRadiographic testing or automatic ultrasonic testing shall not be used for the purpose of locating sound areas or areas\nthat contain imperfections and subsequently making tests of such areas to qualify or disqualify a welder.\n\n\n### 6.7 Retesting\n\n\nIf, in the mutual opinion of the company and the contractor\u2019s representatives, a welder fails to pass the qualification\ntest because of unavoidable conditions or conditions beyond the welder\u2019s control, the welder may be given a second\nopportunity to qualify. No further retests shall be given until the welder has submitted proof of subsequent welder\ntraining that is acceptable to the company.\n\n\n### 6.8 Records\n\n\nA record shall be maintained of the tests given to each welder and of the detailed results of each test. A form similar\nto that shown in Figure 2 should be used. (This form should be developed to suit the needs of the individual company\nbut must be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that the qualification test met the requirements of this standard.) A list\nof qualified welders and the procedures for which they are qualified shall be maintained. A welder may be required to\nrequalify if a question arises about the welder\u2019s competence.\n\n\n### 7 Design and Preparation of a Joint for Production Welding\n### 7.1 General\n\n\nPiping shall be welded by qualified welders using qualified procedures. The surfaces to be welded shall be smooth,\nuniform, and free from laminations, tears, scale, slag, grease, paint, and other deleterious material that might\nadversely affect the welding. The joint design and spacing between abutting ends shall be in accordance with the\nwelding procedure specification used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n### 7.2 Alignment\n\n\nThe alignment of abutting ends shall minimize the offset between surfaces. For pipe ends of the same specified\nthickness, the offset should not exceed  1 / 8  in. (3 mm). Larger variations are permissible provided the variation is\ncaused by variations of the pipe end dimensions within the pipe purchase specification tolerances, and such\nvariations have been distributed essentially uniformly around the circumference of the pipe. Hammering of the pipe to\nobtain proper lineup should be kept to a minimum.\n\n\n### 7.3 Use of Lineup Clamp for Butt Welds\n\n\nLineup clamps shall be used for butt welds in accordance with the welding procedure specification. When it is\npermissible to remove the lineup clamp before the root bead is completed, the completed part of the bead shall be in\napproximately equal segments spaced approximately equally around the circumference of the joint. However, when\nan internal lineup clamp is used and conditions make it difficult to prevent movement of the pipe or if the weld will be\nunduly stressed, the root bead shall be completed before clamp tension is released.

Changes in the weld geometry due to\nalignment offset of abutting pipe ends, changes in weld reinforcement profile of ID root and OD capping passes,\ninternal chamfering, and ultrasonic wave mode conversion due to such conditions may cause geometric indications\nthat are similar to those caused by weld imperfections but that are not relevant to acceptability.\n\n\n### 9.6.1.2 Linear Indications\n\n\nLinear indications are defined as indications with their greatest dimension in the weld length direction. Typical linear\nindications may be caused by, but are not limited to, the following types of imperfections: IP, IPD, ICP, IF, IFD, ESI,\ncracks, EU, IU, and HB.\n\n\n### 9.6.1.3 Transverse Indications\n\n\nTransverse indications are defined as indications with their greatest dimension across the weld. Typical transverse\nindications may be caused by, but are not limited, to the following types of imperfections: cracks, ISIs, and IFD at\nstart/stops in the weld passes.\n\n\n### 9.6.1.4 Volumetric Indications\n\n\nVolumetric indications are defined as three-dimensional indications. Such indications may be caused by single or\nmultiple inclusions, voids, or pores. Partially filled voids, pores, or small inclusions at start/stops in weld passes may\ncause larger indications in the transverse direction than in the weld length direction. Typical volumetric indications\nmay be caused by, but are not limited to, the following types of imperfections: IC, BT, ISIs, porosity, and CP.\n\n\n### 9.6.1.5 Relevant Indications\n\n\nRelevant indications are those caused by imperfections.

For each macrosection test specimen, at least\none face should be ground and polished to at least 600 grit finish and etched with a suitable etchant, such as Nital,\nammonium persulfate or dilute hydrochloric acid to give a clear definition of the weld structure.\n\n\n### 10.3.7.2.2 Visual Examination\n\n\nThe macrosections shall be visually examined with lighting that will sufficiently reveal the details of the weld\nsoundness. The use of optical devices or dye penetrants is not necessary.\n\n\n\n\nA visual examination of the macrosections shall show that the repair weld portion of the completed weld is completely\nfused to the adjacent base metal and/or weld metal at the root and between weld passes and is free of cracks. Any\ndefects shall be within the applicable individual size limits specified in Section 9. If a cross section shows defects that\nare not associated with the repair weld portion of the completed weld, an additional cross section shall be evaluated.\nIf the additional cross section contains other defects, the qualification test is unacceptable.\n\n\n### 10.3.7.3 Hardness Testing\n\n\nMacrosection test specimens shall be prepared for hardness testing in accordance with ASTM E384. The minimum\nrequired number of indentations shall be made using a Vickers indenter and a 10-kg load, or less at locations shown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n51\n\n\n\n\nin Figure 21 through Figure 26, or made at locations otherwise specified at the discretion of the company. HAZ\nhardness impressions shall be entirely within the HAZ and located as close as possible to the fusion boundary\n(between the weld metal and HAZ). If subsequent repairs (e.g. double repair) are qualified, the company shall provide\nhardness test locations.\n\n\n\n\nMaximum hardness values for repair welds shall not exceed those given in Table 6 unless otherwise specified by the\ncompany.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   When hardness testing is required, chemical analysis is performed to determine the carbon equivalent of the base\nmaterials.\n\n\n<<IMAGE_1>>\n[Image 1 contains text: VA\n2mm -0/+0.5mm]\n<<IMAGE_2>>\n[Image 2 contains text: VA\n2mm -0/+0.5mm]\n\n\n5 / 64 \u0003LQ\u0011\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e 1 / 64  in.\n\u0015\u0003PP\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e\u0013\u0011\u0018\u0003PP\n\n\n\n\n3 / 64  in.\n\u0014\u0003PP\n\n\n\n\n5 / 64 \u0003LQ\u0011\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e 1 / 64  in.\n\u0015\u0003PP\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e\u0013\u0011\u0018\u0003PP\n\n\n\n\n127(\u0003\n+HDW\u0010DIIHFWHG\u0003]RQH\u0003\u000b+$=\f\u0003KDUGQHVV\u0003LPSUHVVLRQV\u0003PXVW\u0003EH\u0003HQWLUHO\\\u0003ZLWKLQ\u0003WKH\u0003+$=\u0003DQG\u0003ORFDWHG\nDV\u0003FORVH\u0003DV\u0003SRVVLEOH\u0003WR\u0003WKH\u0003IXVLRQ\u0003ERXQGDU\\\u0003\u000bEHWZHHQ\u0003WKH\u0003ZHOG\u0003PHWDO\u0003DQG\u0003+$=\f\u0011\n\n\n### Figure 21\u2014Hardness Locations for Full Thickness Repair Procedure Qualification\n\n\n5 / 64 \u0003LQ\u0011\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e 1 / 64  in.\n\u0015\u0003PP\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e\u0013\u0011\u0018\u0003PP\n\n\n\n\n3 / 64  in.\n(1 mm)\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\nHeat-affected zone (HAZ) hardness impressions must be entirely within the HAZ and located\nas close as possible to the fusion boundary (between the weld metal and HAZ).\n\n\n### Figure 22\u2014Hardness Locations for Partial Thickness Repair Procedure Qualification at Weld Centerline\n\n\n\n\n52\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n<<IMAGE_3>>\n<<IMAGE_4>>\n\n\n5 / 64 \u0003LQ\u0011\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e 1 / 64  in.\n\u0015\u0003PP\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e\u0013\u0011\u0018\u0003PP\n\n\n\n\n3 / 64  in.\n(1 mm)\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\nHeat-affected zone (HAZ) hardness impressions must be entirely within the HAZ and located\nas close as possible to the fusion boundary (between the weld metal and HAZ).\n\n\n### Figure 23\u2014Hardness Locations for Cover Pass Repair Procedure at Weld Centerline\n\n\n3 / 64  in.\n(1 mm)\n\n\n\n\n5 / 64 \u0003LQ\u0011\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e 1 / 64  in.\n\u0015\u0003PP\u0003\u00ed\u0013\u0012\u000e\u0013\u0011\u0018\u0003PP\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\nHeat-affected zone (HAZ) hardness impressions must be entirely within the HAZ and located\nas close as possible to the fusion boundary (between the weld metal and HAZ).\n\n\n<<HEADING level=3>>Figure 24\u2014Hardness Location for Back Weld Repair or Internal Partial Thickness Repair Procedure at\nWeld Centerline<<HEADING_END>>\n### 10.3.7.4 Impact Tests\n### 10.3.7.4.1 General\n\n\nWhen required by 10.3.3, Charpy impact testing shall be performed at locations in the weld as specified by the company.\n\n\n### 10.3.7.4.2 Preparation\n\n\nFor each repair procedure, both the weld metal and the HAZ shall be tested.

Welding inspection personnel shall meet the\nrequirements of 8.3.\n\n\n\n\nRepairs shall be documented and maintained by the company.\n\n\n### 10.6 Acceptance Criteria\n\n\nRepaired areas shall be inspected and evaluated by the same NDT methods previously used to determine a defect.\nVisual inspection is considered adequate when the defect was rejected by visual means and repaired by grinding\nwithout additional welding. NDT of a repair weld includes as a minimum the total repair area plus 10 % of the total\nrepair weld length, or 2 in. (50 mm); whichever is longer on each side of the repair area. Repairs shall be considered\nacceptable when the repair area meets the standards of acceptability of Section 9 or more stringent acceptance\ncriteria specified by the company.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   A repair weld of a weld originally inspected and rejected using alternative acceptance criteria derived in accordance with\nAnnex A must be reinspected and meet the standards of acceptability of Section 9 or more stringent acceptance criteria as\nspecified by the company. Repair of the total length of defect(s) rejected by Annex A alternative acceptance criteria is required. A\npartial length repair of a defect is prohibited.\n\n\n### 11 Procedures for Nondestructive Testing (NDT)\n### 11.1 Radiographic Test Methods\n### 11.1.1 General\n\n\nSection 11.1 presents the requirements for producing radiographic images on film or other media through the use of X-\nrays or gamma rays. A detailed procedure for the production of images shall be established and recorded. Radiographic\nfilm produced by the use of this procedure shall have the density (see 11.1.10), clarity, and contrast required by this\nstandard. Images produced by other systems shall have the requisite sensitivity to define clearly the essential wire\ndiameter of the proper image quality indicator (IQI). The following criteria shall be used to evaluate images:\n\n\n\n\na) an acceptable image quality that is free from fog and from processing irregularities that could mask the image of\nactual imperfections,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n\n\nb) the prescribed IQI and the essential wire diameter,\n\n\n\n\nc) a satisfactory identification system,\n\n\n\n\nd) an acceptable technique and setup,\n\n\n\n\ne) compatibility with acceptance standards.\n\n\n\n\nAll requirements that refer to the quality of the resulting images shall apply equally to X-rays and gamma rays. The\nuse of radiographic testing and the frequency of its use shall be at the option of the company.\n\n\n\n\nThe company and the radiographic contractor should agree on the radiographic procedure or procedures to be used\nprior to the performance of production radiography. The company shall require the contractor to demonstrate that the\nproposed procedures produce acceptable images and shall require the contractor to use such procedures for\nproduction radiography.\n\n\n### 11.1.2 Details of Procedure\n### 11.1.2.1 General\n\n\nThe details of each radiographic procedure shall be recorded. A copy of the record shall be furnished to the company\nfor its records. The record may be in the form of writing, a sketch, or both. As a minimum, each procedure shall\ninclude the applicable details listed in 11.1.2.2 and 11.1.2.3.\n\n\n### 11.1.2.2 Film Radiography\n\n\nAs a minimum, the procedure for film radiography shall include the following details.\n\n\n\n\na) Radiation source\u2014The type of radiation source, the size of the effective source or focal spot, and the voltage\nrating of the X-ray equipment.\n\n\n\n\nb) Intensifying screens\u2014The type and placement of the screens and, if lead is used, their thickness.\n\n\n\n\nc) Film\u2014The film brand or type or both and the number of film in the holder or cassette.

When the radiographic source is outside but not more than  1 / 2  in.\n(13 mm) from the weld surface, at least three exposures separated by 120\u00b0 shall be made for the radiographic testing of\na complete weld (DWE/SWV). When the radiographic source is outside and more than  1 / 2  in. (13 mm) from the weld\nsurface, at least four exposures separated by 90\u00b0 shall be made for the radiographic testing of a complete weld (DWE/\nSWV). When the OD of the piping containing the weld is 3.500 in. (88.9 mm) or less, a DWE/DWV procedure may be\nused. When this procedure is used and the radiation beam is offset so that the source-side and film-side portions of the\nweld do not overlap in the areas of the radiograph being evaluated, at least two exposures separated by 90\u00b0 shall be\nmade for the radiographic testing of a complete weld. When the source-side and film-side portions of the weld are\nsuperimposed, at least three exposures separated by 60\u00b0 shall be made for the radiographic testing of a complete weld.\n\n\n\n\nWhen smaller diameter, thicker wall pipe is radiographed, additional exposures should be made to minimize the\ndistortion of imperfection images at the ends of the radiographs.\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum distance between the source or focal spot and the source side of the object being radiographed shall\nbe determined by the following formula (using constant units of measurement):\n\n\n\n\nD\nSt k\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n\nD\nis the minimum distance, in inches (mm), between the source or focal spot and the source side of the object\nbeing radiographed;\n\n\n\n\nS\nis the size, in inches (mm), of the effective source or focal spot;\n\n\n\n\nt\nis the thickness of the weld, in inches (mm), including reinforcement, plus the distance between the film side\nof the weld and the film;\n\n\n\n\nk\nis the geometric unsharpness factor.\n\n\n\n\nWhen  t  is determined for SWE/SWV and DWE/SWV procedures, the thickness of the single wall and its weld\nreinforcement shall be used. When  t  is determined for DWE/DWV procedures, the OD of the weld (i.e. the OD of the\npipe plus twice the average height of the weld crown) shall be used;  k  is defined as 0.02 in. (0.5 mm) for material with\na thickness of less than or equal to 2.000 in. (50.8 mm).\n\n\n### 11.1.3.2 Other Imaging Media\n\n\nFor in-motion imaging, the exposure geometry shall be evaluated at the maximum scanning speed to be used during\nthe radiographic testing of the complete weld.\n\n\n### 11.1.4 Type of IQIs\n\n\nIQIs shall conform to the requirements of either ASTM E747 or ISO 19232-1 wire IQI. The company shall define\nwhich type of IQI (ASTM or ISO) is to be used. The IQI shall be made of a material that is radiographically similar to\nthe material being welded.\n\n\n### 11.1.5 Selection of IQIs\n\n\nThe IQI shall consist of either a series of six (6) wires for ASTM E747 wire type or a series of seven (7) wires for ISO\n19232-1 wire type IQI, arranged in order of increasing diameter. The essential wire diameter to be used, based on the\nthickness of the weld is shown in Table 8 for ASTM E747 wire type IQI and Table 9 for ISO 19232-1 wire type IQI. At\nthe option of the company, smaller wire diameter IQI than those specified above may be used, provided the required\nradiographic sensitivity is obtained. The radiographic images of the IQI identifying style number and ASTM set letter\nor ISO designation shall appear clearly.

For the DWE/\nDWV procedure, one IQI shall be placed on the source side of the pipe and across the weld so that the essential\nwire image is superimposed onto the weld images. For the DWE/SWV or SWE/SWV procedures requiring\nmultiple exposures or multiple films for complete inspection of the weld, and where the length of film to be\ninterpreted is greater than 5 in. (130 mm), two IQIs placed across the weld and located on the film side shall be\nused. One shall be within 1 in. (25 mm) of the end of the film length to be interpreted and the other shall be at the\ncenter of the film. When the film length to be interpreted is 5 in. (130 mm) or less, one IQI shall be placed on the\nfilm side, across the weld and located at the center of the length to be interpreted. When a repaired weld is\nradiographed, an additional IQI shall be placed across each repaired area.\n\n\n\n\nb) When it is not practical to place an IQI on the weld due to weld configuration or size, the IQI may be placed on a\nseparate block. Separate blocks shall be made of the same or radiographically similar material and may be used\nto facilitate IQI positioning. The thickness of the separate block material should be the same as the thickness of\nthe weld.\n\n\n\n\nc) Heat shields\u2014IQI may be placed on a heat shield rather than in contact with the pipe, provided that the\nacceptability of such IQI placement is demonstrated during procedure qualification.\n\n\n### 11.1.6.2 Other Imaging Media\n\n\nFor imaging media other than film, IQI placement shall be the same as that required by 11.1.6.1. The IQI may be\nplaced above the surface of the pipe or held in position between the surface of the pipe and the imager by a fixture\nattached to the imager or scanning device. Acceptability of such IQI placement shall be demonstrated during\nprocedure qualification.\n\n\n### 11.1.7 Production Radiography\n\n\nOnly Level II or III radiographers shall interpret the radiographic images of production welds. Radiographers shall\nreport to the company all defects observed in the images unless the company requires that all imperfections observed\nbe reported. The radiographer shall indicate whether the weld meets the requirements of Section 9. The company\nshall determine the final disposition of the weld.\n\n\n<<TABLE_1>>\n| Weld Thickness   |               | Essential Wire Diameter   |      | Wire Identity   |\n|:-----------------|:--------------|:--------------------------|:-----|:----------------|\n| in.              | mm            | in.                       | mm   |                 |\n| 0 to 0.250       | 0 to 6.4      | 0.008                     | 0.20 | 13              |\n| >0.250 to 0.375  | >6.4 to 9.5   | 0.010                     | 0.25 | 12              |\n| >0.375 to 0.500  | >9.5 to 12.7  | 0.013                     | 0.33 | 11              |\n| >0.500 to 0.750  | >12.7 to 19.1 | 0.016                     | 0.41 | 10              |\n| >0.750 to 1.000  | >19.1 to 25.4 | 0.020                     | 0.51 | 9               |\n| >1.000 to 2.000  | >25.4 to 50.8 | 0.025                     | 0.64 | 8               |\n<<TABLE_END>>\n\n\n\n\n60\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n### 11.1.8 Identification of Images\n\n\nImages shall be clearly identified by the use of lead numbers, lead letters, markers, or other identification so that the\nproper weld and any imperfections in it can be quickly and accurately located. The company may specify the\nidentification procedure to be used. Whenever more than one image is used to inspect a weld, identification markers\nshall appear on each image and adjacent images shall overlap. The last reference marker on each end of the image\nshall appear on the appropriate adjacent images in a way that establishes that no part of the weld has been omitted.\n\n\n### 11.1.9 Storage of Film and Other Imaging Media\n### 11.1.9.1 Film\n\n\nAll unexposed films shall be stored in a clean, dry place where the conditions will not detrimentally affect the\nemulsion. If any question arises about the condition of the unexposed film, sheets from the front and back of each\npackage or a length of film equal to the circumference of each original roll shall be processed in the normal manner\nwithout exposure to light or radiation. If the processed film shows fog, the entire box or roll from which the test film\nwas removed shall be discarded, unless additional tests prove that the remaining film in the box or roll is free from\npreexposure fog exceeding 0.30 H&D transmitted density for transparent-based film or 0.05 H&D reflected density for\nopaque-based film.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   H&D refers to the Hurter-Driffield method of defining quantitative blackening of the film.

The reflected H&D density for opaque-\nbased film shall not be less than 0.5 nor greater than 1.5. Transmitted H&D densities through small localized areas\nmay exceed these limits; however, minimum densities shall not be less than 1.5 and maximum densities shall not\nexceed 4.2; reflected H&D density shall not be less than 0.25 and shall not exceed 1.8.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   H&D refers to the Hurter-Driffield method of defining quantitative blackening of the film.

It shall be equipped to prevent light, coming from around the outer\nedge of the radiograph or through low density portions of the radiograph, from interfering with interpretations.\n\n\n### 11.1.10.3 Film Viewing Facilities\n\n\nViewing facilities shall provide subdued background lighting of an intensity that will not cause troublesome reflections,\nshadows, or glare on the radiograph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n61\n\n\n### 11.1.10.4 Image Processing\n\n\nWhen requested by the company, film or other imaging media shall be processed, handled, and stored so that the\nimages are interpretable for at least three years after they are produced.\n\n\n### 11.1.10.5 Image Processing Area\n\n\nThe image processing area and all accessories shall be kept clean at all times.\n\n\n### 11.1.10.6 Radiation Protection\n\n\nThe radiographer shall be responsible for the protection and monitoring of every person working with or near radiation\nsources. The protection and monitoring shall comply with applicable federal, state, and local regulations.\n\n\n### 11.2 Magnetic Particle Test Method\n\n\nWhen magnetic particle testing is specified by the company, a detailed written procedure for magnetic particle testing\nshall be established that meets the requirements of ASTM E709. The company and the NDT contractor should agree\non the magnetic particle testing procedure or procedures prior to the performance of production testing.\n\n\n\n\nThe company shall require the contractor to demonstrate that the proposed procedures will produce acceptable\nresults and shall require the contractor to use such procedures for production testing.\n\n\n### 11.3 Liquid Penetrant Test Method\n\n\nWhen liquid penetrant testing is specified by the company, a detailed written procedure for liquid penetrant testing\nshall be established that meets the requirements of ASTM E165.

The use of ultrasonic testing and the scope of its use shall be at the option of the\ncompany.\n\n\n\n\nThe company and the ultrasonic contractor should agree on the ultrasonic procedures before the performance of\nproduction testing. The company shall require the ultrasonic contractor to demonstrate the proposed procedures to\nproduce acceptable and accurate results and shall require the contractor to use such procedures for production\ntesting.\n\n\n\n\nCaution is advised when this method is applied to in-service weld inspection due to potential parent material and\nsurface imperfections that can interfere with the use of the ultrasonic technique.\n\n\n\n\nAll surfaces to be ultrasonically scanned shall be in the uncoated condition. For new construction projects, the coating\ncutback (bare pipe length) at pipe ends necessary for ultrasonic scanning should be specified prior to the pipe being\ncoated. Pipe seams should be ground flush with the pipe surface for the distance necessary for ultrasonic scanning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n### 11.4.2 Details of Procedure\n### 11.4.2.1 General\n\n\nThe details of each ultrasonic procedure shall be recorded.

Only Level II or III certified personnel shall calibrate equipment and interpret the test results. NDT Level II\nor III personnel in ultrasonics shall perform the test and evaluate the results per the acceptance/rejection criteria.\n\n\n\n\nThe ultrasonic testing personnel shall perform examinations in accordance with qualified and approved procedures\n(see 11.4.4). Personnel responsible for testing shall be capable of determining the acceptability of circumferential butt\nwelds in accordance with the acceptance criteria as listed in 9.6.\n\n\n\n\nThe company has the right, at any time, to require personnel to demonstrate their capabilities to perform to the\nrequirements of the qualified procedure.\n\n\n### 11.4.4 Demonstration of the Testing Procedure\n\n\nPrior to final written approval, the company shall require the contractor to demonstrate the application of the\nprocedure and ultrasonic systems. A procedure demonstration report shall be generated and the results documented\nprior to use on actual field welds. The demonstration process shall be as follows.\n\n\n\n\na) Welds containing defects and acceptable imperfections shall be prepared from actual production pipe material\nsamples utilizing an approved welding procedure specification. Changes in wall thickness, bevel design, acoustic\nvelocity, welding process, repair welds, and other variables that can have an effect on the detectability and\nresolution of the system shall require additional demonstration welds from other corresponding approved welding\nprocedures. Welder qualification welds may be used.\n\n\n\n\nb) Radiographs shall be made of the welds and the results documented.\n\n\n\n\nc) The ultrasonic testing procedure shall be applied, within the detailed temperature ranges, and the results\ndocumented and compared with the radiographs.\n\n\n\n\nd) Differences in detection results shall be documented. (Differences in detectability and resolution between\nultrasonics and radiography shall be noted.) If required by the company, destructive testing of the weld sample\nshall be made to discover or confirm the results.\n\n\n\n\ne) Use of the ultrasonic testing procedure on production welding shall be based on the capability of the implemented\nultrasonic testing method/technique/systems to:\n\n\n\n\n1) circumferentially locate,\n\n\n\n\n2) size for length,\n\n\n\n\n3) determine depth from OD surface, and\n\n\n\n\n4) axially (weld cross section) locate required imperfections/defects in the test samples.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the procedure shall accurately determine the acceptability of welds in accordance with the criteria listed in\n9.6 and 11.4.7.\n\n\n### 11.4.5 API Sensitivity Reference Standard\n\n\nManual ultrasonic testing sensitivity shall be based on a two or three point reference level (i.e. DAC or TCG) derived\nfrom an N10 notch introduced into a sample of the pipe to be inspected (see Figure 27 and Figure 28). The highest\npoint of the DAC/TCG shall not be less than 80 % of full screen height. The reference standard shall also be used to\ndetermine the actual sound beam velocity, refracted angle, and sound path distance in the pipe material to be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n\n\ninspected. Unknown velocity and refracted angle shall be determined when welds in pipe of different chemistry\nspecifications, wall thickness, diameter or from more than one pipe and rolling or piercing manufacturer are to be\ninspected. This may be accomplished by using two probes of the same nominal angle and frequency with the probes\ndirected toward one another (see Figure 29). When a difference is noted in velocity, angle, or sound path distance,\nanother reference standard shall be made from the different pipe material.\n\n\n\n\nN\nB\n\n\n\n\nt\n\n\n### Notch Block Side View\n\n\nN\nA\nC\n\n\n\n\nD\nE\n\n\n### End View\n\n\nE\n\n\n\n\nR 2\n\n\n\n\nR 3\n\n\n\n\nR 1\n\n\n\n\nDimensions\nt\nSpecified pipe wall thickness\nN\nNotch depth = 10 % T  \u00b1 10 % of notch depth\nA\n2 in.

Verify that the outside notch echo peak is\nat or near zero depth reading. This will establish that refracted angle and velocity\nsettings are sufficiently accurate.\n\n\n### Figure 28\u2014Establishing Distance, Refracted Angle, and Velocity\n\n\nFor automatic ultrasonic testing and when required by the company for manual ultrasonic testing, flat bottom holes\nshall be machined into a sample of the pipe to be inspected. This sample shall be used as calibration reflectors in\naddition to the N10 notches at the inside and outside surfaces. The diameter of each flat bottom hole should be\napproximately equal to the thickness of one welding fill pass. The flat reflecting surface of each hole shall be installed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n65\n\n\n\n\nUsing two transducers of equal angle and frequency, one transmitting and the other receiving,\nmaximize (peak up) the echo received. Measure the surface distance between the transducer\nexit points. Half the surface distance divided by measured wall thickness equals the refracted\nangle tangent. Without changing instrument settings, repeat this process on pipe with unknown\nvelocity, refracted angle, and attenuation to determine any differences.\n\n\n### Figure 29\u2014Transfer Procedure\n\n\nat the same angle and position as the weld joint preparation for each fill pass required by the welding procedure.\nAdditionally, planar reflectors or flat bottom holes shall be installed at the weld centerline position with their flat\nreflecting surfaces vertical to the weld. All reflectors should be spaced apart so that no two will be within the beam\nspread of one probe simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\nFor testing on other than new construction, a pipe sample of the same grade, wall thickness, and OD as the pipe to\nbe inspected shall be used to make the reference standard. A transfer technique using probes of the same nominal\nangles and frequencies to be used for inspection shall be carried out to determine actual full skip distance, actual\nrefracted angle, and attenuation in the material to be inspected (see Figure 29).\n\n\n### 11.4.6 Parent Material Ultrasonic Testing\n\n\nAfter completion of the circumferential butt weld, but prior to its ultrasonic testing, a compression wave test of the\nparent material on both sides of the weld (minimum distance = 1.25, the longest surface skip distance to be used)\nshall be performed. All interfering partial and full beam reflectors shall be noted (datum location and distance from the\nweld edge) and recorded on the examination record.\n\n\n\n\nThe company may elect to waive this requirement in lieu of lamination checks performed by the mill.\n\n\n### 11.4.7 Scanning and Evaluation Level\n### 11.4.7.1 Parent Material Ultrasonic Testing\n\n\nManual compression wave testing of parent material shall be performed with the second backwall echo from the\nreference standard (see Figure 27) adjusted to at least 80 % of full screen height.\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic ultrasonic testing of the parent material shall be performed by using the same calibration method and\nevaluation level as that used for manual compression wave or by a different technique if demonstrated to be equal to\nor better than the manual method.\n\n\n### 11.4.7.2 Manual Ultrasonic Weld Testing\n\n\nManual ultrasonic weld testing shall be performed at a scanning sensitivity of DAC/TCG reference sensitivity plus\n6 dB minimum. All indications that exceed 50 % of DAC/TCG screen height shall be evaluated.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation sensitivity for manual ultrasonic weld testing should be DAC/TCG reference sensitivity plus 6 dB with an\nevaluation level for all indications at 50 % of DAC/TCG screen height.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n\n\nAfter the reference sensitivity, scanning sensitivity, and evaluation sensitivity and levels have been established, they\nshall be qualified and then incorporated into the final procedure and in the final qualification report.\n\n\n### 11.4.7.3 Automatic Ultrasonic Weld Testing\n\n\nAutomatic ultrasonic weld testing should be performed at a scanning sensitivity of 80 % screen height reference\nsensitivity plus 4 dB when using the pulse-echo technique.

The completed weld shall be tested by both radiographic and mechanical test methods, as specified in\n13.2. Each operator shall have received adequate training in the operation of the equipment prior to the start of\nwelding and shall be thoroughly familiar with the equipment they operate.\n\n\n### 13.7 Records of Qualified Operators\n\n\nA record shall be made of the tests required by 13.6 and of the detailed results of each test. A form similar to that\nshown in Figure 2 should be used. (This form should be developed to suit the needs of the company but must be\nsufficiently detailed to demonstrate that the qualification test meets the requirements of this standard.) A list of\nqualified operators and the procedures for which they are qualified shall be maintained. An operator may be required\nto requalify if a question arises about their competence.\n\n\n### 13.8 Quality Assurance of Production Welds\n### 13.8.1 Rights of Inspection\n\n\nThe company shall have the right to inspect all welds by nondestructive means and by removing welds and subjecting\nthem to metallurgical or mechanical tests or both. The frequency of such additional inspections and tests shall be as\nspecified by the company.\n\n\n### 13.8.2 Rejection Based on Strip Chart\n\n\nDuring the automatic welding sequence, the operator shall monitor the electrical and mechanical procedure\nparameters of the welding machine on an appropriate strip chart recorder.\n\n\n\n\nIf any of the welding parameters deviate beyond the tolerances specified in the welding procedure specification, the\nweld shall be unacceptable.

They may also be applied to visual inspection.\n\n\n### 13.9.2 Defects\n\n\nISIs shall be considered defects if any single ISI exceeds  1 / 8  in. (3 mm) or if the aggregate length of ISIs in any\ncontinuous 12 in. (300 mm) length of weld exceeds  1 / 2  in. (13 mm). In flash butt welds, cracks, IF, and porosity\ndetected by NDT are considered defects.\n\n\n### 13.10 Repair and Removal of Defects\n### 13.10.1 Repairs Permitted\n\n\nThe following repairs are permissible.\n\n\n\n\na) Surface defects may be removed by grinding, provided the pipe\u2019s minimum wall thickness is not violated.\n\n\n\n\nb) Defects may be removed from the weld by grinding, chipping, gouging, or a combination of these methods,\nfollowed by a weld repair in accordance with Section 10.\n\n\n\n\nRepair by welding is permitted only by agreement with the company.\n\n\n### 13.10.2 Repairs Not Permitted\n\n\nRepair of porosity found in flash butt welds is not permitted; however, porosity in a repair weld deposit made with a\ndifferent welding process is permitted within the limits defined in 9.3.9.2 or 9.3.9.3, whichever is applicable.\n\n\n### 13.11 Radiographic Procedure\n\n\nRadiographic testing shall be in accordance with 11.1.\n\n\n\n\n<<HEADING level=2>>Annex A\n(normative)<<HEADING_END>>\n## Alternative Acceptance Standards for Girth Welds\n### A.1 General\n\n\nThe acceptance standards given in Section 9 are based on empirical criteria for workmanship and place primary\nimportance on imperfection length. Such criteria have provided an excellent record of reliability in pipeline service for\nmany years. The use of fracture mechanics analysis and fitness-for-purpose criteria for determining acceptance\ncriteria is an alternative method and incorporates the evaluation of both imperfection height and imperfection length.\nTypically, but not always, the fitness-for-purpose criteria provide more generous allowable imperfection length.\nAdditional qualification tests, stress analysis, and inspection are required to use the fitness-for-purpose criteria.\nPerforming analysis based on the principles of fitness-for-purpose is alternatively termed engineering critical\nassessment, or ECA.\n\n\n\n\nThe fitness-for-purpose criteria in the prior versions of this annex required a minimum crack tip opening displacement\n(CTOD) toughness of either 0.005 in. or 0.010 in. (0.13 mm or 0.25 mm) and were independent of any higher values\nof fracture toughness. Improvements in welding consumables and with more precise welding procedures, especially,\nwith the increased use of mechanized welding devices have resulted in higher and more uniform toughness and\nductility in most welds. At the same time, toughness values below 0.005 in. (0.13 mm) have been observed,\nparticularly with more stringent notching procedures of CTOD specimens than those in the prior versions of this\nannex. Welds with CTOD toughness below 0.005 in. (0.13 mm) have shown to perform adequately when the\nacceptance criteria are properly adjusted to account for the lower toughness. The acceptance criteria are revised so\nthat they are commensurate with the measured toughness and applied load levels.\n\n\n\n\nThis annex includes three options for the determination of acceptance limits of planar imperfections. In numerical\norder, the options are increasingly complex in application but offer wider range of applicability. Option 1 provides the\nsimplest methodology. Option 2 allows for the full utilization of the toughness of the materials thus providing a more\naccurate criterion but requires more calculation. The first two options were developed with a single set of underlying\nprocedures but are limited to applications with a low to moderate fatigue loading as described in A.2.2.1. 7  Option 3 is\nprovided primarily for those cases where fatigue loading exceeds the limit established for the first two options.\nOption 3 is not prescriptive, and its consistency could be significantly less than Options 1 and 2. Option 3 should only\nbe exercised, when necessary, by skilled practitioners with demonstrated knowledge of fracture mechanics and\npipeline load analysis. With these three options, this current revision of the annex should provide a more complete\napproach to determine inspection and acceptance limits for imperfections.\n\n\n\n\nIt is usually impractical to qualify individual pipeline welds for the alternative acceptance limits after a defect under\nSection 9 is detected, because destructive testing is required to establish the required mechanical properties for the\nwelding procedure under consideration.\n\n\n\n\nThis annex provides procedures to determine the maximum allowable imperfection sizes. It does not prevent the use\nof Section 9 for determining imperfection acceptance limits for any weld. Use of this annex is completely at the\ncompany\u2019s option.\n\n\n\n\nIn this annex, the use of the phrase imperfection acceptance limits and other phrases containing the word\nimperfection is not intended to imply a defective condition or any lack of weld integrity. All welds contain certain\nfeatures variously described as artifacts, imperfections, discontinuities, or flaws. These terms are widely accepted\nand used interchangeably. The primary purpose of this annex is to define, on the basis of a technical analysis, the\neffect of various types, sizes, and shapes of such anomalies on the suitability of the whole weld for a specific service.\n\n\n\n\n7\nY.-Y.

The stress analysis shall include stresses during\npipeline installation and stresses induced by operational and environmental conditions. Under typical onshore\nconstruction conditions, the highest axial stress may occur during the pipe lowering-in process. The lowering-in stress is\npredominantly controlled by the lift height of the pipe relative to the bottom of the trench. The stresses from horizontal\ndirectional drilling can be estimated from the curvature of the pipe path, pull force, and the interaction between the pipe\nand surrounding soil (including friction). 8  These stresses may reach their peak values at different times. The maximum\naxial design stress is the maximum total axial stress at any given time during the design life of the pipeline. 9\n\n\n### A.2.2 Cyclic Stress\n### A.2.2.1 Analysis\n\n\nThe cyclic stress analysis shall include the determination of the predicted fatigue spectrum to which the pipeline will\nbe exposed over its design life. This spectrum shall include but is not limited to stresses imposed by hydrostatic\ntesting, operation pressure, installation stresses, and where applicable, thermal, seismic, and subsidence stresses.\nThe spectrum should consist of several cyclic axial stress levels and the number of cycles applicable to each. If the\nstress levels vary from cycle to cycle, a suitable counting method, such as the rainflow method, should be used to\ndetermine cyclic stress levels and cycle count.  10\n\n\n\n\nThe fatigue spectrum severity,  S *, is computed from the following equation:\n\n\n\n\nS *\nN 1  \u0394\u03c3 1\n3\nN 2  \u0394\u03c3 2\n3\n\u2026 N i  \u0394\u03c3 i\n3\n+\nN k  \u0394\u03c3 k\n3\n+\n+\n+\n=\n\n\n\n\n(A.1)\n\n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\n\nS *\nis the spectrum severity;\n\n\n\n\nN i\nis the number of cycles at the  i th cyclic stress level;\n\n\n\n\n8\nMore details of the stress analysis may be found in reference M. Liu, Y.-Y. Wang, and G. Rogers, \u201cStress Analysis of Pipe\nLowering-in Process During Construction,\u201d Proceedings of the 7th International Pipeline Conference, Paper No. IPC2008-\n64630, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, September 29 to October 3, 2008.\n9\nFor consistency with the computation of material\u2019s flow stress in this annex, stress-strain relations based on minimum specified\nvalues are recommended when converting axial strains to axial stresses. Using actual stress-strain relations may result in the\noverestimation of the applied load level, as the flow stress is computed from the minimum specified values (e.g. see A.5.1.3).\n10  For an example of the use of the rainflow method, see N. E. Dowling, \u201cFatigue Failure Predictions for Complicated Stress-Strain\nHistories,\u201d  Journal of Materials , Volume 7, Number 1, pp. 71 to 87, March 1972.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n82\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n\n\n\u0394\u03c3   i   is the ith cyclic stress range, in kips per in. 2  (ksi);\n\n\n\n\nk\nis the total number of cyclic stress levels;\n\n\n\n\ni\nis the number  i th cyclic stress, from 1 to k.\n\n\n\n\nIf the spectrum severity is less than 5 \u00d7 10 6  and if the use of \u201csteel in-air\u201d crack growth curves, such as those defined\nin Table 4 of BS 7910, is appropriate, Options 1 and 2 acceptance criteria (A.5.1.3 and A.5.1.4) may be applied\nwithout any further fatigue analysis.  11  If the spectrum severity exceeds 5 \u00d7 10 6  and/or in-air crack growth curves are\nnot applicable, Options 1 and 2 may be used with further analysis, or Option 3 procedures may be applied.  12\n\n\n### A.2.2.2 Environmental Effects on Fatigue\n\n\nThe enlargement of weld imperfections due to fatigue is a function of stress intensity, cycles of loading, imperfection\nsize, and the environment at the crack tip. In the absence of contaminating elements, oil and hydrocarbons are\nconsidered no worse than air. Water, brine, and aqueous solutions that contain CO 2  or H 2 S may, however, increase\nthe growth rate. It is normal for minor amounts of these components to be present in nominally noncorrosive\npipelines. When the concentration of either CO 2  or H 2 S exceeds typical historical levels experienced in noncorrosive\npipelines, this annex shall not be used, unless evidence exists that the proposed levels do not result in acceleration of\nfatigue crack growth or adequate corrosion inhibition is applied. The effects of environment on fatigue crack growth\nexternal to the pipe at girth welds are normally mitigated by external coating and cathodic protection and do not limit\nthe use of this annex.\n\n\n### A.2.3 Sustained-load Cracking\n\n\nCertain environments may enhance imperfection growth in service at sustained load or induce brittleness in the material\nsurrounding the imperfection to the point that an otherwise dormant imperfection becomes critical. These environments\ntypically contain H 2 S but may contain strong hydroxides, nitrates, or carbonates. When these materials are present\ninside the pipe, a minimum threshold stress shall be established, and this annex shall not be used if the calculated stress\nexceeds the threshold value. With respect to H 2 S service, the definition of such service shall be that given in\nNACE MR0175. Although external exposure to carbonates and nitrates in the soil has been shown to produce stress\ncorrosion cracking (SCC) in a small number of cases, the cracking is normally axial and is associated with\ncircumferential stress rather than axial stress. However, circumferential SCC failures may occur at locations where\nlongitudinal stresses have increased over the life of the pipeline, for example, at overbends above unstable slopes.\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency and severity of SCC can be mitigated by the use of proper coating and proper cathodic protection. The\nuse of this annex is not precluded when direct exposure to the aggressive environment is prevented by a coating\ndesigned to resist the environment.\n\n\n### A.2.4 Dynamic Loading\n\n\nThe stress analysis shall include consideration of potential dynamic loading on girth welds, such as loads from\nclosure of check valves. This annex does not apply to welds strained at a strain rate greater than 10 \u20133  second (a\nstress rate of 30 ksi/sec for steel).\n\n\n\n\n11  The implied safety factor in the fatigue spectrum severity limit for Options 1 and 2 varies, depending on, for example, the pipe\nwall thickness and distribution of fatigue spectrum. For a wide range of onshore and offshore pipeline scenarios, the spectrum\nseverity limit is estimated to provide a safety factor of more than 2 or 5 on cycles when the fatigue growth rates are based on\nmean+2 standard deviation or mean values of BS 7910 (Table 4,  R  > 0.5), respectively.\n12  Options 1 and 2 provide an adequate safety factor against fracture due to moderate cyclic loading provided aforementioned\n\u201csteel-in-air\u201d curve is applicable. In other environments, for example, when determining allowable defect sizes at the OD of an\noffshore pipeline with fusion-bonded epoxy field joint coating and under cathodic protection, use of the \u201csteel-in-air\u201d curve is not\nappropriate and use of Option 1 or 2 may not be sufficiently conservative. Similarly, if cyclic loading exceeds the defined\nspectrum severity of 5 \u00d7 10 6 , for example, due to cyclic stresses from offshore installation loads on a pipe lay stinger, use of\nOption 1 or 2 may also not be sufficiently conservative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n83\n\n\n### A.2.5 Residual Stress\n\n\nThe effects of welding residual stress are accounted for by specifying minimum CTOD toughness and Charpy energy\nand by incorporating appropriate safety factor in Options 1 and 2 procedures (A.5.1.3 and A.5.1.4). The determination\nof residual stress is not required under these conditions. The effects of residual stress shall be evaluated for all time-\ndependent failure mechanisms, such as fatigue.\n\n\n### A.3 Welding Procedure\n### A.3.1 General\n\n\nThe controls of the variables necessary to ensure an acceptable level of fracture toughness in a welding procedure\nare more stringent than those controlling welding procedures without minimum toughness requirements. An\nappropriate quality control program shall be established to ensure welding is performed within the parameters of the\nqualified welding procedure. Qualification of welding procedures to be used with this annex shall be in accordance\nwith Section 5 or Section 12 of this standard, with the additional mechanical property testing in accordance with A.3.4.\n\n\n### A.3.2 Essential Variables\n\n\nAny change in the essential variables specified below shall require requalification of the welding procedure.\n\n\n\n\na) A change in the welding process, mode of arc transfer, or method of application.\n\n\n\n\nb) A change in any of the following:\n\n\n\n\n1) grade;\n\n\n\n\n2) source/mill for steel (slabs, ingots, billets, etc.);\n\n\n\n\n3) processing facility for plate or coil used to make pipe;\n\n\n\n\n4) pipe manufacturing facility;\n\n\n\n\n5) pipe manufacturing process, including pipe forming and heat treatment process (EW, SAWL, SAWH, seamless,\nexpanded vs not expanded, heat treated vs not heat treated);\n\n\n\n\n6) chemistry outside the limits defined by the manufacturing procedure specification (MPS) according to API 5L or,\nalternatively, if the pipe is not manufactured to an MPS, a change in any of the following:\n\n\n\n\ni)\nincrease in Pcm  \u2265  0.02 for steels with carbon content  \u2264  0.12 % [Pcm = C + Si/30 + (Mn+Cu+Cr)/20 + Ni/60 +\nMo/15 + V/10 + 5B],\n\n\n\n\nii) increase in CE  \u2265  0.03 for steels with carbon content > 0.12 % [CE = C + Mn/6 + (Cu + Ni)/15 + (Cr + Mo + V)/5],\n\n\n\n\niii) increase in C  \u2265  0.02 %.\n\n\n\n\nChemistry compositions requirements shall be based on heat analysis results.\n\n\n\n\nc) A major change in joint design (e.g. from U groove to V groove). Minor changes in the angle of bevel or the land of\nthe welding groove that do not yield a change in the range of qualified heat input are not essential variables.\n\n\n\n\nd) A change in position from roll to fixed, or vice versa, or from vertical to horizontal or vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n84\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n\n\ne) A change in the specified qualified wall thickness of more than \u00b10.125 in.\n\n\n\n\nf)\nA change in the size, type, heat/lot number, or manufacturer of the filler metal and flux, even within an AWS\nclassification.\n\n\n\n\nQualification of a new heat/lot of the filler metal may be done with a single nominal weld of the same welding\nprocedure that is tested for weld tensile (see A.3.4.1), weld Charpy (see A.3.4.2), and weld CTOD (see A.3.4.3).\n\n\n\n\nThe following lot definitions within AWS A5.01 are acceptable: C2, C3, C4, C5, S2, S3, S4, T2, T3, and T4.

Although tensile specimen failure in the weld is acceptable, provided the strength\nrequirement is met, gross weld strength undermatching should be avoided.  14\n\n\n\n\nb) If the specimen breaks in the weld or HAZ at a strength below the SMTS of the pipe material, the weld shall be\nrejected.\n\n\n\n\nc) If a specimen breaks outside the weld or HAZ at a tensile strength less than 100 %, but not less than (lower than)\n95 % of the SMTS of the pipe material, then two additional specimens may be tested. Both retest specimens shall\nmeet the SMTS of the pipe material. If either retest specimen fails to meet the minimum tensile strength\nrequirement, no retesting is permitted.\n\n\n\n\nd) Any specimen that breaks outside the weld or HAZ at a tensile strength less than (lower than) 95 % of the SMTS\nof the pipe material shall be rejected and no further retesting is permitted.\n\n\n### A.3.4.2 Charpy Impact Energy\n### A.3.4.2.1 Specimen Preparation\n\n\nCharpy V-notch impact test specimens shall be prepared with their lengths parallel to the pipe axis. The largest size\nspecimens permitted by the pipe wall thickness should be used. The thickness of subsized specimens should have at\nleast 80 % of the wall thickness. Six specimens shall be removed from each of the following positions: 12, 6, and 3 or\n9 o\u2019clock, for a total of 18 specimens. For each of these positions, three specimens shall have the V-notch placed in\nthe weld centerline; and the other three shall have the V-notch placed in the HAZ as shown in Figure A.2.\n\n\n### A.3.4.2.2 Testing\n\n\nAt least nine valid specimens for each notch location (weld metal or HAZ) shall be tested at or below the minimum\ndesign temperature in accordance with the requirements of ASTM E23.\n\n\n\n\n14  The company is cautioned to consider weld undermatching issues as it relates to pipeline bending or other longitudinal tensile\nloads. An example of assessing weld strength undermatching is given in Y.-Y. Wang, M. Liu, D. Horsley, and G.

The retest requirements are as follows:\n\n\n\n\na) the three retest specimens shall be extracted from a location as close as possible to the location of the specimen\nthat generated the low result,\n\n\n\n\nb) the absorbed energy of all three retest specimens shall meet or exceed 30 ft-lb (40 J).\n\n\n\n\nIf the above retest criteria are satisfied, the Charpy results are acceptable. If the above criteria are not satisfied, no\nfurther retesting is permitted and the weld is rejected.\n\n\n### A.3.4.3 Fracture Toughness Testing\n### A.3.4.3.1 General\n\n\nTo use the alternative acceptance criteria, the fracture toughness of the weld shall be determined by testing in\naccordance with BS EN ISO 15653, as supplemented by this annex.\n\n\n### A.3.4.3.2 Specimen Preparation\n\n\nThe preferred test piece ( B  \u00d7 2 B ) shall be used. As shown in Figure A.3, the specimen should be oriented so that its\nlength is parallel to the pipe axis and its width is in the circumferential direction; thus, the crack tip line is oriented in\nthe through-thickness direction. The specimen thickness (see Figure A.4) should be equal to the pipe thickness less\nthe minimum amount of milling and grinding necessary to produce a specimen with the prescribed rectangular cross\nsection and surface finish from a curved pipe segment. The weld reinforcement shall be removed.

For weld metal\ntests, the notch and fatigue crack tip should be located at the center of the weld and completely in weld metal (see\nFigure A.5).\n\n\n\n\nFor the HAZ tests, the fatigue precracks shall be aimed to intersect the largest unrefined coarse grain HAZ regions\nwithin the central 70 % of the specimen thickness (see Figure A.6). Each of the three HAZ specimens should be\naimed at different coarse grained regions within the central 70 %. If there are fewer than three such regions in the\ncentral 70 %, then multiple specimens may be aimed at the same region. Multiple specimen sampling of the cap pass\ncoarse grain HAZ should be avoided. No more than one specimen should be devoted to the cap pass HAZ. To\nidentify coarse grain HAZ regions, it may be useful to conduct a microhardness survey to locate the coarsest HAZ\nregions that have undergone the least amount of tempering by subsequent weld passes.\n\n\n### A.3.4.3.3 CTOD Toughness Testing\n\n\nFor each welding procedure, both the weld metal and the HAZ shall be tested. Each set of tests (of weld metal or\nHAZ) shall consist of at least three valid specimen tests performed at or below the minimum design temperature. The\nthree specimens shall consist of one each from the nominal 12, 3 or 9, and 6 o\u2019clock positions on the test weld and\nshould be permanently marked to identify the original position.\n\n\n\n\nAfter testing, particular attention should be given to the qualification criteria in 12.4 (particularly 12.4.3) of BS EB ISO\n15653; these criteria deal with the geometry of the fatigue crack front. For this annex, the appropriate value of CTOD\nshall be  \u03b4 c ,  \u03b4 u , or  \u03b4 m .

The test report shall also include a legible\ncopy of the load-displacement record and a record of the appearance of the fracture surfaces; the latter requirement\ncan be satisfied by a clear photograph of one or both fracture surfaces or by retaining one or both fracture surfaces\n(properly preserved and identified) for direct observation.

The use of ultrasonic techniques, radiographic techniques that employ densitometers or\ncomparative visual reference standards, acoustic imaging, inherent imperfection-size limitations due to weld-pass\ngeometry, or any other technique for determining imperfection height is acceptable, provided the technique\u2019s\naccuracy has been established (e.g. see 11.4.4) and any potential inaccuracy is included in the measurement; that is,\nthe determination of imperfection height shall be conservative. The use of conventional radiography (see 11.1) to\nidentify imperfections that require height measurement by other means is acceptable.\n\n\n### A.5.1.2 Structure of the Procedures to Determine the Maximum Acceptable Imperfection Size\n\n\nThe procedures to determine the maximum acceptable planar imperfection size are given in three options. Option 1 is\na simplified approach in graphical format. It relies on theoretically sound and experimentally validated plastic collapse\ncriteria, and has been modified by the Option 2 approach when appropriate. Option 2 is in the form of a failure\nassessment diagram, or FAD. The FAD format allows the simultaneous consideration of brittle fracture, plastic\ncollapse, and the interaction between those two failure modes (elastic-plastic fracture). Options 1 and 2 are limited to\npipelines with limited fatigue loads as specified in A.2.2. Option 3 permits the use of validated fitness-for-purpose\nprocedures when the cyclic loading exceeds the spectrum requirements of Options 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\nThe Option 1 procedures are limited to CTOD toughness equal or greater than 0.004 in. (0.10 mm). The Options 2\nand 3 procedures may be applied at any CTOD toughness level greater than the minimum required value of 0.002 in.\n(0.05 mm).\n\n\n\n\nThe basis of the Options 1 and 2 procedures places no limit on pipe diameter or diameter to wall thickness ratio ( D / t\nratio). Theoretical validation has shown that the procedures are valid for  D / t   \u2265  10.\n\n\n\n\nLine pipes with ultrahigh  Y / T  ratio ( Y / T  > 0.95) are often associated with low uniform strain (engineering strain at\nultimate tensile stress) and low ductility. Additional testing and validation may be necessary to use the alternative\nacceptance criteria in this annex.\n\n\n### A.5.1.3 Determination of Acceptable Imperfection Size by Option 1\n### A.5.1.3.1 General\n\n\nTwo sets of acceptance criteria are given, depending on the CTOD toughness value.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the CTOD toughness is equal to or greater than 0.010 in. (0.25 mm), the maximum acceptable imperfection\nsize is given in Figure A.7 at various load levels ( P r ). If the load level is not given in Figure A.7, the maximum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n91\n\n\n\n\nacceptable imperfection size can be obtained by interpolating the adjacent curves or by taking the value of the next\nhigher load level.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the CTOD toughness is equal to or greater than 0.004 in. (0.10 mm) and less than 0.010 in. (0.25 mm), the\nmaximum acceptable imperfection size is given in Figure A.8.\n\n\n\n\nThe acceptable imperfection size may be more limiting than that from the Option 2 procedure as the limits in\nFigure A.7 and Figure A.8 were calibrated to a CTOD toughness of 0.010 in. (0.25 mm) and 0.004 in. (0.10 mm),\nrespectively.\n\n\n\n\nThe total imperfection length shall be no greater than 12.5 % of the pipe circumference. The maximum imperfection\nheight shall be no greater than 50 % of the pipe wall thickness.\n\n\n\n\nThe allowable height of the buried imperfections is treated the same as the allowable height of the surface-breaking\nimperfections.\n\n\n\n\nThe built-in safety factor in the acceptable imperfection size can accommodate certain amount of undersizing of\nimperfection height without negatively impacting weld integrity.

The stress ratio defines\nthe likelihood of plastic collapse. The toughness ratio is the ratio of applied crack driving force over the material\u2019s\nfracture toughness. It defines the likelihood of brittle fracture.\n\n\n\n\n16  Further adjustments may be desirable, see Step 8) of A.5.1.4.2.\n\n\n<<TABLE_1>>\n|    | Hei   | ght adju   | stment   |       |           |          |          |        |    |    |\n|:---|:------|:-----------|:---------|:------|:----------|:---------|:---------|:-------|:---|:---|\n|    |       |            |          | Initi | al allowa | ble imp  | erfectio | n size |    |    |\n|    |       |            |          |       | Final all | owable   | imperfe  | ction  |    |    |\n|    |       |            |          |       | size aft  | er heigh | t adjust | ment   |    |    |\n<<TABLE_END>>\n<<TABLE_2>>\n| Allowable Imperfection Height   |   Allowable Imperfection Length |\n| in.                             |                             in. |\n|:--------------------------------|--------------------------------:|\n| 0 to 0.05                       |                             8   |\n| 0.05 to 0.15                    |                             3   |\n| 0.15 to 0.24                    |                             1.9 |\n| >0.24                           |                             0   |\n<<TABLE_END>>\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n95\n\n\n\n\ne\nn\ne\nJ\nd  V\nG  \u0002\n, Eq.

Proficiency and understanding of fracture mechanics is necessary to\nensure the procedure is applied correctly. A validated computer program should greatly simplify the computation.\n\n\n### A.5.1.4.2 Determination of Critical Imperfection Size\n\n\nThe critical imperfection size can be computed iteratively using equations provided in A.5.1.4.3. The following steps\nmay be followed.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1) Select an imperfection size as a start point. A reasonable start point is an imperfection with the maximum\nallowed height,  \u03b7  = 0.5, and a small imperfection length that represents the smallest imperfection length\nthat the selected inspection methods can confidently detect.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2) Determine the assessment point in the FAD format in accordance with A.5.1.4.3.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3) If the assessment point falls inside the safe region, increase the imperfection length and repeat Step 2).\n\n\n\n\nStep 4) If the assessment point falls outside the safe region, decrease the imperfection length and repeat Step 2).\n\n\n<<TABLE_1>>\n| 0               | 1   |\n|:----------------|:----|\n| Cutoff, Eq.

Start from the imperfection length\ndetermined in Item a) and repeat Step 2).\n\n\n\n\nStep 6) Make a table of critical imperfection height and length.\n\n\n\n\nStep 7) Apply a safety factor of 1.5 on the imperfection length to produce a draft table of the allowable imperfection\nheight versus imperfection length.\n\n\n\n\nStep 8) Make necessary adjustment to the draft table to ensure detectability of the selected inspection methods  17\n\n\n\n\nand sound welding practice.  18  Produce the final table of the allowable imperfection height versus\nimperfection length.\n\n\n\n\nThe total imperfection length shall be no greater than 12.5 % of the pipe circumference. The maximum imperfection\nheight shall be no greater than 50 % of the pipe wall thickness.\n\n\n\n\nThe allowable height of the buried imperfections is treated the same as the allowable height of the surface-breaking\nimperfections.\n\n\n\n\nThe built-in safety factor in the acceptable imperfection size can accommodate certain amount of undersizing of\nimperfection height without negatively impacting weld integrity. The assumed height uncertainty is the lesser of\n0.060 in. (1.5 mm) and 8 % of pipe wall thickness.

The Option 3\nprocedures are permitted when significant imperfection growth is expected.\n\n\n\n\nSubject to company approval, validated fitness-for-purpose procedures may be used to develop imperfection\nacceptance criteria. One of the most widely accepted procedures is BS 7910. The procedures shall be applied by\nwell-qualified analysts/engineers who have the demonstrated command of the principles of fracture mechanics,\npipeline welding, and NDT. Any selected procedure shall be taken as a whole in developing the acceptance criteria\nwith appropriate considerations of safety factors. It should be recognized that the basic assumptions of various public-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n99\n\n\n\n\naccessible assessment procedures may be different from those of Options 1 and 2. Mixing parts of different\nprocedures is discouraged.\n\n\n### A.5.1.5.2 Fatigue Flaw Growth\n\n\nAppropriate fatigue analysis shall be conducted to determine the starting flaw acceptance criteria. Various public-\naccessible procedures and software are available to determine the flaw growth (e.g. Section 8 of BS 7910). Static\nfracture resistance shall be checked for all peak loads during the entire fatigue loading spectrum. Available software\nprograms may be used by skilled practitioners to conduct this fatigue analysis and check the static failure conditions\nduring the entire application of the cyclic loads.\n\n\n\n\nThe allowable flaw size from Option 1 may be used as the starting flaw sizes for both buried and surface-breaking\nflaws. If the critical flaw size is reached or failure from static peak loads occurs prior to the end of the service life (with\nthe appropriate design or safety factor), the starting flaw sizes need to be reduced. Care should be taken to select the\nappropriate flaw growth curves (da/dN curves) for the type of service. Tables 4 and 5 of BS 7910 provide guidance for\nselection of these curves, and company may provide supplemental information used to generate flaw growth curves\nfor different product conditions inside the pipe. For small  D / t  ratio pipes through-thickness stress is not uniform.\nAnalyses from multiple initial flaw locations are necessary.\n\n\n### A.5.1.5.3 Inspection Error and Safety Factor on Allowable Imperfect Size\n\n\nThe allowable flaw height shall be reduced by the inspection error extracted from NDT qualification results of qualified\ninspection system/procedure/operator for the specific project or project with similar material and welding procedure.\n\n\n### A.5.1.6 Transverse Planar Imperfections\n\n\nTransverse planar imperfections shall be repaired or removed. The height of imperfections that are indicative of\nstacked weld bead starts and stops shall not exceed the lesser of  1 / 4  in. (6.4 mm) or 50 % of the wall thickness.\n\n\n### A.5.2 Acceptable Limits of Volumetric Imperfections\n\n\nBuried volumetric imperfections, such as slag or porosity, contained in material with high fracture toughness are much\nless likely to cause failure than planar imperfections. These imperfections may be treated and evaluated as planar\nimperfections or by the simplified method of Table A.4. Surface-breaking imperfections, and buried imperfections that\nare recategorized as surface-breaking by the imperfection interaction rules, shall be treated and evaluated as planar\nimperfections. The minimum CTOD toughness and Charpy impact energy requirements are applicable regardless\nhow the imperfections are evaluated.\n\n\n### Table A.4\u2014Acceptance Limits for Buried Volumetric Imperfections\n<<HEADING level=3>>Imperfection Type\nHeight or Width\nLength<<HEADING_END>>\n\n\nPorosity\nLesser of  t / 4  or 0.25 in.\nLess of  t / 4  or 0.25 in.\n\n\n\n\nSlag\nLesser of  t / 4  or 0.25 in.\n4 t\n\n\n### A.5.3 Arc Burns\n\n\nArc burns may occur on the internal or external surface of the pipe as a result of inadvertent arc strikes or improper\ngrounding. They generally appear as a pit or cavity visible to the eye or as a dense area on the radiograph. The cavity\nmay be surrounded by a hard HAZ that may be of lower toughness than the base material or the weld deposit.\n\n\n\n\nThe acceptance limits for unrepaired arc burns are given in Table A.5 and are based on the premise that the HAZ has\nzero toughness but that any planar imperfection originating within the HAZ is blunted at the edge of the zone.\nSubstantial data indicate that the total depth of the arc burn, including the HAZ, is less than half the width of the burn.\n\n\n<<TABLE_1>>\n| Imperfection Type   | Height or Width           | Length                  |\n|:--------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------|\n| Porosity            | Lesser of t/4 or 0.25 in. | Less of t/4 or 0.25 in. |\n| Slag                | Lesser of t/4 or 0.25 in. | 4t                      |\n<<TABLE_END>>\n\n\n\n\n100\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n### Table A.5\u2014Acceptable Limits for Unrepaired Arc Burns\n<<HEADING level=3>>Measured Dimension\nAcceptance Limit<<HEADING_END>>\n\n\nWidth\nLesser of  t  or  5 / 16  in.\n\n\n\n\nLength (any direction)\nLesser of  t  or  5 / 16  in.\n\n\n\n\nDepth (to bottom of crater)\n1 / 16  in.\n\n\n\n\nArc burns that contain cracks visible to the eye or on conventional radiographs are not covered by this annex and\nshall be repaired or removed.\n\n\n### A.5.4 Imperfection Interaction\n\n\nIf adjacent imperfections are close enough, they may behave as single larger imperfections.

For the purposes of this annex, in-service pipelines and piping systems are defined\nas those that contain crude petroleum, petroleum products, or fuel gases that may be pressurized and/or flowing. In-\nservice welds are defined as those that fuse directly into the wall of an in-service pipeline or piping system. This\nannex does not cover pipelines and piping systems that have been fully isolated and decommissioned or that have\nnot been commissioned.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two primary concerns with welding onto in-service pipelines. The first concern is to avoid \u201cburn-through,\u201d\nwhere the welding arc causes the pipe wall to be breached. The second concern is for hydrogen cracking, since welds\nmade in service cool at an accelerated rate as the result of the flowing contents\u2019 ability to remove heat from the pipe wall.\n\n\n\n\nBurn-through is unlikely when installing an appurtenance if the wall thickness is 0.250 in. (6.4 mm) or greater,\nprovided that low-hydrogen electrodes (EXX18 type) and normal welding practices are used. Welding onto thinner-\nwall in-service pipelines is possible and considered routine by many companies; however, special precautions, such\nas the use of a procedure that limits heat input, are often specified. Burn-through becomes more likely when welding\ndirectly onto the pipe, which may occur when depositing the buttering layers of a temper bead deposition sequence or\nwhen performing weld deposition repair.\n\n\n\n\nFor hydrogen cracking to occur, three conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. These conditions are: hydrogen in\nthe weld, the development of a crack-susceptible weld microstructure, and tensile stress acting on the weld. To\nprevent hydrogen cracking, at least one of the three conditions necessary for its occurrence must be minimized or\neliminated. For welds made onto in-service pipelines, success has been achieved using low-hydrogen electrodes or a\nlow-hydrogen process and, since low hydrogen levels cannot always be guaranteed, using procedures that minimize\nthe formation of crack-susceptible microstructures. The most common procedures use a sufficiently high heat input\nlevel to overcome the effect of the flowing contents. Several heat input prediction methods have been developed,\nincluding thermal analysis computer models. 20  While these or other proven methods are useful in predicting the heat\ninput required for a given in-service welding application, they are not a substitute for procedure qualification (see B.2).\nPreheating, where practicable, and/or the use of a temper bead deposition sequence, can also reduce the risk of\nhydrogen cracking. For some pipeline operating conditions, the ability of the flowing contents to remove heat from the\npipe wall tends to make the effective use of preheating difficult. Examples of typical temper bead deposition\nsequences are shown in Figure B.1. To minimize the stress acting on the weld, attention should also be given to\nproper fit-up to minimize the stress concentration at the root of the weld.\n\n\n\n\nThe successful application of in-service welding must achieve a balance between safety on one hand and the\nprevention of unsatisfactory material properties on the other. For example, if the pipe wall is thin [i.e. less than\n0.250 in. (6.4 mm)], it may be necessary to limit heat input to minimize the risk of burn-through; however, a low heat\ninput level may be insufficient to overcome the ability of the contents to remove heat from the pipe wall, resulting in\nexcessive weld cooling rates and a subsequent risk of hydrogen cracking. Thus, a compromise must be reached.\nWhen the maximum allowable heat input to avoid burn-through is insufficient to provide adequate protection against\nhydrogen cracking, then alternative precautions (e.g. a temper bead deposition sequence) must be used.\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of this annex pertains to preventing hydrogen cracking in in-service welds. If the pipe wall thickness is\nless than 0.250 in. (6.4 mm), the risk of burn-through should be considered.

Additional consideration should also be given for welding onto in-service pipelines and piping systems\nthat contain products that become explosively unstable upon the application of heat or that contain products that will\naffect the pipe material by rendering it susceptible to ignition, stress corrosion cracking, or embrittlement. Additional\nguidance can be found in API 2201.\n\n\n\n\nThe requirements for fillet welds in the main body of this document should be applied to in-service welds that contact\nthe carrier pipe, except for the alternative/additional requirements specified in this annex. For in-service welding,\nwhere discrepancies exist between this annex and the main body of this document, the annex should govern.\n\n\n### B.2 Qualification of In-service Welding Procedures\n### B.2.1 General\n\n\nThe procedure qualification requirements for fillet welds in Section 5 should be applied to in-service welds, except for\nthe alternative/additional requirements specified in this annex.\n\n\n### B.2.2 Welding Procedure Specification\n### B.2.2.1 Specification Information\n### B.2.2.1.1 Materials\n\n\nFor in-service welds, the carbon equivalent  21  of the materials to which the procedure applies should be identified in\naddition to SMYS. Carbon equivalent levels may be grouped.\n\n\n\n\n[paragraph deleted]\n\n\n### B.2.2.1.2 Pipeline Operating Conditions\n\n\nFor in-service welds, the pipeline operating conditions (pipe contents, flow rate, etc.) for which the procedure applies\nshould be identified. Conditions may be grouped.\n\n\n\n\n21  CEIIW = %C + %Mn/6 + (%Cu + %Ni)/15 + (%Cr + %Mo + %V)/5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n104\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n### B.2.2.1.3 Heat Input Range\n\n\nFor procedures intended to overcome the effect of heat removal by the flowing contents by using a sufficiently high\nheat input level  22  (heat input control procedures), the required heat input range should be specified. For procedures\nintended to overcome the effect of heat removal by the flowing contents by using temper bead deposition sequence\n(temper bead procedures), the required heat input range for each layer should be specified.\n\n\n### B.2.2.1.4 Weld Deposition Sequence\n\n\nFor procedures intended to overcome the effect of heat removal by the flowing contents by using temper bead\ndeposition sequence (temper bead procedures), the required weld deposition sequence should be specified. The weld\ndeposition sequence should include tolerances for bead spacing to assure proper tempering of the previous passes.\n\n\n### B.2.3 Essential Variables\n### B.2.3.1 Changes Requiring Requalification\n### B.2.3.1.1 Materials\n\n\nFor in-service fillet welds, SMYS is not an essential variable.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   For in-service welds other than fillet welds, the strength of the completed weld meets or exceeds the specified minimum\nstrength of the pipe and fitting material.\n\n\n\n\nAn increase in the carbon equivalent above that of the material used for procedure qualification constitutes an\nessential variable, except as provided below.\n\n\n\n\nA procedure may be used for higher carbon equivalent materials than the material used for procedure qualification\nprovided that the thermal conditions are less severe than the procedure qualification conditions and no increase in the\nrisk of hydrogen cracking results.\n\n\n### B.2.3.1.2 Pipeline Operating Conditions\n\n\nFor in-service welds, an increase in the severity of the pipeline operating conditions (in terms of weld cooling rates)\nabove the group qualified constitutes an essential variable.\n\n\n### B.2.3.1.3 Pipe Wall Thickness\n\n\nFor in-service fillet welds, wall thickness is not an essential variable. However, wall thickness of the materials being\nwelded should be considered when considering the thermal severity of the pipeline operating conditions.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   For weld deposition repairs, the qualified welding procedure is not used on a remaining pipe wall thickness less than\nwhat was used during qualification.\n\n\n### B.2.3.1.4 Weld Deposition Sequence\n\n\nA change from a deposition sequence that relies on tempering to some other deposition sequence constitutes an\nessential variable. For a deposition sequence that relies on tempering, a change in the bead spacing beyond the\nlimits in the welding procedure specification constitutes an essential variable.\n\n\n\n\n22  Heat Input (kJ/in.) = (Amps  \u00d7  Volts  \u00d7  60)/[Travel Speed (in./min)  \u00d7  1000], or Heat Input (kJ/mm) = (Amps  \u00d7  Volts  \u00d7  60)/[Travel\nspeed (mm/min)  \u00d7  1000)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n105\n\n\n### B.2.4 Welding of Test Joints\n### B.2.4.1 General\n\n\nPipeline operating conditions that affect the ability of the flowing contents to remove heat from the pipe wall should be\nsimulated while test joints are being made.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   Filling the test section with water and allowing water to flow through the test section while the test joint is being made has\nbeen shown to produce thermal conditions equivalent to or more severe than typical in-service welding applications (see\nFigure B.2). Procedures qualified under these conditions are therefore suitable for any typical in-service application. Other media\n(e.g. motor oil) may be used to simulate less severe thermal conditions.\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n\n\n\n\nFluid out\n\n\n\n\nEnd plate\n\n\n\n\nSupport\npost\n45\u00ba \u00b15\u00ba\n\n\n\n\nFluid in\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   For a single in-service welder qualification, this test qualifies the welder for all positions.\nTests may be performed in other positions which will qualify the welder for that position only.\n\n\n### Figure B.2\u2014Suggested Procedure and Welder Qualification Test Assembly\n### B.2.4.2 Branch and Sleeve Welds\n\n\nThe requirements in 5.7 for branch and sleeve welds are appropriate for in-service welding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n106\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n### B.2.4.3 Weld Deposition Repairs\n\n\nWeld deposition repairs should be deposited on a section of pipe containing simulated wall loss. The area of\nsimulated wall loss should be of sufficient size to remove all the required tests specimens and may consist of a single\nlarger area or multiple smaller areas (see B.2.5.1). Other specimen layouts may be used at the discretion of the\ncompany. The remaining wall thickness of the simulated wall loss should be no greater than the minimum value\nspecified in the welding procedure specification. Weld deposition repairs should be deposited in such a way that the\noriginal wall thickness is completely restored.\n\n\n### B.2.5 Testing of Welded Joints\n### B.2.5.1 Preparation\n\n\nThe requirements in 5.8 are appropriate for in-service welding, except that test specimens should be cut from the joint\nat the locations shown in Figure B.3 or Figure B.4 and the minimum number of specimens and the tests to which they\nare to be subjected are shown in Table B.1.\n\n\n### B.2.5.2 Longitudinal Seam Welds\n\n\nThe longitudinal seam welds of full encirclement sleeves should be tested in accordance with 5.6. The backing\nmaterial, if used, should be removed and the specimens may be flattened at room temperature before testing.\n\n\n### B.2.5.3 Branch and Sleeve Welds and Weld Deposition Repairs\n\n\nBranch and sleeve welds and weld deposition repairs should be tested in accordance with 5.8, except for testing of\nthe additional specimens indicated in B.2.5.1.\n\n\n### B.2.5.4 Macrosection Tests\u2014Branch and Sleeve Welds\n### B.2.5.4.1 Preparation\n\n\nThe macrosection test specimens (see Figure B.5) should be at least  1 / 2  in. (13 mm) wide. They may be machine cut,\nor they may be oxygen cut oversized and machined by a nonthermal process to remove at least  1 / 4  in. (6 mm) from\nthe side(s) that will be prepared. For each macrosection test specimen, at least one face should be ground to at least\na 600 grit finish and etched with a suitable etchant, such as Nital, ammonium persulfate, or dilute hydrochloric acid, to\ngive a clear definition of the weld structure.\n\n\n### B.2.5.4.2 Visual Examination\n\n\nThe cross section of the weld is to be visually examined with lighting that will sufficiently reveal the details of the weld\nsoundness. The use of optical devices or dye penetrants is not necessary.\n\n\n### B.2.5.4.3 Hardness Testing\n\n\nTwo of the four macro test specimens for branch and sleeve welds and both macro test specimens for weld\ndeposition repairs should be prepared for hardness testing in accordance with ASTM E384. A minimum of five\nindentations should be made using a Vickers indenter and a 10-kg load to determine the maximum hardness value in\nthe coarse-grained HAZ at the weld toe of each specimen.\n\n\n### B.2.5.4.4 Requirements\n\n\nA visual examination of the cross section of the weld should show that it is completely fused at the root and free of\ncracks. The fillet weld should have leg lengths that are at least equal to the lengths specified in the procedure\nqualification and should not deviate in concavity or convexity by more that  1 / 16  in. (1.6 mm). The depth of the\nundercutting should not exceed  1 / 32  in. (0.8 mm) or 12  1 / 2  % of the pipe wall thickness, whichever is smaller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n107\n\n\n\n\nNB\nFB\n\n\n\n\nNB\nFB\n\n\n\n\nNB\nFB\n\n\n\n\nMT\n\n\n\n\nNB\nFB\n\n\n\n\nNB\nFB\n\n\n\n\nT\n\n\n\n\nRB or SB\n\n\n\n\nMT\n\n\n\n\nNB\n\n\n\n\nFB or SB\n\n\n\n\nNB\nFB\n\n\n<<HEADING level=3>>Sleeve Weld\nBranch Weld<<HEADING_END>>\n\n\nNOTE    T = tensile; RB = root bend; FB = face bend; NB = nick break; SB = side bend; MT = macro test.\n\n\n### Figure B.3\u2014Suggested Location of Test Specimens for Sleeve and Branch Welds\n\n\nProcedures that produce HAZ hardness values in excess of 350 HV should be evaluated with regard to the risk of\nhydrogen cracking.\n\n\n### B.2.5.5 Face Bend Test\u2014Branch and Sleeve Welds and Weld Deposition Repairs\n### B.2.5.5.1 Preparation\n\n\nThe face bend specimens (see Figure B.6) should be approximately 9 in.

The branch weld test specimen\nis shown in the axial direction; specimens in the other direction are curved. Test specimens are not flattened prior to testing.\n3. Where wall thickness is greater than 0.500 in. (12.7 mm), it may be reduced to 0.500 in. (12.7 mm) by machining the inside surface.\n4. In lieu of taking separate specimens for the face bend test, the remaining portion of the nick-break specimens may be used.\n\n\n### Figure B.6\u2014Face Bend Test Specimen\n### B.3 In-service Welder Qualification\n### B.3.1 General\n\n\nFor in-service welding, the welder should be qualified to apply the specific procedure being used according to the\nrequirements of 6.2, except for the alternative/additional requirements specified in this annex.\n\n\n\n\nA welder qualified on pipe having an OD of less than 12.750 in. (323.9 mm) should be qualified for all diameters less\nthan or equal to the diameter used in the qualification test. A welder qualified on pipe having an OD of greater than or\nequal to 12.750 in. (323.9 mm) should be qualified for all pipe diameters. A welder who has an existing multiple\nqualification to 6.3 and an in-service qualification to B.3 should be qualified as an in-service branch or sleeve welder\nfor all positions, all diameters, and all wall thicknesses within the limits of the essential variables in 6.3.\n\n\n\n\nFor weld deposition repairs, welders who perform test welds on the bottom of the pipe are qualified for welding in all\npositions. Welders who perform test welds on the side of the pipe are qualified for welding only on the side and top of\nthe pipe. Welders who perform test welds on the top of the pipe are qualified for welding only on the top of the pipe.\n\n\n### B.3.2 Welding of Test Joint\n\n\nFor in-service welding, pipeline operating conditions that affect the ability of the flowing contents to remove heat from\nthe pipe wall should be simulated while test joints are being made.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   Filling the test section with water and allowing water to flow through the test section while the test joint is being made has\nbeen shown to produce thermal conditions equivalent to or more severe than typical in-service welding applications (see\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n111\n\n\n\n\nFigure B.2). Welders qualified under these conditions are therefore qualified for any typical in-service application. Other media\n(e.g. motor oil) may be used to simulate less severe thermal conditions.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to making the test joint used for the destructive testing described in B.3.3, the welder should demonstrate\nto the satisfaction of the company the ability to comply with aspects of the welding procedure specification that are\nintended to avoid the development of crack-susceptible microstructures and/or prevention of burn-through. For\nexample, for heat input control procedures, the company may choose to require the welder to demonstrate the ability\nto maintain a heat input level within the range specified in the welding procedure specification. For temper bead and\nweld deposition repair procedures, the company may choose to require the welder to demonstrate bead placement\nwithin the dimensional tolerances specified in the welding procedure specification and the ability to maintain a heat\ninput level within the range specified in the welding procedure specification.\n\n\n### B.3.3 Testing of Welded Joints\n\n\nThe weld should be tested and considered to be acceptable if it meets the requirements of 6.4 and 6.5. For\nlongitudinal seam welds, the minimum number of specimens and the tests to which they should be subjected is\nshown in Table B.2. For weld deposition welders, the minimum number of specimens and tests to which they should\nbe subjected is shown in Table B.1.\n\n\n### Table B.2\u2014Type and Number of Test Specimens for Longitudinal Seam Welds\u2014Welder Qualification Test\n### Number of Specimens\n<<HEADING level=3>>Wall Thickness\nTensile<<HEADING_END>>\n<<HEADING level=3>>Nick Break\nRoot Bend\nFace Bend\nSide Bend\nTotal<<HEADING_END>>\n\n\n\u2264 0.500 in.

The areas to be welded\nshould be inspected to ensure that imperfections are not present and that the wall thickness is adequate. All welders\nperforming repair work should be familiar with the safety precautions associated with cutting and welding on piping\nthat contains or has contained crude petroleum, petroleum products, or fuel gases. Additional guidance can be found\nin API 2201.\n\n\n### B.4.2 Alignment\n### B.4.2.1 Fit-up\n\n\nFor sleeve and saddle welds, the gap between the sleeve or saddle and the carrier pipe should not be excessive.\nClamping devices should be used to obtain proper fit-up. When necessary, weld metal build-up on the carrier pipe can\nbe used to minimize the gap.\n\n\n<<TABLE_1>>\n| Wall Thickness       | Tensile   | Number of Specimens   |           |           |           |       |\n|:---------------------|:----------|:----------------------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:------|\n|                      |           | Nick Break            | Root Bend | Face Bend | Side Bend | Total |\n| \u22640.500 in.

These joints should be fitted with a mild steel back-up strip or\nsuitable tape to prevent penetration of the weld into the carrier pipe.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE   Penetration of the longitudinal butt weld into the carrier pipe is undesirable since any crack that might develop is exposed\nto the hoop stress in the carrier pipe.\n\n\n### B.4.3 Welding Sequence\n\n\nSuggested sleeve and branch welding sequences are shown in Figure B.7 through Figure B.12. For full-encirclement\nfittings requiring circumferential fillet welds, the longitudinal seams should be completed before beginning the\ncircumferential welds. The circumferential weld at one end of the fitting should be completed before beginning the\ncircumferential weld at the other end. For other types of fittings, a welding sequence that minimizes residual stress\nshould be used.\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for weld deposition repair have been developed which include preparation prior to welding and weld\ndeposition sequence.  23  For example, a perimeter pass should be used to establish a boundary beyond which no\nsubsequent welding is allowed. The first layer of fill passes should be deposited using established heat input limits to\nminimize the risk of burn-through. A second perimeter pass should be used to temper the HAZ at the toe of the first\nperimeter pass. Higher heat input fill passes should be used for subsequent layers to further temper the initial passes,\nagain observing established heat input limits if necessary. Additional layers should be deposited, as necessary, for\nproper filling.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nNOTE    This is the suggested welding sequence; others may be followed at the discretion of the company.\n\n\n### Figure B.7\u2014Reinforcing Pad\n\n\n23  W.

Ultrasonic testing, radiographic testing, or a combination of both are effective for volumetric inspection for weld\ndeposition repairs.\n\n\n\n\nWhen determining appropriate delay times prior to inspection for hydrogen cracking, the time-dependant nature of\ncracking should be considered, as well as the probability of the weld to cracking. Longer delay times decrease the\nchance that cracking can occur after inspection has been completed. The probability of cracking, and thus the\nimportance of determining an appropriate delay time, can be minimized by using more conservative welding\nprocedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n116\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n### B.6 Standards of Acceptability: NDT (Including Visual)\n\n\nThe standards of acceptability in Section 9 for imperfections located by NDT should be applied to in-service welds.\nFor weld deposition repair, the weld length is defined as the maximum weld length in the direction in which the defect\nis oriented.\n\n\n### B.7 Repair and Removal of Defects\n\n\nThe requirements in Section 10 for the repair and removal of defects should be applied to in-service welds. Care\nshould be taken during the removal of the defect to ensure that the wall thickness is not reduced to less than that\nwhich is acceptable for the operating pressure of the carrier pipe.\n\n\n\n\n<<HEADING level=2>>Annex C\n(normative)<<HEADING_END>>\n## Requests for Interpretation and Request for Revision to the Document\n### C.1 Introduction\n\n\nThe API-AGA Joint Committee on Oil and Gas Pipeline Field Welding Practices will consider written requests for\ninterpretations and revisions in a formal manner. The Committee\u2019s activities in this regard are limited strictly to\ninterpretations of this standard, or to the consideration of revisions to this standard on the basis of new data or\ntechnology. Such requests are handled as expeditiously as possible, but due to the complexity of the work and the\nprocedures that shall be followed, some responses may require considerable time. As a matter of policy, API does not\napprove, certify, rate, or endorse any item, construction, proprietary device, or activity related to the use of this\nstandard. Accordingly, any requests for interpretation requiring such consideration shall not be addressed. API does\nnot act as a consultant on specific welding problems or on the general application or understanding of this standard.\nIf, based on the information submitted in the request for interpretation, it is the opinion of the Committee that the\ninquirer should seek professional assistance, the request for interpretation is not addressed with the recommendation\nthat such assistance be obtained. Requests for interpretation that do not provide the information needed for the\nCommittee\u2019s full understanding shall not be addressed, and the inquirer is so notified.\n\n\n### C.2 Requirements\n### C.2.1 General\n\n\nRequests for interpretation shall be limited strictly to interpretations of this standard (and not include interpretations of\nany normative references), or to the consideration of revisions to this standard on the basis of new data or technology.\nRequests shall be submitted in writing. Requests shall contain the name, address, and affiliation of the inquirer and\nshall provide enough information for the committee to fully understand the point of concern in the inquiry.\n\n\n\n\nRequests for interpretation or proposed revisions to the documentshould be directed to:\n\n\n\n\nStandards Department\n\n\n\n\nAPI\n\n\n\n\n1220 L Street, NW\n\n\n\n\nWashington, DC 20005\n\n\n\n\nstandards@api.org\n\n\n### C.2.2 Scope\n\n\nEach request or interpretation shall be limited to only one single provision of the standard, however the point of the\ninquiry may include two or more interrelated provisions as references or supporting information. The particular\nprovision(s) shall be identified, including reference to the applicable edition, addenda, and errata.\n\n\n### C.2.3 Purpose of Inquiry\n\n\nThe purpose of the inquiry shall be stated. The purpose may be either to obtain an interpretation or to propose\nconsideration of a revision to a particular provision in the standard.\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n\n\n\n\n\n118\nAPI S TANDARD  1104\n\n\n### C.2.4 Content\n\n\nThe inquiry should be concise, yet complete, to enable the Committee to quickly and fully understand the point of the\ninquiry. Omit superfluous background information. The inquiry should be technically and editorially correct. If the point\nof the inquiry is to obtain an interpretation, the inquiry shall be stated in such a manner that the response to the inquiry\nis either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d.  The Committee shall not address inquiries that pose questions of \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhy\u201d. If the point of\nthe inquiry is to obtain a revision of the standard, the inquiry shall provide technical justification for that revision.\n\n\n### C.2.5 Proposed Reply\n\n\nA request for interpretation may include a proposed reply, stating a believed interpretation of the requirements of the\nprovision in question, or recommended wording for a revision.\n\n\n### C.2.6 Additional/New Proposed Processes\n\n\nProcesses other than those described in this document can be considered for inclusion in this standard. Persons who\nwish to have other processes included shall submit, as a minimum, the following information for the committee\u2019s\nconsideration:\n\n\n\n\na) a description of the welding process,\n\n\n\n\nb) a proposal on the essential variables,\n\n\n\n\nc) a welding procedure specification,\n\n\n\n\nd) weld inspection methods,\n\n\n\n\ne) types of weld imperfections and their proposed acceptance limits,\n\n\n\n\nf)\nrepair procedures.\n\n\n### C.2.7 Response Time by the Committee\n\n\nThe Committee shall review and provide a response to a request for interpretation as quickly as possible.  The\nCommittee shall review the requests in the order they were received by the API.   However, since some responses\nmay require input from several sources, a response may take up to one year to formulate and issue to the inquirer.\nThe Committee shall not accelerate this process in order to meet a deadline or schedule requirement of the inquirer.\nThe inquirer should take into consideration this time frame.\n\n\n\n\nFor proposals of revision that are submitted, the Committee shall determine the need for immediate change to/\ninclusion in the document (an Addendum) or if the revision may be delayed until the next overall edition of the\ndocument is published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW ELDING   OF  P IPELINES   AND  R ELATED  F ACILITIES\n119\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Product No. D110421\n\n\nDocument Type: Digital\nTotal Pages: 129\nTotal Images: 12\n\nImage Reference Table:\n[IMAGE_1] Page: 59, Size: 1240x826\n[IMAGE_2] Page: 59, Size: 1240x826\n[IMAGE_3] Page: 60, Size: 1240x722\n[IMAGE_4] Page: 60, Size: 1240x722\n[IMAGE_5] Page: 61, Size: 374x730\n[IMAGE_6] Page: 61, Size: 374x730\n[IMAGE_7] Page: 96, Size: 575x153\n[IMAGE_8] Page: 96, Size: 575x153\n[IMAGE_9] Page: 109, Size: 362x84\n[IMAGE_10] Page: 109, Size: 362x84\n[IMAGE_11] Page: 109, Size: 362x84\n[IMAGE_12] Page: 109, Size: 362x84\n\nTotal Tables: 62\n\nTable Reference List:\n[TABLE_1] Page: 18, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_2] Page: 18, Size: 1x3\n[TABLE_1] Page: 19, Size: 10x8\n[TABLE_1] Page: 23, Size: 18x4\n[TABLE_1] Page: 24, Size: 8x4\n[TABLE_1] Page: 26, Size: 2x3\n[TABLE_2] Page: 26, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_3] Page: 26, Size: 2x3\n[TABLE_4] Page: 26, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 27, Size: 12x8\n[TABLE_3] Page: 28, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 29, Size: 1x3\n[TABLE_3] Page: 30, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_4] Page: 30, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_1] Page: 36, Size: 2x3\n[TABLE_2] Page: 36, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_3] Page: 36, Size: 2x3\n[TABLE_4] Page: 36, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 38, Size: 12x8\n[TABLE_1] Page: 48, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_2] Page: 48, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_3] Page: 48, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_4] Page: 48, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_1] Page: 49, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_2] Page: 49, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_3] Page: 49, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_4] Page: 49, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_1] Page: 54, Size: 4x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 57, Size: 7x9\n[TABLE_1] Page: 62, Size: 7x5\n[TABLE_2] Page: 62, Size: 7x7\n[TABLE_1] Page: 66, Size: 8x5\n[TABLE_1] Page: 67, Size: 8x5\n[TABLE_1] Page: 83, Size: 6x7\n[TABLE_2] Page: 84, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_3] Page: 84, Size: 1x1\n[TABLE_1] Page: 92, Size: 14x3\n[TABLE_1] Page: 94, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 95, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 96, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_2] Page: 96, Size: 2x1\n[TABLE_1] Page: 99, Size: 4x6\n[TABLE_1] Page: 100, Size: 4x5\n[TABLE_2] Page: 100, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 101, Size: 6x4\n[TABLE_1] Page: 102, Size: 4x11\n[TABLE_2] Page: 102, Size: 5x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 103, Size: 1x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 107, Size: 3x3\n[TABLE_1] Page: 108, Size: 4x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 115, Size: 1x3\n[TABLE_2] Page: 115, Size: 2x1\n[TABLE_3] Page: 115, Size: 2x1\n[TABLE_4] Page: 115, Size: 1x3\n[TABLE_5] Page: 115, Size: 1x4\n[TABLE_8] Page: 115, Size: 1x3\n[TABLE_1] Page: 116, Size: 2x7\n[TABLE_2] Page: 116, Size: 1x4\n[TABLE_3] Page: 116, Size: 2x2\n[TABLE_4] Page: 116, Size: 2x2\n[TABLE_1] Page: 117, Size: 11x9\n[TABLE_1] Page: 119, Size: 4x7", "metadata": {"filename": "1.txt", "Document Type": "Digital", "Total Pages": "129", "Total Images": "12", "Image Reference Table": "", "[IMAGE_1] Page": "59, Size: 1240x826", "[IMAGE_2] Page": "59, Size: 1240x826", "[IMAGE_3] Page": "60, Size: 1240x722", "[IMAGE_4] Page": "60, Size: 1240x722", "[IMAGE_5] Page": "61, Size: 374x730", "[IMAGE_6] Page": "61, Size: 374x730", "[IMAGE_7] Page": "96, Size: 575x153", "[IMAGE_8] Page": "96, Size: 575x153", "[IMAGE_9] Page": "109, Size: 362x84", "[IMAGE_10] Page": "109, Size: 362x84", "[IMAGE_11] Page": "109, Size: 362x84", "[IMAGE_12] Page": "109, Size: 362x84", "Total Tables": "62", "Table Reference List": "", "[TABLE_1] Page": "119, Size: 4x7", "[TABLE_2] Page": "116, Size: 1x4", "[TABLE_3] Page": "116, Size: 2x2", "[TABLE_4] Page": "116, Size: 2x2", "[TABLE_5] Page": "115, Size: 1x4", "[TABLE_8] Page": "115, Size: 1x3", "title": "Welding of Pipelines and Related Facilities"}}
