{"timestamp": "2025-03-20T21:19:32.998268", "query": "Why is the determination of carbofuran residues important?", "response": "The determination of carbofuran residues is important because carbofuran formulations are extensively used in agriculture for the control of insect pests. Frequent and increased use of carbofuran formulations can result in harmful effects due to the toxic nature of residues. Careful assessment of these residues is necessary to safeguard human health and establish regulatory policy. This standard enables health authorities and others engaged in the field to follow a uniform test procedure for the estimation of carbofuran residues in crops, soil, and water. By following this standard, accurate and consistent results can be obtained to ensure that carbofuran residues do not exceed safe levels.", "sources": ["11020.txt", "11020.txt", "11020.txt"]}
{"timestamp": "2025-03-20T21:20:34.654037", "query": "What methods are prescribed in this standard for determining carbofuran residues?", "response": "The standard prescribes a method for determining carbofuran residues in crops, soil, and water using gas chromatography (GC). The procedure involves injecting a sample along with a standard of known concentration, and measuring the peak area of the carbofuran compound in the sample and the standard. The concentration of carbofuran residue is then calculated using the formula provided in the context, which takes into account the mass of the sample, the volume of the sample injected, the mass of the standard injected, the recovery factor, and the peak area of the sample and the standard. The standard also specifies that the percent mean recovery should be determined by adding a known amount of carbofuran to a treated control sample and analyzing it using the same method. The standard was last amended in November 1995 and the reagent water used should be of reagent grade.", "sources": ["11020.txt", "11020.txt", "11020.txt"]}

Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n1. The first section (6.5 Calculations) outlines the formula for calculating the Carbofuran residue (in parts per million or ppm) based on the peak area of the sample and standard, mass of standard injected, final volume of sample, and recovery factor.\n2. The next section (Page 4, clause 2.1) mentions an amendment to the IS:11020 - 1984 methods document for determination of Carbofuran residues in crops, soil, and water. Specifically, it indicates that certain substitutions should be made, such as replacing \"IS : 1070 - 1977\" with \"IS : 1070 - 1992\" and \"Reagent grade water (third revision)\" with an unspecified term.\n3. The column specifications for the gas chromatography analysis include a 60 cm long, 4 mm internal diameter glass column packed with various stationary phases and temperatures for the column, injection port, and detector.\n4. The gas flow rates for nitrogen, hydrogen, and air are specified, along with the recorder chart speed.\n5. The reagents section (6.3) describes the preparation of two specific reagents: a pH 11.0 buffer and a reagent for derivatization using 1-Fluoro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB) in acetone.\n\nOverall, this document appears to provide instructions for preparing and using specific reagents and performing a gas chromatography analysis to determine the residue level of Carbofuran in a sample.
