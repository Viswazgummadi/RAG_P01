{"instruction": "What requirements does the standard mention for cocoa bean storage structures?", "response": "According to the document, This Indian Standard (First Revision) was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards, after the\ndraft finalized by the Water Sectional Committee had been approved by the Chemical Division\nCouncil.\nThis standard was originally published in 1983. The current revision has been undertaken to take\ninto account the uptodate information available about the nature and effect of various\ncontaminants as also the new techniques for identifying and determining their concentration. In\nthis revision based on experience gained additional requirements for alkalinity, aluminium and\nboron have been incorporated and the permissible limits for dissolved solids, nitrate and pesticides\nresidues have been modified.\nA report prepared by the World Health Organization in cooperation with the World Bank showed\nthat in 1975, some 1 230 million people were without safe water supplies. These appalling facts\nwere central to the United Nations decision to declare an International Drinking Water Supply\nand Sanitation decade, beginning in 1981. Further, the VI Five-Year Plan of India had made a\nspecial provision for availability of safe drinking water for the masses. Therefore, this standard\nwas prepared with the following objectives:\na) To assess the quality of water resources, and\nb) To check the effectiveness of water treatment and supply by the concerned authorities.\nDuring VII Five-Year Plan, 55 mini mission districts were identified with a view to meet supply of\nwater to all the problem villages. The VIII Five-Year Plan intends to provide safe drinking water\nto the rural mass. It also propose to ensure supply of desired quality land required quantity of\ndrinking water.\nWhile preparing this standard, the Committee had taken note of the limited testing facilities\navailable in the country. This standard, therefore, categories various characteristics as essential or\ndesirable. The standard also mentions the desirable limit and indicates its background so that the\nimplementing authorities may exercise their discretion, keeping in view the health of the people,\nadequacy of treatment, etc. All essential characteristics should be examined in routine. Besides,\nall desirable characteristics should be examined either when a doubt arises or the potability of\nwater from a new source is to be established.\nIt has been recognised that often it is necessary to relax the specifications, especially when no\nalternate resources are available and therefore, to enable the experts to exercise their discretion a\nmaximum permissible limit has also been given.\nIn the case of virological examination, if not even one plaque-forming unit (PFU) of virus can be\nfound in 1 litre of water, it can reasonably be assumed that the water is safe to drink. It would,\nhowever, be necessary to examine a sample of the order of 10 litres to obtain a proper estimation of\nthe PFUs at this level. Such examinations cannot be made in ordinary control laboratories but\nthere should be at least one laboratory in the country or region capable of carrying out virus\nexaminations and also of pursuing further research on this subject.\nThe methods of test for various characteristics mentioned in this standard are currently under\nrevision and their latest revision shall be used in testing.\nIn the formulation of this standard, assistance has been derived from the following publications:\na) International Standards for Drinking Water issued by World Health Organization, 1984\nGeneva;\nb) Manual of Standards of Quality for Drinking Water Supplies. Indian Council of Medical\nResearch, 1971, New Delhi; and\nc) Manual on Water Supply and Treatment (  third revision  ), Ministry of Urban Development,\n1989, New Delhi.\nThis edition 2.1 incorporates Amendment No. 1 (January 1993). Side bar indicates modification of\nthe text as the result of incorporation of the amendment.\nFor the purpose of deciding whether a particular requirement of this standard is complied with,\nthe final value, observed or calculated, expressing the result of a test or analysis, shall be rounded\noff in accordance with IS 2 : 1960 \u2018Rules for rounding off numerical values (  revised  )\u2019. The number\nof significant places retained in the rounded off value should be the same as that of the specified\nvalue in this standard."}

{"instruction": "What are the factors that can damage cocoa beans during storage?", "response": "According to the document, ### X1.3 The Tape Test\nX1.3.1  By far the most prevalent test for evaluating coating \u201cadhesion\u201d is the tape-and-\npeel test, which has been used since the 1930\u2019s. In its simplest version a piece of\nadhesive tape is pressed against the paint film and the resistance to and degree of film\nremoval observed when the tape is pulled off. Since an intact film with appreciable\nadhesion is frequently not removed at all, the severity of the test is usually enhanced by\ncutting into the film a figure  X  or a cross hatched pattern, before applying and removing\nthe tape. Adhesion is then rated by comparing film removed against an established\nrating scale. If an intact film is peeled cleanly by the tape, or if it debonds just by cutting\ninto it without applying tape, then the adhesion is rated simply as poor or very poor, a\nmore precise evaluation of such films not being within the capability of this test.\nX1.3.2  The current widely-used version was first published in 1974; two test methods\nare covered in this standard. Both test methods are used to establish whether the\nadhesion of a coating to a substrate is at an adequate level; however they do not\ndistinguish between higher levels of adhesion for which more sophisticated methods of\nmeasurement are required. Major limitations of the tape test are its low sensitivity,\napplicabiity only to coatings of relatively low bond strengths, and non-determination of\nadhesion to the substrate where failure occurs within a single coat, as when testing\nprimers alone, or within or between coats in multicoat systems. For multicoat systems\nwhere adhesion failure may occur between or within coats, the adhesion of the coating\nsystem to the substrate is not determined.\nX1.3.3  Repeatability within one rating unit is generally observed for coatings on metals\nfor both methods, with reproducibility of one to two units. The tape test enjoys\nwidespread popularity and is viewed as \u201csimple\u201d as well as low in cost. Applied to\nmetals, it is economical to perform, lends itself to job site application, and most\nimportantly, after decades of use, people feel comfortable with it.\nX1.3.4  When a flexible adhesive tape is applied to a coated rigid substrate surface and\nthen removed, the removal process has been described in terms of the \u201cpeel\nphenomenon,\u201d as illustrated in Fig. X1.1.\nX1.3.5  Peeling begins at the \u201ctoothed\u201d leading edge (at the right) and proceeds along\nthe coating adhesive/interface or the coating/substrate interface, depending on the\nrelative bond strengths. It is assumed that coating removal occurs when the tensile\nforce generated along the latter interface, which is a function of the rheological\nproperties of the backing and adhesive layer materials, is greater than the bond strength\nat the coating-substrate interface (or cohesive strength of the coating). In actuality,\nhowever, this force is distributed over a discrete distance (O-A) in Fig. X1.1, which\nrelates directly to the properties described, not concentrated at a point (O) in Fig. X1.1\nas in the theoretical case\u2014though the tensile force is greatest at the origin for both. A\nsignificant compressive force arises from the response of the tape backing material to\nbeing stretched. Thus both tensile and compressive forces are involved in adhesion tape\ntesting.\nX1.3.6  Close scrutiny of the tape test with respect to the nature of the tape employed\nand certain aspects of the procedure itself reveal several factors, each or any\ncombination of which can dramatically affect the results of the test as discussed  (6) ."}

Procedure\n7.1  Select an area free of blemishes and minor surface imperfections. For tests in the field,\nensure that the surface is clean and dry. Extremes in temperature or relative humidity may\naffect the adhesion of the tape or the coating.\n7.2  Make two cuts in the film each about 1.5 in. (40 mm) long that intersect near their middle\nwith a smaller angle of between 30 and 45\u00b0. When making the incisions, use the straightedge\nand cut through the coating to the substrate in one steady motion.\n7.3  Inspect the incisions for reflection of light from the metal substrate to establish that the\ncoating film has been penetrated. If the substrate has not been reached make another X in a\ndifferent location. Do not attempt to deepen a previous cut as this may affect adhesion along\nthe incision.\n7.4  Remove two complete laps of the pressure-sensitive tape from the roll and discard. Remove\nan additional length at a steady (that is, not jerked) rate and cut a piece about 3 in. (75 mm)\nlong.\n7.5  Place the center of the tape at the intersection of the cuts with the tape running in the same\ndirection as the smaller angles. Smooth the tape into place by finger in the area of the incisions\nand then rub firmly with the eraser on the end of a pencil. The color under the transparent tape\nis a useful indication of when good contact has been made.\n7.6  Within 90 6 30 s of application, remove the tape by seizing the free end and pulling it off\nrapidly (not jerked) back upon itself at as close to an angle of 180\u00b0 as possible.\n7.7  Inspect the X-cut area for removal of coating from the substrate or previous coating and rate\nthe adhesion in accordance with the following scale:"}

{"instruction": "Why is it important to store cocoa beans properly?", "response": "According to the document, 15. Galvanized Steel in Concrete\n15.1 Galvanized steel can be placed in direct contact with\nconcrete as the galvanized coating forms an excellent bond\nwith the concrete materials. When embedding steel parts in\nconcrete, the highest quality system is produced when all of the\nsteel parts are coated with the same corrosion protection\nsystem. If there are galvanized parts in concrete near steel parts\nwith no corrosion protection, there can be active corrosion cells\nwhenever moisture is present. This will lessen the corrosion\nprotection offered by the galvanized coating. The highest\nquality system contains all galvanized steel parts.\n15.2 Galvanized steel parts when placed in concrete are\nnormally passivated either by natural weathering prior to\nplacement, by applying a passivation coating after the hot-dip\ngalvanizing process, or, effectively, by the presence of more\nthan 100 PPM of chromate in the concrete mix. When no\npassivation layer is on the surface of the galvanized coating\nand no chromates are in the concrete, there is a slight chance of\na reaction between the zinc metal and the concrete water\nsolution. The reaction between zinc metal and concrete water\nsolution can release small quantities of hydrogen gas bubbles.\nWhen the concrete cover is designed to be thin and the surface\narea of the galvanized part in the concrete is large, these\nescaping gas bubbles could cause rough concrete surfaces."}

{"instruction": "What requirements does the standard mention for cocoa bean storage structures?", "response": "According to the document, 3. Steel Selection\n3.1 The production of a galvanized coating has as its basis\nthe metallurgical reaction between the steel and the molten\nzinc, resulting in the formation of several iron-zinc compound\nlayers, for example, gamma (not always visible microscopi-\ncally), delta, and zeta in  Fig. 1 . In addition, a layer of the\nmolten zinc adheres to the surface of the compound layers as\nthe steel is withdrawn from the galvanizing bath. Upon\nsolidi\ufb01cation, this adherent zinc forms the eta layer.\n3.2 It is known that the exact structural nature of the\ngalvanized coating, as typi\ufb01ed by  Fig. 1 , may be modi\ufb01ed in\naccordance with the exact chemical nature of the steel being\ngalvanized. Certain elements found in steels are known to have\nan in\ufb02uence on the coating structure. The elements carbon in\nexcess of about 0.25 %, phosphorus in excess of 0.04 %, or\nmanganese in excess of about 1.3 % will cause the production\nof coatings different from the coating typi\ufb01ed by  Fig. 1 . Steels\nwith silicon in the range 0.04 % to 0.15 % or above 0.22 % can\nproduce galvanized coating growth rates much higher than\nthose for steels with silicon levels below 0.04 % and between\n0.15 % and 0.22 %. Recent studies have shown that even in\ncases where the silicon and phosphorous are individually held\nto desirable limits, a combined effect between them can\nproduce a coating as shown in  Fig. 2 , which typically would\nhave a mottled or dull gray appearance.\n3.3 These elements manifest their structural effect as an\naccelerated growth of the compound layers, particularly the\nzeta layer, and the virtual elimination of the eta layer. Cosmeti-\ncally this accelerated growth is seen as a gray matte \ufb01nished\ncoating as opposed to the usual bright and smooth appearance\nof galvanized coatings. Sometimes, a large surface may have\nadjacent areas of matte \ufb01nish and bright \ufb01nish leading to a\nmottled appearance.\n3.4 There is some evidence that the coatings resulting from\nthis accelerated growth are more brittle and less adherent than\nnormal coatings. There is also evidence that these coatings are\nsubject to a premature red staining in atmospheric exposure;\nhowever, this staining has been found not to be associated with\ncorrosion of the substrate steel."}

{"instruction": "What are the factors that can damage cocoa beans during storage?", "response": "According to the document, Visual inspection can sometimes be facilitated by holding a small mirror between the tube sheet and the fitting to\nobtain a view of the juncture between the tube and the fitting. Roll leaks may not become detectable until a coil has\nbeen under pressure for 10 min to 15 min. Leakage in the tube rolls can be either a nuisance or a serious problem,\ndepending on the process and the operating conditions of the heater. Where there is no formation of coke, the leak\nmay be stopped by rerolling the tube. Roll leakage is serious; however, in the case of a heater that is subject to coking\nand that operates at high pressure-temperature conditions or in poisonous or highly explosive vapor service,\nincluding phenol or hydrogen service. Oil leaking between the fitting and the outside surface of the tube can result in\nthe formation of coke. This coke formation continues with service and the force of the coke buildup can be sufficient to\ncause partial collapse of the tube end and to allow the tube to slip in the fitting. Under these conditions, leakage\ncannot be corrected by rerolling because the serration in the fitting\u2019s tube seat is full of coke and the mechanical\nstrength of the rolled joint is not improved by the rerolling operation. Figure 26 shows an example of a fitting and a\ntube that have leaked in the roll."}

{"instruction": "Why is it important to store cocoa beans properly?", "response": "According to the document, Annex E A welding system may consist of a single power source or a complex assembly of list 22 od 25\n(informative) components. This European Standard recommends the means to ensure that the key\nValidation of ancillary components In a welding system components of the most widely used welding systems conform to the required accuracy of\ncontrol of output. Other components in the welding system will affect the quality of the welded\nproduct and need care and maintenance to ensure correct operation.\nWelding manipulators, welding rotators, orbital welding rotation drives and robotic\nmanipulation devices control the welding speed and therefore influence the heat input to the\nweld and metallurgical and mechanical properties of the weld. The speed on these\nmachines should be checked at intervals compatible with other maintenance and validation\ntasks on the welding equipment to ensure that it conforms to the manufacturer's specification.\nThree factors need to be checked:\na) the absolute accuracy of the speed control calibration;\nb) the of the speed control calibration;\nc) the consistency of the speed control during operation.\nA number of devices are available to assist the user of welding equipment to check the speed\ncontrol. The simplest of these is the stopwatch and measuring rule; these instruments will\nenable most rotary and linear devices to be checked. Electrical transducers are from\nthe manufacturers of the portable welding monitors. A rubber-tyred wheel runs on the moving\ncomponent and this wheel drives a tachogenerator which gives an output proportional to the\nspeed. More complex electromechanical transducers are available to fit on to welding\nequipment to measure welding speed and displacement. Equipment manufacturers should be\nconsulted about these devices.\nArc voltage control devices are feedback control systems. A control to set the desired arc\nvoltage is normally part of the system. This may be a scaled control or an unscaled control\nwith a digital or analogue meter showing the set arc voltage.\nThe simplest way to check the arc voltage control is to do so with an arc running. The\nset-up should be arranged so that the arc runs with the minimum of variation. Compare the\nset voltage with the actual arc voltage over the desired operating range. To measure the arc\nvoltage, use a meter with a calibrated accuracy of 0,5 or better conforming to EN 60051-1.\nCAUTION Do not start TIG arcs with high voltage high frequency initiators with the meter\nconnected across the output terminals (see Annex D).\nValidation of an arc voltage control device without an arc Is more difficult and specialist\nknowledge should be sought.\nThe most widely used gas flow control device is the bobbin flow meter. The easiest way to\ncheck the operation of these meters is by direct comparison with a similar meter of known\naccuracy. Such gauges can be obtained from the manufacturers with a traceable calibration.\nThis will rarely be better than 2 %.\nThe gauge to be checked should be connected In series with the standard gauge using short\nlengths of pipework of the largest practical diameter. The system should be connected to a\nsupply of the appropriate gas and the flow readings compared at the desired gauge readings.\nElectronic flow gauges are available and the validation of these devices should be entrusted\nto specialists. A calibrated electronic flow device can be used to validate production flow\ngauges."}
