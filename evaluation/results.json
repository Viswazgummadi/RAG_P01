      "response": "According to the provided context, the requirements for cocoa bean storage structures include:\n\n1. Effective control of insects and other pests, and exclusion of rain and ground moisture.\n2. Compliance with the standards and codes of practice for handling, transporting, and storing cocoa beans.\n3. Accessibility to lorries and preferably situated near a rail head with goods siding.\n4. Sufficient berthing, loading, and unloading facilities if located near waterways.\n5. The structure may be of any dimensions economically suited to the land available, and the storage capacity should be calculated using a coefficient factor of 0.8m2 per metric tonne of cured cocoa seeds.\n\nThe coefficient factor is derived from 14 bags stacked one over the other, each bag containing 62.5 kg of cocoa beans, 30% floor area for passage in between the stacks, and stacks of 30 bags.",

      "response": "The standard IS 1609:1991, titled \"Damp-Proofing Treatment Using Bitumen Felts- Code of Practice,\" provides guidance on preventing moisture damage in buildings, specifically in foundations, basements, and walls. The standard covers the methods of application of bitumen felts for damp-proofing treatment to prevent the penetration of moisture and water from an external source at or below ground level. The standard aims to ensure that wet areas of a building, such as bathrooms, kitchens, water closets, balconies, and sunshades, are protected from dampness and leakage, which can lead to unhygienic conditions, health issues, and structural deterioration. The standard applies within a specific temperature and pressure range and emphasizes the importance of safety practices and international coordination. However, it does not cover all safety concerns associated with its use and it is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.",

The temperature control is important to maintain the quality and shelf life of the refractory materials. If the manufacturer's shelf life recommendations are more stringent, then the manufacturer's restrictions shall apply.\n\nIn the context you provided, there is also a mention of storing ceramic specimens for testing in water at a temperature of 27\u00b0 \u00b1 2\u00b0C until the time of test.
